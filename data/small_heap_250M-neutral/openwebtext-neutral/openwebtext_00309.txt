The Great Reinhart-Rogoff War of 2013 rages on today with a brand new Reinhart-Rogoff salvo on the New York Times op-ed page and a brand new Reinhart-Rogoff rebuttal by New York Times op-ed columnist Paul Krugman.
I want to try to broker some peace.

It's true that Reinhart and Rogoff's initial paper was technically flawed. And it's also true that Reinhart and Rogoff were happy to be feted as tribunes of austerity even as their paper made more careful claims. But the debate between them and their detractors has covered up the more important fissures that separate both them and their detractors from the Republicans in Congress.
The real debate right now is with a Republican Party that won't permit any more stimulus, won't permit any more deficit reduction if it includes tax revenues, and won't even permit the federal government to make it easier for people to refinance their homes. That's a position that often gets called "austerity," and so cloaks itself in the work of more serious deficit hawks, but it's actually something very different, and much less coherent. And it's not the position of Reinhart and Rogoff, or Krugman, or even Joe Scarborough. In fact, it's not even obviously bridgeable with the positions of Reinhart, Rogoff and Krugman.
"Our consistent advice has been to avoid withdrawing fiscal stimulus too quickly, a position identical to that of most mainstream economists," write Reinhart and Rogoff in their op-ed. They also note that that they've favored "more radical proposals," including "reducing mortgage principal on homes that are underwater," "moderately higher inflation" and "write-downs of sovereign debt and senior bank debt in the European periphery."
This support hasn't just been private. In interviews with me, Reinhart, in particular, has repeatedly defended both fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as argued that a core failure of policymakers today is their refusal to write down housing debt. “The initial policy of monetary and fiscal stimulus really made a huge difference,” they told me. “I would tattoo that on my forehead.”
This is not, to say the least, the Republican Party's position. And the idea that we should accept more inflation, and write down mortgage debt, puts them closer to Krugman than to Republicans or Democrats.
There's no doubt that Reinhart and Rogoff are more interested in austerity than Krugman. But like most economists, they've believed that the government could do much more to promote growth now, and have been open to policies that would extend short-term fiscal support if they're part of a framework with credible long-term deficit reduction.
Meanwhile, for all the insinuations to the contrary, Krugman has also been clear that they believe deficits are a problem over the long term. "I do get the premise that modern governments able to issue fiat money can't go bankrupt, never mind whether investors are willing to buy their bonds," they wrote in 2011. "And it sounds right if you look at it from a certain angle. But it isn't."
The more modest differences between the various participants in the broader austerity debate are covering up a real area of consensus: We could, and should, do more now, and we could, and should, couple that with policies that reduce deficits in the medium and, more to the point, long term.
The debate between most of the academic "austerians" and the "keynesians" is, in many ways, a fake debate: There's no serious economic model in which $400 billion in stimulus spending — plus some principal reduction — over the next two years would destabilize the bond markets if it was coupled with $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 12 years.
Reinhart and Rogoff could have been doing much more to call out the inanity of this position, which has blocked both more short-term support for the economy and more long-term deficit reduction. That, for them, should be a lesson of this debacle: They got in bed with politicians whose policy agenda had little to do with their actual research, and so now they're being blamed for that policy agenda. But on a purely analytical level, their arguments, properly understood, are much nearer to the policy preferences of Paul Krugman than John Boehner. That's also true for Joe Scarborough, oddly enough.
The problem in American politics today isn't that Krugman, Reinhart, Rogoff and even Scarborough couldn't go into a room and come out with a plan they're all happy with. It's that the Republican Party would never agree to it.

Christina Hendricks has been cast in NBC's upcoming drama “Good Girls,” Variety has learned.
The “Mad Men” alum joins the series in the role originally set for Kathleen Rose Perkins, who was recast. The pilot will reshoot this fall with Hendricks on board, and the series will debut midseason.
In “Good Girls,” when three suburban moms — played by Hendricks, Mae Whitman and Retta — get tired of trying to make ends meet, they decide it's time to stick up for themselves by robbing the local supermarket at toy gunpoint. But when the manager catches a glimpse of one of them and the loot is far more than they expected, it doesn't take long for the three best friends to realize the perfect getaway will be harder than they think.
The series has been described as a comedy-infused drama that mixes a little “Thelma & Louise” with a bit of “Breaking Bad.”
Alongside stars Hendricks, Whitman and Retta, the cast is rounded out by Reno Wilson, Manny Montana, Lidya Jewett, Izzy Stannard and Matthew Lillard.
“Good Girls” hails from Shondaland alum Jenna Bans, who created the series and will serve as executive producer with Jeannine Renshaw and Dean Parisot, who will direct the pilot. Universal Television is the studio.
Hendricks starred on “Mad Men” for its entire run. Since, they have appeared on Sundance's “Hap and Leonard” and Comedy Central's “Another Period.” Hendricks just finished the Ridley Scott-produced film “The Burning Woman,” opposite Sienna Miller, and will co-star with Glenn Close and Gillian Anderson in “The Crooked House,” based on an Agatha Christie book. They also just wrapped “The Candy Jar” with Helen Hunt for Netflix and will topline the horror movie, “The Strangers 2.”
Hendricks is repped by ICM, Link Entertainment and attorney Howard Fishman at Hirsch Wallerstein.
The text of Pope Francis' general audience:
Feminists and proponents of women's ordination aren't gonna be happy.
My emphases and comments:
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Today we turn to the Catechism of the Year of Faith. [Well! They mentioned it again.] In the Creed we repeat this phrase: “He rose again on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures”. This is the very event [a historical event] that we are celebrating: the Resurrection of Jesus, the center of the Christian message that has resounded since the beginning and has been handed down so that it may reach us today. Saint Paul writes to the Christians of Corinth: “For I handed on to you …what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures; that they were buried; that they were raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures; that they appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve”(1 Cor 15:3-5). This brief confession of faith announces the Paschal Mystery, with the first appearances of the Risen Christ to Peter and the Twelve: the Death and Resurrection of Jesus is the heart of our hope. Without this faith in the Death and Resurrection of Jesus our hope would be weak, but it wouldn't even be hope, the Death and Resurrection of Jesus is the heart of our hope. The Apostle says: “If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins” (v. 17).
Unfortunately, there have often been attempts to obscure faith in the Resurrection of Jesus, and doubts have crept in even among believers themselves. A watered down faith, as we would say, not a strong faith. This is because of superficiality, sometimes because of indifference, occupied by a thousand things considered more important than the faith, or because of a purely horizontal vision of life. But it is the Resurrection that gives us the greatest hope, because it opens our lives and the life of the world to the eternal future of God, to full happiness, to the certainty that evil, sin, death can be defeated. And this leads us to live everyday realities with more confidence, to face them with courage and commitment. The Resurrection of Christ shines a new light on these daily realities. The Resurrection of Christ is our strength!
But how was the truth of faith in Christ's Resurrection transmitted? There are two kinds of witness in the New Testament: some are in the form of the profession of the faith, namely, synthetic formulas that indicate the center of the faith. Instead, others are in the form of an account of the event of the Resurrection and the facts connected to it. The form of the profession of faith, for example, is what we have just heard, or that of the Letter to the Romans where Paul writes: ” for, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised them from the dead, you will be saved “(10.9). From the earliest days of the Church, faith in the Mystery of Death and Resurrection of Jesus is steadfast and clear.
Today, however, I would like to dwell the second, on testimony in the form of the accounts that we find in the Gospels. First, we note that the first witnesses to this event were the women. At dawn, they go to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus, and find the first sign: the empty tomb (Mk 16:1). This is followed by an encounter with a Messenger of God who proclaims: Jesus of Nazareth, the Crucified One, they are not here, they are risen (cf. vv. 5-6). The women are driven by love and know how to accept this proclamation with faith: they believe, and immediately transmit it, they do not keep it for themselves. They cannot contain the joy of knowing that Jesus is alive, the hope that fills their heart. This should also be the same in our lives. Let us feel the joy of being Christian! We believe in the Risen One who has conquered evil and death! Let us also have the courage to “go out” to bring this joy and light to all the places of our lives! The Resurrection of Christ is our greatest certainty, it is our most precious treasure! How can we not share this treasure, this beautiful certainty with others! It's not just for us it's to be transmitted, shared with others this is our testimony!
[OKAY! Here we go! This is a good day for our team, friends.]
Another element. In the professions of faith of the New Testament, only men are remembered as witnesses of the Resurrection, the Apostles, but not the women. This is because, according to the Jewish Law of the time, women and children were not considered reliable, credible witnesses. [See what they are doing? See?!?] In the Gospels, however, [!]women have a primary, fundamental role. [There it is! The GOSPEL account is NOT culturally-conditioned, locked into a woman-repressing mentality. The Gospel, the Christian message, breaks with that.] Here we can see an argument in favor of the historicity of the Resurrection: if it were a invented, in the context of that time it would not have been linked to the testimony of women. Instead, the evangelists simply narrate what happened: the women were the first witnesses. [Actually, the angels were the first… but let that pass.] This tells us that God does not choose according to human criteria: the first witnesses of the birth of Jesus are the shepherds,[again, the first were really angels… but let that pass…] simple and humble people, the first witnesses of the Resurrection are women. This is beautiful, [this is fantastic!! Now wait for it…] and this is the mission of women, of mothers and women, [MOTHERS!] to give witness to their children and grandchildren that Christ is Risen! Mothers go forward with this witness! [MOTHERS!] What matters to God is our heart, if we are open to Him, if we are like trusting children. But this also leads us to reflect on how in the Church and in the journey of faith, women have had and still have a special role in opening doors to the Lord, in following them and communicating their face, because the eyes of faith always need the simple and profound look of love. [By being MOTHERS. They aren't talking about Church ministry. Far from suggesting anything about leadership positions in ecclesiastical structures, Francis is talking about having babies and being strong Catholics.] The Apostles and disciples find it harder to believe in the Risen Christ, not the women however! Peter runs to the tomb, but stops before the empty tomb; Thomas has to touch the wounds of the body of Jesus with their hands. In our journey of faith it is important to know and feel that God loves us, do not be afraid to love: faith is professed with the mouth and heart, with the word and love.
After the apparitions to women, there were others: Jesus becomes present in a new way:  They are the Crucified One, but their body is glorious; They did not return to an earthly life, but a new condition. At first they did not recognize him, and only through their words and deeds were their eyes opened: the encounter with the Risen Lord transforms, it gives new strength to faith, an unshakable foundation. The Risen Christ also reveals Himself to us with many signs: Sacred Scripture, the Eucharist, the other Sacraments, charity, these gestures of love bring a ray of the Risen One. [Mothers Marching in the Plaza de Mayo morphed into Mothers Marching for the Resurrection of Jesus.]
Let us be enlightened by the Resurrection of Christ, let us be transformed by Their power, so that through us the signs of death give way to signs of life in the world! I see that there are many young people in the Square! Young boys and girls, to you I say bring forth this certainty to the world: the Lord is Alive and walks beside us on our life's journey! Bring forth this hope, be anchored in this hope, the hope that comes from heaven! Be anchored and bring forth the hope! You witness of Christ bring forth hope to this world that is aged by wars and sin! Go forward young people!
Crazy is Glenn Beck's business and, last year, business was good. According to Forbes, Beck pulled in $32 million in the twelve months ending March 1. Most of the money was made by Mercury Radio Arts, the “entertainment company” that handles Beck's best-selling books, their lucrative website, and their sold-out sweater concerts, all of which accounted for $30 million of the money they made.
Ever the capitalist, Beck isn't content with their current level of wealth. And since they don't really care about politics (he told Forbes “I could give a flying crap about the political process”), their plans are to make more money by rolling out more radio stations, selling more books, and continuing the “never-ending quest to try to improve the quality” of what he's doing. At least that last one is a goal we can all support.
Cash from controversy: Glenn Beck made $32 M in the last year, says Forbes [NYDN]
Nowadays, Ipoh Old Town Wall Art Mural becomes the new attraction in the Ipoh city. Ipoh was a town full of historical buildings and a lot of delicious food. It's also my hometown, I'm born here. I'm proud to introduce to you my hometown. Now Ipoh also known as one of the Best in Asia by Lonely Planet.
The person brings us the drawing is Ernest Zacharevic. The same man who painted murals on walls along the streets of Penang's Georgetown, Ernest Zacharevic. Now the town is calling the “Art of Oldtown”. The Ipoh Old Town is the place originate of the white coffee, it's also called “Ipoh Oldtown White Coffee”. Ernest was drawn seven art murals on the Ipoh Oldtown. The murals do relive a sense of nostalgic moments related to Ipoh's heritage and culture.
I've mentioned before how Arctic Keys saved me $700 on Easter. It's a good thing too, because the very next day Audiobus cost me about the same when I became the 4th person to see it working! Not because you need multiple iPads to use Audiobus, but because you'll want them! We've got all kinds of great interoperability going on with our apps thanks to Virtual MIDI, but for the first time ever we can now sync the audio across multiple devices. This allows us to actually play with the different apps at the same time, instead of having a bunch in the background.
I had hoped to skip an iPad generation, but after seeing the potential here I knew I needed a 2nd iOS device. I'm now eyeing iPhone 5 rumors in anticipation of adding a 3rd to the mix. If you have multiple iOS devices, you're set to take advantage of this new platform.
This screenshot is from my iPad 3. As soon as I connected the SoundPrism Pro running on my iPad 2 it started to play audio into LoopyHD running on the iPad 3. It was really that simple. This is the sort of "it just works" design that Apple developers aspire to.
Micheal Tyson and Sebastian Dittmann, have been working very hard on making this ease-of-use a reality. Pictured here is an animation of the slide-out connection panel that will be available in all Audiobus compatible apps.
Sebastian has been involved with Virtual MIDI and OMAC from the beginning, and has seen how splintered the implementations have become. Nearly every app developer has their own way of handling Virtual MIDI! This maddening confusion will not be present in Audiobus, thanks to this little slide-out.
I get lots of emails from people trying to figure out Virtual MIDI, but I'm certain I won't get any from people trying to get Audiobus going. It just works!
Now that I've got the Alpha version to play with I've been able to do some experiments! iOS has an audio-buffer limited to 3 apps making sounds per device. This is true of all iPad versions. Audiobus will allow you to get around this by bringing together multiple device audio streams! You can run 3 apps on one device, 3 apps on another and sum them together on a 3rd. Or, as in my tests, run 3 apps on one iPad, 2 on another and have Audiobus be the 3rd.
Combined with Networked MIDI and Virtual MIDI you could extend this to many devices and apps! Including an entirely new class of apps designed to fit in that filter slot that goes between the source and destination in Audiobus. I expect to have my synths running on a couple of iPads, while a iPhone/iPod is running dedicated effects, all going back into one of the iPads for summing in a recorder app.
All of this is cool and all, but I still can't disclose the most amazing part... yet!

Spanish designer, Daniel Garcia, imagined a four-door sports coupe for the Audi lineup. Garcia designed the Audi A9 Concept as a possible replacement for Audi's current flagship model, the A8. The A9 Concept was designed using Audi's current design styles and is a luxury sports sedan aimed to compete with the likes of the Porsche Panamera, Aston Martin Rapide and the Lamborghini Estoque. The designer says that they drew inspiration for the design from Santiago Calatrava's architectural design displayed in their buildings in “La Ciudad de las Artes y de las Ciencias” (The City of Arts and Sciences) which is located in Garcia's hometown of Valencia.
The most amazing feature of the car is the single-piece windscreen/roof which is to be designed using a currently undiscovered nanotechnology material. This material will allow the car to repair any damage automatically as well as change color and opacity, changing visibility in both directions. The nano-material sounds very sci-fi and the cars exterior matches that theme. Moreover, the car boasts an unique ‘electronic painting' system that allows the owner to change the vehicle exterior colour with the touch of a button. The powerhouse beneath this moving work of art will be an advanced hybrid system consisting of an internal combustion engine paired with four electric motors in the wheels. Pictures of the concept can be seen below.

Editor's note: Today is National Burger Day! A day of appreciation for hamburgers. When considering our prevous stories on burgers this one immediately springs to mind. Absolutely barmy! Enjoy.
The Book of Kells is officially registered as a global trademark owned by Trinity College Dublin, despite complaints made by worldwide fast-food chain Burger King that the new trademark infringed on their own trademark in the US.
The university had registered the name “Book of Kells” and their new “BK merchandise” as a global trademark some months ago, but the process was held up in America due to the objections made by Burger King.
The restaurant chain had to be convinced that use of the initials “BK” to refer to Ireland's national treasure would not have any impact on their own trademark and their brand of burgers, fries and milk shakes, nor would it cause confusion for their customers (we can just imagine the despair of hungry tourists in Dublin when they're met with a manuscript instead of a fast-food counter).
"Eventually, they understood that Trinity College was not interested in the fast-food business," explained Paul Corrigan, retail and merchandising manager for Trinity College.
The new venture and the further commercialization of the Book of Kells is an effort to increase the profits earned from the precious artifact, the money going towards the care of TCD Library's collection of priceless books.

"We don't want to be seen as exploiting the Book of Kells, but, as you know, governments have cut university funding and we have to find new ways of financing our preservation of the manuscript and the other ancient texts we look after," continued Corrigan.
TCD, which showcases the famous manuscript in the Old Library on campus, is working in collaboration with art book publisher Thames & Hudson in the UK to produce five products drawing on the illustrations in the book. The deal with the publisher means that a percentage of the profits made on the BK products will be returned to the college so as to contribute to the upkeep of the manuscript.
The Book of Kells has now become a registered global trademark owned by Trinity College http://t.co/B7z9y4NpFM pic.twitter.com/2MYBcf33Kr — Irish Archaeology (@irarchaeology) August 10, 2015
This new range of products includes a five-year journal ($20.30); a set of three large notebooks ($13.15); three small notebooks ($9.90); a boxed collection of 20 different notecards with envelopes ($18.70); and a boxed collection of 30 postcards ($11.60).
The products are currently on sale in the Old Library Gift Shop in Trinity and will become available in certain bookshops throughout Ireland and internationally from September 7.
The Book of Kells is Ireland's most globally renowned historic manuscript with elaborate decorations illuminating the text of the four gospels. Depicted within the 340 folios of calf vellum, now bound in four separate volumes, are full-page illustrations dedicated to Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Evangelists as well as many other smaller decorative illustrations spread throughout the gospels.
The book is believed to have been created in 800 AD somewhere in Britain or Ireland in a Columban monastery, but its exact origins are the topic of much debate. The book takes its name from the Abbey of Kells which kept the Book of Kells for centuries before it moved to the Dublin university.

A major tourist attraction, the manuscript has been housed in the Old Library in Trinity since 1953 and attracted an astounding 650,000 visitors to view the ancient pages last year alone.

A panel beater who shot and killed a man outside their Thomastown factory had consumed 54 to 68 bongs and 39 to 42 stubbies of beer on the day leading up to the shooting, a court has heard.
Ivan D'Angelo told a Supreme Court jury on Thursday how they would wake up with a ‘‘brekkie bong'' and then start drinking and smoking marijuana for the rest of the day until they went to bed.
The only thing they had to eat during the day before the shooting was two slices of pizza, at about 8.30pm.
Defence barrister Peter Faris, QC, provided the jury with a chart detailing Mr D'Angelo's drinking and drug-taking habits.
Asked how they were able to carry out skilled panel work when drinking so much beer, Mr D'Angelo replied: ‘‘Pretty much before I even started my apprenticeship, my brother's friend was teaching me how to panel beat and I've learnt to drink while I work, it's a normal thing for me.
GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- New York Rangers center Derek Stepan, an unsigned restricted free agent, missed their second straight day of training camp Thursday, and a resolution to their contract situation does not appear imminent.
Rangers general manager Glen Sather said they have been in constant communication with Stepan's camp but that there is nothing to report.
Sather said Stepan has to understand the parameters and limitations that come with the salary cap in the new collective bargaining agreement. As of now, Sather said Stepan seems open to the team's standard two-year "bridge deal" but that the sides remain "too far apart" on dollars to make a deal.
Is Sather confident the dispute will be resolved quickly?
"I hope so," they told ESPNNewYork.com. "[He's] a good player, but you've got to be careful. You don't want to miss too much time here."
Thursday was the first day of on-ice sessions for the Rangers in training camp, providing new coach Alain Vigneault the first real glimpse of the team.
Asked about the impact of Stepan missing ice time on the Rangers' preparations, Vigneault said: "I work with the guys that are here. He's not here. That's it."
The Rangers' first preseason game is Monday against the New Jersey Devils.
Good friend and teammate Ryan McDonagh said they have been speaking with Stepan (who led the Rangers in scoring with 44 points last season) and has told them to stay positive. McDonagh said he's confident the situation will be resolved and the team will embrace the 23-year-old center with "open arms."
Stepan's absence will create an opportunity for other players down the middle. Vigneault said that 21-year-old center Oscar Lindberg caught management's eye with a strong performance in the recent Traverse City prospects tournament.
Vigneault said every team "needs surprises" in training camp.
Pro-independence flyers were distributed outside schools on Tuesday, after a months-long break in such campaigning.
The groups Hong Kong National Front and Student Localism say they have distributed leaflets outside around 20 schools across Hong Kong.
The flyers read “Hong Kong independence, back to the right track” and “The only way to defend Hong Kong and our people is to go independent.”
They did not disclose the name of the schools but revealed that a Sha Tin secondary school student voluntarily handed out flyers outside the school gates, whilst another did so outside the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Lo Kon Ting Memorial College in Yuen Long.
“Hong Kong independence is a far away goal, which adults and students have to fight for. The future belongs to us, the young generation – we will be Hong Kong's masters, thus we will wake more sleeping students up,” Student Localism wrote on its social media page.
The groups criticised the spread of patriotic education in schools, the use of Mandarin as a teaching medium for Chinese, and the rise of mainland Chinese people competing for school places in Hong Kong.
It added that the government cannot suppress an ideal: “An ideal will never disappear. Suppression will only make the flame of independence burn stronger.”
The two groups called on university and secondary school students to promote independence in schools, and said they will provide assistance.
Last year, Student Localism also organised students to hand out pro-independence flyers outside schools on the first day of school on September 1. Some schools allowed students to do so, but there were cases of students being stopped by teaching staff outside school gates. Then-secretary for education Eddie Ng said schools may reach out to regional education officials, or even the police public relations branch, to ask for support if the distribution of pro-independence leaflets near school premises disturbed students.
Previously, Tony Chung, a core member of Student Localism and a secondary five students at Buddhist Mau Fung Memorial College, told HKFP that the plan to promote independence in schools was suspended soon after, because of the disqualification of two localist lawmakers and internal conflicts among pro-independence groups.
In September, the emergence of Hong Kong independence banners on university “Democracy Wall” message boards sparked controversy, as some schools removed them without seeking the consent of student unions, who managed the boards with authorisation from school management.
The vice-chancellors of ten universities then issued a joint statement that said: “We treasure freedom of expression, but we condemn its recent abuses. Freedom of expression is not absolute, and like all freedoms it comes with responsibilities. All universities undersigned agree that we do not support Hong Kong independence, which contravenes the Basic Law.”
However, Peter Mathieson, the outgoing University of Hong Kong president, claimed that the statement did not suggest that discussion of Hong Kong independence was, or is, an abuse of freedom of expression.
Controversial decision from Interior Department is conditional on availability of spill-response equipment, which is currently en route to Oregon for repairs
Barack Obama has removed one of the last obstacles to oil drilling in Arctic waters, granting Shell permission to bore two new exploratory wells.
However, the drilling permit granted by the Interior Department on Wednesday bans Shell from drilling into oil-bearing zones until critical spill-response equipment is in place – and that equipment is aboard a damaged icebreaker en route to Oregon for repairs.
The restrictions could severely limit Shell's operations during the brief Arctic season, which winds down in late September. The company has spent $7bn and seven years trying to open up the Arctic to oil and gas drilling.
“Shell currently is not permitted to drill into oil-bearing zones,” Brian Salerno, director of the department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The statement said the company would only be able to drill one well at a time and would have to wait to drill deeper into oil-bearing formations until the arrival on site of its capping stack, a critical piece of equipment in the event of a well blowout.
That capping stack is aboard the M/V Fennica icebreaker, which sprang a hole in its hull after navigating through shallow waters almost immediately after leaving the Alaskan port of Dutch Harbor earlier this month.
“Without the required well control system in place, Shell will not be allowed to drill into oil-bearing zones,” Salerno said.
The conditions put further limitations on Shell's plans to open up the Arctic for oil exploration.
An earlier decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service required Shell to keep active rigs 15 miles away from walruses and other wildlife.
The company had initially planned to drill the wells much closer, allowing Shell to move more easily between the two sites.
The new conditions following growing pressure from campaigners against Arctic drilling.
Al Gore, a former vice-president, said this month that drilling for new sources of oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic was “insane” – especially given scientists' conclusion that the majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change.
Al Gore criticizes Obama on climate change and 'insane' Arctic drilling Read more
But the potential short-term rewards for a company like Shell are enormous, with the Arctic ocean believed to contain about 20% of the world's untapped and recoverable oil and gas reserves.
So far, the company has got in one short – and disaster-prone – season of Arctic drilling, after its Kulluk rig ran aground on an island in late 2012.
Since then, the Obama administration has imposed more stringent conditions – such as the requirement for a capping stack – intended to avoid an oil spill disaster in the Arctic.
However, campaigners said that even Wednesday's conditions did not change their overall conclusion that it was a mistake to open up drilling in the Arctic.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said the permits were “misguided”.
Cassady Sharp, a campaigner for Greenpeace, noted that the discovery of the hole in Fennica demonstrated the perils of trying to drill for oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic.
“By opening up the Arctic to oil drilling, President Obama is courting disaster and undermining their legacy on climate change. The world cannot afford to burn Arctic oil, and the consequences of a spill would be enormous,” they said in a statement. “ It is not too late for President Obama to finally come to terms with the disaster in the Arctic that could happen on their watch.”

For example, a collection of “smiley face with heart shaped eyes” emojis offered by different companies are shown below:

Each emoji provides the same general impression of love and happiness, but they differ in color, shading, mouth shape, size and orientation of eyes, etc.
It is challenging to enforce copyright in an emoji or other creative work against an unauthorized user unless the copyright has been registered with the federal government. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine specifically which emojis are actually covered by registered U.S. copyrights. The Copyright Office database lists copyright registrations, but does not display the artwork associated with the registrations. Also, a copyright registration may have a generic title, such as “Artwork #3,” which does not identify that the copyright protected artwork is an emoji. As such, there is no easily-accessible list of copyright-protected emoji designs.Each emoji provides the same general impression of love and happiness, but they differ in color, shading, mouth shape, size and orientation of eyes, etc.
To minimize risk, it is prudent to assume that each company which has developed and offers its own set of emojis has registered its copyright in the emojis. If you are considering offering a product incorporating an existing emoji, such as a t-shirt displaying the emoji, either confirm that the emoji is in the public domain or seek permission of the company which created the emoji. Alternatively, you may wish to create your own unique emojis.
Wayne Coyne recently opened up to ClashMusic about The Flaming Lips' collaboration with Yoko Ono.
The Flaming Lips are keen to make friends. The Oklahoma collective spent the past 12 months working with other artists, filing away their collaborations for a future release.
Set to be made widely available through Bella Union this month, 'The Flaming Lips And Heady Fwends' includes some iconic artists. Joining Wayne Coyne & Co. are the likes of Ke$ha, Prefuse 73, Nick Cave and Neon Indian - amongst plenty of others.
Managing to get Wayne Coyne on the phone, Clash Magazine editor Simon Harper spoke to the artist about their unusual new project. Opening up about those collaborations, the songwriter reflected on their work with Yoko Ono, in particular.
Yoko Ono appears on your new ‘Heady Fwends' album, and they thrive on spontaneity. What was working with them like?
We worked with Sean [Lennon] and Charlotte in their studio in New York while Yoko - they were doing stuff with us, but they were working remotely from London and then Tokyo. But I don't know; when I listen to a lot of Yoko's music, to me it doesn't feel as though it's endlessly reaching around. They have a thing that they do and they do it pretty consistently. It's so strange how to almost anybody in the world that knows anything about music you say ‘Yoko Ono' and they know exactly what she's doing. And you take it for granted. You know, one day they woke up and said: ‘This is what I'm going to do. I'm gonna go [wails incoherently] and tell the world this is my music', and that's insane to get away with that. It's insane to say ‘this is what I do'.
In the time that we worked with them it was a little bit difficult because they want to be the one that makes the music. When I was with Sean and Charlotte, I was pushing my agenda of ‘Well, here's what I want to do but I want you to on it', but Yoko doesn't do that easily. In the end, I think once they heard it they thought, ‘Oh well, this sounds great, because I think I sang great on it'. But in the beginning they were like, ‘I don't want to do your music. I want to do my own music. Why would I want to work with you?' And luckily with Sean there saying, ‘Come on Mom, this is really fun, we're all working on this together' it happened. But it wasn't completely free-form. There was a lot of ‘Yes mam, we'll do it this way'. (Laughs) Which is what I like! I liked that they did here thing! I don't want anybody to just be nice to me. I want them to do their thing, and they definitely did them thing.
Was there a lot of compromise elsewhere on the album, or was everybody cool?
No. That was why I went to so much effort. The [Yoko] track that was on the album is a great fucking track, but we didn't make it really. It kind of happened. That was the track we had to fight for the most because they did these vocal things but then we made the track from it. We cut and pasted all these things, and although it sounds like a performance it's not really. And I think that's why they had so much difficulty with it - they were like, ‘Well, I don't remember doing that. I don't really want to do it that way'.
So in time, and with a little bit of letting them sit with it, I think they came to really like it - once she'd listened to it without thinking that we were trying to invade their creation or something. But yeah, I mean that's the nature of working with people: I want them. I don't want a watered-down version of them. I don't want them saying yes when they mean no. If they say no, they mean no, and you have to work on it.

'The Flaming Lips And Heady Fwends' will be released on July 30th. Watch out for a full interview with Wayne Coyne on ClashMusic shortly!
Several Ways to Congratulate a Programmer
Posted byon September 20, 2010
- Hey, it's really Programmers' Day, - realized I about two hours prior to it coming. Then I imagined tomorrow's congratulations - boring commonplace phrases, not a bit different from things said on any other day. And I yearned for something professional, with zest in it! I got to work immediately, and here is the result. This article suggests several methods to represent any trivial greetings in a special way, with respect to our profession and this encyclopedia.
Method 1. Classic
The first thing that jumps to one's head when esoteric programming is mentioned is the infamous Brainfuck. The language is convenient for multiple reasons:
it is famous, especially when compared to other esoteric languages;
it has plenty interpreters, including on-line ones, while most esoteric languages are either not implemented or have one or two interpreters, which in turn require quite an effort to install and run them before ever starting coding in the actual language;
it features particular simplicity and variability of the ways to output text messages;
it ignores any characters of code except for 8 command ones, so the code can be formatted as one likes, concealed in ASCII-art or borders around some other text etc.
So, the simplest loop-less code to output "Happy Programmers' Day!" in Brainfuck looks like this:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++++++ ++++++++++++++++++.+++++++++++++++..+++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++. <-----------------------------------------.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.-- -.--------.+++++++++++.-----------------.++++++++++++..--------.+++++++++++++.+. >>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.<.<----------------------------------- ------------.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.++++++++++++++++++++++++.>>------.
Looks not much fun, right? We can rearrange it like this:
+++++++++ ++++++++++ +++ +++ ++++++++++ +++ ++++++++ +++++++++ ++++++++++ +++++++.+ ++++++++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +.+ +++ +++ +++ +++ ++. .++ +++ +++ +.> +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ ++. <-- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---------- --- --- -----.++++ +++ +++ +++ +++++++++ ++++++++++ ++.---.-- ------.+ +++ +++ ++++.----- --- --- ------.+++ +++ +++ +++ ..------ --.+++++++ ++++++.+ .>>+++++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +.< .<-- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- .++ +++++++++ ++++++++++ +++++ +++.++++++ +++++++++ ++++++++ +.> >------.++ +++ +++ ++++++++
If we take next most known esoteric language (popular mostly among esolangs addicts and inventors), Befunge, if also has a lot of ways to output a text message, but the simplest one is too evident to be of any interest at all: it's just the characters of the message in reverse order, taken in brackets of command characters:
0"!yaD 'sremmargorP yppaH">,:#<_@
Method 2. Dramatic
A popular way to greet someone is to create a themed piece of art - a poem, a fairy tale, whatever you have time and inspiration for. The best language to implement this is Shakespeare programming language. In it the code is represented as a play, the variables are named after Shakespeare characters, and the programmer might not be a playwright, but they must know the King's English :-) Because the more ornate and luxuriant the bunch of adjectives prior to a noun is, the larger is the numerical constant denoted with it, and all operations are described in variables' monologues. Outputting "congrats" in this fabulous language looks like this:
The Shakespeare-Style Congratulations Ariel, the genie to store values of o,n,r,t,s Caliban, the ugly creature to store values of c, g, a Prospero, the hero to operate on them Act I. Scene I. [Enter Prospero and Ariel] Prospero: You peaceful mighty proud handsome white-winged overweight overpraised overnice angel! You are as good as the difference between you and an ill naughty crying underage child! [Exit Ariel] [Enter Caliban] Prospero: You are as ugly as the difference between Ariel and sum of their white fluffy wings and their bored smile! Speak your mind! [Exit Caliban] [Enter Ariel] Prospero: Speak your mind. You are as worried as the sum of you and a spider! Speak your mind! [Exit Ariel] [Enter Caliban] Prospero: You are as disgusting as the sum of you and a drunken vomiting idiot. Speak your mind! [Exit Caliban] [Enter Ariel] Prospero: You as as sweet as the sum of you and reddest royal roses. Speak your mind. [Exit Ariel] [Enter Caliban] Prospero: You are as silent as the difference between you and the sum of your dirty feet and your unkempt greasy hair. Speak your mind! [Exit Caliban] [Enter Ariel] Prospero: You are as prominent as the sum of you and a sparkling diamond. Speak your mind. You are as lovely as the sum of you and a guinea-pig. Speak your mind! [Exit Ariel] Prospero: What the hell is wrong about these guys walking here and there in silence? [Exit Prospero]
Method 3. Magical
A little professional hocus-pocus to surprise your colleague is: run shell (for example, Bash), and type the following:
echo 1774767685848640863781394195195183398747095833456108183818P | dc
Unexpected, eh? This is so-called dc-magic, simple but quite unevident. dc is Desktop Calculator, a tool that allows to process arbitrary-precision numbers. In this case command P prints the preceding number, but (that's the trick!) as a string. To do this, the number is translated to hexadecimal format: 0x48617070792050726F6772616D6D6572732720446179210A broken into pairs of digits, and each pair of digits is printed as a character with corresponding ASCII-code.
Method 4. Cloak-and-dagger
People who don't own a printer have a language of their own - Whitespace. It is notable that an empty piece of paper from a Whitespace programmer can mean literally anything - from love letter to a cartel. This magnificent language understands not visible characters but blanks between them - spaces, tabs and line feeds. Thus, an uncommented code looks like a void document, and produces a blank piece of paper when printed.
Following is a code to output "congrats", in which spaces are replaced with S, and tabs with T. Squiggle brackets denote start and end of numbers (to improve readability), and last period delineates three new lines in the end of code.
SS{STTSSSTT} T SSSS{STTSTTTT} T SSSS{STTSTTTS} T SSSS{STTSSTTT} T SSSS{STTTSSTS} T SSSS{STTSSSST} T SSSS{STTTSTSS} T SSSS{STTTSSTT} T SASS{STATS} T SS .
Method 5. Ornamental
Finally, there are plenty of ways to embed the message into an image - here are just a few of them.

I'm often shocked as to how many SaaS founders are unable to answer simple questions regarding the health of their business. If you're a SaaS founder or operator and don't know what your monthly churn rate is, what your MRR is, or what your LTV is, I'm sorry to say, but you're doomed.
There is a tonne of material on SaaS metrics that you can find online. What you might notice are different variations and equations for each metric, which might make things confusing or overwhelming. My goal is to break down the most important SaaS metrics into simple explanations and formulas so any SaaS founder, no matter how your financial acumen is, can apply in your own business.
Churn Rate
Churn simply means the amount of customers you are losing in a month. To calculate churn, you would take the number of customers lost in the given month, and divide that by the total number of customers you had to start the month.
For example, let's say you had 1000 customers on January 1st. In the month of January, you lost 15 customers. You would calculate churn as follows:
Customers lost / Total customers at the beginning of the month = Churn Rate
15 / 1000 = 0.015 or 1.5%
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
This is the amount of recurring revenue you generate in a month. MRR does not include any one-off charges. Only ongoing recurring charges.
To calculate MRR, you would take all of the new MRR for the month (MRR from new customers or MRR from accounts expansions), and deduct that from the lost MRR for the month (account contractions, and churn MRR). You would then add that net MRR to your MRR at the beginning of the month to get your end of month MRR.
The good news is, most recurring billing platforms calculate this for you. If not, find one that does.
Account Revenue Per User (ARPU)
ARPU is another very important SaaS metric, as it tells you what your average customer is paying you per month.
To calculate ARPU, you simply take your MRR at the end of the month, and divide it by the amount of total customers you have at the end of the month.
For example, let's say your MRR at the end of January was $100k, and your total customers at the end of the month was 1000. You would calculate ARPU as follows:
MRR at end of the month / total customers at end of the month = ARPU
$100,000 / 1000 = $100
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
CAC is extremely important, as it tells you how much money it costs you to acquire one customer.
To calculate CAC, you would tally up all of your marketing and sales related expenses (payroll for sales and marketing employees, advertising costs, software tools for marketing/sales, etc.) for the month, and divide that by the number of new customers in the month.
For example, let's say your total marketing/sales related expenses totalled $10k in January, and you acquired 100 new customers in January. You would calculate CAC as follows:
CAC for the month / new customers in the month = CAC
$10,000 / 100 = $100*
Lifetime Value (LTV)
LTV might be the holy grail of SaaS metrics, as it tells you how much money a customer will pay you in their lifetime.
The good news is, if you calculated the above metrics, you can easily find out your LTV by plugging in your numbers. Keep in mind, there are several variations for calculating LTV, but I will use a common simplified version which works just as fine.
(1 / churn rate %) x ARPU = LTV
Using the above examples, we know our monthly churn rate was 1.5%, and our ARPU was $100.
(1 / 0.015) x $100 = $6666.66*
*CAC and LTV are useless by themselves. You need to know both of these metrics to understand the health of your SaaS. As a general rule, your LTV should be at least 3 times higher than your CAC. If not, you might have trouble being profitable unless you make changes in pricing, or reduce costs.

Before teeing it up in the pre-qualifier for this week's season-opening LPGA event, the ISPS Handa Australian Open in Yarralumla, Australia, the only Black Widows that LET rookie Daniela Holmqvist of Sweden had ever heard of were the eponymous golf spikes .
But after punching out of the rough on the fourth hole of the Royal Canberra Golf Club in Tuesday's competition, they felt a sharp stab in their ankle. When they looked down, they saw a large, black creature with a red spot on its back just above their sock line. After quickly swatting it away, they doubled over in pain.

"When I told the local caddies in my group what had happened, they got very upset and said it was a Black Widow, and immediately started looking for their phones to call the medics," Holmqvist told Karin Klarstrom of Svensk Golf.
As Holmqvist's leg started to swell and the pain became intense, they made the quick decision to take matters into their own hands (she'd just been informed that a Black Widow bite can kill a child in as little as 30 minutes). They pulled a tee out of their pocket ("it was the only thing I had handy," they told Svensk Golf) and used it to cut open the wound so they could squeeze out the venom and keep it from spreading inside their body.
"A clear fluid came out," they said. "It wasn't the prettiest thing I've ever done, but I had to get as much of it out of me as possible."
It appears the do-it-yourself surgery was effective. An official was called and after weighing their options, Holmqvist decided to play on, despite severe pain and some anxiety about their well-being. Medics followed them the remaining 14 holes to make sure they didn't pass out, and monitored their behavior and swelling. They finished the round without incident but shot 74, which left them out of the tournament.
"It still hurts," they told Svensk Golf later in the evening. "I don't recommend getting bitten by a Black Widow."

The German website Heise reports that Skylake CPUs might have a special feature to boost single-thread performance, the site calls it reverse Hyper Threading. The feature pretty much combines several physical cores into a single ‘Super Core'. In other words, the feature combines features and performance of multiple physical cores into a single virtual core.
(Credits: Heise / C'T Labs. Translation: Kerne = Cores / Puntke = Points)
Heise found unusual behavior of the Core i7 6700K Skylake CPU when performing tests with the SPEC CPU2006 Suite. The single-thread performance of the CPU was found to be 2.4x faster than the Haswell architecture based Core i7 4790K CPU. When multiple cores and threads were tested, the difference in performance between the Skylake and Haswell CPU was a lot less. The site reports a difference of about 20% when multiple threads are used instead of about 170% between single-thread performance.
Heise speculates that Intel might have added a feature to the CPU that allows a second core to assist the first core with e.g. functional units, caches or buffers. Heise speaks about a single virtual core that is made up of several physical cores. This isn't actually something new, a similar technology was announced by the company Soft Machines at the end of 2014. This company, founded by two former Intel employees has developed a technology they call VISC.
On its website Soft Machines writes, “The VISC architecture, based on the concept of “virtual cores” and “virtual hardware threads”, enables dynamic allocation and sharing of resources across cores.”
The company also promises to increase performance 2 to 4 times, which is on par with the performance increase reported by Heise. So far it's only speculation of the website, actual details on the processor are expected at the Intel Developer Forum that's held the 18th of August this year.
Nearly 850 Chicago Public Schools employees received layoff notices Friday, hours after officials said they had identified $52 million in administrative and operational cuts to help close an estimated $1 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year.
Eliminating almost 100 central office positions and adopting more efficient building maintenance will help save $20.7 million, on top of $31.6 million in cuts announced earlier this year, officials said. They did not estimate how much the district might save through layoffs — most resulting from a Board of Education decision last month to close 50 schools and programs — because some workers will be eligible to reapply for other jobs.
CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett called the deficit "historic." They said the district will spend the next several weeks looking for more ways to trim expenses but will try to avoid cuts that would affect students.
"Next year's budget will not come without painful decisions, which is why we are making tough choices at central office in order to minimize impacts to our classrooms," Byrd-Bennett said in a written statement.
Officials say that since 2011, CPS has cut almost $600 million from the central office and programs that it funds.
The nation's third-largest school district has been struggling to trim its deficit, which it said was inflated by a $400 million increase in its annual pension payments, salaries and flat or declining revenue.
The layoffs included about 550 teachers — both from schools that are closing and struggling academically — along with teacher assistants, bus aides, custodians and others.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel promoted the school-closure plan, saying the buildings were underused and that closing them it would save the district hundreds of millions over 10 years and improve education. Chicago Teachers Union Staff Coordinator Jackson Potter called the layoffs and closures "part and parcel of a very intense series of attacks on our schools that will undermine the academic growth and development and the safety of our most vulnerable students."
They contend that Emanuel has refused to explore other options, including by demanding a more equitable state tax system and taking back tax revenue lost to tax-increment finance districts meant to promote development. Potter also said the union believes the layoffs "could be the tip of the iceberg" as individual schools assess their budgets.
Emanuel and Byrd-Bennett said CPS has 403,000 students in a system that has seats for more than 500,000. The school closures have sparked protests and lawsuits from opponents who say they disproportionately affect minority neighborhoods and will endanger children who may have to cross gang boundaries to get to a new school.
Officials have said students will be moved to schools that are performing better academically and that CPS will work with Chicago police and community groups to ensure students can get to and from their new schools safely.
Punjab only comes to the attention of this republic during one of the periodic bursts of unrest in the state. For most of the time in between, the rest of the republic is content to nurture the myth of a hardworking if unpredictable people who spend much their leisure time dancing the bhangra while consuming copious quantities of lassi or liquor. Occasionally, a report on one of the ongoing "crisis" in the state, whether that of drugs or agriculture, will make it to the national media.
The current crisis has generated its own exotic images: protestors whose poses and attitudes suitably reflect a "martial race" agitated over the desecration of the pages of a holy book; panj pyaras (whoever they are as far as people in the rest of the country are concerned) in colourful costumes taking the battle to the takht jathedars (whoever they may be). These images are accompanied by reports of "radicals" abroad, helped by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), who somehow, according to the Punjab and central government, manage to manufacture trouble and assemble people in numbers that far exceed their miniscule strength in India and abroad.
The truth is that the origins of the current problems lie in the times in between, when the republic is looking away from Punjab. In a state dominated by the jutt Sikhs who are linked to each other by tribal kin and clan associations, democracy has always been a veneer. The forms of democracy, the legislature and the electoral process appear healthy but they lack substance. Work by the government does not take place through constitutionally mandated channels where citizens can demand services and accountability; instead it is carried out through a network of clan associations where loyalty to a leader is rewarded through patronage.
While this is true of all parties that come to power in Punjab, whether the Akalis or the Congress, the process has been further honed under the leadership of Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and their son Sukhbir Badal. Individual leaders of the party, cabinet ministers and ostensibly powerful leaders in bodies such as the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC), which controls all gurdwaras, are all directly beholden to the Badals and have little autonomy. The state has become a conglomerate run by the Badal family through patronage networks.
Three years ago when Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Badal leveraged the construction of a Bluestar Memorial to appropriate the figure of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who, while they were alive, came close to putting the Akalis and Badal themselves out of business. At that time, I had noted in an article titled A Community Led by Dunces, “…the voices that represent Sikhs do not speak for them. They represent the most regressive impulses of the community, and in ordinary settings, they would not be able to speak for a roomful of Sikhs, leave alone the entire community.”
The potential of micronutrients to ameliorate the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) was explored in a clinical trial conducted in Ukraine. Cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during a habituation/dishabituation learning paradigm were obtained from 6 to 12 month-olds to assess neurophysiological encoding and memory. Women who differed in prenatal alcohol use were recruited during pregnancy and assigned to a group (No study-provided supplements, multivitamin/mineral supplement, or multivitamin/mineral supplement plus choline supplement). Heart rate was collected for 30 s prior to stimulus onset and 12 s post-stimulus onset. Difference values (∆HR) for the first 3 trials of each condition were aggregated for analysis. Gestational blood samples were collected to assess maternal nutritional status and changes as a function of the intervention. Choline supplementation resulted in a greater ∆HR on the visual habituation trials for all infants and for the infants with no PAE on the dishabituation trials. The latency of the response was reduced in both conditions for all infants whose mothers received choline supplementation. Change in gestational choline level was positively related to ∆HR during habituation trials and levels of one choline metabolite, dimethylglycine (DMG), predicted ∆HR during habituation trials and latency of responses. A trend was found between DMG and ∆HR on the dishabituation trials and latency of the response. Supplementation did not affect ORs to auditory stimuli. Choline supplementation when administered together with routinely recommended multivitamin/mineral prenatal supplements during pregnancy may provide a beneficial impact to basic learning mechanisms involved in encoding and memory of environmental events in alcohol-exposed pregnancies as well as non- or low alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Changes in maternal nutrient status suggested that one mechanism by which choline supplementation may positively impact brain development is through prevention of fetal alcohol-related depletion of DMG, a metabolic nutrient that can protect against overproduction of glycine, during critical periods of neurogenesis.

Introduction
Have you ever wondered how glow-in-the-dark things work? It can be a lot of fun to play with bracelets, wands and other toys that are glow-in-the-dark! Did you ever imagine that you could make something at home that glows? It turns out that it's not that hard to do—all you need is tonic water and a black light! Some common household chemicals can also affect this beverage's glow. In this activity you'll make tonic water glow by using a black light and then you'll add a little bleach to the water. How will adding bleach affect the tonic water's glow? Try this activity to find out!
Background
Tonic water is a carbonated beverage that has a chemical called quinine dissolved in it. Quinine is made from the bark of a tree and has been used for centuries as a treatment for malaria. Quinine not only gives tonic water a characteristic bitter taste (which is offset today by the addition of sweeteners to bottled tonic water) but this chemical can also be very fluorescent under the right conditions.
Under an ultraviolet "black light," the quinine in tonic water makes the water fluoresce a brilliant, bright blue (even though only a relatively small amount of quinine is dissolved in the water). In general, something fluoresces because it has absorbed light energy, which makes it excited, and then it releases (or emits) light as it returns to its normal, unexcited state. Part of why we find things that glow under ultraviolet lights—such as some minerals, fish and tonic water—to be fascinating is because we cannot see the (ultraviolet) light they absorb but can see the visible light they emit (which is blue in the case of quinine).
Materials
Tonic water
Clear, plastic, disposable cup
Measuring cup (optional)
Medicine dropper
Bleach
Ultraviolet "black light" bulb (This can be purchased at a party supply store or some hardware stores.)
A room that can be darkened
When handling the bleach, be sure to read and follow all safety precautions listed on the container. Adult assistance is required when handling bleach. Do not drink the bleach or the tonic water mixed with the bleach, and be careful to not get it on your skin.
Avoid looking directly at the ultraviolet "black light" and shining it on your skin because the light can damage your eyes and skin.
Pour about one cup of tonic water into a clear plastic, disposable cup.
In a darkened room turn on the ultraviolet black light and shine it on the cup. What happens to the tonic water in the cup when the black light shines on it?
While still shining the black light on the cup of tonic water, use the medicine dropper to carefully add two drops of bleach to the tonic water. Carefully mix the bleach in with the tonic. What happens when the bleach is added to the tonic? What happens after the bleach is mixed in with it?
If you do not see a change in the tonic water, try adding and mixing in a few more drops of bleach. What happens?
If you have some left, under the black light you can compare the glow of the tonic water in the original bottle with the tonic water that has bleach mixed in. Do they look very different? Overall, how did adding bleach to the tonic water change its glow under the black light?
Extra: If you dilute tonic water with regular water, you can make the tonic water glow less brightly. What is the smallest amount of tonic needed (as you dilute it with normal water) for it to still visibly glow under an ultraviolet black light?
If you dilute tonic water with regular water, you can make the tonic water glow less brightly. What is the smallest amount of tonic needed (as you dilute it with normal water) for it to still visibly glow under an ultraviolet black light? Extra: Bleach is a type of chemical called an oxidizing agent. Some other common household oxidizing agents include hydrogen peroxide and OxiClean (which contains sodium percarbonate). When other oxidizing agents are added to tonic water, do they have the same effect on its glow under an ultraviolet black light that bleach does?

Extra: You could try preparing JELL-O with tonic water instead of regular water. Does the JELL-O made with tonic water glow under an ultraviolet black light? (Tip: Try preparing the JELL-O with water that is hot but not quite boiling.)
Observations and results
When you added a few drops of bleach to the tonic water, did it stop fluorescing under the ultraviolet black light?
You should have clearly seen that the tonic water glowed a brilliant, bright blue color when you put it under the ultraviolet black light (before adding bleach). This is because the (invisible) ultraviolet light from the black light is absorbed by the quinine in the tonic water, and this excites the quinine. When the quinine becomes unexcited, it releases visible blue light that we see. After adding and mixing in a few drops of bleach with the tonic water, however, it should have stopped glowing. Why? Bleach is an oxidizing agent and can disrupt and break certain chemical bonds (specifically carbon–carbon double bonds). It is in these chemical bonds that the quinine absorbs the ultraviolet light, so by adding bleach to the tonic water it makes the quinine unable to absorb ultraviolet light anymore, and so it can no longer emit blue light.
Cleanup
You can pour the very diluted bleach down a drain. Thoroughly clean anything that came in contact with the bleach and rinse your hands.

After an eventful year of traveling to 11 out of 22 native communities, former Miss Indian ASU Jennifer Jones passed their title to a new reign.
Seven contestants, representing five different tribes, competed on April 15, but the Mr. and Miss Indian ASU title went to sociology sophomore Matthew Yatsayte and American Indian Studies junior Gypsy Pete.
Yatsayte has been a part of the Native community since they attended Student Preparedness Initiative: Readiness Inspired by Tradition, or SPIRIT, a two-week program that helps native first-year student adjust to campus life.
Being a part of SPIRIT introduced them to various clubs on campus including Native Americans Taking Initiatives on Student Success, Barrett Indigenous Culture Association and American Indian Council. Through these clubs they learned that working with indigenous people was something they liked to do.
Yatsayte described their platform as “Looking back at our cultural roots and our cultural values and living by those, but also keeping in mind that we need to be able to be open to new things to further our people as well as further ourselves.”
They said their inspiration for their platform came from a quote by Terry Pratchett: “If you do not know where you come from, then you don't know where you are, and if you don't know where you are, then you don't know where you're going.”
They believe that learning more about their culture will show them where they stand in society and prevent them from being swayed away from their culture and tradition.
Gypsy Pete has served the Native American community at ASU through student-led involvement and working as Jennifer Jones' second attendant from 2016-2017.
As Miss Indian ASU, their goal is to serve Native communities to enable “the empowerment of young girls (to) become independent successful native women, while balancing their native culture, from the western society.”
“(Many) indigenous boys and girls do not have the capability and opportunity to attend school. I just (want) to be a role model and ambassador for those who can't,” they said.
Attending college sets an example for young people to realize that they can be away from home, but still can retain their traditional ways, Pete said.
Graduate law student Brian Garcia said they are interested in running for Mr. Indian ASU next year with a platform in engaging Native Americans in the civic process.
They want to work in Indian country to create a civically engaged environment through tribal sovereignty, self-determination and self-sufficiency.
“Among other things, I am a first-generation college student and my parents are both immigrants. My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Mexico. I am a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe,” said Garcia. “From that I realized how important it is to be civically engaged.”
Garcia said they are amazed by the way the pageant brings many tribes together and focuses on a platform regarding issues that impact Native Americans.
“I would focus on having more Native individuals (participate) in the civic process," they said. "There's a disparity in terms of the amount of policy that goes into a municipal, state and federal government and we see that lack translate into those policies that have essentially hurt Indian country.”
Garcia found inspiration from Kathlene Rosier, the executive director of the Indian Legal Program at ASU and Laura Gonzales-Macias, the associate director of American Indian Student Support Services at ASU.
Gonzalez-Macias, advisor for the royalty committee, said for the past seven years they have seen the pageant and the contestants flourish with the number of tribes participating and the platforms they share.
“I have seen awareness and I see students take pride in who they are by sharing their stories," Gonzales said.
“That is one of the reasons why I like the theme of the pageant this year, ‘The Power in Your Story,' because it empowers the students and others as witnesses to — indigenous people are proud, educated, resourceful, individuals who have a lot to offer," they said.

Divided U.S. Supreme Court Leaves Texas Abortion Law In Effect
The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to block abortion restrictions that are included in a new Texas law that was enacted after vigorous debate this year. The law is the subject of an ongoing legal battle.
Texas officials have defended the law in lower federal courts, with Planned Parenthood and other opponents winning an initial victory that was overturned days later by a U.S. Court of Appeals.
In today's ruling, as SCOTUSblog reports, "The majority said that the challengers had not met the requirement for setting aside a federal appeals court order permitting the law to take effect."
The blog's Lyle Denniston adds that the vote on the issue was 5-4.
Critics of the Texas law have said it imposes a burden both on physicians who perform abortions and on their patients, with its requirement that the doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic.
"The case remains on appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans," the AP reports. "That court is expected to hear arguments in January, and the law will remain in effect at least until then."
Insurgents have carried out a gun and bomb attack in the south Afghan town of Tarin Kowt, Uruzgan province, leaving at least 22 dead, officials say.
They said the violence included three suicide bombings followed by fighting in a market, adding that all eight attackers had now been killed.
The dead include Ahmed Omed Khpulwak, a local BBC reporter.
The Taliban say they carried out the attack, which comes amid renewed violence in Afghanistan.
Nato says it is providing air support to Afghan forces in Tarin Kowt.
TV station stormed
Afghan intelligence officials said at least one bomb exploded near the governor's office and one near the offices of a security firm owned by a local militia commander. It is not clear where the third bomb was detonated.
Ahmed Omed Khpulwak was one of those brave reporters who have created that bond of trust with the people Peter Horrocks, Director, BBC Global News They 'put their lives on the line'Remembering Omed
Most of the fighting took place near these offices, which are close to the main market and a building which houses a local radio and TV station.
The BBC's Bilal Sarwary says the market was attacked from four sides, but the siege was broken by elite forces.
Residents said heavy machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles were used by both sides.
Health officials said 22 people had been killed including three women and 40 injured, most of them civilians.
Among the dead is Ahmed Omed Khpulwak, a reporter for the BBC Pashto radio service as well as the Pajhwok news agency.
They were one of several people killed when the TV and radio station was attacked.
BBC Global News director Peter Horrocks said: "The BBC and the whole world are grateful to journalists like Ahmed Omed who courageously put their lives on the line to report from dangerous places."
Two soldiers were among the dead but no senior government officials have been harmed, officials said.

Arizona State guard and two-time All-Pac-12 First Team selection Jahii Carson as expected will forgo their final two years of NCAA eligibility and enter the 2014 NBA Draft. The 2013 Pac-12 Co-Freshman of the Year averaged 18.6 points, 4.6 assists and 4.0 rebounds in their sophomore season, leading the Sun Devils to a 21-12 mark and its first NCAA appearance since 2009, as well as its best home record (16-1) in 40 seasons. Carson averaged 18.5 points and 5.1 assists in 2012-13, the first first-year student to do that since Chris McGuthrie of Mount St. Mary's in 1992-93 (19.8/.5.1).
“After discussing all my options with my family, teammates and coaches, I have decided to enter the 2014 NBA Draft,” Carson announced. “My time at ASU has helped me mature as a student, athlete and person and has prepared me to take this next step in my career. I cannot thank Coach Sendek enough for allowing me to be a part of such an incredible Sun Devils community and I look forward to cheering on my teammates and all their future success.”
“Jahii and I discussed their decision to enter the NBA Draft, and while our program will miss him, I know they are ready to start their professional career,” said Sun Devils' head coach Herb Sendek. “Jahii made an incredible impact on our program over the past two seasons and was a huge part of the success we achieved as a team. I know I speak for the entire Sun Devils community when I say we are wishing Jahii and their family all the best in the future.”

Arizona lawmakers this week launched a website to raise $50 million for a fence along the state's Mexican border designed to keep out illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. "Arizona once again has to do the job the federal government isn't," said state Sen. Steve Smith, a first-term Republican who sponsored the legislation. The site, Build the Border Fence, had brought in $80,000 as of Thursday, after just two days. Is this a creative solution to a pressing problem, or a politically charged publicity stunt?
Conservatives are turning Arizona into a laughingstock: What this "nearly bankrupt state" really needs is a creative way to pay for education and health care, says Estelle Gonzales Walgreen at Hispanically Speaking News. What we got instead: More proof that the "prehistoric and insensitive" Republican legislature has its priorities mixed up. Thank goodness there's not a fence around the whole state — "businesses and sane people can continue to flee."
"Pick your poison in Ariz.: Join the border militia or help pay for the fence"
It's Washington's priorities that need straightening out: Arizona lawmakers are just "combating the neglect coming from Washington, D.C.," says J. James Estrada at The American Thinker. Congress and the White House can't be counted on to do the "will of the people" — they just squander resources on things taxpayers don't really want. "Our voluntary targeted donations may have to save the day until help arrives in November 2012."
"Republicans launch website to raise funds for border fence"
This is just a distraction: It's no certainty that the federal government or private landowners would even allow Smith to erect their "Fence of Dreams" on their land, says E.J. Montini at The Arizona Republic. In any case, the fence is really just a diversionary tactic to "get everyone in Arizona fixated again on illegal immigration" so they'll forget about "more recent scandals and screw-ups" that have embarrassed the legislature.
"Will 'Fence of Dreams' protect... politicians"
Tracey Wigginton (born 1965), known as the "Lesbian Vampire Killer", is an Australian murderer who achieved notoriety for killing Edward Baldock in 1989, supposedly to drink their blood. This was described as "one of the most brutal and bizarre crimes Australia has ever seen".[1]
Victim [ edit ]
Edward Baldock (47) was a council worker, and father of four, walking home after drinking with friends.
Murder [ edit ]
Wigginton, who allegedly killed and drank the blood of animals, had been planning for some time to escalate to murdering a man so that they could "feed" on him.[2] On the night of the murder, Wigginton (then aged 24), Lisa Ptaschinski (aged 24) and two other women, Kim Jervis (aged 23) and Tracy Waugh (aged 23), drove up to Baldock in their car, and led them to a park on the banks of the Brisbane River. There, Wigginton stabbed them 27 times, nearly severing their head.[3] A few days after the murder, Wigginton told police that they ‘felt nothing' while stabbing Baldock and that they sat down to smoke a cigarette while they watched them die.[4]
Wigginton was the only one of the four co-accused who pleaded guilty to the charge of murder. Therefore, there was no trial and few details were disclosed to the court as to why this incident occurred by Wigginton; Ptaschinski (her then-girlfriend), Jervis, and Waugh stated that Wigginton had claimed to have vampiric tendencies. They said that the reason for the murder was to enable the drinking of the man's blood.[5]
Verdict [ edit ]
In 1991 the jury convicted Wigginton of murder and they were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Queensland with a minimum of 13 years. Ptaschinski was also convicted of murder, and Jervis of manslaughter. Waugh was cleared.
Aftermath [ edit ]
In 2006 Wigginton assaulted a fellow inmate and a prison guard.[6]
They (Wiggington) made four unsuccessful parole applications until 2011 when the parole board granted their application.[7]
The case still commands strong media interest and public reaction. In April 2008 it has been reported that Lisa Ptaschinski, one of the other killers, would be released from prison after nearly 22 years. Under the resettlement leave program, Ptaschinski would be given a maximum of 12 hours leave every two months for six months.[8] However, it was later reported that the earlier reports of possible release were false.[9]
Wigginton was released from prison on January 11, 2012 after a successful parole bid.[10] This was Wigginton's second parole application.

When I was watching Eagles tape for my Zach Ertz scouting report recently, I checked out Brooks. They had some really good moments, but they frustrated me quite a bit as well. I don't think they do a good job with their hands. Good blockers get their hands on defenders and you know…block them. Brooks used their massive frame to push on defenders more than I like. That can lead to missed blocks.
There is no question that Brooks was very good at times.

The Great Buck Howard is a 2008 American comedy-drama film directed by Sean McGinly that stars Colin Hanks and John Malkovich. Tom Hanks also appears as the father of their real-life son's character. The character Buck Howard is inspired by the mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, whose popularity was at its height in the 1970s. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2008.[3] It is the first Walden Media film to be distributed by Magnolia Pictures.
Plot summary [ edit ]
Troy Gable (Colin Hanks) defies their father (Tom Hanks) and leaves law school to pursue their dream of becoming a writer in Los Angeles. To support himself, they take a job as a road manager for "The Great" Buck Howard (John Malkovich), a fading mentalist. Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as Bakersfield and Akron. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide their fee for that night's performance, which they then unfailingly discovers. (Kreskin is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)[4]
A reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect their career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards them and Troy, with whom they become romantically involved. Buck reveals that their comeback will involve putting "hundreds" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving Jerry Springer. Furious, Buck unfairly blames the mishap on Troy and Valerie, and then faints from exhaustion. In the hospital, Buck and Troy discover that the media absence actually worked in Buck's favor, as rumors reported by the news media exaggerate the scope of Buck's act; as a result, Buck returns to the limelight as a retro-"hip" phenomenon. They appear on television shows such as those of Jon Stewart, Regis Philbin, Conan O'Brien, and more. Buck is reunited with their estranged friend, George Takei, who sings "What the World Needs Now".
Buck finally gets the call they have been waiting for: To perform once again on The Tonight Show. They previously had performed with Johnny Carson 61 times during the height of their career, but never since the show has been hosted by Jay Leno. Buck is bumped by Tom Arnold, who has too much material and uses up Buck's time. Buck refuses an immediate offer to come back and appear on The Tonight Show the following week, but agrees to receive an offer to headline a date in Las Vegas. When the limelight on Buck dims once more after they fail to find their money for the first time ever during their Las Vegas premiere, Troy leaves them and through Valerie's connections, lands a job with a celebrated TV writer (Griffin Dunne). After some time, Troy sees from an ad in the paper that Buck is doing their show again in Bakersfield. Buck is clearly back where they feel most comfortable, and once again successfully performs their signature trick, leaving Troy to wonder whether Buck doesn't have some mysterious talent after all.

Reception [ edit ]
The Great Buck Howard received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of critics gave it positive reviews based on 88 reviews, the consensus being "By turns fluffy and biting, this show biz comedy is given girth by comic heavyweight John Malkovich and made all the more charming by Emily Blunt."[5] The film was released to the general public on March 20, 2009, grossing $115,004 in the opening weekend. It was run in 55 theaters, equaling to an average of $2,091 per theater. The worldwide gross stands at $900,689.[2]
Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has called the PROTECT IP Act "a threat to our economic future and to our international objectives." They characterized its predecessor as a "bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile." The bill would force Domain Name System (DNS) operators to stop correctly resolving the names of so-called "rogues sites."
Is this sort of monkeying with the DNS a problem? Yes, say DNS experts in a new report (PDF) on the practice. In their view, DNS filtering provisions would make the Web less secure—and do little to stop illegal filesharing sites.
DNSSEC is being implemented to allow systems to demand verification of what they get from the DNS. PROTECT IP would not only require DNS responses that cannot deliver such proof, but it would enshrine and institutionalize the very network manipulation DNSSEC must fight...
These rerouting measures "would weaken this important effort to improve Internet security," the paper contends. They would "enshrine and institutionalize the very network manipulation" that DNS security components fight "to prevent cyberattacks and other malevolent behavior on the global Internet, thereby exposing networks and users to increased security and privacy risks." Their widespread use would "threaten the security and stability of the global DNS" and create "significant risk of collateral damage, with filtering of one domain potentially affecting users' ability to reach non-infringing Internet content."
And in the end, they would do little to stop digital piracy. The authors say filters are easily evaded and would be of minimal help when it comes to cutting down on copyright infringement online.
The report is signed by five DNS experts from Shinkuro, Verisign, Georgia Tech, ICANN's Security Council, and the Internet Systems Consortium, and it appeared just before the PROTECT IP ACT was placed on hold in the Senate at Wyden's request.
The authors say that they have no beef with strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, but this kind of IP policing makes them cringe. Here's why.
Such text shall specify
First, a quick primer on DNS. It's the reason why, if you want to visit the United States Senate's website, you can type "senate.gov" rather than its Internet Protocol address: 156.33.195.33. Domain name servers distributed around the world keep track of who has what IP number, aided by millions of recursive servers that make the number-to-name process much faster.
What PROTECT IP would do is authorize the feds to serve a court order on an ISP, demanding that it take action against a US based website accused of engaging in intellectual property theft. Specifically, the ISP would be required "to prevent the domain name described in the order from resolving to that domain name's Internet protocol address"—in other words, filtering or rerouting it elsewhere.
Wherever users would wind up, elsewhere-wise, they'd see a government announcement explaining the move. "Such text shall specify that the action is being taken pursuant to a court order obtained by the Attorney General," the bill says.
What these security folks especially don't like about this DNS redirection business is that it will mess with an up-and-coming extension for the system, called DNSSEC, which encrypts DNS records, making them more secure. DNSSEC's main objective is to protect consumers and sites from so-called "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks, in which a miscreant intercepts a digital conversation, and, pretending to be a trusted source, fleeces the user of their security data.
Ironically, PROTECT IP bears strong resemblance to such a hack, except that it is authorized by the government, the experts note.
"DNSSEC is being implemented to allow systems to demand verification of what they get from the DNS," they write. "PROTECT IP would not only require DNS responses that cannot deliver such proof, but it would enshrine and institutionalize the very network manipulation DNSSEC must fight in order to prevent cyberattacks and other miscreant behavior on the global Internet."
One Clue To Romney's Veep Pick: Whose Wiki Page Is Getting The Most Edits?
Tech President reminds us that one way to possibly figure out who will be a vice presidential pick is to watch the various contenders' Wikipedia pages in the days before such an announcement is likely.
In 2008, as The Washington Post wrote at the time, "just hours before [Sen. John] McCain declared their veep choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, their Wiki page saw a flurry of activity, with editors adding details about their approval rating and husband's employment. ... Palin's entry was updated at least 68 times, with at least an additional 54 changes made to their entry over the preceding five days."
Meanwhile, the Post said, "on Aug. 22, the day before the Obama campaign officially named [then-Sen. Joe] Biden as the veep pick, Biden's Wiki page garnered roughly 40 changes. Over the five days prior, users would make at least 111 other changes to their entry."
The obvious — in hindsight — implications of the Wiki activity: Aides were going into the entries to tune them up and clean out any material that was either embarrassing or erroneous.
So what's going on now with some of those said to be among the leading possibilities to be joining Mitt Romney on the Republican ticket?
-- Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's Wiki page has been revised 16 times so far today, by someone called "River8009."
-- Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's Wiki page has been revised nine times so far today and 11 times from Aug. 2-6.
-- Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty's Wiki page has been tweaked four times today.
-- Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan's Wiki page has been edited once today, and 11 times from Aug. 2-6.
-- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's Wiki page hasn't been edited today, but was revised eight times from Aug. 3-4.
-- New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte's Wiki page has not been touched today. It was last revised on July 28.
-- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's Wiki page hasn't been revised since July 24.
Of course, somebody who knows about the 2008 Wiki tea leaves may just be messing with our minds.
And, as Tech President also noted, in 2004 it was "an obscure aviation website" that noticed a John Kerry campaign plane had been repainted to include the name Edwards. And that's how word that then-Sen. John Edwards would be the Democratic vice presidential pick first broke.

Update at 7:45 a.m. ET, Aug. 8. Lots More Action To Report.
Could it be that reports by outlets such as The Two-Way have sparked some mischief?
Portman's page has already been touched 13 times today. On Tuesday, it ended up being changed 98 times.
Rubio's page has been busy too — 22 changes so far today and a total of 28 on Tuesday.
There have been 14 changes to Pawlenty's page as of this hour today, and there were five on Tuesday.
Ryan's page has been busy too — 39 changes so far today and a total of nine on Tuesday.
There have been 10 changes to Jindal's page so far today. On Tuesday there ended up being five.
Someone's been tweaking Ayotte's page. There have been three changes so far today.
And Christie's page has suddenly gotten a fair amount of attention. There were two tweaks on Tuesday and so far today there have been 40 edits.

David Cameron's hopes of getting a reform deal on Friday look in doubt as haggling continues at the EU summit.
Leaders have finally sat down together for dinner after several member states opposed plans to curb migrant benefits and change EU regulations.
The prime minster had planned to return to the UK to fire the starting gun on an EU referendum campaign on Friday.
The BBC understands Justice Secretary Michael Gove will campaign in the referendum for Britain to leave the EU.
'English breakfast'
Mr Cameron sounded cautiously optimistic about their prospects of a deal on Friday morning, saying there had been "some progress" in marathon all-night talks, which broke up at 05:30 GMT.
But stumbling blocks still remain after a day of one-to-one meetings and there is speculation talks will continue into Saturday.
The original aim had been to conclude the deal at an "English breakfast" meeting on Friday, which became an "English brunch", then an "English lunch" and eventually an "English dinner".
Mr Cameron's plan had been to head back to London, with a deal in their pocket, for an emergency cabinet meeting at which they would commit the government to campaign for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. That would trigger the start of the referendum campaign and allow ministers who want Britain to leave the EU to speak out.
But Mr Cameron has now said there will not be a cabinet meeting on Friday although they added "one will be held if and when a deal is done".
Downing Street had said the prime minister was "likely to have a number of further bilaterals including with the Danish PM, the Czech PM and the Dutch PM" before dinner.
A senior EU official said summit host Donald Tusk, the European Council president, believed there was a "chance" of a deal over dinner but many issues remained to be resolved.
The BBC's Europe correspondent Chris Morris said there was confidence "in the background" that a deal could be done on Friday or Saturday. EU leaders did not want to leave Brussels without a deal and face having to return for another summit, they added.

There are signs that some of the stark differences expressed on Thursday, at the start of the two-day summit, are starting to narrow.
Poland's Europe minister Konrad Szymanski said a deal was "close", telling reporters: "We managed to have a compromise on many, many issues... but we still need more clarification, more guarantees to get the compromise which would be satisfactory for both sides. There's still some way to go, we need some hours."
Poland is among four Central European countries resisting a British demand for an "emergency brake" on in-work benefits for migrant workers to be in place for as long as 13 years.
France and Austria both voiced concern that Mr Cameron's demand for safeguards for non-eurozone countries, aimed at protecting the City of London from new financial regulations, might impede the development of the single currency.
President Francois Hollande said France wanted "a financial regulation system which is valid in all parts of Europe" with no "right of veto" for individual countries.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said the UK must not be allowed to exercise "a blockade against genuine banking union or other deepening of the eurozone".
One UK official said: "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed... what matters is that we get the right deal, it doesn't matter how long it takes."
An EU source spoke of five key areas where talks were ongoing:
How the EU's binding treaties will be altered to make the changes
How many member states can trigger an "emergency brake" on migrant welfare
For how long a member state can impose restrictions on in-work benefits for migrants
Whether child benefit curbs can be applied retrospectively
Changing treaties to alter the principle of "ever closer" union.
Mr Cameron is thought to have rejected calls from the Central European nations, represented in the overnight talks by Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, for cuts in child benefit for offspring living overseas to be imposed only on new migrants.
Belgium - backed by France - proposed that the summit conclusions should state that any deal agreed this week is final and the EU will not make an improved offer if Britain votes to leave.
The move is designed to kill off the idea, backed by some Eurosceptics, that a Leave vote would give the UK leverage to extract further concessions from the EU before a second poll.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said they expected Mr Cameron to come back with a deal from Brussels, as the other leaders would recognise how "embarrassing" it would be for them to return empty-handed.
But they added: "He hasn't asked for us to get back supremacy for our Parliament, they haven't asked for us to control our own borders, they haven't asked to reduce the vast daily fees we pay.
"We will be allowed - after they have come here like Oliver Twist and begged for concessions - to control migrant benefits for up to four years. I find the whole thing as a British person pretty shameful."
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said their party would be campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU - but they branded David Cameron's renegotiations "a theatrical sideshow, designed to appease their opponents within the Conservative Party".

What happens next?
Friday:
If David Cameron gets a deal, they will return to the UK and hold an emergency cabinet meeting - possibly on Saturday - to reach an agreed position on remaining in the EU. At this point, ministers who want Britain out of the EU will be allowed to speak out.
Mr Cameron may then announce the date of the UK's referendum, although they do not have to do so
Thursday 23 June:
Still seen as the most likely date of a UK referendum if Mr Cameron gets a deal in February (or the March EU summit) but they have until the end of 2017 to hold one.

As a place to shop, it was years ahead of its time.
In the capital, there really was nowhere quite like Goldbergs.
The funfair roundabout inside Goldbergs department store in Edinburgh, November 1968.
Abraham Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant hailing from Eastern Europe, opened the first store in Glasgow in 1908, kicking off a business empire that would go on to boast more than 100 outlets the length and breadth of Scotland.
The purpose-built Edinburgh store was completed in the summer of 1960, standing prominently in the heart of Tollcross opposite the district's famous clock.
It was quite unlike anything else which had gone before.
The Edinburgh Goldbergs' lofty, plinth-like frontage, dressed in distinctive pale yellow stone with huge glass windows, was a world apart from the stuffy Victorian-Edwardian department stores of yesteryear.
Aerial of the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, showing Goldbergs (centre) in May 1976.
It must have seemed as if a spaceship had landed among the soot-ridden tenements of Tollcross.
Inside, Goldbergs was an airy palace of automatic doors, escalators and Mediterranean whitewashed walls.
Customers marvelled at its fancy decors and tremendous window displays, and a funfair, a creche, and an aviary filled with exotic birds kept the kids well-entertained.
To cap it all off, the Goldbergs roof garden boasted some of the finest views of Edinburgh Castle to be had from anywhere in the city.
Goldbergs was initially closed on a Saturday and open on a Sunday so that the owner could observe the Jewish Sabbath. The rather curious opening days eventually changed after Abraham Goldberg's passing.
It is worth noting that the owners' religious leanings did not prevent Goldbergs from putting on a dazzling display for Christmas. December is when the store came alive.
Later on, the store developed its own unique loyalty scheme and even had its own fashion brand, Wrygges, both of which proved to be extremely popular.
The catalyst for the Edinburgh store and expansion into a Scotland-wide chain was the handing-over of the business from father to sons, Ephraim and Michael.
Despite a strong economic performance in its first two decades, the opening of both the St. James and Waverley Shopping Centres, in 1973 and 1985 respectively, hit the Edinburgh Goldbergs hard.
The department store had been intended as the showpiece in a new busy interchange at Tollcross, but the new roads never passed the drawing board and the store failed to attract the kind of footfall it had been built for.
Goldbergs ceased trading in 1990 with demolition of the store taking place six years later. Apartments have since been built on the site.
Since its closure, the much-lamented shoppers' paradise secured an almost mythical presence within the collective memory of just about every Edinburgh resident over the age of 30. There can be few structures dating from the 60s which are recalled so fondly.

Microsoft is planning to build a HomeHub feature into future Windows 10 updates to better compete against devices like Google Home and Amazon's Echo. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that the feature is currently in the planning stages, and the software maker is expected to introduce a “HomeHub” in updates due in 2017 and 2018, and not the upcoming Creators Update.
Windows Central reports that the feature will “crush” Google Home and Amazon Echo, but The Verge understands that HomeHub is designed to be a service and feature that will run on any Windows 10 PC and turn it into a machine where Cortana can be summoned from the lockscreen to provide useful information. Windows Central previously reported that the HomeHub was a voice-activated speaker that was supposed to be unveiled at Microsoft's Surface hardware event back in October. Those reports were inaccurate, but Microsoft is planning a software feature with the same name.
The primary focus for HomeHub is to create a family environment for a PC. Microsoft has tried a variety of different methods to enable family accounts, privacy controls, and app sharing over the years, but HomeHub is part of a new Family team in the Windows group at Microsoft, sources tell us. Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet reports that Microsoft has been hiring people into this team, with a focus on a family environment for Windows.
Windows Central has obtained some concept plans for HomeHub, including the ability to share appointments, apps, and other data on a PC without it being logged into an account. This would allow a PC to be used like a Google Home or Amazon Echo, for queries via Cortana and for simple access to apps. Microsoft is experimenting with the idea of a Welcome Screen, with a fullscreen interface that will display items as if they're a virtual fridge door for families. This type of software could enable third-party PC makers to create more kitchen-like devices to compete with Amazon's Echo.
Microsoft is planning to enable Cortana to be the center of its HomeHub initiative, and the integration will allow the assistant to provide HomeHub-like features across iOS and Android. This will include extending the assistant to control smart devices and manage them from the Windows 10 HomeHub feature. Microsoft's HomeHub plans are currently in the planning phases, so many features will likely change and the interface itself could be entirely cut out of future Windows 10 updates. Microsoft has largely been left out of the emergence of the smart home, despite having Cortana running on the Xbox One. The HomeHub is Microsoft's bet to try and control the ecosystem before Amazon, Google, or even Apple provides the best framework to manage devices in your home.

As the worst Ebola outbreak in history unfolds in West Africa, The Post's Joel Achenbach explains how the deadly virus wreaks havoc on the human body. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)
As the worst Ebola outbreak in history unfolds in West Africa, The Post's Joel Achenbach explains how the deadly virus wreaks havoc on the human body. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)
The Ebola virus sweeping through West Africa has mutated repeatedly during the current outbreak, a fact that could hinder diagnosis and treatment of the devastating disease, according to scientists who have genetically sequenced the virus in scores of victims.
The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, also offer new insights into the origins of the largest and most deadly Ebola outbreak in history, which has killed more than 1,500 people in four countries and shows few signs of slowing. It also provided another reminder of the deep toll the outbreak has taken on health workers and others in the affected areas, as five of the paper's more than 50 co-authors died from Ebola before publication.
In a collaboration led by scientists at Harvard University and aided by officials at Sierra Leone's health ministry, researchers sequenced Ebola virus genomes from 78 patients beginning in the early days of the outbreak this spring. Those 99 samples — some patients were tested more than once — suggested that the outbreak began with a single human infection before spreading rapidly, like a spark that grows into a wildfire.
Ebola's arrival in Sierra Leone in May started with a funeral, according to Thursday's findings. A young pregnant woman tested positive for the virus and was treated at Kenema Government Hospital. Health workers who traced their contacts discovered that they and more than a dozen other women recently had attended the burial of a traditional healer who had been treating Ebola patients near the Sierra Leone-Guinea border. All of them had been infected.
“They realized they were not an isolated case,” said Pardis Sabeti, an associate professor at Harvard whose lab sequenced the Ebola genomes and quickly made public the data earlier this summer.
The genomic sequencing also offers hints as to how the Ebola “Zaire” strain at the heart of the current outbreak — one of five types of Ebola virus known to infect humans — likely ended up in West Africa in the first place. Researchers said the data suggests that the virus spread from an animal host, possibly bats, and that diverged around 2004 from an Ebola strain in central Africa, where previous outbreaks have occurred.
“We don't actually know where the virus has been since then,” said Sabeti, referring to the time between 2004 and when the virus resurfaced earlier this year. “We're trying to piece together an historical record.”
Thursday's study also details hundreds of genetic mutations that make the current Ebola outbreak different from any in the past. Some of those changes have the potential to affect the accuracy of diagnostic tests or the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments under development for the disease.
“We've uncovered more than 300 genetic clues about what sets this outbreak apart from previous outbreaks,” Stephen Gire, one of the study's co-authors and an infectious disease researcher at Harvard, said in an announcement about the findings. “Although we don't know whether these differences are related to the severity of the current outbreak, by sharing these data with the research community, we hope to speed up our understanding of this epidemic and support global efforts to contain it.”
Sabeti said researchers are expecting to receive additional Ebola samples soon from Nigeria. They plan to sequence those, as well, and release the data as soon as possible.
“The fact that we can do this in real time while the outbreak is still going is breathtaking,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said of the group's rapid genomic sequencing of the virus, which they said could have taken two years or longer in the past. “We didn't have this technology years ago. What they did was really extraordinary.”
Fauci said Thursday's findings also underscore the necessity to get the outbreak under control before the Ebola virus continues to morph.

“We're left with a situation where if, in fact, this thing smolders on and on, we know mutations will accumulate,” they said. “And that has its own set of problems. We've really got to get this thing shut off.”
Sabeti said they that since they and their colleagues published the sequencing data, they have heard from companies working on vaccines and treatments, as well as by researchers developing new diagnostic tests, who want to understand how the mutations could affect those efforts. Only through such collaboration, they said, can scientists tackle the current outbreak with the speed it deserves.
“There's nothing you should crowdsource more than an epidemic. It has this urgency where we need every person working on it,” Sabeti said. “It took a village to make this paper happen. It will take a planet to help get this virus under control.”
Adam Lallana‘s debut was delayed by injury, but the 26-year-old is showing signs that they will become a key player, according to Henry Jackson.
Liverpool's summer of transfer activity was extremely busy and productive, but by the time the new season started the man that had almost been forgotten about was the player the club had the spent the most money on.
Adam Lallana completed their move to Anfield in July for a reported £25m, after a superb season at Southampton which saw them nominated for the prestigious PFA Player of the Year award. Many detractors felt the fee was too much, and a knee injury picked up in pre-season seemed to put the 26-year-old at the back of the agenda.
They finally made their debut for the club against Aston Villa earlier this month, but their display was understandably rusty having not kicked a ball in anger since England's doomed World Cup campaign in Brazil – injured in pre-season on their second day with at the club.
Against Ludogorets the following week, in what was their Champions League debut, Lallana seemed to be slowly getting into their rhythm in the second-half, only for Brendan Rodgers to, perhaps incorrectly, substitute them with a quarter of the game remaining. In what was a fairly lifeless display by the Reds, the creative midfielder was one of the few players who looked capable to producing something out of nothing.
The former Southampton man was then left out of Liverpool's starting eleven for the trip to West Ham last Saturday, as Rodgers opted for the more defence-minded Lucas Leiva in their preferred 4-4-2 diamond formation.
A poor first-half display by the Reds led to the anonymous Brazilian being replaced by Lallana at half-time, and they were comfortably one of their side's best players when they came on. They ran with the ball, showed some nice trickery and generally looked a class act. It wasn't necessarily an outstanding performance, but it was clear that there is an abundance of natural talent at their disposal.
Despite the hugely disappointing 3-1 loss, Lallana could walk off the pitch with their head held high. Rickie Lambert, who was also with them at Southampton for several years, spoke of their admiration for the 26-year-old to Liverpool's official website on Monday:
“He's going to bring a whole new dimension to the team. They were unlucky to get injured at a vital time in pre-season. No player likes to get injured at that time. He's come back and he's looking strong. He's only going to get stronger.
“He's missed out on a few weeks, and there's nothing they can do about that. But their attitude has been first-class in training. He's been desperate to get back.
“That extra strength and that extra speed will come back over the next few weeks and you will be seeing the best of Adam Lallana, without a doubt.”
Lambert's words came to fruition on Tuesday evening, as Lallana's Liverpool career took another positive step. They were voted Man of the Match following an excellent performance against Middlesbrough, on another nervy night at Anfield.
http://youtu.be/3CaVF2wqQsw
The England international was the creative hub of the side throughout, showing some clever touches, good movement and an audacious piece of trickery in the lead-up to Suso's goal. They also converted twice in the epic penalty shootout victory to round off a very fine display.
With four games now under their belt, Lallana is returning to something close to full fitness, and must be in line to start against Everton in Saturday's much-anticipated Merseyside derby at Anfield.
With Philippe Coutinho out of favour after a poor start to the campaign, Lucas easily past their best and Joe Allen and Emre Can both unavailable through injury, they will likely play on the left-hand side of the midfield diamond.
There would be no better way to announce themselves to the Anfield faithful than to score the winner against their local rivals, and it would another confidence boost as they try to win over those who feel they have cost the club too much.
There haven't been many positives to shout about so far this for Liverpool, with three defeats in their opening five Premier Leagues, but the ever-improving Adam Lallana is most certainly one of them.
They still have some way to go before they get back to the form that earned them the move in the first place, but the Reds have a real gem on their hands. They will prove those detractors wrong.
Organizational psychologist Billie Blair
IT managers and their staffs are different from the rest of us.
They view the world in terms of "us against them" and see others in an organization as pests or threats to their IT universe, says Billie Blair, who holds a doctorate in organizational psychology and heads Change Strategist Inc., a Los Angeles-based management consulting firm.
Organizational psychologists have an understanding of management and psychology. They use that knowledge to help firms and organizations understand behaviors that can impinge on the ability to implement required changes, said Blair.
Blair also has the perspective of having once overseen an IT department as a former dean of the College of Psychology and Human Services at California State University.
Blair looks at the performance of an entire organization, including IT, and draws observations from that work.
[ Find your 2017 salary info and our detailed report at IT Salary Watch ]
IT managers see themselves as "reigning supreme," says Blair, but they are also capable of having a dramatic impact. In an interview with Computerworld, they outline various personnel and organizational issues facing IT executives.
Are IT managers different from other managers in an organization? IT managers are different than managers in the other parts of the organization, for the most part. They tend to adopt a persona of aloofness. They are different from the operations and sales folks. They feel themselves to be odd men out to start with, and they are. They perform a specific service that the organization can't do without.
What makes IT managers different? Is it the type of job or the characteristics of the people it attracts? It is a little bit of both. It is the type of job, and clearly people choose their professions based on their proclivities, interests and natural inclinations. It's the same thing with CFOs, or people in the financial accounting arena. In IT's case, it is a love of things technical and they are typically very good at it. Mostly, in these days, people in those positions have been told since childhood that they were gifted in all things technical. They feel very comfortable in what they do. They have chosen their job because they like it a lot. I would tend to say that they love it. Technical jobs are an engagement with things rather than people, for the most part, and it's that engagement with things which is what got them to the management level. Now, as managers, they have to deal in a whole new arena. With IT managers, within their group, their cadre of other IT folks, it's pretty much an 'us versus them' approach. We are the gurus and the knowledgeable people and those other people are the ones that are always making demands and keeping us from doing our real jobs.
Do IT managers feel under siege? There are always demands. It's sort of useful to look at the IT manager in the university setting. In the university, they are aloof because they know their area. But in the university setting there are lots of people that enter into that category, but still IT folks maintain a persona of aloofness. This is in a setting where everybody is a specialist and everybody has that giant ego. For the most part, they (IT professionals) get away with it. This sounds like I don't like IT people - I actually really do and certainly respect their knowledge and ability. But it's their attitude that gets them in trouble in organizational settings. It is (an attitude) that they know it all, and that everybody else is a fool, and all that everybody else does is just mess up their systems.
Do IT professionals have a problem explaining what it is that they bring to the business? For the most part, they don't try to explain very much. That's part of their problem. They just want people to bow to them as they come into the room. They are not talented in dealing with people. They don't understand that in doing that they are generally being very off-putting to the person they are dealing with. It's a matter of learning how to be part of an organization. Every time they are dealing with the rest of us they have very little patience.
Outside of the IT department, how are IT managers and their departments perceived? They are seen as difficult to get along with. The phrase you will hear most often is 'difficult to get anything out of' and that means, typically, services.
It sounds as if a lot of people try to avoid IT departments. True? Yes. They would if they could. That's absolutely correct.
Welcome to the inaugural episode of our new Let's Play series! I'm diving into the end-all-be-all of roguelikes, a game you may have heard of but probably haven't played. NetHack has been around since 1987 as a descendant of Rogue, which a few games have taken inspiration from since then. But where Rogue was a simple game that was expanded on in Hack and NetHack, NetHack hasn't spawned its own sequel: it's simply grown and grown and grown in complexity for nearly 30 years.
Well, except for the ASCII graphics. Those are still pretty simple.
The same way I took on Dwarf Fortress, I decided I wanted to learn the ropes of NetHack with an experienced player at my side. My friend Jeremy Nissen, who has completed many NetHack runs, joins me for this series to impart wisdom, explain NetHack's intricacies, and let me get my self killed on more than one occasion.
Look for new episodes every Wednesday!
In this episode: An introduction to NetHack. What it is, and how to take your first steps into this scary ASCII world.
THE driver of a truck involved in Saturday's horrific collision with a train in Dandenong appears to have smashed straight through level crossing boom gates, the state's top transport safety official says.
The 69-year-old truck driver from Narre Warren North, whom police have not named, went through the crossing in Abbotts Road about noon on Saturday. They walked away unhurt, but the crash left a 43-year-old Cranbourne man on board the train dead - the first death of a passenger on Melbourne's electrified rail system in decades.
The train driver, Trevor King, survived the collision, but remains in The Alfred hospital, having sustained extensive injuries, including several broken ribs. Mr King, 30, also received serious head injuries that have led doctors to place them in an induced coma.
Mr King's wife is also a driver for Metro but is on maternity leave, and their brother is a Metro driver as well.

Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani's reference to goddess Durga and demon Mahisasur were expunged from the Rajya Sabha records on Friday following instructions of Chairman M. Hamid Ansari, an official statement said.
The minister, in their reply to a debate on the recent incidents at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad University, referred to commemoration of Mahisasur's death at the JNU, and read out from a pamphlet which they said was authenticated by the university.
The opposition members created an uproar, with Congress leader Anand Sharma saying it would set a bad precedence of insult of gods and prophets.
The issue was raised in the upper house again on Friday, as opposition members sought an apology from Irani over their remarks.
Irani did not offer an apology, but said they themselves worship goddess Durga and that the reference was made merely to prove a point.
"I myself am a practising Hindu and a Durga worshipper. The documents I read (from) yesterday (Thursday) are official documents from the university... these are not documents of the government," Irani said on Friday.

It will come as a great relief to Hillary Clinton's supporters that Bernie Sanders is telegraphing an uneventful end to a campaign they once promised to take all the way to the Democratic Convention. After meeting with President Obama on Thursday, they dialed back that promise substantially, and announced they would meet with Clinton in the coming days “to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump.” Presumably they will not be asking them to be their running mate—and presumably, challenging their nomination at the convention doesn't count as working together to defeat Trump.
So in an arithmetic if not exactly explicit sense, he's promising to suspend their campaign and endorse them sometime before the end of July.
On the surface, Democrats are eager to turn the page on the primary because they want to run against Trump with a unified party. But at a deeper level, their impatience reflects their anxiety about Clinton's difficulty appealing to young voters.
Even in their home state of New York, which gave them a sizable and crucial primary victory in April, Sanders won among voters under 30 by a 30-point margin. Somewhere around a quarter of Sanders's voters say they will never vote for Clinton. If the #NeverHillary contingent of Sanders's base resembles their base more generally, then these #NeverHillary voters are disproportionately young. Combine that with the fact that young people are famously unreliable voters, and it follows logically that Democrats are concerned that getting out the youth vote in November is going to be very difficult—that unifying the party will be harder for Clinton than it was for Barack Obama eight years ago.
Popular discourse on the topic of private equity (PE) exits in India has always been confusing. Headlines like “Investors cheer: Private equity exits hit all-time high in 2015” and, the more sobering “PE exits near four-year lows” have appeared within weeks of each other.
For years, private equity professionals in India sought to establish credibility with “How much money we put to work.” In recent times, the narrative shifted to, “How much of the fund we returned to investors.” The journey between the two statements tells the story of a maturing industry urgently developing its approach to exits in a large and volatile emerging market.
Solid data from exits over the past decade provides a more accurate picture.
The PE exit record in India is among the primary concerns, for both limited and general partners.
The long view: between 2000 and 2013, of the $94 billion invested, $24 billion (on a cost-basis) exited at a value of $43.5 billion, or a 1.8 return multiple. Of the $70 billion that remains invested, as much as $33 billion was invested between 2000 and 2008. The number could be lowed, since it is difficult to know how much is written down.
More recently, between 2005 and 2011, private equity invested $69 billion, of which $18 billion exited at a value of $31 billion, or a 1.7 return multiple.

Here are some of the questions we're often asked.
Is the exit record improving?
The good news is that returns are indeed improving. Exit multiples are on the rise: from 1.6-1.7 times in 2013-14 to 2.1 times in 2015-16. We see a corresponding improvement in IRRs (internal rates of return). Gross returns at exit have risen to 18% in the first quarter of 2016, from 9% in 2014 (and 14% in 2015).
However, the pace of exits remains stubbornly consistent. For the 12 quarters from 2012 to 2014, an average of $730 million (at cost) exited per quarter. For the five quarters from 2015 to the first quarter of 2016, that number stood at $620 million—slightly lower than the average in the earlier years.
In short, the exit record for recent vintages investments is improving while earlier vintages remain stubbornly stuck.
Is there a pattern to successful exits?
Our analyses of exits reveal some compelling themes. PE firms that initiated strategic and operational improvement programs in their investee companies within the first 12 months were more likely to exit. Early improvements allowed funds to exit as soon as opportunities presented themselves. As returns improved between 2013 and 2015, we saw average exit periods correspondingly reduce from 5.9 years to 4.4 years.
In general, the shorter the holding period, the better the returns.
Is there genuine outperformance prior to exit?
We measured the performance of PE portfolio companies relative to non-PE-backed peers (adjusted for size and sector). Our analysis shows clear outperformance, both in revenue and earnings growth. Equally important, we can attribute much of this improvement to specific actions taken by new investors, promoters, board, and management.
On an average, improvements in margin are easier to sustain compared to revenue. However, there is an important flipside—gains are highest in the first few years, and diminish over five years.
How have exits fared across sectors?
We analyzed 880 exits across 11 sectors. Unsurprisingly, the exit and return record varies significantly, depending on the sector. If we apply a simple bar and choose sectors that returned at least one-third of the capital invested, at an IRR higher than 14%, three sectors meet the bar: IT/BPO services, financial services, and healthcare.
While engineering & construction, consumer goods, and machinery & industrial goods meet the 14%-returns hurdle, less than a third of the deals by value have exited these businesses. On the other hand, telecommunications and transportation & logistics exited more than a third of the capital invested, but did not meet the 14%-return hurdle.
On balance, sectors that offer natural liquidity by virtue of their profitability or ability to raise cash, are less susceptible to having exits and/or returns impacted by volatility.

Deepening social inequality and poverty in New Zealand
By John Braddock
25 October 2012
Two reports published in New Zealand last month showed that the gap between rich and poor widened in 2010-11, taking inequality to its highest-ever level. Middle and lower paid workers saw their incomes fall sharply, while those of the rich increased. Child poverty, which under both National and Labour-led governments has more than doubled since 1985, remains entrenched at 25 percent.
The Ministry of Social Development's (MSD) Household Incomes Report revealed a fall in average take-home pay for the first time since the early 1990s. It recorded a drop in real household incomes of 2.7 percent between 2010 and 2011 at the median, or midpoint, of the distribution.
The report highlights the sea-change underway in the lives of working people under the global economic crisis. In just one year, the incomes of households at the 30th percentile, that is three-tenths from the bottom, fell by as much as 5.5 percent. From 2010 to 2011, the Gini coefficient—a common measure of social inequality—reached its highest level in 30 years.
New Zealand has no official measure of poverty or material hardship. The MSD report used indices related to median household income that are recognised internationally. According to this data, an average of 15 percent of the population lived in poverty at any given time in 2010-11. The proportion of households with a single person of working-age in poverty trebled from 10 to 30 percent for the period from the 1980s to 2007, and accelerated again in 2011 to 35 percent. Two out of five poor children came from families with at least one adult in full-time work—evidence of the deteriorating situation facing the “working poor.”
For a quarter of the population, housing costs swallow up more than 30 percent of their income, compared with one in five in the mid-1990s and one in ten in the 1980s. After mortgage and debt repayments, real household disposable income fell even further in 2010-11. The drop was 4 percent at the median, while for three of the lowest four deciles the fall was more than 7 percent. The disposable incomes of the bottom 30 percent of the population were on average only slightly better in real terms than 30 years ago. By contrast, a household in the top decile, i.e., the wealthiest ten percent of society, boosted their incomes by 40 percent over the same period.
A second report by an Expert Advisory Group convened by the Children's Commissioner found that approximately 25 percent of children, or 270,000, live in poverty. Many of these experience “significant material deprivation” and many remain poor for long periods of time.
While poverty rates among children remained relatively static between 2009 and 2011, there was a rise in the proportion experiencing “measurable hardship”, from 15 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2011. Many households with incomes above the official poverty line have been plunged into hardship through increasing housing costs, forcing them to cut back on food, clothing, transport, medical care and education. Half of all poor children are either Maori or Polynesian, who are among the most oppressed layers of the working class.
The reports have triggered public concern, prompting the main opposition parties, Labour and the Greens, to opportunistically advocate for free school meals for students in schools in economically oppressed areas. TV3's “Campbell Live” program turned a week of prime-time shows over to the issue, culminating in a fund-raising drive for the KidsCan charity. Two public meetings convened by a Wellington journalist, purporting to advance solutions to poverty, attracted several hundred people.
None of the limited measures advocated in any way address the root causes, in the profit system itself, of the rapid social reversal confronting working people. Rather, the proposals are designed to contain growing social tensions within the existing parliamentary set-up, major political parties and the trade unions.
Labour Party and Greens posturing over child poverty is particularly hypocritical. When Labour held office between 1999 and 2008 with the support of the Greens, it presided over worsening social inequality. It refused to raise unemployment benefits, which had already been savagely cut by National in the early 1990s. Now the Labour Party has ruled out reversing other regressive National government policies, such as the increase in the Goods and Services Tax.
The government has made it clear that the austerity measures demanded by the corporate elite will be stepped up. Prime Minister John Key scathingly dismissed as “dopey” a recommendation from the Children's Commissioner's panel to reinstitute the universal child benefit, which was once paid to all parents of children under the age of 6, but abolished in 1991.
The government is initiating a series of harsh “welfare reforms” to cut expenditure by $1 billion over four years. Around 125,000 parents on welfare benefits, who support more than 220,000 children, will be subject to a raft of punitive “social obligations” to qualify for payments. They face losing 50 percent of their benefit if they fail to meet “work obligations”, such as attending job interviews.
Sole mothers are required to be available for work. Under a “one strike” rule, anyone who turns down any offer of “suitable employment” will have their benefit cancelled and will be barred for 13 weeks from applying to get it back.
Nelson Civics Education Action Group initiator Sharyn Black told the World Socialist Web Site that the government is getting tens of thousands of women “work ready” by ordering them to find 15 hours' work per week, in order to drop them off the benefit. Middle-aged beneficiaries are being forced into dubious intensive training courses, in industries like hospitality.
Savings limits are being imposed to restrict applications for Accommodation Support. According to Black, “WINZ [Work and Income New Zealand] says if you can afford to save you shouldn't be on a benefit.” Black also pointed to changes to the Local Government Act which will remove from local councils the power to fund measures intended to support the “social or economic wellbeing” of residents.
It was a glorious thing when Intel released its Gulftown-based Core i7-980X in early 2010. It was the first desktop CPU out of the company that featured six cores, and it felt like a relative boon to those, like me, who run virtual machines, encode video, compile software, and more. In the end, I was left seriously impressed with that chip.
At that time, I naively believed that an eight-core was in our near-future. In fact, I outright expected Sandy Bridge, which released in late 2011, to have an eight-core model. It didn't. I didn't let anything dampen my spirits though, as at the end of my look at the Core i7-3960X, I said something to the effect of, “I can't imagine that eight-core models will not be released within the next six months or so.”
I'm not sure what got that into my head. A staggering 1,020 days have passed since the 3960X's announcement, and we finally have an eight-core chip at our disposal. Admittedly, I wasn't exactly enthralled by what the Core i7-4960X brought to the table, but with eight cores, I think the i7-5960X has a great chance at having a different conclusion.
Welcome to Haswell-E:
That's a chip that means business. All Haswell-E processors are built on a 22nm process, but the eight-core of course tops the transistor count charts, with 2.6 billion – 800 million more than the Core i7-4960X. As expected, these transistors are built using Intel's much-touted Tri-Gate 3D design.
Like Sandy Bridge-E and Ivy Bridge-E, Haswell-E has 2011 contact points on its belly, but its processors will only support the latest socket revision, called LGA2011-3. At the moment, those are only going to be found on motherboards featuring Intel's X99 chipset.
In regards to the function layout, nothing has really changed between Ivy Bridge-E and Haswell-E, and that's because the design isn't broken. All of the cores still sandwich the cache, and other key functions are found at the top and bottom.
The X99 chipset is Intel's first desktop offering from Intel (or AMD, for that matter) to support DDR4 memory, and somewhat humorously, it officially supports very modest 2133MHz speeds. Chances are good that if you buy into this platform, you'll be winding up with memory faster – or perhaps much faster – than this.
One important thing to note about this block diagram is the mention of “up to” 40 PCIe lanes. Last-gen, that didn't matter too much, but this gen, it does. Intel's decided to separate its smallest LGA2011-3 chip, the i7-5820K, further from the others by limiting its PCIe lanes to 28. Both the i7-5960X and i7-5930K have the expected 40, so for those who are building the highest-end gaming PCs possible, the i7-5820K may not be an ideal choice.
Intel's sticking to the “3 model” scheme it started with Sandy Bridge-E for this launch, with the bottom CPU set to sell for $389 in quantities of 1,000. That should result in prices at etail of about $420 or so. The middle model bumps the price to $583, which nets you slightly faster stock speeds, as well as the full 40 PCIe lanes. The big gun is the i7-5960X, Intel's debut eight-core. As is tradition for Intel's top-end parts, this chip is priced at $999.
Core Threads Clock Turbo Cache PCIe Lanes TDP $/1,000 Core i7-5960X 8 16 3.0GHz 3.5GHz 20MB 40 140W $999 Core i7-5930K 6 12 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 15MB 40 140W $583 Core i7-5820K 6 12 3.3GHz 3.6GHz 15MB 28 140W $389 Core i5-4790K 4 8 4.0GHz 4.4GHz 8MB 16 88W $339 Core i7-4690K 4 4 3.5GHz 3.9GHz 6MB 16 88W $242
Intel's Core i7-5820K, despite its fewer PCIe lanes, is quite an attractive chip compared to the i7-4790K. It has a much slower clock, but it has 50% more cores, and far more L3 cache. For the most part, it's similar to last-gen's i7-4930K. That chip was 100MHz more at stock, and 200MHz more at Turbo, but had 3MB less L3 cache and cost $200 more.
As for the other two models, there's quite a bit to talk about. For starters, the i7-5960X has a glaring flaw: Its stock speed is 3.0GHz. I don't recall the last time any Intel enthusiast chip had dipped that low, and it's hard to see that spec next to a $999 price tag. But on account of the fact that the chip has eight cores – something none of the other chips do, and something no AMD chip is going to hold a candle to – that drop in clock can be forgiven. Still, it doesn't look right.
I haven't put even two seconds into overclocking the i7-5960X as of the time of writing, but after talking to a couple of different vendors, I've come to the conclusion that a 4.5GHz overclock is going to be somewhat of a pipe dream. 4.0GHz, however, should be no problem at all to hit, especially if you don't mind giving the chip a bit of extra voltage.
Even if you were to boost the chip to a static 3.7GHz or 3.8GHz across all of the cores, that dramatically enhances the appeal of the chip, and negates the fact that the i7-5930K is clocked a bit higher at stock.
Above is a shot of our i7-5960X sample cuddling with ASUS' X99-DELUXE motherboard. This board is the first X99 offering I've touched, and so far, I'm beyond impressed with it. As you can probably imagine, this board will be the focus of my first X99 review, so stay tuned for that – there's a lot to talk about.
Before moving on, there's something interesting in that shot above: If you look closely at the CPU, you'll see it say “USA”. I couldn't help but ask Intel about this, since all of the CPUs I've received from the company have largely come from Costa Rica or Malaysia, and I was told that the USA label will not be carrying over to the retail products. So now that I've wasted your time with this information, let's talk about DDR4.
Corsair was kind enough to send along a kit of its Vengeance LPX for our testing. This 16GB kit is clocked at DDR4-2800 speeds, although as I quickly found out, that speed is a little hard to hit at this point in time, and even after talking to ASUS and Corsair, I'm not entirely sure why. At 2800MHz speeds, my bandwidth score in Sandra was actually less than it was with the sticks clocked at 2400 or 2666. It could be that I have a bunk memory controller in my chip, or ASUS' EFI needs some further tweaking. What I do know for sure is that there are some definite launch quirks here.
Desktop DDR4 at this point is bleeding-edge, and its pricing reflects it. I tackled this a couple of times recently in our news section, so I'm going to borrow a table from a post I wrote earlier this week to help illustrate things here.
DDR3 DDR4 Premium 2133MHz 2x8GB $163 (G.SKILL, 1.5V, CL 11) $220 (Crucial, 1.2V, CL 15) +35% 2133MHz 4x8GB $315 (G.SKILL, 1.65V, CL 10) $440 (Crucial, 1.2V, CL 15) +40% 2400MHz 2x8GB $153 (ADATA, 1.65V, CL 11) $230 (Crucial, 1.2V, CL 16) +50% 2400MHz 4x8GB $320 (Mushkin, 1.65V, CL 11) $460 (Crucial, 1.2V, CL 15) +44%
If you'll be building an X99-based PC, you're quite obviously going to be shelling out a fair bit of money to get up and running. I think I'm safe to assume that 16GB is going to be the amount of memory most people will go for, and at the moment, that will set you back just over $200 for a modest kit. Couple that with a $300 motherboard and at least the $400 i7-5820K, and that becomes a $900 base to your new PC.
Performance Expectations
Hey, Intel! I think I see an AMD engineer snooping around outside!
Alright, with Intel not looking, I have this to say: You probably don't need an eight-core Intel processor. It could be that such a thing doesn't even need to be said, but I just feel better by saying it anyway.
The fact of the matter is, even six cores is overkill for most people. It takes specific scenarios to take proper advantage of the resources that such a chip provides, and at the moment, that doesn't include gaming. Intel does make mention of 3DMark's Physics test benefiting from the extra cores, but that's not exactly representitive of actual gameplay.
Who'd benefit from such a big CPU the most are those who encode lots of video, render a lot of 3D projects, compile large applications, run multiple virtual machines, and in general, do some pretty hardcore stuff with their PC.
Because the i7-5960X is clocked at a mere 3.0GHz, the i7-5930K stands out. It might lose two cores, but it's at least 500MHz faster, and of course, $400 less than the eight-core.
That all being said, let's tackle a couple of quick numbers. Intel claims that its eight-core Haswell-E will prove up to 32% faster in 3D rendering (based on Cinebench scores), and up to 20% faster in 4K video editing (based on Adobe Premiere Pro CC). Further, in its test of converting a 4K source video to 1080p using HandBrake, the i7-5960X proved 69% faster than the quad-core i7-4790K, and up to 34% faster than the i7-4960X.
With that all taken care of, we can now move onto a look at our own performance tests, to see what the i7-5960X is truly made of. For the sake of this review, I'm going to be comparing the i7-5960X directly to the i7-4960X. I would have loved to have been able to include i7-4770K results in this review, but due to time constraints, I was unable to re-test the chip using our updated test suite. Fortunately, the real comparison involves the chips that are included, so let's get a move on and get to comparing – well, after a quick look at our testing system and methodologies.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell for a fifth straight day on Wednesday, their longest losing stretch since February, on worries Britain might leave the European Union while the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled plans for two U.S. rate hikes this year despite slower growth expectations.

A weekly draw in U.S. crude stockpiles helped crude futures pare losses during the session, before prices fell again in post-settlement trade.
Brent crude futures' front-month LCOc1 settled down 86 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $48.97 a barrel. In post-settlement trade, it fell as low as $48.56 by 3:46 p.m. EDT (1946 GMT).
The front-month in U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 settled down 48 cents, or 1 percent, at $48.01 per barrel. The session low was $47.55. In post-settlement it fell to $47.45.
Goldman Sachs said in a note that crude would need to trade at $45-$50 per barrel for the market to reach a supply deficit in the second half of 2016.
Oil prices have fallen without a break since June 8, for a total loss of about 7 percent. Just a week ago, Brent hit 2016 highs of nearly $53 a barrel and WTI reached toward $52 after a rash of supply disruptions, mostly out of Nigeria and Canada.
Wednesday's decline came as global markets slumped on fears that Britain could vote on June 23 to leave the EU. The dollar .DXY dipped against a basket of currencies but remained close to a June 3 high on worries of the so-called Brexit.

The Fed kept interest rates unchanged for June as it lowered economic growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017. But it still signaled two rate increases this year.
“The downgrade of the economy by the Fed is definitely weighing on crude oil prices aside from the Brexit concerns,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.
“For oil to maintain its recent rally, we are looking for strong demand going forward. That's been taken away, and you still have rate hike possibilities to contend with.”
U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 933,000 barrels last week, the government-run Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, versus market expectations for 2.3 million-barrel draws. [EIA/S]
“It's a mixed bag,” Chris Jarvis, analyst at Caprock Risk Management in Frederick, Maryland, said of the EIA data, which also showed a bigger-than-expected draw in gasoline stocks and a surprise build in distillates that included diesel.
“This will do little to move the needle in either direction for oil prices and the energy market will continue to get its cue from macro-economic environment and global equity markets,” Jarvis added.

Method call optimization - avoiding next-method
Gauche's object system is a direct descendant of stklos, which is based on TinyCLOS. Each method takes an implicit parameter, next-method , which is bound to a next-method object and can be used to invoke the less specific method in a method chain. It is similar to the super method in class-oriented object systems. However, the next-method object must remember the actual arguments used in the method's invocation. That is, when it is called without arguments, it should pass the original arguments to the next method:
gosh> (define-method foo ((a <number>)) `((number ,a))) #<generic foo (2)> gosh> (define-method foo ((a <real>)) (cons `(real ,a) (next-method))) #<generic foo (2)> gosh> (foo 3) ((real 3) (number 3))
Here, (next-method) in (foo <real>) passes 3 to the next method, (foo <number>) . Note that the next-method object is a first-class object, so for example, it can be saved to a global variable:
gosh> (define nm #f) nm gosh> (define-method foo ((a <real>)) (set! nm next-method) nm) #<generic foo (2)> gosh> (foo 3) #<next-method (#<method (foo <number>)>)0 (3)> gosh> nm #<next-method (#<method (foo <number>)>)0 (3)>
And invoked later:
gosh> (nm) ((number 3))
This means that a next-method object must be allocated for every invocation of a method. In many cases, though, next-method isn't used at all in the method body, so it's a waste. Can we do something?
An easy path would be to let programmers indicate whether the method want to use next-method or not, probably using a CL-style method qualifier. But it's kind of silly---whether the method uses next-method or not is already shown in the code; why the programmer need to bother to say it again?
Fortunately, during compilation, we track how many times each local variable is referenced. So at some point in the compiler passes, we know whether next-method is used in the method body or not. We can extract that information and save in the method object, and when the method is invoked we check it and avoid next-method creation if possible.
The define-method form is expanded as follows:
(define-method name ((arg spec) ...) <method-body>) | v (add-method! name (make <method> ... :specializers (spec ...) :body (lambda (next-method arg ...) <method-body>)))
The body of the method is just a plain lambda form; it has nothing special about being a method body. So the compiler can't treat method body differently.
Instead, we introduced a general mechanism to save a list of unused argument in each closure; it is a meta-information and saved along source-code information.
The <method> initializer looks that information to find out whether next-method argument is used. If not, it sets method-leaf flag of the method object.
The method invocation code looks at the flag and omits creation of next-method object.
Let's see how effective this optimization is. This is the benchmark script.
(use gauche.time) ;; method without next-method (define-method foo (x) #t) ;; method with next-method (for comparison) (define-method bar (x) (when x (next-method))) ($ time-these/report 10000000 `((foo . ,(cut foo #f)) (bar . ,(cut bar #f))))
On 0.9.5:
Benchmark: ran foo, bar, each for 10000000 times. foo: 2.021 real, 3.550 cpu (3.470 user + 0.080 sys)@2816901.41/s n=10000000 bar: 2.099 real, 3.680 cpu (3.570 user + 0.110 sys)@2717391.30/s n=10000000
On HEAD:
Benchmark: ran foo, bar, each for 10000000 times. foo: 1.313 real, 1.740 cpu (1.730 user + 0.010 sys)@5747126.44/s n=10000000 bar: 2.051 real, 3.670 cpu (3.570 user + 0.100 sys)@2724795.64/s n=10000000
In wall-clock time, it's about 35% speedup (actually, averaging multiple runs show it's more like 40%). It's also interesting that CPU time is halved---since GC runs in parallel, it indicates this modification generates a lot less garbage, hence less GC time.
Note: Since 0.9.6's built-in methods will be pre-compiled by the 0.9.5 compiler, you won't see the effect of this optimization on built-in methods in the 0.9.6 release. You'll need to rebuild the source with 0.9.6.
There are still lots of room of optimization in our method dispatch mechanism, and we'll explore it more in the comping releases.

The human-made global warming movement has officially shifted from runaway global warming fears over to extreme weather fears. This strategic shift has been in the works for years as global average temperatures have stalled by up to 16 years. First there was a transition from “global warming” to “climate change” and now to “global climate disruption.” Some have suggested “global weirding” others have suggested a “new normal.”
At the opening of the 18 annual United Nations climate summit being held in Doha, Qatar, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, urged governments around the world to “do something about” extreme weather. “We have had severe climate and weather events all over the world and everyone is beginning to understand that is exactly the future we are going to be looking about if they don't do something about it,” Figures explained at the opening of the annual UN climate summit.
In June of this year, Democrat Rep. Henry Waxman (Ca) blamed CO2 for wildfires in Colorado and floods in Florida. “It's time to stop denying science. Extreme events like the wildfires in Colorado and the floods in Florida are going to get worse unless Republican-controlled Congress changes course soon,” Waxman explained.
Global warming proponents claimed that 2012 was a 'new normal' in climate with “unprecedented” weather events. Former Vice President Al Gore summed up this view when they wrote: “Every night on the news now, practically, is like a nature hike through the book of Revelations.
Sen Boxer (D-Calif), the chair of the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee declared: “Hurricane Sandy has shown us all what the scientists sitting right in this room said the day I got the gavel, & they told us exactly what would happen and it's all happening.”
But the latest peer-reviewed studies, data and analyses undermine claims that the weather is more “extreme” or “unprecedented.” On every key measure, claims of extreme weather in our current climate fail to hold up to scrutiny.
Deaths due to extreme weather are radically declining, global tropical cyclone activity is near historic lows, the frequency of major U.S. hurricanes has declined, tornadoes have dramatically declined since the 1950s, droughts are not historically unusual nor caused by humankind, there is no evidence we are currently having unusual weather.
Professor of Environmental Studies Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado, summed up the latest science on weather extremes. : “There is no evidence that disasters are getting worse because of climate change,” they wrote. “There's really no evidence that we're in the midst of an extreme weather era - whether man has influenced climate or not,” Pielke added.
Sandy, the 'new normal'?
Pielke Jr. also explained the data does not support linking Hurricane Sandy to human-made global warming. “Sandy was terrible, but we're currently in a relative hurricane 'drought',” they explained..
The scientific data does not support claims that Sandy was a “new normal.” See: Hurricane Facts: 'According to NOAA, they have been on decline in US since the beginning of records in 19th century. The worst decade for major (category 3,4,5) hurricanes was 1940s'
Scientist Martin Hoerling of NOAA on Sandy: 'As to underlying causes, neither the frequency of tropical nor extratropical cyclones over N. Atlantic are projected to appreciably change due to climate change'
NOAA scientist Martin Hoerling debunks notion that warmer than average ocean temps made Sandy stronger: 'The unusually warm waters off Eastern Seaboard were however in areas where the background temperature is like 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So adding a few degrees Fahrenheit at that cool water temperature doesn't matter too much for the intensity of a hurricane'
125 International Scientists Rebuke UN for Climate Claims in Open Letter: 'Global warming that has not occurred cannot have caused extreme weather of past few years': 'Climate changes naturally all the time, sometimes dramatically. The hypothesis that our emissions of CO2 have caused, or will cause, dangerous warming is not supported by the evidence. The incidence and severity of extreme weather has not increased'
These scientific facts have not deterred climate activists from using Sandy and other storms to bolster their claims. Gore now claims that “All weather events now affected by global warming.”
In the 1970's, extreme weather was also blamed on humans – during the human-made global cooling scare. See: 1975: Newsweek Explained How Global Cooling Causes Extreme Droughts, Floods, Dry Spells And Heatwaves -- Global cooling 'causes an increase in extremes of local weather such as droughts, floods, extended dry spells, long freezes, delayed monsoons and even local temperature increases – all of which have a direct impact on food supplies'
During World War II, some blamed the war for causing extreme weather. See: Flashback 1941: War Caused Weather Extremes And Global Weirding! 'The ancient belief that years of war tend to bring abnormal vagaries In the weather' -- 1941: 'There have been remarkable extremes of weather since the war began, and these have continued all through the year. The spring was one of the bleakest on record, and summer began in the same way. The first 10 days of June yielded 131 hours of sunshine, which is the ordinary 'allowance' for January. Then a drought and heat of an unusual character occurred suddenly, with temps up to 94 degrees in London'
In 2012, some climate campaigners are warning the global warming activists to lay off extreme weather claims. See: Keith Kloor: 'Extreme weather and disasters has become crack cocaine to the climate community. Many of them are now hooked': 'And they come crashing down once the heat breaks and global warming disappears from the headlines'
In 2006, NASA's global warming scientist James Hansen warned against using storms as a selling point to human-made global warming. See: Flashback 2006: Hansen warns: 'We don't want the public to hang their hat on a recent storm, recent hurricanes for example, because those will fluctuate from year to year'
The website Real Science pointed out that pleasant sunny days in the Spring are now being defined as “extreme weather.” See: The New Extreme: 'NOAA counts the mild U.S. weather in March & August as 'extreme weather' . “A mild day in winter is extreme, as is a cool day in summer,” the website explained.
The promoters of human-made climate fears have essentially declared that human-made climate change will cause many bad weather events to happen. And since bad weather events always happen, there is no shortage of “proof' of their predictions. They can always claim every bad weather event as evidence of their correctness.
There is no way anyone can falsify the global warming claims now because any weather event that happens “proves” their case, despite the fact that the current weather is neither historically unprecedented, nor unusual.
For more details on how so-called “extreme weather” does not prove that humans are destroying the climate, please see the full 35-page Climate Depot report.
My PC is too big. Much too big. I'd always vaguely suspected it, but testing Corsair's Obsidian Series 350D case earlier this week made it quite clear.
My PC is full of air and unoccupied slots and bays. I have four 5.25" optical drive bays that I don't use. The top one houses a DVD burner, but I can't remember the last time I stuck a disc in it. I moved to Canada over three years ago, and I'm positive that I've never purchased a blank DVD in this country.
Half of the expansion slots on my motherboard are set dressing. I only have a dual-slot graphics card and a sound card. In fairness, I use five of my six hard-drive bays—but that's because I'm still holding on to old drives, including a 320GB WD Caviar SE16. If I were to build a new system today, I would probably need just two 3.5" bays, with one 4TB hard drive in each. Add a 2.5" solid-state drive for my OS and applications, and I'd be set.
I'm sure I'm not alone. In fact, I'm willing to bet the vast majority of PC gamers and enthusiasts out there have just as much empty space in their PCs. Oh, don't get me wrong; leaving room for upgrades is fine. However, in the age of laptops, iPads, and smartphones, it seems a little strange that we should all have humongous mid-tower PCs full of air.
Over the past few days, I've been trying to picture what a modern desktop PC ought to look like. We could redesign everything completely, of course—introduce new form factors all over the place and wind up with something close to perfection. However, I think we can already improve things greatly with a few simple, practical steps:
Let's make microATX the new default for desktops. microATX provides enough expansion for a couple of graphics cards plus one wildcard, uh, card, which is about all most of us will ever need. We can keep ATX around for workstations and extreme quad-GPU rigs.
Get rid of 5.25" bays. Just get rid of 'em. Optical media is dead, and there are far better ways to back up your data than to burn a DVD or Blu-ray.
While we're at it, let's have smaller power supplies, too. Pretty much nobody needs a 1kW PSU. Heck, I figure most gaming PCs draw less than 500W. I'm sure we don't need to devote a cubic foot at the bottom of every case to AC-DC conversion. Switching to the SFX form factor could be a viable option there; Silverstone already makes a nice 450W SFX PSU.
Speaking of power, we could save users a lot of grief by simplifying power cabling. Heck, we could build it right into the enclosure—connect the PSU to the case with a big, standardized connector, and have strategically placed plugs and connectors sprout off where they're needed. All of the sudden, you no longer need loads of space around the motherboard and behind the motherboard tray for cable routing.
In line with the above, we might as well integrate SATA data connectors into drive bays, too. Just make every bay behave like a docking station and pre-route the cables. I guess we'll also want an option to bypass or upgrade the integrated cables, since high-end SATA Express SSDs are presumably just around the corner. Not all drives will need a 2GB/s interface, though.
Come up with a unified connector for front LEDs and buttons. This is long, long overdue. Seriously, how hard could it be to call up major motherboard makers and make them all agree on a common pin-out? Give it a snazzy marketing name, add it to the list of features along with your military-grade capacitors and auto-overclocking voodoo, and move on. Sheesh.
On the cooling side of things, let's try to arrange the stock fans in order to maintain positive internal pressure. And let's avoid having huge, unfiltered grates at the top of the case. You don't see anyone cracking open their laptop to vacuum dust out of it every six months. Desktop PCs shouldn't require that, either.
Oh, and give us more I/O at the front. Even high-end cases usually have only four front USB ports, and those tend to be all crowded together. I'd like to be able to leave at least a couple of charging cables plugged in permanently and still have room for chunky thumb drives and USB headsets.
That's about as far as I've gotten just now, but I'm sure there are other things we could do. And I'm sure you folks have ideas, too.
The broader point, though, is that desktop PCs could use a makeover. With just a handful of good initiatives, and maybe a new standard or two, we could make desktop PCs substantially simpler to build, more straightforward to use, and easier to carry around. Not every enclosure needs built-in cabling for everything plus a dozen front-panel ports, but we should at least offer those options. The easier it is to build a PC, the more people will do it, and the better the industry will be.
Absolutely one of the coolest and most high quality carbines I have ever seen. Rarely seen stateside the Beretta CX4 Storm is both highly unique and functional. Accepts all standard Beretta 92 pistol mags. The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun.It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies throughout the world and its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4's dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use. Comes with 2-10 round mags, cleaning kit, and mag loader.
These rifles are brand new in the box. They come with an owners manual but the owners manual is printed in a foreign language... possibly Russian. These rifles were evidently produced for a foreign military or police contract and imported into the U.S. not by Beretta U.S.A. but by P.W. Arms.
The streets of Hamilton are in for some tough justice this September.
RoboCop, a re-imagining of the 1987 Paul Verhoeven cult classic, is scheduled to begin shooting on James Street North next month.
The film stars Michael Keaton, Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson and is directed by José Padilha.
Film crews are set to shoot on James Street North from Sept. 24 until Oct. 1.

"They're going to transform the street to look like Detroit," said Julia Davis, from the Hamilton Film and Television office.
Builders constructing the set at 265 James Street North say they're setting up the space to look like a restaurant for a chase scene in the film.
Then when it's finished, they'll tear it all down again.
Michael Keaton was a late addition to the film's star-studded cast. On Wednesday, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Columbia Pictures announced he's set to play Raymond Sellars, the CEO of the corporation that builds RoboCop.
"Michael is the final addition to the amazing cast we have assembled for this film and it is so great to have the last puzzle piece in place," Padilha said. "It is thrilling that everything has come together to bring this innovative new vision of RoboCop to life. We've got a great script, a great cast, some killer ED-209's and I can't wait to get Alex Murphy back on the streets."
RoboCop is considered a sci-fi classic, and tells the story of Alex Murphy, a Detroit cop who is killed on duty but resurrected as a hulking cyborg.
The original was heralded by critics for its smart satire of American culture. Some called it the best film of 1987.
The RoboCop reboot is slated for an August 2013 release.
One of the ongoing projects that we've been following closely is the Airport Metro Connector, which seeks to connect the terminals at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) with the growing Metro Rail network. This is obviously a project of great interest given that LAX is the third busiest airport in the United States and many other airports in the U.S. and abroad are connected to local rail systems.
A new Metro staff report released today (above) recommends that one alternative for the project be studied more intensively: building a new rail station near Aviation Boulevard and 96th Street to serve trains along the Crenshaw/LAX and Green Lines. The station would also be the “gateway” transfer point to an Automated People Mover that would take people to the airport terminals. The people mover would be built by LAX.
Metro will evaluate the light rail part of this alternative — i.e., the new rail station — in the project's upcoming environmental clearance document. The planners at LAX would study the Automated People Mover.
The new Metro Rail station would be about .4 miles north of the future Aviation/Century station that will also serve both the Crenshaw/LAX and Green Lines. The idea, according to the Metro staff report, is that the 96th Street Station would be the gateway for passengers headed to LAX while the Aviation/Century station would connect riders to the many businesses along the Century Boulevard corridor.
A new analysis by Metro staff also found that this alternative would deliver about the same number of riders to LAX as running a light rail line directly to the airport terminals. The analysis also found that the recommended alternative would get people to the terminals in about the same amount of time, cost far less to build and could be built sooner, with a completion date perhaps as early as 2022, depending on when LAWA builds the people mover.
The preferred alternative was developed in close cooperation with planners and officials at Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), the city of Los Angeles agency that oversees the airport.
Over the past several years, LAWA has been finalizing details on its current modernization plan, which includes the people mover, a new ground transportation hub (known as the Intermodal Transportation Facility or ITF) and a consolidated rental car facility. LAWA's current plans are to build the people mover just north of 96th Street en route to the Crenshaw/LAX corridor. Here is the link to the latest LAWA presentation on their ground transportation program.
The people mover would also include a station at the ITF to be built by LAWA on the northwest corner of 98th Street and Airport Boulevard. That facility would serve as a pick-up and drop-off point for airport passengers and, according to LAX, would allow passengers to check in for flights and check their baggage. LAX is studying whether to build two or four people mover stations to serve the airport terminals.
The public policy question hovering over the Airport Metro project over the past few years has been how to best connect the existing Green Line and future Crenshaw/LAX Line to the airport?
Other cities have also wrestled with trying to determine whether it's best to build a rail line directly into airports or instead build a special airport train that connects airport terminals with the local transit system. The latter approach is the one used at Phoenix Sky Harbor, Miami International, JFK in New York and Oakland International Airport.
LAX poses particular challenges with seven terminals spread out along a horseshoe shaped road with runways and tarmacs on all sides of the horseshoe. That means that running light rail into the airport requires lengthy and expensive train tunnels as well as a limited number of stations and longer trips for riders not bound for the airport. The Metro Board of Directors formally eliminated those options from further consideration in January.
Some other interesting factoids from the new Metro staff report:
•A Metro Rail-people mover connection resulted in about the same ridership as having a light rail line run directly into the airport terminals, according to Metro's ridership forecasts. In the future, it's expected that about 57 percent of airport bound passengers would arrive by private car, 33 percent by shuttles, taxis and limos, eight percent by the Flyaway bus and one to two percent via transit buses and trains. Keep in mind that about 66.6 million passengers used LAX in 2013, meaning even small percentages can add up to a lot of people.
•Building rail into the terminal area could be three times as expensive with a cost of $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion compared to connecting the people mover to light rail at 96th and Aviation (alternative A2).
•The chart below shows the average walk times involved in using Metro Rail and the people mover to reach airport terminals — assuming LAX builds two people mover stations to serve the terminals.
•Here's the operating plan for the Crenshaw/LAX Line and the Green Line with a station at 96th/Aviation along with the future Aviation/Century station that is being built as part of the Crenshaw/LAX Line project:
•Building a light-rail spur line from the Crenshaw/LAX Line and Green Line into the airport could have had serious operational impacts for Metro Rail. The big problem: it would have involved longer and less frequent trips for many Metro Rail passengers not headed to airport or near-airport destinations.
•In order to reach the furthest airport terminal, Metro staff estimates that it would take 32.2 minutes from the Crenshaw/Expo station on the Crenshaw/LAX Line, 31.4 minutes from the Green Line's Redondo Beach station and 50.7 minutes from the Green Line's Norwalk station.
•As the report says, if LAWA decides not to support Metro's staff recommended alternative, Metro then would work with LAWA staff on a transfer to the people mover at the Aviation/Century station.
•Also from the study and worth noting: Metro and LAWA have yet to discuss “funding assignments” for the project between the two agencies. LAWA still must make final decisions on the airport's Ground Transportation Program, which includes the people mover.
The Metro Board is scheduled to consider the Metro staff recommendation at their Planning Committee meeting at 2:30 p.m. on June 18 and Construction Committee meeting at 10:15 a.m. on June 19. Both meetings will be held in the Board Room at Metro Headquarters adjacent to Union Station and, as always, are open to the public. The full Board of Directors are scheduled to take up the issue at their meeting at 9:30 a.m. on June 26 at Metro HQ.

Penguin's business-focused imprint Portfolio plans to publish a book recounting the legal dispute between Gawker Media and wrestler Hulk Hogan (whose real name is Terry Bolea).
The case, in which Hogan sued Gawker for publishing a sex tape involving them and the wife of their then-best friend, could often seem farcical — part of Hogan/Bolea's testimony involved the difference between Bolea's and Hogan's penis size. At the same time, the lawsuit had real consequences, with Gawker ultimately declaring bankruptcy, selling to Univision and shutting down operations on its flagship Gawker website.
The book will be written by media columnist and author Ryan Holiday. Their first book, Trust Me I'm Lying focused on their career doing publicity and marketing for American Apparel and Tucker Max, while more recent titles like Ego Is The Enemy and The Daily Stoic examine how to apply the philosophy of stoicism to modern life and business.
So how did Holiday end up writing about Gawker and Hogan? They said PayPal founder/venture capitalist Peter Thiel (he helped to fund Hogan's lawsuit) and Gawker founder Nick Denton both sent them unsolicited emails at the end of last year.
Ultimately, Holiday said the book will be based on “dozens of hours” of interviews with Thiel, Denton, Hogan, AJ Daulerio (who published the Hogan footage on Gawker), Hogan's attorney Charles Harder and others, as well as on the time he's spent poring over 25,000 pages of legal filings.
While a number of journalists (including me) have written about the troubling implications of a billionaire secretly funding a lawsuit against their enemies in the press, Holiday told me that it's a mistake to focus on “whether this should have happened or not.”
“The question is how did this happen?” Holiday said. “How did a media company that purports to do investigative journalism miss a conspiracy aimed against it? How did a case that everyone was convinced wouldn't stand up in court, that was obviously protected by the First Amendment, last through multiple judges and ultimately make it all the way to a verdict? How did Thiel think they would not eventually be discovered and not anticipate the backlash?”
The currently untitled book was acquired by Portfolio's Niki Papadopoulos for what the publisher said is a “significant” sum. (We've heard that the advance was $400,000.) It's scheduled for release this winter.
The International Ventriloquism Grand Championships were held at the MacFarlane and Gray Hotel Spa and Convention Center. Contestants attended from around the world to compete for the substantial prize money offered. The Grand Championships were sponsored by Fatboy's Farm Apple Wine.
Unfortunately for every other competitor, the master ventriloquist Noser chose the Grand Championships to come out of retirement, desperately needing the prize money to pay off three months' late rent, plus interest. Unfortunately for the human race, the vampire monarchs Vladdy and Lizzie chose the Grand Championships to stage their return to human form and call forth an army of undead.
Though they succeeded in regaining human form, both vampires were slain by Wendy Watson, who had made impromptu stakes out of the arms of Noser's dummy, Young Noser. Despite this impromptu amputation of their puppet, Noser went on to win the Grand Championships and the prize money.
Already working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to secure records on their blockchain, Factom has now set its sights on the trillion-dollar mortgage industry. Having launched its new Factom Harmony solution in March, the company hopes to attract big banks and host their sensitive mortgage data. By increasing the efficiency of document management, Harmony will allow a seamless transaction process between lenders and brokers, without them having to worry about lost documents, altered agreements or incomplete records.
Built on the Factom Apollo data management solution, which allows users to store and create immutable digital records, Harmony “works with existing imaging or document management solutions to create secure, transparent, unalterable records for final loan documents.” In the process, every file is secured within a blockchain container, locking in the order of the final documentation, recording each person who accesses files and rejecting duplicate documents.
Factom refers to this system as “a perfected digital audit vault” for each specific loan. Thus the core product behind Factom Harmony is called Digital Vault, which locks into time the most important closing documents and gives a complete history of every file from origination to close.
As an all-inclusive solution, Factom Harmony
creates a permanent record and index of final loan documents, making audits smooth by reducing quality control, due diligence and review time;
reduces costs by creating a single source that organizes the final documentation and provides cryptographic truth that each document is an authentic copy;
provides access control to multiple parties that can collaborate under audit conditions and exceptions, and includes an immutable audit trail of all actions on each document in real-time, giving a true history of every loan;
opens a secure audit room or due diligence deal room that can be tracked on the Factom blockchain.
According to Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom Inc., “The Harmony solution and the underlying Factom blockchain provide lenders with something that was fundamentally missing from the industry. With Harmony, a lender is able to create a final set of documents for each closed loan.”
Right now, origination of a loan has underlying costs of about $7,500 per loan — up from approximately $2,500 per loan in 2006. The costs have tripled over the last few years as banks have been forced to step up their efforts to be in compliance with new laws.
Factom Harmony addresses many of the redundancy issues associated with these efforts by permanently documenting the process from the moment documents are first created, and then allowing that data to be quickly shared and verified digitally. Having digital records that can be securely shared and verified also speeds up financial institutions' ability to settle transaction among themselves. Factom does not claim to move money faster, but it does attempt to allow others to have the confidence in the data they are reviewing and thus speed up the processes.
According to Factom, Harmony is the first practical and effective deployment of blockchain technology in the mortgage industry. Through combining blockchain technology, advanced cryptography tools and a digital fingerprint for each document or data file, lenders can securely store and expose individual loan files or documents to various third parties.
“This technology dramatically changes the approach and reduces the costs for audits, third-party reviews, litigation costs and due diligence costs,” Jason Nadeau, executive vice president of Factom, said in a statement. “The combination of blockchain and digital signature technology within Factom's solution creates a solution where the benefits of digital signatures and electronic vaulting are now available for all documents without having to deploy any eMortgage or eClosing technology.”
Toni Moss is the founder and CEO of AmeriCatalyst LLC, an advisory firm located in Austin, Texas, specializing in corporate strategy, business development, market intelligence and market positioning for companies engaged in all sectors of the residential real-estate and housing finance industry in the North American market. Moss has advised clients including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, the European Commission and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Well-known in the U.S. mortgage industry, they are a big fan of Factom Harmony, and had this to say about the blockchain-based solution:
“The industry remains disparate and fractured with regard to the acquisition, management, distribution and protection of data, with a wide variety of third-party providers, proprietary platforms and programming languages. It's just a matter of time before mortgage data is aggregated into a secure and centralized industry utility — and blockchain [technology] is the most promising catalyst to enable it,” Moss said to Bitcoin Magazine.
“As data becomes more plentiful, accurate, accessible and immutable, investors will have the confidence to return to the mortgage market; processing, servicing and transactional costs (should) decrease; and the market itself will be far more secure and sustainable in the long-term.”
Factom has yet to announce any contracts or partnerships related to its mortgage solution, but the time is right for big banks to start utilizing blockchain technology. In a separate recent development for the company, the Factom blockchain was made accessible to Chinese developers through WanCloud, a product released by Wanxiang Blockchain Corporation to drive progress among Chinese enterprises.
TOKYO, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- After McDonald's Japan apologized Saturday for plastic pieces found in its food, it admitted a human tooth was found in French fries sold in Osaka. McDonald's Holding Co. (Japan) Ltd., the operator of the chain in Japan, also disclosed a third incident of plastic found over the weekend in its meals. It added it is still investigating the issue of the tooth, noting the tooth was not fried although it was contained in a packet of fried food, none of the employees of the Osaka McDonald's had lost a tooth and employees of the food processing plant wear masks at work. The incident was first reported in August.
Since a scandal, involving tainted meat from a Chinese supplier, surfaced in July 2013, McDonald's sales in Japan have fallen by about 10 percent per month. The company said it expects to record its first annual loss in 11 years in this fiscal year.
Company director Takehiko Aoki tried to separate the matters of foreign objects in food and contaminated meat Wednesday, saying, "We respond differently to individual contamination issues from bigger food-quality problems. Individual cases happen in various places and various forms, but they don't cause big health problems in a continuous manner."
Alejandro Sabella has named some surprise players in their provisional 30-man Argentina squad for the 2014 World Cup, but it's likely that they've been brought in with a view towards the 2015 and 2016 Copa America tournaments, rather than as actual competitors for first-choice players. Franco Di Santo, Lisandro Lopez and Fabian Rinaudo were surprise inclusions, but will almost certainly be among those cut.
Like Diego Maradona in 2010, Sabella doesn't have much to choose from in the way of natural fullbacks, and will have to play someone out of position if their starters get injured. The good news for them is that a few of their central defenders have played right back before, and that Pablo Zabaleta can fill in at left back in a pinch.
Lionel Messi is one of many forwards called into the team, and that list might only have Di Santo cut from it. Messi is likely to play behind a center forward, while both Sergio Aguero and Ezequiel Lavezzi play wide more than they play in the middle for Argentina.
Goalkeepers: Sergio Romero (Monaco), Mariano Andújar (Catania), Agustín Orion (Boca Juniors)
Defenders: Ezequiel Garay (Benfica), Federico Fernández (Napoli), Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City), Marcos Rojo (Sporting Portugal), José María Basanta (Monterrey), Hugo Campagnaro (Inter Milan), Nicolás Otamendi (Atlético Mineiro), Martín Demichelis (Manchester City), Gabriel Mercado (River Plate), Lisandro López (Getafe)
Midfielders: Fernando Gago (Boca Juniors), Lucas Biglia (Lazio), Javier Mascherano (Barcelona), Ever Banega (Newell's Old Boys), Angel Di María (Real Madrid), Maximiliano Rodríguez (Newell's Old Boys), Ricardo Alvarez (Inter Milan), Augusto Fernández (Celta Vigo), Enzo Pérez (Benfica), José Sosa (Atlético Madrid), Fabian Rinaudo (Catania)
Forwards: Sergio Agüero (Manchester City), Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Gonzalo Higuaín (Napoli), Ezequiel Lavezzi (Paris Saint-Germain), Rodrigo Palacio (Inter Milan), Franco Di Santo (Werder Bremen)
"It Happened on Friday," a short story by Iraqi author Abd al-Malik Noori, written sometime around 1950, opens with a young boy tucking into "sammoon and `amba," purchased from a vendor outside a Baghdad movie theater, on their day off from school. Noori describes how the spicy, yellow `amba streaks the boy's cheeks and chin, and drips down their shirt. `Amba, a pickled mango condiment, is a familiar sight in Israel, too. Brought to this country by the Jews of Iraq, bowls of it are prominently displayed at shwarma and felafel stands. Sammoon is diamond-shaped bread filled with `amba that is sold on the streets of Baghdad.
This scene has remained etched in my mind because it reminds me of my own childhood in Iraq. On Friday mornings, I used to pass by the Ghazi movie theater, not far from my house, and look on, wild with envy, as other boys, most of them Muslim, feasted on sammoon and `amba. I was not allowed to join them because my mother warned me over and over not to touch the `amba sold by street vendors. It was teeming with disease-carrying germs, they said, and anyway, why would I want to eat that "fake, contaminated" stuff when we had a barrel of the genuine article, produced by the Mancherchee Manekchee Poonjeajee company of Bombay, sitting at home?
Even so, watching the boys with their sammoon and `amba never failed to whet my appetite and, needless to say, I did disobey my mother on occasion, tasting of that forbidden fruit. The heavenly flavor of `amba on fresh-baked sammoon lingers on my tongue to this day.
The pungent odor of `amba, one of the distinctive smells of Baghdad, also symbolizes the prominent culinary link between Iraq and the Indian continent. Israel came next: Iraqi Jews opened small factories in Israel and began to produce `amba, the main ingredients being slices of mango pickled in a sauce flavored with curry powder and other sharp spices.
When I moved with my family to Ramat Gan in 1955, the place was full of Jews from Baghdad, many of them residing in the neighborhood of the Rama movie theater. Above one of the food stands was a sign in gigantic Arabic script which read "`Amba Hodit" (Indian `amba) - advertising the fact that the `amba sold there was "authentic," which is to say "Indian," and not some local imitation.
In 1991, during the Gulf War, when several Iraqi Scud missiles happened to fall in parts of Ramat Gan that have a large Iraqi Jewish population, the joke going around was that the Scuds had been attracted by the smell of the `amba.
But the truth is, the Iraqi-Indian connection, especially with regard to the Jews of Baghdad and southern Iraq, went far beyond Indian `amba. From the time I was a child, I knew that the Jews of Baghdad and the port city of Basra had satellite communities in various parts of India and environs. At home, I often heard the names of relatives and friends who were working or living in India, particularly in Bombay, Calcutta and Poona, but also on the island of Java (today part of Indonesia) and in Singapore.

There were branches of the community in Manchester and London, but these were actually offshoots from the Iraqi Jewish communities in Asia, who began to send their sons or representatives to open offices in important centers of commerce in England at the end of the 19th century.
Most of the offspring of David Sassoon, known as the "Rothschilds of the East," moved from India to Great Britain for business purposes, but went on to achieve fame in other spheres, too. Philip Sassoon, a grandson, was a member of the British Parliament and served as undersecretary of state for air in the 1920s and `30s. Siegfried Sassoon (note the Germanic name!) was one of England's leading poets between the two world wars.
These were facts that I was already aware of as a child, but little did I know that there was also an Iraqi Jewish community in China and Indonesia. In the summer of 1992, Harvard University was holding an international conference, the first of its kind, on Chinese Jewry. Among the speakers were Chinese scholars, permitted to travel to the United States for the first time. I asked my friend Prof. Bernard Wasserstein, who was one of the organizers, if I could participate as an observer, and they had no objection. I was not preoccupied with the subject of Iraqi Jewry at the time, and was intrigued by the idea of meeting scholars from China.
To my great surprise, the moment I walked into the conference hall, I was approached by two Chinese professors, who were looking at my name tag. "Where are you from, Mr. Somekh?" asked one of them in English, with a very odd accent. "Hong Kong or Burma?" I replied that I was from Tel Aviv. It took a few moments for them to register that most of the Somekh family now lives in Israel rather than the eastern tip of Asia.
At the conference, I heard some fascinating lectures about the "Baghdadi" communities (in India and China, the reference is not only to Iraqi Jews, but to Jews of Middle Eastern descent, be they Syrian, Iranian or Yemenite). But the most amazing discovery of all, from my perspective, came from a young Italian researcher by the name of Chiara Betta, who was writing their doctorate in England on the economy of China, with special emphasis on Salah (Silas) Hardoon, a Baghdad Jew who virtually ruled the business world of Shanghai in the 1920s. In some ways, Hardoon's story is typical of the Asiatic connection of Iraqi Jews, but in other ways, it is unique.
Hardoon, born in Baghdad, first reached India as a clerk in the financial empire of David Sassoon. This huge concern made a point of bringing over bookkeepers from Baghdad, who were considered industrious and trustworthy. But there was a third reason - technical, you might say: David Sassoon's companies did their bookkeeping ("blanjoo") in Judeo-Arabic, i.e., Arabic written in Hebrew script, a practice which continued into the 20th century.
Hardoon did such a fine job that their employers, the Sassoons, sent them to Shanghai to run their branch office there. In time, Hardoon decided to take the plunge: They bid farewell to the Sassoon enterprise and launched their own economic empire. It succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Before long, Hardoon was the richest person in Shanghai, the city's "uncrowned king." Every year, in celebration of the Chinese New Year, Hardoon would open the gates to their palace and present a gift of money to every citizen who came to see him. When they died in 1931, their Eurasian wife organized an enormous mass funeral jointly presided over by a rabbi and a Buddhist monk. The family in Baghdad tried to claim their fabulous estate, but eventually gave up after a long court battle.
But to get back to India, new Jewish communities sprang up around these wealthy Iraqi Jews and their prospering businesses. They built synagogues and prayed in the style they remembered from Baghdad. In fact, at home, many of them continued to speak Baghdadi Judeo-Arabic. Until the middle of the 20th century, an Indian Jew of Iraqi origin could be identified by the use of old words that had long fallen into disuse in Iraq. In England and elsewhere, I have met Indian Jews whose speech was peppered with Arabic words that reminded me of an Iraqi grandmother - completely at odds with their modern European dress and appearance.
Several of these "Baghdadi" communities in India published newspapers in Baghdadi Judeo-Arabic (such as Dover Meisharim and Doresh Tov Le'ammo), and close ties were maintained with their home communities in Iraq. It was not uncommon for them to write to the great posekim [authorities on Jewish law] in Baghdad, headed by Rabbi Abdullah Somekh (1813-1898), for help in resolving religious issues.
In their recent book, "The Luminous Face of the East: Studies in the Legal and Religious Thought of Sephardic Rabbis of the Middle East," Zvi Zohar offers a fascinating account of this relationship between "diaspora" and "center" with respect to the Iraqi-Jewish community.
But the "Baghdadi" Jews of India were not linked to Iraq only in matters of faith and language. For the large communities of Baghdad and Basra, the satellite communities were a source of refuge and support in times of trouble. Moreover, contact with these outside communities broadened the horizons of the Iraqi Jews and opened their eyes to the modern world, so radically different from Ottoman, pre-modern Iraq.
This bond between Iraqi Jews and their countrymen in India continued until recently. When World War II broke out, a number of prominent Jews in Basra sent their wives and children to "Bombay" (a general term for the cities of India where Iraqi Jews lived) until the danger blew over. Some of them remained in India even afterward. My cousin, whom I loved dearly as a child, was sent to India with their siblings. There they married a young local Jew from the Hillel family, also of Iraqi descent, and continued to live in Bombay until the early 1970s, when the whole family moved to Israel.
Echoes of the Indian connection reverberated loudly in Iraq even in purely spiritual matters. An affair that rocked the Basra Jewish community in the 1930s, involving one of its leaders, Kedourie Any, is particularly interested in this regard. Any was a successful business person, some of whose family had settled in India. I am related to him: My maternal uncle married Any's daughter. As a child, I often visited their mansion on the coast of Shatt al-Arab. In time, I came across the man's rich library, in English and Arabic - a discovery which turned my trips to Basra into a thrilling cultural experience. In the stillness of the library, I would sit and read novel after novel.
On the shelves, I also noticed books and periodicals on "spiritual" topics whose significance I did not grasp until 1965, when I happened to read a certain article by Dr. Hayim Cohen in the Jerusalem periodical "Hamizrach Hehadash" ("The New East"). The title of the article was "Jewish Theosophists in Basra: A Symptom of the Battle for Enlightenment."
The story goes like this: Mr. Any and their wife, Rosa, born at the end of the 19th century, were a modern couple in every respect, and in some matters, they took the liberty of deviating from the conservative norms around them, although they continued to cling to the religion of their forefathers. They kept up contact with European visitors who came to Basra, and Rosa was among the first women to wear European clothing outside the house.
In the 1930s, or perhaps sometime before that, the Anys discovered theosophy. After a while, they organized a theosophy circle attended by several local Jews. At the time, Any themselves was head of the Jewish community council, but they saw no contradiction whatsoever between Judaism and theosophy. The community apparently saw nothing wrong with this new spiritual interest either.
Theosophy, a mystic philosophy that aspires to break down barriers and create a coherent universe, is not Indian in origin, but rather Western (Greek, German, American). At the same time, India was the hub of many of its activities. One of the important centers of theosophy was the Indian city of Madras. Kedourie Any's brother, Reuven Eliyahu Any, who settled in Bombay, was appointed honorary secretary of the theosophy society in that city.
In Basra, the theosophists met for several years without hindrance. However, after a personal dispute with a respected figure in the community, pressure was put on Any to stop dabbling in theosophy. Any refused to give in, and eventually resigned as chairperson of the Jewish community (it is unclear whether they left of their own free will or was forced out).
At that point, Any established a kind of temporary synagogue, traditional in character, that welcomed all Jews and apparently succeeded in attracting a sizable crowd. Contributing to its success was the fact that Any hired a certified shochet [ritual slaughterer] and paid the man's salary out of their own pocket. As a result of this arrangement, the price of kosher meat dropped because the shochet did not have to pay the communal slaughtering tax ("gabella").
In the end, Kedourie Any was welcomed back by the Jewish community, for fear that most of Basra's Jews would turn around and join their congregation. Any thus resumed their place in Jewish society, but without giving up their belief in theosophy, arrived at through their exposure to Indian philosophy.
This is the eighth chapter of Prof. Sasson Somekh's memoirs. The previous installment, "Generations of Namesakes," appeared in Ha'aretz English Edition on Jan. 18, 2002.
The first month of the Donald Trump presidency has provoked a public backlash against the president and their Republican enablers in Congress. Massive protest marches against Trump and their policies have been complemented by rowdy town-hall meetings that have left Republican legislators gibbering in the face of angry constituents.
In politics, moments like these present what's known as “an opportunity.” There's obviously widespread discontent with the new administration, and a savvy opposition party would reorient itself to capitalize on that frustration. But for the Democratic Party, disruptions like these are something to be feared and controlled.

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that having seen the problems Republicans are facing with angry voters in their home districts, senior Democratic leaders are cowering at the prospect of having their own events disrupted. The plan they have devised to prevent this from happening is to ask Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to request all the activists to not protest:
Such episodes spurred Democrats to ask Sanders for help, according to Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who attended the meeting on Tuesday. “They basically explained to Bernie, it looks like you could be the person that could calm down and make sure their energy and all this enthusiasm is directed in all the right proper channels,” Manchin said. “Bernie has a voice, and if [protesters] want to be active, then direct them to where the problem may be or where they anticipate a problem.”
It's so sad. Republicans who have faced down angry crowds have absurdly dismissed them as nothing more than “paid protesters” and professional activists. This is the Democratic equivalent of that nonsense. Democrats like Manchin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York seem to believe that Bernie Sanders' popularity with the activist base translates into controlling how it behaves. By their understanding, their constituents aren't people with their own views; they're vessels for Bernie's agenda.
That's no less delegitimizing than calling someone a “paid protester.” Both presume that disruptive political acts flow not from genuine grievances, but from the whim of a distant authority figure. I would hope that there are some voters in West Virginia who are righteously pissed that Manchin has cozied up to Trump more clearly than any other Senate Democrat and voted to confirm all but two of Trump's Cabinet nominees thus far, including Wall Street foreclosure baron Steve Mnuchin, now the Treasury secretary. With any luck, these voters will show up at a Manchin event and loudly voice that displeasure.
There's also no reason to think that Sanders or anyone else can tamp down activists' anger against the Trump administration and politicians who seek to accommodate it. Instead of foisting this impossible protest-prevention job on Sanders, the smarter play would be to listen to what people are angry about and figure out why, exactly, Sanders is so well-received by activists.
The bigger problem underlying all this is that the Democratic Party still doesn't seem to have a broader agenda other than projecting, “We're not Donald Trump.” Consider for a moment the fact that Sanders' title within the Democratic leadership is "chairperson of outreach," and the “outreach” that leaders want them to do involves telling people to stay away from Democratic events so that they can go yell at Republicans. And even as Democrats try to impersonate a hard-nosed opposition party, they still manage to stomp all over their message when members bend over backward to find “common ground” with the administration.
Rather than listening to its angry constituents and crafting a message that appeals to anti-Trump voters, Democratic leaders are trying to have it both ways and begging Bernie Sanders to help protect them from populist blowback. Schumer and Manchin want Sanders to direct protesters, in Manchin's words, “to where the problem may be.” It never occurs to them that those activists might view Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin as part of the problem.
My conference is better than yours: The last bastion of the ignorant

My conference is better than your conference, so there.
That one statement, which sounds petty and like a six-year old trying to win an argument with their five-year old neighbor, is the last bastion of the ignorant and misinformed. And people who cheer for programs that don't have their own individual successes to brag about.
Prior to Saturday's kickoff against South Carolina in Williams-Brice Stadium, I was roaming the sidelines as usual, looking for picture opportunities for Twitter and talking to some of the personnel that surround the program. At one point, I heard a roar from the Clemson fans already on hand and turned around to see the Clemson players and coaches begin Victory Walk.
As the players neared the end zone the South Carolina student section began to react, and as is normal began to hurl insults and epithets toward the Clemson players' direction. It's part of college football and it's what makes the game so great. Those passions are why we love it, and if they hadn't shown derision and distaste for their rival, I would have been disappointed.
However, one poor fellow did disappoint me. As the insults and shouts drifted out of the stands, I turned around to see if I could catch some of the more original insults. This one, down near the front, scrunched up their face and I could tell they were trying their hardest to think of something clever to say before time ran out. Finally, they lifted a fist skyward and screamed, “Get a real conference, you losers!”
Again, the last bastion of the ignorant and misinformed, but I can't really blame the poor kid. And this isn't an entire story written with the purpose of trying to make fun of some poor slob who has been spoon fed the ESPN agenda and believes it. The purpose is to point out that college football is now past all of that dominant conference baloney – there are actually a lot of really good teams out there and they span across several conferences. And they beat up on the not-so-good teams, of which there are a lot.
As I turned away and started to head back to the press box, I wanted to walk over to the youngster and ask him, “So, which conference is a real conference? The one with Kentucky and Vanderbilt and South Carolina and Missouri? The one with teams that don't have a clue how to throw a forward pass like Missouri or Florida or LSU? That conference? The one that has gone 1-7 against the ACC on rivalry weekends the last two seasons? That conference?”
But I didn't. Because the rest of the country is beginning to see what the rest of us already knew – the SEC isn't the king anymore. No one is the king because parity reigns. The tired old “get a real conference” or “if they played our schedule” are now concepts that are set up for ridicule by those of us who actually watch college football and realize that teams like Houston and Temple are better than more than one SEC or ACC or PAC 12 team.
The storyline that started last season continued into this season – each conference has a few really good teams up at the top that beat up on the bottom-feeders. And there are a lot of bottom-feeders in each league. I don't have to name them. You know them. And then there are a lot of teams that are good but not great. They are average. And the teams at the top are really good, but I don't know that we've seen greatness. Not like we've seen in the past.
I thought that perhaps the perception had changed after last season, but the voters had eight SEC teams in the Top 25 of both the AP and Coaches Polls prior to the start of the season. Teams that had more holes than a third-grader's notebook paper snowflake. Teams like Missouri and Arkansas and Auburn. Those teams are nowhere to be seen, and the ACC has Clemson, Florida St. and UNC all trending towards the top. But that doesn't mean the ACC is the best conference or is better than the SEC, because the reality is it doesn't matter. Those three teams have survived the gauntlet of the schedule, and they've done it because of what their coaches and players have accomplished on the field. Not what their conference has done.
Sure, conference affiliations and strength of schedule will always matter. As it should. But if any program has to ride the coattails of their conference in this day and age it speaks to bigger problems. It's 2015 after all, and it's about wins and losses more than it is about your conference. Ask the College Football Playoff committee.
Alabama is very good. Clemson is very good. Oklahoma is playing well and Iowa is undefeated. Four different conferences.
Get a real conference? That needs to be replaced by get a real team and win some games. Then you'll be speaking my language.
DRESSING-up hardman Sean Bean has taken a crucial step towards becoming the North of England's first living saint.
The actor, famous for appearing in Hollywood blockbusters where they play Sean Bean, completed the most Northern night in history with a story involving beer, a fight and somebody looking at somebody else's bird.
Bean's agent, Wayne Hayes, said: “While this would ordinarily rank Sean alongside any Sheffield man between 17 and 62, they managed to take it to another level by finishing off their night by eating a portion of chips and gravy off the back of a whippet.
“And they didn't stop complaining about how bloody expensive it all was until about 20 minutes ago.”
The Elders Of Goole, a group of 12 Yorkshiremen that convene in the function room of a working men's club to assess acts of outstanding Northernosity, have been tracking Bean since their 2002 portrayal of Macbeth, in which they impregnated two of the witches and told Lady Macbeth to make them a brew with four sugars.
Elder Roy Hobbs said: “Sean has fulfilled the prophecy as set out in the Northernomicon of Parkinson.
“He will be brought unto Leeds in a golden 1997 Mondeo where they will be anointed with a pint of Saltaire bitter as the Elders surround them and sing On Ilkley Moor Bah T'at in a haunting falsetto.
“It's a moving ceremony that has been known to reduce grown men to tears, shortly before they are ostracised for being a bloody great poof.”
As Britain's first living Northern saint, Bean's privileges will include first knock at dominoes for life and a platinum Greggs card.
Alright, it's not perfect. But a lot of effort went into making this Squirtle pumpkin, which I made yesterday for Halloween. With this week's release of Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, it's a great time to be a Pokémon fan. And even though I'm 21, I wanted to finally do a Pokemon-themed pumpkin.
I chose one of my very favorite Pokémon, Squirtle. For those unfamiliar with the 1998 “Squirtle Squad” storyline, Ash encounters a gang of Squirtles who were previously abandoned by their owners and have since turned to a life of crime. After Team Rocket detonates an explosion in an attempt to capture Pikachu, Ash saves the Squirtle Squad's leader, who shows their gratitude by joining Ash on their journey.
I started by sketching the outline of the Squirtle, complete with their signature sunglasses, with a sharpie. It helps to use a marker that can easily be erased with a paper towel. If you're anything like me, you'll make a lot of mistakes along the way. You'll also want to get some proper carving tools, which can be found in most craft or party stores.
After I realized that I couldn't cut out the shape of my Squirtle and keep the outline of the design, I spent the next hour carving out about a half of a centimeter of the outline with a sharp knife.
When I first lit a candle inside of the pumpkin, hoping that the light would illuminate the outline of the Squirtle, it was barely visible. So I spent another thirty minutes making the outline a little bit wider and deeper.
Finally, I lit the candle inside the pumpkin the second time and it looked much better. If there aren't any big holes in your pumpkin like mine, you'll need to cut a hole in the back of the pumpkin for air to flow into the pumpkin for the candle.
I'm close to graduating from college, and before this year, I hadn't carved a pumpkin since elementary school. But as I've begun aging into adulthood, it was important to me to set time and money aside to do something fun and creative. I wanted to take a break from my two part-time jobs and full-time course load to take the edge off and relive some of the fun from my childhood with a Pokemon-themed pumpkin. And I'm glad I did.
Donald Trump speaking at their veterans fundraiser in Iowa in January (Photo: Screen capture)
The despair over Donald Trump's candidacy has reached new lows among Republican insiders this week.
One day after Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said that Republicans faced an “extinction-level event” this fall if Trump didn't drastically change course, several anonymous GOP insiders tell Politico that it's time to stick a fork in The Donald's presidential aspirations.
“Trump is underperforming so comprehensively,” fumed one Iowa Republican. “It would take video evidence of a smiling Hillary drowning a litter of puppies while terrorists surrounded them with chants of ‘Death to America.'”
A Wisconsin Republican, meanwhile, bemoaned the fact that Trump is woefully far behind Clinton when it comes to creating a competent get-out-the-vote operation in key swing states.
“Considering the disadvantage a GOP candidate starts with, the work in key targeted states like Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania has to be error-free,” they said. “There is no evidence that Trump has done that or that they have much of a ground game to begin with.”
Even one Republican who said Trump still had a chance to turn it around conceded that their time is running out very quickly — and said that “if they don't move in 15 days, it's effectively over.”

But this is not a normal year, and once again the heated controversy over the Elizabethton/Carter County Animal Shelter came to the forefront to overshadow a 4-cent tax increase.
The Monday meeting started calmly, even though the committee considered and recommended the increase to property taxes. That would raise the tax rate from $2.45 to $2.49 per $100 of assessed value.
A handful of citizens did ask the committee to make sure all economies were done before deciding to raise taxes.
The committee also discussed holding the vote on the new budget during the June Commission meeting rather than the July meeting, but that failed by a 3-5 vote.
The meeting turned stormy when county Mayor Leon Humphrey once again took the podium to respond to comments made in last Thursday's Elizabethton City Council meeting in which Elizabethton Mayor Curt Alexander was critical of the increased costs of running the shelter. Alexander was also critical of the lack of negotiation between the city and the county over the increased costs and the city's desire to make changes in the agreement between the two governmental bodies on how the shelter should be operated.
Humphrey told the committee that during the City Council meeting, “Mayor Alexander said they wanted to do the right thing, they applauded the (shelter) staff. ... How can anyone who has only been to that shelter once in five years assess what we are doing as being good our bad? It can't be done.”
Humphrey said they got a proposal from the city Monday, and it reflected what had been passed in the city budget. It calls for the city to pay for only a quarter of the expenses of the shelter instead of the 50-50 split of costs in the original agreement. It also sets $100,000 as the maximum yearly amount the city would spend on the shelter.
“If we are going to negotiate, why don't we propose back to them that maybe the city of Elizabethton take over responsibility for operating the shelter, seeing as they are experts?” the mayor said shortly before Budget Committee Chairwoman Sonja Culler asked them to sit down.
Humphrey said they are awaiting an investigative report from the Tennessee Comptroller's Office, which they said will note criminal activity took place prior to the time that the county took direct control of the shelter. Whether that rises to the level that the district attorney will press charges is anybody's guess. That will be between him, their staff and the comptroller's report.
The committee also approved a request by Mayor Leon Humphrey to allow their office and the Building and Grounds budget they administer to keep the approximately $25,000 that has not been spent this fiscal year. Humphrey said there are several problems with county buildings that need to be addressed and the additional funds would be used to complete a couple of those projects.
The Iraq War debate was not among American journalism's finest hours. Despite, or perhaps because of, the media's incessant coverage of the run-up to war, the public ended up wildly misinformed. An August 2003 Washington Post poll found that 69 percent of Americans thought it either “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that Saddam Hussein had been involved in the 9/11 attacks. Eighty percent of Fox News viewers believed either that Iraq and al Qaeda were closely linked, that the U.S. had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, or that world public opinion favored the war. Even among Americans who got most of their information from print, a majority fell for one of these mistruths. The New York Times ultimately apologized for not showing more “skepticism” about pre-war claims of Iraqi WMD.
Now, with Israel, or America, or both, potentially headed for war with Iran, the press is being tested again. And it's mostly failing again. On the narrow question of whether Iran has decided to seek a nuclear weapon—as opposed to mere nuclear capacity—the elite media are trying hard to convey skepticism. On Saturday, The New York Times ran a front-page, above-the-fold story explaining that U.S. intelligence agencies don't really know whether Iran is building a bomb.
That's the good news. The bad news is that beyond the specific issue of whether the Iran is pursuing a nuke, the media are still doing what they did during the Iraq debate: passing off pro-war arguments as fact.
Two examples. Again and again, the Times has called a potential Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities “preemptive.” But that's wrong. A “preemptive” attack is an attack you launch when the other side is about to attack you. It's the equivalent of shooting a guy reaching for their holster. What the Israeli government is considering is a “preventive” attack: the equivalent of shooting a guy you think may soon procure a gun. During the Iraq War debate, the Bush administration thumbed its nose at these definitions and called its impending invasion of Iraq “preemptive,” thus implying that Saddam was on the verge of attacking the U.S. Now the media are picking up where Bush left off, using the wrong term for an Israeli strike on Iran and therefore implying, with no evidence, that Iran is on the verge of nuking Tel Aviv.
The second example, as a smart friend recently pointed out to me, is “existential threat.” This month, a Times article declared that “Israel, which considers a nuclear Iran a threat to its existence, would not allow itself to be in a position where its fate was left in others' hands.” The sentence is absurd. Israel (singular) “considers” nothing; it's a nation of almost eight million people. To be sure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to consider Iran an existential threat, and the implication of the Times article is that their view is so widely shared that on this question, Israel virtually speaks as one. But that's simply not true. Netanyahu's own defense minister, Ehud Barak, although reportedly open to military action, said in 2009 that “Iran does not constitute an existential threat against Israel.” Meir Dagan, the man who led Israel's external spy agency, the Mossad, from 2002 to 2010, has said that “I don't think there is an existential threat” from Iran. Late last year, their successor, current Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, reportedly suggested the same thing. According to a recent Christian Science Monitor poll, a majority of Israelis disagree with Netanyahu as well.
How could the Times, America's best newspaper, and a paper clearly trying to learn from its Iraq mistakes, commit such similar ones again? The answer, I think, is that when politicians and government officials from different parties and different corners of government seem to agree on something, journalists often take it as fact. That's part of what happened on Iraq. Because the intelligence agencies and congressional Democrats mostly agreed with the Bush administration's claim that Saddam had WMD, journalists could safely assert it, too. And in a Washington culture that relies heavily on official sources, even journalists willing to think unconventional thoughts about Saddam's WMD had trouble finding credible sources willing to say so.
Today as well, politicians from both parties simply assume that Iran is pursuing a nuke. The intelligence agencies' willingness to challenge this assumption has helped journalists do the same. But beyond this particular question, the dynamic resembles the one preceding war with Iraq. Democrats and Republicans both use the term “preemptive.” The leaders of both parties insist that Iran represents a mortal threat to Israel, which cannot possibly be deterred. And so establishment journalists, who instinctively play between the yard lines established by the two parties, find it easy to repeat those assertions, too.
The Washington press is part of Washington culture. To challenge pro-war narratives, it usually needs establishment figures to lead the way. And when the left-of-center party won't challenge those narratives—as the Democrats refused to do on Iraq, and are refusing to do again on Iran—the press isn't likely to either.
Rosetta makes first detection of molecular nitrogen at a comet
It is in these cold outer reaches of our Solar System in which the family of comets that includes Rosetta's comet is believed to have formed.
Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the Solar System was forming. In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets. It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan, and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and Neptune's moon Triton.
The in situ detection of molecular nitrogen has long been sought at a comet. Nitrogen had only previously been detected to bound up in other compounds, including hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, for example.
Rosetta arrived last August, and has since been collecting extensive data on the comet and its environment with its suite of 11 science instruments.
ESA's Rosetta spacecraft has made the first measurement of molecular nitrogen at a comet, providing clues about the temperature environment in which Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko formed.
One scenario involves temperatures of between roughly –250ºC and perhaps –220ºC, with relatively inefficient trapping of molecular nitrogen in either amorphous water ice or cage-like water ice known as a clathrate, in both cases yielding a low ratio directly.
That ratio for Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko turns out to be about 25 times less than that of the expected protosolar value. The scientists think that this depletion may be a consequence of the ice forming at very low temperatures in the protosolar nebula.
The trapping of molecular nitrogen in ice in the protosolar nebula is thought to take place at temperatures similar to those required to trap carbon monoxide. So in order to put constraints on comet formation models, the scientists compared the ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide measured at the comet to that of the protosolar nebula, as calculated from the measured nitrogen to carbon ratio in Jupiter and the solar wind.
“Identifying molecular nitrogen places important constraints on the conditions in which the comet formed, because it requires very low temperatures to become trapped in ice,” says Martin Rubin of the University of Bern, lead author of the paper presenting the results published today in the journal Science .
The new results are based on 138 measurements collected by the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument, ROSINA, during 17–23 October 2014, when Rosetta was about 10 km from the centre of the comet.
Comet's orbit Alternatively, the molecular nitrogen could have been trapped more efficiently at even lower temperatures of around –253ºC in the same region as Pluto and Triton, resulting in relatively nitrogen-rich ices as seen on them. Subsequent heating of the comet through the decay of radioactive nuclides, or as Rosetta's comet moved into orbits closer to the Sun, could have been sufficient to trigger outgassing of the nitrogen and thus a reduction of the ratio over time. “This very low-temperature process is similar to how we think Pluto and Triton have developed their nitrogen-rich ice and is consistent with the comet originating from the Kuiper Belt,” says Martin. The only other body in the Solar System with a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere is Earth. The current best guess at its origin is via plate tectonics, with volcanoes releasing nitrogen locked in silicate rocks in the mantle. However, the question remains as to the role played by comets in delivering this important ingredient.
“Just as we wanted to learn more about the role of comets in bringing water to Earth, we would also like to place constraints on the delivery of other ingredients, especially those that are needed for the building blocks of life, like nitrogen,” says Kathrin Altwegg, also at the University of Bern, and principal investigator for ROSINA. To assess the possible contribution of comets like Rosetta's to the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere, the scientists assumed that the isotopic ratio of 14N to 15N in the comet is the same as that measured for Jupiter and solar wind, which reflects the composition of the protosolar nebula. However, this isotopic ratio is much higher than measured for other nitrogen-bearing species present in comets, such as hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. Earth's 14N/15N ratio lies roughly between these two values, and thus if there was an equal mix of the molecular form on the one hand, and in hydrogen cyanide and ammonia on the other in comets, it would be at least conceivable that Earth's nitrogen could have come from comets. “However, the amount of nitrogen found in 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko is not an equal mix between molecular nitrogen and the other nitrogen-bearing molecules. Rather, there is 15 times too little molecular nitrogen, and therefore Earth's 14N/15N ratio cannot be reproduced through delivery of Jupiter family comets like Rosetta's,” says Martin. “It's another piece of the puzzle in terms of the role of Jupiter family comets in the evolution of the Solar System, but the puzzle is by no means finished yet,” says ESA's Rosetta project scientist, Matt Taylor. “Rosetta is about five months away from perihelion now, and we'll be watching how the composition of the gases changes over this period, and trying to decipher what that tells us about the past life of this comet.”
Image copyright Reuters Image caption British firm Inmarsat compared data sent back from flight MH370 with similar aircraft
The British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat has now pretty much confirmed what the world had feared - that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was surely lost in the southern Indian Ocean, south-west of Australia.
The satellite operator was receiving hourly "pings" from equipment on board the plane for at least five hours after the aircraft left Malaysian airspace.
Initially, these pings - which were essentially just "I'm switched on" messages - were used to plot two broad arcs, indicating a possible position at last transmission, and therefore a direction of travel - one going to the north, the other heading south.
A northerly route for the plane always looked doubtful because it would have taken the aircraft towards countries with sophisticated air-defence systems. The chances of it avoiding detection seemed slim.
But after reviewing all of its flight MH370 data, Inmarsat is now confident the southern arc contained the true course.
Doppler effect
The company examined the frequency spectrum of the ping transmissions and how they differed from pings emitted by other Boeing 777 flights.
This allowed engineers to model how the frequency might change very slightly as a plane travels through the sky.
This is the famous Doppler effect, which acts to "stretch" or "compress" radio waves emanating from moving objects. With a moving police car, the equivalent sound effect is to change the pitch of the siren.
The analysis is cutting-edge and has never been done before, but it has enabled Inmarsat's engineers to confirm that the southerly arc intersected the path taken by flight MH370.
The analysis tells us nothing about the final location of the ill-fated plane. It tells us nothing about any changes in altitude that the plane flew, other than it was airborne.
Neither does it tell us about its speed or its fuel capacity at the times of those pings. All this technique really does at the moment is told us that the plane was moving one way rather than the other.
All that said, if certain assumptions are made about cruising speed, it is possible to narrow the likely zone of ocean over which the plane sent its seventh and last satellite connection. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has issued a map showing two different tracks - one for a constant speed of 450 knots; the other for 400 knots.
One has to remember that no-one knows how long the plane continued powered flight after the seventh ping, and it would likely have glided for a distance even after running out of fuel.
But the stomach-churning realisation that follows from the Inmarsat analysis is that the plane was moving far away from any landing possibility. The only conclusion can be that it did indeed eventually crash in the ocean.
Analysts will continue to probe the available data. Specifically, they are trying to understand the seventh ping - a partial connection - received just a few minutes after the sixth contact. What it means is uncertain. Possible explanations include technical glitches, power surges - it's all speculation at the moment. What is a puzzle is that a normal ping would not have been expected for nearly an hour.
People have asked whether the Inmarsat analysis is reliable, and the Chinese have demanded to examine all of the data themselves. But the London company's work has been checked by other satellite industry experts. There's high confidence the conclusions are robust.
Right 'haystack'
At least now search planes and ships know they are likely looking in the right "haystack", even if it is still a huge one.
But there is urgency. A lot of time has elapsed between the loss of the plane and confirmation that it surely fell into the southern Indian Ocean.
The priority is to get ships into the area to retrieve purported debris items, to help narrow the zone of the probable impact.
The flight recorders from flight MH370 will be close to that location, albeit about 3,500m down.
The batteries on these "black boxes" have perhaps a 30-day lifetime, meaning they will continue to ping their existence to searchers overhead for only a limited period.
When the batteries go flat, we move into a much more difficult phase - that of using remotely operated vehicles to actively look for the devices.
'Remoteness of area'
"The data on them should last for many years. We saw with Air France flight 447 that the black boxes were recovered two years after the fact, and the French were able to pull all the data off them," said Van Gurley from the Metron company, which took part in the search for flight 447.
"In this region of the Indian Ocean, the bottom is about two miles down. There are a number of technologies - sonar sleds and robotic vehicles - that can access that depth.
"The problem is the remoteness of the area because those robotic vehicles need a support ship and a support ship needs to occasionally go [into port] for fuel, water and food.
"So, given that the search area is 1,500 miles off Perth, just keeping ships on station for an extended period of time will be very challenging."
And Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, added: "We don't have very good maps of this region. It hasn't been surveyed much in the past.
"It doesn't have a strong interest in terms of the resources on the seabed. We've probably got better maps of the Moon's surface than this part of the seabed."

As we're all well aware now, FBI Director James Comey declined to recommend charges in the Hillary Clinton email scandal. Them willful disregard of national security in handing classified data on a server stored in their bathroom isn't worthy of charges, apparently.
Comey cited a lack of precedence in charging someone under similar circumstances, saying their bureau could not find a single case in which a person was charged with crimes for similar actions.
“In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information,” Comey brazenly announced, “we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.”
We really wish Mr. Comey would have consulted with us first.
Here's a brief rundown that anybody can do with a Google search, in which 10 people were actually punished for similar or lesser offenses than what Mrs. Clinton got away with yesterday.
Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser guilty of Destroying Documents in National Archives: “Sandy Berger … pleaded guilty in 2005 to illegally sneaking classified documents from the National Archives by stuffing papers in their suit. They later destroyed some of them in their office and lied about it.”
More from The Political Insider
State Department Official Fired and Security Clearance Revoked After Linking to Classified Wikileaks Document: Peter Van Buren, a foreign service officer for Hillary's State Department, was fired and their security clearance revoked for quoting a Wikileaks document AFTER publishing a book critical of Clinton. In fact, the Washington Post reported that one of their firing infractions was “showing ‘bad judgement' by criticizing Clinton and then-Rep. Michele Bachmann on their blog.”
Bill Clinton's CIA Director Was Pardoned During Plea Negotiations for Storing Classified Data on Home Computer: John Deutch, CIA director under President Clinton, was found to have classified information on a government-owned computer in their home several days after they left the CIA. They had to be pardoned in the middle of plea negotiations by Hillary's husband.
Navy engineer sentenced for mishandling classified material: Bryan Nishimura of Folsom, California, pled guilty to the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials during stints in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. Here's the money quote from the AP – “An FBI search of Nishimura's home turned up classified materials, but did not reveal evidence they intended to distribute them.” The exact words used to clear Hillary of their misdeeds. Instead, Nishimura was sentenced to two years probation, fined $7,500, and had to surrender their security clearance. Meanwhile, Clinton will be able to serve as Commander-in-Chief.
Sailor Smuggles Classified Docs off Ship: “A Navy intelligence specialist admitted Thursday that they smuggled classified documents out of Fort Bragg in folders and their pants pockets, then sold them for $11,500 to a man they believed was a Chinese agent.”
Low Level Submarine Shipmate Prosecuted for Less Serious Crime than Clinton: Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier allegedly used a cellphone camera to take photos in the classified engine room of the nuclear submarine where they worked as a mechanic, the USS Alexandria, then destroyed a laptop, camera and memory card after learning they were under investigation. They were indicted on one felony count of unlawful retention of national defense information and another felony count of obstruction of justice.
Marine Corps. Major Caught Sending Classified Documents to Superiors Using Personal Email: Maj. Jason Brezler was dismissed from the Marine Corps when they “accidentally took home 14 documents on their personal computer, some of which were classified.” According to the report, Brezler was “in a graduate school class when they received an urgent email from military officials in Afghanistan and sent a specific document in response, using their personal email account.”
Lab Tech Steals Data from Nuclear Facility. Jessica Lynn Quintana, a former worker at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, pleaded guilty in federal court to “knowingly removing classified information from the national security research laboratory, after they took home sensitive documents and data from the lab last year.”
NSA Manager gives Classified Info to Newspaper: A National Security Agency manager was indicted on allegations of willful retention of “national defense” or classified information, obstruction of justice and making a false statement, after they allegedly “passed classified information to a Baltimore Sun reporter who wrote stories exposing NSA mismanagement.” Charges were dropped and the NSA manager pleaded to a misdemeanor, in what was called a victory against the Obama administration whom had attempted to use dated laws to prosecute leakers of classified information. Now apparently, the administration is seemingly content with those intelligence leaks.
State Dept. Official Steals Classified Docs: Donald Willis Keyser earned over a year in prison when they “pled guilty to a three-count Criminal Information in which they admitted that they willfully and unlawfully removed classified documents and digital memory devices from the Department of State to their residence.” United States Attorney Chuck Rosenberg stated that Keyser “had an absolute obligation to safeguard the classified information entrusted to them and utterly failed to do so.” They then added, “His (Keyser's) sentence of imprisonment is a warning to others in positions of public trust.” Just not Hillary Clinton.

Elections To Replace Some Trump Cabinet Picks Looking Tighter Than Anticipated
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill Barrow/AP Bill Barrow/AP
Updated: Tues., 4/11/17, 9:50 a.m. ET
Democrats are hoping to prove that the growing opposition to President Trump is very real with an upset in one — or possibly even two — upcoming special congressional elections.
Their best chance is in Georgia's 6th District, where Republicans are scrambling to stop Democrat Jon Ossoff from winning the contest outright with a majority of the vote in an April 18 all-party primary.
But now there's growing concern over a previously sleepy race in Kansas to replace new CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Fearing a low-turnout election and an underperforming GOP candidate, Republicans are sending in their cavalry at the eleventh hour to prevent an upset in the race that's headed to the polls Tuesday.
That's still an unlikely outcome, but if Democrats keep the race in ruby red Kansas close, it could give them more momentum and optimism heading into Georgia the following week.
Ossoff and Democrats hope to "Make Trump Furious"
A 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional staffer, Ossoff has become a vehicle for the anti-Trump sentiment nationwide. They announced this week that they had raised an eye-popping $8.3 million in the race — an unheard of number for a congressional contest in such a short time. But 95 percent of that came from out-of-state donors, with the help of progressive blogs and celebrity endorsements.
Still, that money has allowed them to dwarf their opponents on air and build an impressive field organization that's put them just within reach of winning with a majority outright on April 18 — a nearly unthinkable feat in an 18-candidate field.
Republicans, at this point, just need to keep Ossoff below 50 percent and force them into a June 20 runoff, where they feel much better about the chances that one of several candidates who have emerged as top-tier challengers — most likely former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, Johns Creek City Councilman Bob Gray, state Sen. Judson Hill or former state Sen. Dan Moody — would have against Ossoff then.
Congressional Leadership Fund YouTube
National Republican groups have poured about $4 million into the race to knock down Ossoff, looking to tie them to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — still toxic with the GOP base and a motivating factor to turn out their voters, Republicans say — at and to argue he's tried to embellish their national security credentials.
One ad last week from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a superPAC with ties to House leadership, went for the jugular by pointing out Ossoff's documentary company had received money from "Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists."
This is the type of district that's primed for a possible upset — even though now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price won re-election easily here time after time, Trump carried Georgia's 6th District by only 1 point last year after Mitt Romney won it by 23 points in 2012. This is the northern Atlanta suburbs — a growing, diverse and well-educated area, just like the places where Trump struggled mightily last fall.
With the GOP field fractured, Ossoff has been able to corral their considerable resources into a sizable advantage, and their best shot is to deliver a knockout punch and win the April 18 contest outright. If he's pushed into a runoff, and the race becomes a more traditional contest and GOP attacks have more time to permeate, winning Tom Price's old House seat looks much harder for Ossoff.
Panic in Kansas?
This contest on Tuesday is giving Republicans some late heartburn, as they're worried about a low-turnout contest, a depressed GOP base and an underperforming nominee.
Unlike the Georgia district up for grabs next week, the 4th Congressional District in Kansas, which includes Wichita, is one Trump won comfortably by 27 points. But the race has largely flown under the radar, and Republicans worry their base may not show up for GOP nominee Rob Estes, the state treasurer.
So in the eleventh hour, Republicans are now sending in their cavalry. The National Republican Congressional Committee went up with an ad last week hitting Democratic nominee James Thompson on their position on abortion rights, Vice President Pence has recorded a robo-call on Estes' behalf and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — who won Kansas big in the state's presidential caucuses last year — will campaign with Estes on Monday.
Also working against Republicans is Gov. Sam Brownback's unpopularity in the state, and Thompson has tried to tie Estes to the governor.
Ultimately, the late help will still probably be enough to pull Estes over the finish line on Tuesday, and there's been no major late surge of interest by national Democrats in the race that would signify that they have a real chance of pulling off an upset. In fact, the state party turned down requests from Thompson for help last month.
But a closer-than-expected result could only give Democrats more momentum and optimism heading into Georgia the following week.
Is Montana next on upset watch?
If there's an upset in Georgia and if the Kansas contest is close, expect progressive activists to turn their sights to this May 25 contest between Republican Greg Gianforte and Democrat Rob Quist to become the state's lone representative in the House.

Democrats have been able to break through in the state's gubernatorial and Senate races (though Sen. Jon Tester is a top target in 2018) but they haven't held the state's only House seat in almost two decades.
And without a significant late shift toward Quist, Gianforte, a wealthy software executive who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, still looks poised to win.
Progressive groups such as the Daily Kos and Democracy for America have looked to boost Quist, a banjo-playing folk and bluegrass singer who has written their own campaign song. The Democratic nominee, who's making their first run for office, has jabbed at Gianforte for keeping a low profile while Quist has held town halls across the state.
Quist, however, has their own problems with tax liens, which they have blamed on medical costs and insurance prices, according to Montana Public Radio. The GOP superPAC Congressional Leadership Fund has already hit Quist with $700,000 in attack ads, too, painting them as too liberal.
Ultimately, the GOP-lean of the state which Trump won by 21 points and Gianforte's deep pockets still looks like too much for Democrats to overcome. But, like Kansas, this one could take on a life of its own late in the game.
Remember, special elections are still special
If Democrats are able to pull off wins in any of these contests, the party will be crowing that this spells doom for President Trump and Republicans in the 2018 midterms. And, to be sure, it would be a devastating blow for any House seat this early on in Trump's already-struggling presidency to switch hands — especially ones previously held by their Cabinet members.
Ultimately, House special elections are snapshots in time — and right now Democrats need to be able to prove their opposition to Trump, with protests and marches, isn't just all talk and no results. Winning one of these races would prove they can turn their grass-roots' anti-Trump sentiment into real blowback at the ballot box.
But it's also not a guarantee of future success, and if Ossoff wins, for example, he'd start out with a target on their back in 2018, when the weird dynamics of a multicandidate field aren't in play and he'd have much more trouble raising millions of dollars if they aren't the only game in town.
However, if Ossoff doesn't win, that isn't a signal, either, of Democratic fortunes in 2018. Democrats have plenty of other targets beyond Georgia's 6th District to put the House in play, as well. Midterm elections of a first-term president are a referendum on the commander in chief, and if Trump's approval continues to sink and their administration continues to be mired in controversy, there will by myriad opportunities for Democrats.
California and South Carolina: the other races
Beyond that trio of more compelling contests, there are two other vacancies still to be voted on. The 23-way California contest to succeed now-state Attorney General Xavier Becerra in California's 34th Congressional District was whittled down April 4, with Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez and Los Angeles Planning Commissioner Robert Lee Ahn advancing to a June 6 runoff.
Progressive groups had hoped to get one of their favorite candidates through in this Los Angeles district where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary last year. But with that vote splintered, Ahn was able to edge through, benefiting from a growing Asian population in the district.
Gomez was the front-runner to begin with, and probably remains as such in the runoff. They raised the most money of any candidate in the race and has secured endorsements from many Democratic insiders, including Becerra.
In South Carolina, whoever wins the GOP nomination in the 5th Congressional District will be a near-lock to succeed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.
The overwhelming number of votes in this race will come from York County, the largest area of the district that's seen a boom as a growing suburb of Charlotte. Former state Rep. Ralph Norman, whose family owns a major real estate development company in the area, already has a base in the area, and they resigned from the Legislature to focus on the race. State House Speaker Pro Tempore Tommy Pope represents part of the district's base in Columbia, too, and they already have name recognition in the state from being the lead prosecutor on the high-profile 1994 case of Susan Smith, the mother who was found guilty of drowning their two young sons in a car.
The primary is on May 2, and Republicans in the state say Pope and Norman have the best chance to advance to a likely May 16 runoff if no candidate gets a majority. But former state GOP Chairman Chad Connelly, who was faith engagement director for the Republican National Committee, has run a strong campaign too and could pull in votes from heavily evangelical voters.
Ultimately, the GOP primary is shaping up to be a contest about who's the most conservative, and don't expect to see candidates shirk away from Trump as they play up their praise of Mulvaney. Whoever wins the nomination will be the heavy favorite come June.
Democrats haven't held the seat since John Spratt, the then-Budget Committee chairperson, was defeated by Mulvaney in 2010, and the seat has only gotten more Republican since then, voting for Trump by almost 20 points.
I want to be as fair-minded as I can in what I am about to say. Now, the media acts like the government has been running better than a Swiss watch for the last eight years. And I don't want to sit here and act like it ran like a Swiss watch the eight years before that, either. Nor will it run like one going forward. Why? Because it is still the government we are talking about. One man isn't wholly responsible for this train wreck we see before us. But what's more, one man will not be fully responsible for future messes, as much as the media would have us believe.
I will save time and refer to our federal government as Guv from here on. Look here, Guv, the population of homeless people has been increasing every year. Now, how is it that you're able to run around and blather this nonsense about us being “the greatest nation on Earth” when every city park looks like a refugee camp? And why do they look like refugee camps? Because they are! They're economic refugees! You clowns have collectively spent the prosperity of three or four generations now! And for what? The Vietnam War? The Iraq War? This horrifying nightmare you brought to us trying to bring Dumbocracy to Syria? I see the homeless every day. More than half are seriously mentally ill. No, let local police handle it, right?
Speaking of the homeless, there are flyers and handbills everywhere telling homeless veterans where they can try and get help. No, not from the VA. I'm talking hot meals, showers, a place to sleep. Some of them are so recently discharged, you can hear their dogtags still jangling under their shirts as they walk. See, these are the results of your trying to bring “democracy” to people who will fight tooth and nail to keep your version of that out of their countries. But you're done with them, right? Again, let the local police handle it. We've got a war to start with Russia, after all.
Why are the most advertised Gold and Silver coins NOT the best way to invest?
I'm tired of hearing this nonsense about how great Guv has been for the last eight years. Sorry, but this is the same Guv that has been in control for over a couple hundred years now and they've done nothing but pauperize huge swathes of the nation that used to have economic stability. Tax this, tax that, pass this law, sign BS trade treaties over here, jail people for smoking weed, and on and on it goes. We have more people per capita in prison than the Soviets had socked away in gulags and you jokers want to tell me we're so great? Flush out your headgear, dummies. You jail people over smoking some flowers while you people commit multiple felonies, torture human beings, start illegal wars, and kill people all over the planet and not one of you—not one!—sees a day of jail time for it. No, jail is also the relocation camp for the economic refugees your insane policies have created. And the mentally ill, too, by the way. KBETHOS Make America G...

The poor, yeah, you're all so keen on us, aren't you? As if we're cute little waifs in a Norman Rockwell painting that you condescend to flip a dime to on the street corner. Excuse me, but the fundraisers you all attend cost $25,000 a plate. That's more than we earn in a year! And, what, Guv? You think you KNOW us and what our needs are? Many of us haven't even heard of the crap you serve at these shindigs and you want to act like you're in solidarity with us? Here's a news flash for you: I don't trust any of you and I don't even like any of you. I've seen too many broken promises. Too many people that went to jail for weed while you people, again, committed multiple felonies and flippin' walked.
You do these stupid things like provoking the Russians—the Russians!—and act like we're all behind you on this? Yeah? We're the one that will be incinerated. If we're lucky. You'll all be hiding in those bunkers you built for yourselves with that 100 year supply of Xanax and heaven alone knows what other drugs you stashed away down there. Right, no jail terms for you! Let some poor soul have a bottle of Xanax without a prescription, they go to jail. You guys stash a century's worth of it for a couple thousand people to party like it's Doomsday (because it is) and they probably high-fived throughout the Pentagon and put in a few purchase requisitions for Quaaludes.
Look here, Guv, what makes you think you're so dang smart? Smart people don't get into wars they can't win because they don't get into wars. Look at the Swiss. They make nice watches. They make lots of nice stuff besides that. Why? Because they're not flushing away their prosperity down the commode on senseless wars that drain the economy. You run around with this BS meme that “war is good for the economy” and the only “economy” it's good for is the offshore one the CIA has through black markets, shell corporations, and bogus bank accounts. Man, the German SS had nothing on these guys! Those bush league buffoons in black uniforms wouldn't make it through Day One at Langley. Not crooked enough. Great team you've got there, Guv. CIA means Crooks In America.
You created a humanitarian disaster in Syria and a war of epic proportions. That war will not be truly be over for a decade, I'll bet. And the terrorist attacks coming from it will plague Europe and the United States for two decades, at least. And for what?! Democracy?! My word, do any of you realize what you have done?! Almost 300,000 people dead and more to die and you think they care about voting for some charlatan with a pass key to the bathroom at Langley? If this goes on, in order to have elections in Syria, you'll need to hold a mass séance. You spent how many hundreds of millions of dollars on this insane war and vets from the last one are sleeping on the streets. Bravo, Guv! Outstanding performance! Those Hollywood celebrity policy parrots will be glad to play you in the next movie to glorify this endless slaughter. Then you can invite them up to the White House and give them the ear you have long refused to give to the real people who aren't playing real people on TV.
You see, Guv, I am not fooled by this. I know that it doesn't matter who is president, the United States military, probably on orders from the CIA, will continue to provoke the Russian military until someone gets nervous and shoots. Bravo! The border skirmish we've all been waiting for! Now we can jump right in and lose another war. Notify local police departments across America that the homeless population will soon be increasing rather rapidly. Well, those who live anyway. Right, let's park American troops in Poland. Because that's right where the last world war we had begun in earnest. Might as well keep using a winning combination, right? Those poor, duped Poles. Waving American flags as American tanks and Humvees roll in. And none of them know they're expendable and we can't beat the Russians in a conventional war. Meaning Krakow will be a smoking, radioactive crater within 48 hours of a border skirmish escalating into a full-scale launch-on-warning. Let's see you wave American flags then.
And how does a war with Russia help us, exactly? Oh, I know! Then we can pass more wartime measures, more laws that will probably govern and dictate when a red flag needs to pop up on a Homeland Security because someone checked out a “flagged” book at a public library in Twin Falls, Idaho. “Patriotic Americans will not read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, or any such Russky propaganda! We have instructed public libraries to remove these books from their shelves and give us a list of names of who has checked them out over the last twenty years! If any librarian refuses to do so, they or they will be subject to arrest as a person-of-interest! And anyone found in possession of music by Shostakovich is subject to arrest! Let no one even think of cooking Beef Stroganoff! After all, if it saves just one life…” That's how you think, isn't it, Guv? Everyone is a suspect, everyone is guilty. Except you, Guv. And you're the one actually committing the crimes! Brilliant! Perfect alibi! “How can I be the crook? I wrote the laws!”
So don't hand me this crap that the government has been rolling along, slick as you please, for the past eight years. The government has rolled the world into a humanitarian disaster. The government is rolling the world into another world war. And the most fascinating thing about it is that most of Europe, who will be the nuclear battlefield as far as the first salvos of tactical nukes go, thinks that Guv has not been behind it! And practically begs Guv to provoke the Russians even more! Ukraine changed hands between Russia and Poland for hundreds of years and, what, now we're concerned about it? Gosh, how did they ever manage to bicker over this piece of territory while the United States was busy shooting its indigenous population in the name of Manifest Destiny? Right, Guv, you've got the proven track record on what can and cannot be done with lands and populations one side deems up for grabs, right? As long as you apologize for shooting them later, it's all good. What? Give the land back? No, Guv has moved on. Now Guv tells other countries to give back land or enforces no-fly zones. And Europe seems to forget what their cities looked like the last time the Russians came through. And Guv, too, for that matter. Crippled America: How ... Donald J. Trump Best Price: $0.10 Buy New $6.73 (as of 03:55 EST - Details)
Right, everything has been just peaches and cream for the last eight years. Gosh, I know I'm impressed. Russia is conducting mass civil defense drills for the first time since the end of the Cold War. They've fielded another 100 thermonuclear warheads with dozens of new ICBMs. Gee, Guv, sure is a smart move to put troops into places where the possibility of a border clash is certain. Or, perhaps, some trigger-happy Polish soldier decides to “get even” and takes a shot at the Russians and hides behind an American tank. Or some Estonian. Or some U.S. naval vessel fires on a passing Russian warplane. “We can't let the Russians embarrass us!” Indeed. It's certainly worth the deaths of several billions of people to ensure we are never embarrassed.
It sure is swell to see everyone feel that the CIA is now telling us the truth. At least the news media does. Why not? Many of them probably get press releases from some press agency funded by In-Q-Tel. Look that one up. Right, CIA venture capital firm. Gee, Guv, exactly what companies do they fund anyway? Or do you even know? Of course they must be telling us the truth. Like they told us the truth about Iraq. And Syria. Now, we know the CIA tortured people. So if the news media affords this organization impeccable truthiness, it would be like the news telling us in 1939, “Oh, yes, we know the Soviets tampered with our elections. The Gestapo told us so!” Why not? Guv brought over several Nazi war criminals here during Operation Paperclip and afforded credibility to them, too. Must be where Guv learned it.
Nazi war criminals helped us win the Space Race, too. The one liberals think was so peaceful and not about proving who had the most accurate ballistic missiles. “If we can put a man on the moon, we can drop a warhead right into Leonid Brezhnev's vodka tumbler!” Later, they padlocked psychiatric hospitals, shook them all out on to the streets, and built the Space Shuttle. Yay! The Guv-lovers all want more money spent on NASA. Well, in order to do that, we need to order local governments to build more city parks. That way, there will be a place for the burgeoning population of homeless to be sequestered. Then we can afford to send a mission to Mars to prove that planet is less viable than Death Valley. But, hey, we'll beat the Russians to another orbiting sphere of lifeless rock! I understand Guv entertains notions of building a “base” on Mars. More likely, a secret prison for “unlawful enemy combatants” and other non-people who no longer exists. “It's not on Earth! So no laws regarding the treatment of human beings apply! On Mars, we don't even have to think of them as human beings!” But, no worries. They won't be able to afford to cart the homeless up there.
Sell this government to someone else. I'm not buying it.

I got my really generous Trick or Treat gift!
It came in the mail today and I picked it up after voting (Canadian elections were today- so it feels like a treat for voting haha).
I have a big sweet tooth lately and my santa sent over two huge boxes of assorted candies! One of them is a Hershey's chocolate mix- Mr.Big (a nostalgic favorite), Reeses Cups (the candy I would gladly trade anything for as a kid in Halloween) Reeses Pieces and Chocolate with Almond cream-- that one sounds delicious and I don't think I've ever tried it. The other box was a Skittles Starburst mix- Sour and Original Skittles and mini packs of starbursts. I'm tempted to just eat them all, but really I should share... I'm going Trick or Treating with my little cousin so I'm gonna make them up a generous treat bag. I mentioned my cousin to my Santa and they also sent over a great colouring book for us to do- she's gonna be SO excited. I got hyped up for Halloween anyway, since it's such an awesome time of year, but THIS is gonna be something they aren't expecting.
THANK YOU SANTA! YOU'RE A GHOULISH GENIUS!!!
Ten years ago, I put solar panels on my roof and began eating locally grown food. I bought an energy-efficient refrigerator that uses the power equivalent of a single light bulb. I started heating my home with a stove that burns organically fertilized corn kernels. I even restored a gas-free lawn mower for manual yardwork.
As a longtime environmental activist, I was deeply alarmed by new studies on global warming, so I went all out. I did my part.
Now I'm changing my life again. Today, underneath the solar panels, there's a new set of deadbolt locks on all my doors. There's a new Honda GX390 portable power generator in my garage, ready to provide backup electricity. And last week I bought a starter kit to raise tomatoes and lettuce behind barred basement windows.
I'm not a survivalist or an "end times" enthusiast. When it comes to climate change, I'm just a realist.
I haven't given up the cause. I still work overtime to promote clean energy, and I take solace when top climate scientists say we can still avoid the worst effects of global warming if we move quickly. It's just that, well, we're running out of time.
The proof is everywhere - outside my front door, in my neighborhood, on the news. After a decade of failure to address climate change at the national and international levels, our weather has gone haywire. In the Washington region alone, in barely a year, we've annihilated all records for snow accumulation, we've seen appalling power outages associated with year-round thunderstorms, and we've experienced the hottest summer in the 140 years we've been measuring. Winston Churchill's oft-quoted warning on the eve of World War II now applies directly: "The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences."
Those consequences explain the generator in my garage and why I'm reinforcing my basement windows to protect emergency supplies.
This may seem like a stunt, or a sign that this frustrated environmentalist has finally lost it. But I'm not crazy. Just wait. The mega-storms and social disruptions on the horizon will be the best proof of that.
It wasn't the wildfires that blackened much of Russia last summer that led me to buy my portable generator, nor the unspeakable rains in Pakistan that inundated nearly a quarter of that country. It was the one-two punch of thunderstorms that blew through the D.C. area on July 25 and Aug. 12 of last year. The first storm, with wind gusts of 90 mph, knocked out power to 400,000 people and generated a wave of lightning that, by a freak tragedy, killed my friend Carl Henn at a community picnic in Rockville.
The second storm hit while I was in the parking lot of a TV station in Northwest Washington, about to be interviewed about Arctic ice melt. Suddenly, darkness overcame us, and it became midnight at 8 a.m. The street lamps flickered on. Cars turned on their headlights. And I saw the largest, darkest, windiest thunderstorm I'd ever seen, approaching from the west. I whipped out my cellphone and called my wife in Takoma Park. "Go to the basement now!" I said. Inside the TV studio, I watched the anchors switch to a live report about apartment dwellers trapped by a massive fallen oak as the first of more than 100,000 homes began to lose power. Houses across the area were ripped open by wind and crashing tree trunks.
Throughout 2010, my neighborhood lost power more times than I can remember. This included blackouts during the "Snowmageddon" storms, of course, when Washington traded in sidewalks for white trenches and roads for deep canyons. And yes, major snowfall events are increasing in the eastern United States even as the planet warms, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
It makes sense, too. We're not setting records for average low temperatures, after all. Not even close. We're setting records for precipitation intensity across a huge swath of America, in summer and in winter. A warmer atmosphere evaporates more water from oceans and lakes. And what goes up must come down. Last year was the wettest year on record worldwide, NOAA announced last month. That's what's driving the snow extremes - while the mercury rises.
Some months ago it became known that the German Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst - BND) was spying on Turkey. Turkey's political leadership was none too happy. Yet the BND has good reasons to keep a watchful eye on Ankara. It is not only the crises in Iraq and Syria, drug-smuggling, people-trafficking and the activities of the PKK that make Turkey a legitimate target for German intelligence. For quite some time, evidence is mounting that Ankara is trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
Over the past two decades, discussions within the nuclear community about emerging nuclear powers always centred on the "usual suspects": Iran, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, South Korea and Turkey. Not surprisingly, opinions as to the likelihood of a military nuclear program differed. In the case of Iran, for example, the evidence appeared solid. By contrast, the case of Turkey was built on vague indications.
This list of likely nuclear aspirants has not changed since, yet the likelihood of a Turkish nuclear weapons program has increased dramatically. Simply put: the Western intelligence community now largely agrees that Turkey is working both on nuclear weapon systems and on their means of delivery. Iran is the model to emulate. Consequently, Turkey has started a large-scale civilian nuclear program, justified by the country's urgent energy needs. In 2011, Turkey concluded a $20bn contract with the Russian company ROSATOM on a large reactor complex. Two years later, a similar agreement was concluded with a Japanese-French consortium, this time over $22bn. President Erdoğan also announced yet another power plant, to be built entirely by indigenous personnel.
So far, so good, one might say. After all, nuclear energy seems like a sensible option to at least partially meet Turkey's demand for affordable energy. However, a thorough analysis of the contracts reveals that these projects are not just about improving Turkey's energy supply. Turkey has also consciously opened the door to a military nuclear option.
Proposals for constructing a light-water reactor usually consist not just of a commitment to build the plant according to agreed specifications and timelines, but also commitments to run the project for sixty years, to provide the required low enriched uranium and to take back the spent fuel rods. Such offers were put forward by both Rosatom and the Japanese-French consortium. However, in both cases, Turkey insisted that the deal would neither include the provision of uranium nor the return of the spent fuel rods. Ankara wanted to deal with this matter separately at a later stage. Turkey never provided an explanation for this decision. However, the intention behind this unusual maneuvering is not difficult to fathom. Turkey wants to maintain the option to run the reactors with its own low enriched uranium and to reprocess the spent fuel rods itself. This, in turn, means that Turkey intends to enrich uranium, at least to a low level.
And there is more. The option to provide low enriched uranium to currently eight agreed reactors—Turkey is planning twenty-three projects in total—indicates the scope of Turkey's envisioned enrichment effort. The path that Turkey wants to take is clear: to follow in Iran's footsteps. According to President Rouhani, Iran wants to build sixteen reactors by 2030, which are supposed to be powered by indigenously enriched uranium, although much of this low enriched uranium is earmarked for high enrichment and thus for the production of weapons-grade fuel. Of course, Turkey vehemently denies any intention to enrich uranium. However, Turkey has declared on many occasions that it will always insist on its “rights” deriving from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and that it regards enrichment for peaceful use as perfectly legal. That the Turkish government is at pains to justify its rejection of an external supply of low enriched uranium while not admitting a national interest in enrichment was illustrated by a statement made by the Turkish Minister for Energy, Taner Yildiz, in January 2014. Yildiz argued that the refusal to contractually settle the uranium supply with the asupervisorstioned companies was due to Turkey's desire to understand the full nuclear fuel cycle. Not only does Yildiz' explanation appear weak; Turkey's declaratory nuclear policy also seems to follow the path taken by Iran: one only admits what in light of the facts can no longer be denied.
Turkey's motives for rejecting the continuous uranium supply by its Russian and Japanese-French business partners may appear dubious; its rejection to return the spent fuel rods to the supplying countries is outright disastrous, as it allows for only one conclusion: Turkey is bent on producing plutonium for making weapons. While reprocessing would indeed allow the reuse of the spent uranium, such an option is merely theoretical, since fuel rods made from reprocessed material are far more expensive than those made from “new” uranium. It is for this reason that reprocessing of spent uranium is hardly being conducted anymore.
With its rejection to return the spent fuel rods, Turkey is embarking on the pathway to the bomb. The common counterargument, according to which the separation of the “dirty” plutonium would require a sophisticated reprocessing plant that currently does not exist in Turkey, remains unconvincing. Studies have shown that such a plant can be built within half a year and would be the size of a regular office building. Moreover, the widespread belief that in order to build a nuclear weapon, one requires weapons-grade plutonium with an impurity level of at most 7 percent, is long obsolete. Already in 1945, General Groves, the leader of the “Manhattan Project,” noted that due to the shortage of pure plutonium, the United States would soon be forced to use material with an impurity level of up to 20 percent. In 1962, the United States detonated a plutonium bomb in Nevada that had an impurity level of 23 percent. Finally, if the fuel rods of a light water reactor do not remain inside the reactor for several years, which is the economically viable option, but are removed after only six to twelve months, one ends up with weapons-grade plutonium. The Iranian reactor Bushehr offers a telling example. If the reactor were powered down after eight months and the fuel rods removed, Iran would own 150 kilogrammes of plutonium with an impurity level of only 10 percent—the equivalent of twenty-five Nagasaki-category bombs. In short, the weaponization of plutonium has many facets.
The assumption that Turkey is aiming for nuclear weapons is also supported by the country's activities towards creating the entire nuclear fuel cycle. As has been revealed by a well-connected information service, German intelligence reported that as far back as May 2010, Prime Minister Erdoğan had demanded to secretly start preparing for the construction of sites to enrich uranium. Accordingly, Turkey has started to produce Yellowcake, a chemically compressed uranium ore. Yellowcake is converted to gas, which is then enriched in centrifuges. To date, nothing is publicly known about a conversion plant in Turkey, yet according to the BND, Turkey is already in possession of enriched uranium originating from a former Soviet republic and smuggled via Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina with the help of the Mafia. It would not come as a surprise if Turkey already had centrifuges to enrich uranium. After all, Turkey was involved in the activities of Pakistani nuclear smuggler Abdul Qadeer Khan, who between 1987 and 2002 sold thousands of centrifuges to Iran, North Korea and Libya. The electronics of these centrifuges came from Turkey. Khan had even contemplated moving their entire illegal production capacity of centrifuges to Turkey. In 1998, then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif offered Turkey a “nuclear partnership” on nuclear research. Moreover, there is still an organic partnership between both countries dating back to Turkey's support for Pakistan's nuclear program. Back then, many of the components that Pakistan could not acquire openly were shipped via Turkey to Pakistan. With this backdrop, it does not come as a surprise when intelligence services report that to this day there is a dynamic scientific exchange between both countries.
The question of whether Turkey already has centrifuges and where they may have come from can probably be answered without the recourse to any revelations by intelligence services. At the same time, this might help solve one of the last enigmas of the history of nuclear proliferation: the search for the “fourth customer” of A.Q. Khan. In mid-2003, a shipment of centrifuge parts and tools intended for Libya “disappeared” during a journey from Malaysia via Dubai to Tripoli. It had been ordered—and probably already paid for—by President Gaddafi as part of a major deal on 10,000 centrifuges intended to turn Libya into a nuclear power. The sender of the shipment was A.Q. Khan, who had ordered a company in Malaysia to buy the components from all over the world and ship them to Libya.
Kobe Bryant's final game got bumped.
It's almost inconceivable that this happened, but here we are. The scheduling gods have looked down upon Bryant and decided to laugh.
Bryant's last game will take place on Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz at 10:30 p.m. ET, the exact moment of the tip-off between the Golden State Warriors and the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors will be going for their 73rd win of the season, which would break what many believed to be an unbreakable 72-win record set by Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the rest of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls.
Faced with a tough decision, ESPN decided to go with current greatness as opposed to celebrating past greatness. They bumped Bryant's final game, opting to televise the Warriors game on ESPN instead.
… But don't worry. Bryant's game will be on ESPN2.
It's the right decision, albeit one that's mostly symbolic. (Who has ESPN and not ESPN2?) Bryant's last game is important, and their career deserves to be celebrated, but from a watchability standpoint, I'm much more excited to watch the Warriors machine go for greatness than I am watching Jazz players loosely guard Bryant while they go 8 for 19 in a game the Lakers lose by 12.
Again: ESPN did the right thing.
It is a bummer about the timing, though. For as much as Bryant has become a bit of a joke in the past couple years — the aging former star refusing to admit what's happening to their body, the ultimate competitor taking long 2s in a game the Lakers are losing by 25 — it's important to remember that Bryant is one of the five greatest players to ever play the game of basketball.
It's more than the 81-point game or the five titles, though good lord, that right there is enough to put someone in the Hall of Fame. For me, the thing about Bryant is looking at the sustained greatness.
(Though for good measure, it's fun to watch highlights from that 81-point game.)
They were an 18-time All-Star, which yeah a few of them were padded by fans voting them in past their prime, but they were also an 11x first team All-NBA player, two-time second team and two-time third team player. For fifteen years Bryant was considered one of the best 15 players in the league. The average NBA career length is 4.8 years. Bryant was one of the 15 best players, one of the six best guards, for 15 years. That is flabbergasting.
There are a lot of what-ifs with Bryant's career, all of which make you wonder that despite their near peerless resume, if they didn't leave some of it on the table.
There's the age-old: What if they and Shaquille O'Neal had worked out their differences? They won three titles together, and didn't appear to be slowing down when the strain got too much and O'Neal left the team. How many titles did they leave on the table by breaking the band up? One? Two? More?
The other big what-if with regards to Bryant are the Chris Paul trade, which would have sent Paul to the Lakers in 2011 … until the league pulled the plug on the deal. Paul ended up going to the Clippers. The deal was done, though, and it makes you wonder if a re-energized laker could have made another run at a title or two.
This is insane to think about, considering they won five titles, but there's a universe in which Kobe Bryant is an eight, or dare I say it, nine-time NBA champion.
Over the last few years, the league changed on Bryant. The Lakers, a long-time top destination for free agents, lost their luster, partly because players realized they didn't need to be in a big market to grab endorsements and partly because the death of Dr. Jerry Buss left the team without its leader in the front office.
The rise of small ball and the three pointer left Bryant, never an elite long-distance shooter, looking out of touch and hopelessly stuck in the past. Once feared and adored, Bryant became — at least in some pockets of the internet — a bit of a joke. I too am guilty of this.
For every long contested two they took and every insane interview they gave, I chuckled. And when I heard that the Warriors were going to bump Bryant in their final game, I wasn't mad. Of course they were getting bumped. And it was just to ESPN2. If anyone really wants to see Bryant say goodbye, they can flip over during commercials.
I stand by that take. The Warriors are going for something great, and they deserve to be watched. But that doesn't change the fact that the timing is unfortunate.
2010 has been the deadliest year yet for coalition troops in Afghanistan, with 709 troops killed, 497 of those from the U.S. American officials have spoken of a fragile progress, with a possible small drawdown of troops starting next summer, keeping 2014 as the goal date for Afghans to take control. The United Nations released a report saying that more than 2,400 Afghan civilians were killed and more than 3,800 injured in the first 10 months of 2010, with 76% of these casualties being caused by "anti-government elements". The report also shows deaths and injuries caused by "pro-government forces" (U.S. and NATO troops, Afghan army and police) accounted for 12% of civilian casualties, an 18% drop from the same time period last year. Collected here are images of the country and conflict over the past month, part of an ongoing monthly series on Afghanistan . ( 43 photos total
With Simone Zaza, Mario Mandzukic and Paulo Dybala all joining Juventus this summer, the Spanish international's future has come under scrutiny.
Tuttosport report that despite interest from Porto and Tottenham Hotspur, Rafa Benitez is keen to bring Llorente to the Bernabeu.
The clubs are yet to agree a deal but Llorente is said to be open to the idea of the switch.
The newspaper believes a deal could be announced at some point in the next week.
OUR VIEW
Llorente was one of the most sought after forwards in world football back in 2012 after an excellent season under the watchful eye of Marcelo Bielsa. Their decision to run down their contract with the club and leave on a free in 2013 was met with derision from the club's support. Their decision to move to Juve was borne of a desire to win silverware – and while they have undoubtedly done that they have never really been first choice.
However, their strike rate at Juve stands at an impressive 23 in 65 league games and they would be a massive asset at Real. Furthermore, they would add another - more aerially physical - dimension to their attack.
The Secret Service is running out of funding to pay agents needed to protect President Trump and their family because of an unprecedented number of White House protectees and because of frequent travel, according to USA Today.
"The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,'' Service Service Director Randolph "Tex" Alles told USA Today in an interview. "I can't change that. I have no flexibility."
In a statement Monday, Alles said that the Secret Service has the funding it needs to meet all mission requirements through Sept. 30 within the statutory pay caps, but the agency estimates that about 1,100 will work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps through December.
As a result, the director is discussing with members of Congress to raise the caps from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for the rest of Mr. Trump's first term, CBS News confirmed.
"To remedy this ongoing and serious problem, the agency has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and the Congress over the past several months to find a legislative solution," Alles said in their statement Monday. "As we work to ensure that employees are compensated for the hours they work, the Secret Service continues its rigorous hiring of special agents, Uniformed Division officers, and critical support staff to meet future mission requirements."
The agency experienced a similar funding shortage in 2016 during the Obama administration that resulted in legislation that allowed agents to exceed pay caps.
The agency has also had to deal with frequent travel by the president to their properties along the East Coast such as in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey as well as vacations taken by other members of their family, the report said. Tiffany Trump's trip to Berlin earlier this summer cost taxpayers over $22,000 in hotel costs for the Secret Service agents who accompanied them And just a few weeks ago, Eric Trump's trip to visit the family's golf course in Ireland cost over $7,000 in hotel costs for agents. These costs do not include airfare, overtime, compensation for agents or vehicle rentals.
CBS News' Laura Strickler confirmed Monday that according to federal purchase orders, the Secret Service has spent at least $73,000 on golf cart rentals at both Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster. The agency also spent $64,000 to inspect elevators at Trump Tower, which is standard operating procedure when a protectee goes to a building with elevators, according to the Secret Service. Tiffany Trump's trip to Berlin earlier this summer cost taxpayers over $22,000 in hotel costs for the Secret Service agents who accompanied them
And just a few weeks ago, Eric Trump's trip to visit the family's golf course in Ireland cost over $7,000 in hotel costs for agents. These costs do not include airfare, overtime, compensation for agents or vehicle rentals. Donald and Eric Trump's trip to Uruguay in January cost over $97,000 in hotel costs for Secret Service agents.
The Secret Service protects 18 members of the president's family, with 42 people in total, CBS confirmed. During the Obama administration, agents protected 31 people.

The International Space Station's last set of U.S. solar arrays are slightly deployed in this predawn view from exterior cameras caught on March 20, 2009. The arrays were to be fully extended later that day.
With the Space Shuttle Discovery scheduled to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday, skywatchers across much of the United States and southern Canada is in for a real treat on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
Weather permitting, there will be a few opportunities to see both the Discovery orbiter and the ISS flying across the sky from many locations.
The sight should easily be visible to anyone, even from brightly lit cities.
Other satellites too
The appearance of either the space shuttle or the space station moving across the sky is not in itself unusual. On any clear evening within a couple of hours of local sunset and with no optical aid, you can usually spot several orbiting Earth satellites creeping across the sky like moving stars. Satellites become visible only when they are in sunlight and the observer is in deep twilight or darkness. This usually means shortly after dusk or before dawn.
What makes the prospective upcoming passages so interesting is that you'll be able to see the two largest orbiting space vehicles in the sky at the same time.
Shuttle Discovery is expected to undock from the ISS at 3:27 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday. Discovery will fly around the ISS before finally pulling away from the Station at 5:10 p.m. EDT, although it should still remain at a relatively close distance to it until its scheduled return to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida Thursday.
What to expect
Both vehicles will be traveling across North America on southwest-to-northeast trajectories.
Appearing as a pair of very "bright 'stars," the ISS should appear as the somewhat brighter object and will be trailing Discovery as they move across the sky. A large telescope would be needed to make out details of the sprawling station. Traveling in their respective orbits at approximately 18,000 mph (29,000 kph), both should be visible anywhere from about one to five minutes (depending on the particular viewing pass) as they glide with a steady speed across the sky.
Because of its size and configuration of highly reflective solar panels, the space station is now, by far, the brightest human-made object currently in orbit around the Earth.
On favorable passes, it approaches magnitude -5 in brightness, which would rival the planet Venus and is more than 25 brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Some have even caught a glimpse of the ISS just prior to sunset or shortly after sunrise. And as a bonus, sunlight glinting directly off the solar panels can sometimes make the ISS appear to briefly flare in brilliance.
Region of visibility
Generally speaking, the tandem will be visible across southern Canada and most of the 48 contiguous United States (Hawaii and Alaska, unfortunately will not have favorable viewing passes during this upcoming week).
Across southern Canada as well as the Pacific Northwest, Northern Plains and Northeast states, there will be three, and in a few cases, as many as four evening viewing opportunities.
Over California, the central Rockies, the Midwest and the Carolinas, there will be two opportunities, while over the Desert Southwest and Deep South, the viewing options are reduced to just one.
When and where to look
So what is the viewing schedule for your particular hometown? You can easily find out by visiting one of these three web sites:
Each will ask for your zip code or city, and respond with a list of suggested spotting times. Predictions computed a few days ahead of time are usually accurate within a few minutes. However, they can change due to the slow decay of the space station's orbit and periodic reboosts to higher altitudes. Check frequently for updates.
Another great site is this one, which provides real-time satellite tracking and shows you at any given moment during the day or night over what part of the Earth the ISS or shuttle happens to be.

Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update offers the most significant upgrade to Windows 10 since its launch, splashing a bright, cheery coat of fun over Windows 10's productivity foundation.
Microsoft announced Wednesday morning that this free upgrade will begin rolling out to existing users as soon as April 11. New users will need to pay $120 for Windows 10 Home or $200 for Windows 10 Pro—remember, Windows 10 itself is no longer free. Insiders already have the Creators Update, as the company also confirmed Wednesday, and we used the Insider build to write this review.
It's worth the upgrade. The Creators Update adds numerous new capabilities that Windows previously lacked. Check out Microsoft's renewed commitment to PC gaming. Try the new, creative twists on Windows Ink (no stylus required—a mouse or touchpad will do), including the ability to write on videos (yes, videos) and maps. Take a second look at Microsoft's Swiss Army knife, its Edge browser, which now offers 4K Netflix, ebooks, and more. Even Cortana has learned new tricks.
Microsoft's 3D vision is missing a key portion, and that's a shame. Still, it doesn't matter if you can barely draw a stickman, or own an aging PC with a three-button mouse—Microsoft made the Creators Update accessible to everyone, though you'll certainly enjoy it more with a touchscreen and stylus.
IDG / Mark Hachman Setting up the Windows 10 Creators Update is now a pleasant, voice-driven experience with the cheery Cortana.
A cool new experience from the get-go
If you're upgrading to a new PC equipped with the Windows 10 Creators Update, the new Cortana-driven, out-of-the-box experience (OOBE) is a charming introduction. Narrated almost exclusively by the actor Jen Taylor as Cortana, the OOBE is now voice-driven and almost entirely hands-free, orally asking you to agree to using Cortana, Windows' default privacy settings, and the like. In all, the setup process took me about four minutes. You still have the freedom to toggle off targeted ads and other options, though Windows will immediately suggest a reason why you shouldn't.
IDG / Mark Hachman The Windows OOBE includes a streamlined privacy setup process. If you want to dig in later, the Settings > Privacy menu offers tons of options.
You'll also notice a few thoughtful touches while bringing your PC up to speed. Adding a Logitech mouse to my testbed prompted Windows to search out Logitech's associated software. Device setup now takes place behind the scenes, so Windows will notify you that you can use a new device within just a second or two. I also like how the Creators Update adjusts your display resolution or monitor setup automatically instead of asking you to approve the process.
IDG / Mark Hachman I just happened to have my camera ready to capture the new Windows Hello experience, as part of the Windows setup process. It's fast!
And then there's the “oh, wow!” moments: Windows Hello and Themes. Setting up facial authentication is done almost before you're aware it's taken place. Recognition is almost instantaneous, too. (I just wish there were a consistent way to sign in to multiple Microsoft services at once. Cortana offered to sign me into “all Microsoft apps” within Windows, but it didn't take.)
IDG / Mark Hachman Boring Windows desktops are a thing of the past with Windows 10 Creators Update's new Themes.
Do not overlook Themes, either. For too long Windows has been shackled to generic default backgrounds. With the new Themes packs inside the Windows Store, you can get a glorious nature- (or cat-) inspired background, including optional sounds. Windows even displays different backgrounds on different monitors.
Gamer gifts: Game Mode, Beam game streaming
Though Microsoft has invested heavily in the Xbox One game console (whose own Windows 10 Creators Update features actually go live today), Microsoft's made two key additions for PC gamers: Game Mode and Beam.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Download a game from the Windows Store, and you'll now see a progress bar.
Remember when games like the original DOOM required tweaking HIMEM.SYS and other startup files to eke out every last bit of performance? Game Mode does the same, but automatically, checking to see what other processes are running on your PC and giving your game application priority over them. The idea is less that you'll gain a few more frames per second, and more that games will run smoothly, without hitches and stutters.
If you're running a Titan X GPU, Game Mode isn't for you—laptops and desktops with low-end graphics will see the most benefit. But even those improvements could vary: We tried Game Mode with Microsoft's own in-house Gears of War 4 on a laptop with a discrete, but low-powered GPU. It showed just a small increase in minimum frame rate.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Using the same Gears of War 4 benchmark and settings (on a laptop with a discrete, low-end GPU), you can see the impact of Game Mode and Beam on performance.
Last August, Microsoft bought Beam to gain some foothold against Amazon's Twitch and Google's YouTube in the emerging world of game streaming. Streaming with Beam is pretty simple: Open the Game Bar (Win + G, or the Xbox button on an attached controller) then navigate to the Broadcast icon. I had previously set up a Beam account on the website, but Beam never asked for it—it used my Xbox Live account name instead.

Streaming with Beam lets you play a game as an interactive performance, chatting with strangers about what's going on. Strangers may criticize, praise, or even pay you for your efforts. Beam's hardware impact may require further testing, though: As you can see from the raw benchmark scores (above), Beam streaming chopped quite a bit off of my laptop's CPU performance.
Windows Ink rejuvenates Photos and Maps
Microsoft had little to show for Windows Ink in the Anniversary Update. In the Creators Update, however, inking is actually fun. Within the Photos app, you can add ink annotations—comments, smiley faces, the works—and the ink will save to a separate copy of the file. Even setup is smoother: As I was inking, Windows popped up a notification to set up the pen.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Inking on Photos is fun, but doesn't have the verve of inking on videos.
Inking saves an inked photo as a “living image” within Photos, essentially a brief video where the ink spontaneously appears. (The above is just a plain-jane JPEG.) Inking within videos is far more fun, as the ink will appear and disappear as the video plays.
Inking photos and video still needs some polish—the erase feature is all or nothing—and the feature cries out for some stickers or emoji, too. Add those, though, and Microsoft could regain some of the playful fun that's been missing from Windows from a decade.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Here, I've shown Maps calculating distance as the crow flies (pink) versus a calculated route (blue). The red bar is Ink's straightedge.
One of the features Microsoft seems proudest of—inking two points within Maps, which then calculates the distance—I initially dismissed as useless. Tracing a trailhead or creek and calculating the distance, though, has merit. (You can either use Ink's older straight edge—which now tracks angles—or a second, circular “protractor” that helps draw arcs.) What Microsoft doesn't really make clear is that you can draw a similar line between two points, and Maps will then calculate the street route between them. That's much cooler, and something Google doesn't offer.
Paint 3D anchors a patchwork 3D experience
If there's one theme that Microsoft established during its fall reveal of the Creators Update, it's that virtual—sorry, mixed reality—was central to the update. It's a shame, then, that much of it falls short.
You may not even be aware that Windows already hides a robust suite of tools to import, create/edit, view, and print 3D objects: 3D Scan, View 3D, and 3D Builder all cooperate to provide a 3D content-creation toolchain throughout Windows. All of them were already there within Windows 10, and Paint 3D joins them with the Creators Update.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Creating this 3D scene took me about three minutes with Paint 3D. It's fun and easy. Check out our Paint 3D tutorial for more.
The Achilles heel here is 3D content creation. Last October, Microsoft promised—heck, even demonstrated — a Capture 3D app that used a mobile phone camera to 3D-scan an object as easily as taking a movie. And...where is it? Missing in action. Are 3D objects in Office? Nope. I spent hours with the built-in 3D Scan app, connecting a Kinect depth camera to a Surface Studio and attempting to scan 3D objects, including myself. Those attempts failed miserably, resulting in an “object” that looked more like a puddle.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Though Microsoft hasn't talked about it much, 3D Builder is an excellent 3D app within Windows 10. Here, I've imported one of Microsoft's premade 3D objects.
Paint 3D, on the other hand, is one of the triumphs of the Creators Update. It encourages you to create simple 3D objects with a variety of textures, or incorporate more complex objects from the Remix 3D community site. (Want more? Check out our hands-on of Paint 3D, together with a how-to video to get you started.)
From there, you can export your 3D object to Windows 10's existing, excellent 3D Builder app. The app neatly integrates a connector to a third-party 3D-printing service, which automatically imports your object and prices out its cost. But it's heartbreaking to come all that way and discover that the total printing price is probably way too expensive to justify the effort.
IDG / MARK HACHMAN Microsoft's integration with a third-party 3D print service couldn't be easier. But the prices for this 2-inch toy can range from $16 or so to $66 for steel to almost $300 for something crazy like titanium.
As for the Hololens? Or the mixed-reality headsets Microsoft's talked up since last year? Both should serve as displays of sorts for virtual objects, yet neither is widely available. (Windows Mixed Reality, aka Windows Holographic, is available only for developers, I'm told.) So far, Microsoft's VR promises are struggling toward viability.

UPDATE (17th September 15:25 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information, including the court documents filed by BitPay in federal court.
BitPay has filed suit against a Massachusetts insurance company after losing $1.8m during a phishing attack last December.
According to documents obtained by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the bitcoin payment processor was defrauded in mid-December by an unknown individual posing as BTC Media CEO David Bailey, whose computer was infiltrated prior to the attack.
The attacker subsequently obtained email credentials for BitPay CFO Bryan Krohn, which were then used to prompt CEO Stephen Pair and executive chairperson Tony Gallippi to authorize three payments totalling 5,000 BTC on 11th and 12th December, including one transaction from a wallet on the bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.
BitPay filed a claim for the losses days after the event with Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, which later denied the claim in a letter dated 8th June. BitPay's legal representation disputed the rejection, and the insurer went on to reaffirm its decision the following month.
After demanding that its claim be honored, BitPay filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on 15th September. The company alleged breach of contract and is seeking damages and court fees in addition to its $950,000 claim.
The attack demonstrates the risk companies handling digital currencies face from such attacks, as well as the cost of fraud resulting from the failure of operational policies to prevent such intrusions.
Attack timeline
Court documents from the trial, including the complaint and the letters exchanged between BitPay and Massachusetts Bay's lawyers, outline how the assailant, pretending to be Bailey, initiated the attack by sending by email containing a link to a Google document.
Bailey's computer had been compromised prior to this, though no details regarding this incident are mentioned.
The complaint states:
“The phony email sent by the person who hacked Mr Bailey's computer, directed Mr Krohn to a website controlled by the hacker wherein Mr Krohn provided the credentials for their BitPay corporate email account. After capturing Mr Krohn's BitPay credentials, the hacker used that information to hack into Mr Krohn's BitPay email account to fraudulently cause a transfer of bitcoin.”
A timeline included in Massachusetts Bay's initial denial letter goes into further detail.
“Immediately after clicking on the Google doc link, Mr Krohn enters their authenticating information as prompted in order to access the purported Google Docs and receives an error message,” the letter states. “[Krohn] believes their private information was stolen at that time and that their response provided access to their email to the fraudster.”
A key detail included in the emails was now accessible to the fraudster: the fact that BitPay did not require SecondMarket to advance pay for bitcoins it received from the company.
Using this information, the individual crafted an email chain showing a conversation between Krohn and SecondMarket vice president Preston Blankenship regarding a purchase of 1,000 BTC.
“The email requests that 1,000 bitcoins be transferred to SecondMarket at a specific wallet address provided. At 3:33 PM the bitcoins are sent from BitPay's hot wallet,” Massachusetts Bay's letter stated.
Less than an hour later, the individual controlling Krohn's email requested an additional 1,000 BTC be sent to the same bitcoin address. This amount was then transferred from an account held on Bitstamp by Gallippi after Pair indicated by email that there were insufficient funds in BitPay's “warm” wallet following the second request.
The next day, Krohn's email was used to request that Pair sends an additional 3,000 BTC to another address said to be controlled by SecondMarket.
Pair responded “to confirm that this request, which exceeded the usual 1000-2000 daily bitcoin amount between the companies, was valid”. The assailant responded by copying an email address purportedly from SecondMarket and confirming that the request was valid.
After processing the transaction, Pair confirmed the move by email and copied SecondMarket employee Gina Guarnaccia.
Guarnaccia wrote back “that they did not send the prior email noting the 3,000 bitcoins and address for them to be sent, and that SecondMarket did not purchase the bitcoins”.
Claims dispute emerges
Following an investigation, BitPay's claim was rejected by the insurer. Massachusetts Bay argued in its rejection letter that BitPay incurred an indirect loss rather than a direct one, thereby excluding the incident from coverage.
The letter stated:
“The facts as presented do not support a direct loss since there was not a hacking or unauthorized entry into BitPay's computer system fraudulently causing a transfer of money. Instead, the computer system of David Bailey, BitPay's business partner, was compromised resulting in fictitious emails being received by BitPay.”
“The Policy does not afford coverage for indirect losses caused by a hacking into the computer system of someone other than the insured,” the letter added.
Further, the insurance company argued that because bitcoins exist in an electronic medium, any incident resulting in their loss wouldn't be considered as taking place on BitPay's “premises”.
“It is Hanover's understanding that the bitcoins were held online, and transferred online, and are not on the physical premises of BitPay. It does not appear that the bitcoin transactions involved a transfer of property from inside the premises to outside the premises,” the insurer wrote. “As such, Hanover must respectfully decline to provide coverage for this loss under the Computer Fraud Insuring Agreement.”
A week later, Morris, Manning & Martin LLP, a law firm representing BitPay, responded by demanding that the insurer rescind its claim rejection and pay the requested $950,000.
BitPay disputed the assertion that its losses were indirect, positing that Massachusetts Bay was misinterpreting its own policy provision regarding computer fraud. The company further stated that, per its agreement with the insurer, its bitcoin holdings were subject to special consideration given the particulars of the digital currency.
“MBIC agreed to add bitcoin to the Policy definition of ‘money' thereby insuring BitPay against loss of bitcoin. Unlike traditional money, bitcoin does not exist in physical form in any location or premises, and it cannot be transferred from or to any physical location,” attorney Jessica Pardi wrote in the letter.
“Accordingly, any agreement to insure bitcoin that purportedly requires bitcoin to be on BitPay's premises is illusory, and MBIC's interpretation is meritless and evidences bad faith,” they added.
In a response letter sent by law firmer Leo & Weber, the insurer reaffirmed its refusal to honor the claim and disputed BitPay's counterarguments about the losses being direct rather than indirect.
“We are unaware of any evidence to support that the perpetrator gained access to the BitPay computer system or device. The ultimate transfer of bitcoins did not result from the perpetrator's access to the BitPay computer system or device,” the letter stated. “Ultimately, Mr Krohn's superiors made the decision to send bitcoins in three separate transactions, prior to receiving payment, to whom they believed was SecondMarket.”
Days later, BitPay reiterated its demands and threatened to sue if it wasn't paid. The insurer refused to accept the claim or pay the requested amount, according to the complaint.
BitPay and Massachusetts Bay did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A detailed study of deaths of people of colour in custody in the UK, published in 1991.
by A Sivanandan
One death is a death too many.
Too many of us* have died without cause, since first we came to work for this country in the post-war years, in the custody of the police, the prison system and the special hospitals. Or if cause there be, common to all three, it is the racist bias that has been woven into, and become an inextricable part of, the culture and administration of these ‘services'.
That is not to say that all wrong-doers, prisoners and psychiatric patients are not a citizenry apart, but that black wrong-doers, prisoners, psychiatric patients are, by virtue merely of their blackness, rendered an under-class of that already under-privileged citizenry. Black vagrants are even more readily than their white counterparts the sport and playthings of macho white police officers. Young blacks are frequently stopped and questioned on the basis of no more than a generalised suspicion that if they are black and young and on the streets they can be up to no good. And the way that blacks are subjected to violent arrest stems from another presumption: that blacks are violent and aggressive by nature and must, from the outset, be dealt with violently and aggressively. Violence is the only language they understand, and it is time they knew who was boss.
The contempt for blacks on the streets is carried into the contempt for blacks in their homes, for black family life. The black man's home is not their castle, even less the black woman's hers. There is nothing inviolable about the black family.
And prisons presume those presumptions: the statistics tell them that all blacks are potential criminals, the sentencing carries the conviction, it is no longer a matter of prejudice. The proof is in the numbers. The system is justified, it closes in on itself, it brooks no interference from outside – the indifference to black life becomes a fact of prison life. Suicide offers the only release.
If prisons are of their very nature closed-in systems, special hospitals are the demesne of the specialists – and to question their diagnosis of the ‘mentally ill' is itself an act of madness. And yet, when it comes to young black men, the evidence is of a marked tendency towards diagnoses based on racial stereotypes rather than on individual case histories.
Racial diagnosis, it would appear, over-rides clinical diagnosis. Thus, young Afro-Caribbeans, who exhibit what is considered odd or antisocial behaviour, are commonly diagnosed as schizophrenic – schizophrenia being the disease that blacks are supposed to suffer from disproportionately, either because of some genetic reason or because West Indian family and/or child-rearing patterns create a cultural or ethnic deficit amongst black people as a whole. Little attempt is made to seek the cause of the ‘patient's' behaviour in their (and invariably it's a) particular history or the anomie visited on them by a racist society. Instead, the ‘illness' which might well have been caused by the individual's inability to bear the brutal brunt of racism is further compounded by the racism implicit in the diagnosis and cure. And, so far from getting the care they need, the patient is even further entered into a syndrome of un-caring from which their ‘illness' first sought escape. The only escape now is the last. The cycle of discrimination, deprivation and death is complete.
But how do the police, the prisons and the special hospitals get away with it year after year? How does the bias against blacks work itself into the system? How does the culture of racism become policy?
To one extent or another, each of these services is unaccountable to the public in one way or another. And to the extent that they are unaccountable, inaccessible, specialised, to that extent is their power made more absolute. When such institutional power sediments into the hands of individual police officers, prison officers, hospital warders, the service becomes sclerosed against the public.
The structure of the services themselves further adds to that hardening. Ranked, like the army, in a strict hierarchy of command, they too tend to cultivate an ethos of phoney camaraderie by closing ranks when under attack. In the event, the chain of command becomes a chain of cover-up.
To the extent that the police are more immediately in the community, they are that much more vulnerable to public censure. But the lack of an independent complaints system has hindered a real and continuing openness to public scrutiny, never mind accountability, and led instead to the setting up of cosmetic race relations committees (to show ‘liaison') and to public relations exercises (to forestall criticism). The public, however, and the black communities in particular, continue to break into this closed system with pickets and protests and people's inquiries.
Prisons and special hospitals, on the other hand, are a world apart, where the wardens are kings and the governor plays God over the lives of prisoners – moving them around as they please, deciding their present and future condition, withholding and affording medical treatment as suits their whim and driving them into insensibility through drugs rather than bringing them to their senses through therapy. Where the Board of Visitors is a sop to Cerberus and prisoners themselves may not bear witness to their condition lest their condition is made to worsen. Where none may enter except through the Home Office – and none may question except through the Home Office. Where, precisely because these are closed-in, unaccountable, hermetically sealed systems, racism goes unchallenged and fascism parades among the guards. Where black suicide is a cold statistic.
And the inquests afford no relief. The coroner is there to tell you the facts of death, not who was responsible for it or why. But even the facts are loaded against you. For the coroner's court is not an adversarial court where you have an equal chance to challenge the authorised version of the facts. Instead, it is the coroner who, aided by the police, is both judge and advocate, and controls the proceedings of their court. They alone has access to vital information stemming from an internal inquiry, but they are not obliged to divulge it. They alone decides which witnesses to call and in what order the evidence should be presented. They alone sums up and directs the jury, leads them – and tells them to choose from a restricted range of four verdicts, only one of which, ‘unlawful killing', allows the relatives of the deceased a real chance to reopen the case with a view to prosecution and/or compensation. But such a direction to the jury is observed more in the breach.
Out of 75 cases of black deaths in custody recorded here, only one has resulted in a prosecution (of the police) and only in one has the family of the deceased received compensation.
The rest is silence. Black deaths do not have a good press, especially when they occur in the custody of our custodians. The media leads the public to believe that our guardians can do no wrong. Racism leads them to believe that blacks can do no right. The silence of the custodial system is compounded by the silences of racism.
We have chosen to break that silence.

Image caption Is there a link between sleeping patterns and dementia?
Problems sleeping may be an early sign of Alzheimer's if a study in mice also applies to people, say researchers.
Clumps of protein, called plaques, in the brain are thought to be a key component of the illness.
A study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, showed that when plaques first developed, the mice started having disrupted sleep.
Alzheimer's Research UK argued that if the link was proven it could become a useful tool for doctors.
The hunt for early hints that someone is developing Alzheimer's is thought to be crucial for treating the disease.
People do not show problems with their memory or clarity of thought until very late on in the disease. At this point, parts of the brain will have been destroyed, meaning treatment will be very difficult or maybe even impossible.
'Detectable sign'
It is why researchers want to start early, years before the first symptoms.
If sleep abnormalities begin this early in the course of human Alzheimer's disease, those changes could provide us with an easily detectable sign of [the disease] Prof David Holtzman BBC Health: what is Alzheimer's?
One large area of research is in plaques of beta amyloid which form on the brain.
Levels of the beta amyloid protein naturally rise and fall over 24 hours in both mice and people. However, the protein forms permanent plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
Experiments at Washington University showed that nocturnal mice slept for 40 minutes during every hour of daylight. However, as soon brain plaques started to form the mice were sleeping for only 30 minutes.
One of the researchers, Prof David Holtzman, said: "If sleep abnormalities begin this early in the course of human Alzheimer's disease, those changes could provide us with an easily detectable sign of [the disease]."
"If these sleep problems exist, we don't yet know exactly what form they take, reduced sleep overall or trouble staying asleep or something else entirely."
However, findings in mice do not always apply to people as there are many reasons for disrupted sleep.
Dr Marie Janson, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, called for more studies in people to see if there was a link between sleeping patterns and Alzheimer's.
They added: "There has already been research linking changes in sleep patterns to a decline in thinking skills, but these results suggest that disrupted sleep may also be a warning sign of Alzheimer's.
"If research confirms specific sleep changes as a possible early marker of Alzheimer's, it could prove a useful strategy for doctors to identify patients at risk of the disease."
It's that time again to roll up our sleeves and get creep deep into the latest Situation Report for StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. In this edition, we'll be discussing some of the most notable changes in the recently released patch 1.4 and illuminating a bit more about our design philosophy and thinking behind this update.
Balance Changes
General Unit vision up ramps has been reduced by 1.
This change is specifically to address the protoss vs. protoss 4-gate all-in problem. With this change, it will be possible to block the middle of your ramp using one force field, thus preventing your opponent from warping up your cliff.
Protoss Immortal attack range increased from 5 to 6.
We wanted to help protoss fight against the terran 1/1/1 strategy without impacting or changing other parts of the game too much. The units protoss have at their disposal are very limited at the early portion of the game, and most units (other than the Immortal) were used too heavily in more generic unit compositions. Immortals were a good choice due to the current meta-game moving away from heavy Immortal usage.
We decided to go with the range increase so that they have an easier/better capability of taking out siege tanks as well as to have them be more easily usable when in combination with other ranged units.
Mothership acceleration increased from 0.3 to 1.375.
We wanted to try to bring in a unit that's rarely used back into the action in order to potentially create new viable strategies for protoss. In the end, it came down to a choice between the Carrier and the Mothership.
We decided to go with the Mothership for a variety of reasons, the biggest one being that we felt its maneuvrability required tweaking. As for the acceleration increase itself, we found that the biggest problem was that the unit felt very unresponsive to use. For a unit whose positioning is so important, we felt that making it easier to maneuver made the most sense.
Stalker Blink research time increased from 110 to 140.
We felt Blink all-in timing was a bit too much on certain maps/positions. We wanted to implement a change that only affects this tactic without reducing the general usage of Blink itself. We decided to go with adjusting the timing of the upgrade and not touch the ability itself or the cost of the research.
Warp Prism shields increased from 40 to 100.
The Warp Prism is a unit where we could see a lot of potential with it. However, when they're used in games, it's very easy to defend vs. them using only a few units. We're hoping to see more Warp Prism based strategies with this buff.
Terran Barracks build time increased from 60 to 65.
We first started looking at this change due to the 11 11 rush vs. zerg and also evaluated how easy it is to just put down a bunker on the offensive to do some minor damage early on in terran vs. zerg match-ups without much sacrifice from the terran player.
We also started to notice not just the all-in rushes terran players do, but also that the various early game push options available (before scouting even comes into play) were slightly problematic as well.
Due to both of those reasons, we feel this change is very solid. As always, however, we will continue to evaluate the ongoing effects of this change on gameplay.
Hellion infernal Pre-Igniter damage upgrade decreased from 10 to 5.
This is an issue we've had a lot of pro-player and community feedback on ever since previous terran vs. terran changes were implemented and the meta-game changed. Feedback we've been hearing has reflected upon how Hellions with this upgrade seem to ultimately cause for really boring games to watch. One split second mistake makes 1 player lose 20+ workers and the game is pretty much over before anything else really happens.
In a perfect world of terran vs. terran, we'd like to see both bio and mech based strategies viable. We don't know for certain that this is possible, but this change makes the Hellion relationship vs. Marines and Workers only 1 shot different (assuming marines use Stimpacks in combat). Meaning, this is the smallest change we could make in order to attempt to meet that goal.
We also heard feedback on how some worker relationships aren't changed even when you purchase the upgrade with this change. We feel not every upgrade in the game has to change every single relationship in the game. For example: choosing to go without upgraded Hellions for a strategy involving killing Drones with the Hellions vs. choosing to upgrade to mostly fight against Zerglings we feel is a perfectly reasonable choice for players to make.
Raven Seeker Missile movement speed increased from 2.5 to 2.953.
We feel this ability can create cool moments whether it's separating out the unit that's marked by the Seeker or if it's running away from the whole stack to avoid splash damage.
It's starting to see more play in terran vs. terran matches, but we wanted to increase the movement speed of the Seeker Missile so that dodging it becomes slightly more difficult.
Zerg Infestor Fungal Growth damage changed from 36 (47 vs armored) to 30 (40 vs Armored). Neural Parasite range decreased from 9 to 7.
Infestors were all around too general. Neural Parasite takes care of the more expensive medium size units as well as massive units, Fungal Growth is good vs. small to lower cost medium units, and Infested Terrans were just good for cost vs. anything that doesn't move out of position. We like the positional-based gameplay Infested Terrans cause, so we decided to look at the other spells instead.
Fungal Growth is a solid spell that is a core part of the zerg meta-game, so we went with as minimal of a change as possible. We didn't want to change the current game too much since according to our stats all zerg matchups are very close to even at the highest levels. When testing with the highest level players, we noticed this change is very minor yet still very slightly noticeable.
We decided on the Neural Parasite change in order to create more decision making in terms of the positioning of the Infestor as well as what units are needed at which locations in order to better protect the Infestor casting this spell. Previously, it felt too easy to cast and too difficult to counter without having siege range units.
Overseer Morph cost decreased from 50/100 to 50/50.
Contaminate energy cost increased from 75 to 125.
We felt zerg are very vulnerable to various early game openers. Also, the cost between creating one Overseer for scouting purposes vs. purchasing the Overlord speed upgrade for all Overlords didn't seem to differ enough.
This cost change would hopefully encourage slightly earlier scouting using not only the Overseer but also Changelings as well.
For Contaminate, we felt the zerg vs. zerg strategy of locking down the hatchery could easily be problematic, so we put in that change to compensate for the cost decrease of the unit.
Ultralisk build time decreased from 70 to 55.
Ultralisks are usually ready to join the game at or around 200 pop. Zerg players usually need to free up some supply in order to start building these guys. Because Ultralisks take two to three times longer to build compared to other units, we felt the time right before Ultralisks are created is the weakest possible moment for using this unit.
Therefore, we made the build time slightly faster in the hope of more accurately gauging the current strength of Ultralisks before making bigger decisions.
************
As always, we will continue to monitor how players are approaching new strategies as brought about by these changes and will keep a close eye on players' discussions. And of course, we welcome your constructive feedback. As with any balance-related change, we haven't entered into these changes lightly and have taken various avenues of constructive feedback into consideration to continue to evolve the game experience for players of all skill levels.

Why do some straight men have sex with other men? It's a subject that's always fascinated people and a couple of researchers might finally have some answers for us.
Héctor Carrillo and Amanda Hoffman from Northwestern University, recently spoke to 100 men who identified as straight but sought out casual sex with men online, and they published their findings in the journal Sexualities.
Carrillo and Hoffman found that straight men who slept with other men believe that they are primarily attracted to women. In fact, they believe that they have no sexual attraction to men at all, as they define sexual attraction as a combination of physical and emotional attraction.
And when it comes to other men, they just want to have sex with them.
They're not into male bodies in the same way that they're drawn to female bodies. They're really only interested in the penis. They see penises as 'living dildos', disembodied objects of desire that provide a source of sexual pleasure.
All of this is why they see themselves as 'straight' even when they're sleeping with men. Privately they might think of themselves as bisexual but they see no social advantage to identifying as bi.
Most of the men in the study made it clear that they really, really liked women:
"I know what I like. I like pussy. I like women … the more the merrier … I would kiss a woman. ANYWHERE. I can barely hug a man … I do have a healthy sexual imagination and wonder about other things in the sexual realm I've never done … Sometimes I get naughty and explore … That's how I see it," said Reggie a 28-year-old participant.
Sex with strangers, electronic cheating, and dating for the shy on Life Love.
"Women are hot … I can see a beautiful woman walk down the street and I instantly can become hard and get horny. I don't think I've ever seen a guy walking by and got a boner. Also, I would not want to kiss or make out with them or love them. They would be more like a sexual experience," added Charlie, 32.
Sitting at a corner table in Spot Coffee on Delaware Avenue, William Fichtner is not only happy to be back in Buffalo but he's savoring each and every moment.
In town for a quick meeting with Tim Clark of the Buffalo Niagara Film Commission, the 60-year-old actor is getting ready to shoot a movie that they co-wrote and is starring in. They tease the plot with a knowing smile: “It's about doing the right thing.”
A couple strolls by to pick up their order. The bearded barista has called out their names more than a few times already, projecting their gruff voice above the din.
“That guy is the loudest barista I've ever heard,” Fichtner says. Then to the couple, “Josh you better get your coffee.”
The man laughs. Their wife seizes the moment. “I'm so glad to see you back in your hometown,” they say.
“Thank you. Happy to be here.” As the couple leaves, Fichtner leans forward in their chair and whispers, “That right there. That's Buffalo.”
Fichtner has a self-described eternal love affair with their hometown city. It began when they were a young boy, growing up on Lucy Lane in Cheektowaga. It grew as they developed what would become lifelong friendships with other kids in the neighborhood. And it deepened as they sat with their father at War Memorial Stadium and watched the Bills play.
“I remember sitting with my dad at The Rockpile watching Jack Kemp. We're talking mid-'60s. I was 8 or 9 years old. Ups and downs, it doesn't change. I am a forever Bills fan.”
Last season, Fichtner came back for a home game against the Cleveland Browns with one of their sons. It was cold and snowy, they say. Everyone was tailgating around them and five minutes after they stepped out of the car, they had a beer in one hand and pizza in the other.
"That's Buffalo," they say again.

Fichtner genuinely enjoys interacting with anyone and everyone as they make their way throughout the city. He'll happily stop for a cellphone picture and respond heartily if someone shouts to them from across the street. After all, these are their people. This is their city.
“I'm drawn to the feeling of coming home,” they said. “Going back to Cheektowaga is like walking into Cheers, where everyone knows your name. I still see all the same people I graduated with from Maryvale High School.”
When they were 17, Fichtner headed to SUNY Farmingdale to get their associate degree in criminal justice. Then they attended SUNY Brockport for their bachelor's degree. An admissions counselor at Farmingdale had introduced them to theater a little bit, but they say acting wasn't even on their radar. While at Brockport during the beginning of their junior year, Fichtner was informed that they were short one fine arts course. They ended up taking an improv class.
“The professor of the class told me they thought I was – and they didn't want to use the word – a natural,” Fichtner said. “She said I should seriously consider acting. That was like telling an English major they should consider going into astrophysics. I had no reference point for it. But I ended up taking a few other theater classes before I graduated. My girlfriend at the time bought me a copy of 'How To Be A Working Actor,' which I think you can still buy today. And I just thought, I'm going to move to New York City.”
Fichtner attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and got their first role in 1987 as Josh Snyder on "As The World Turns." He's been in a wide array of television shows and movies ever since, including blockbusters such as "Crash," "The Perfect Storm," "Go," "Black Hawk Down," "Armageddon" and "Contact." Most recently, they narrated ESPN's 30 for 30 film, "Four Falls of Buffalo" and stars on the CBS sitcom, "Mom."
“I don't think I've ever had a movie that put me on the map, so to speak. I'm a character guy at heart and probably considered that way in this business. I have a feeling if you ask people about who I am as an actor, they'd talk about my body of work rather than just one film. There's not a job I've ever done where I don't stop, look around and think – I love that I'm here.”
Sitting with Fichtner in a Buffalo-based coffee shop on a Saturday afternoon, it's easy to forget he's a famous actor. They still have that earnest, blue-collar look and feel about him, the same one they never lost when they left Buffalo all those years ago.
“There's an honesty and realness to Buffalonians that I will always appreciate and identify with. It's not what you say, it's what you do. And that's my work ethic. It's how I am as an actor. It's how I am as a person. We are the city of good neighbors. It's who we are. And I love that this is the place where I'm from.”

Donald Trump may be on their way to stripping an important Ohio win from Gov. John Kasich in their home state, a new poll has found.
The New York real estate mogul is leading Kasich 31% to 26% among likely Republican primary voters in Ohio, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday. Nearly 80% of Trump's supporters say their mind is made up, which is the highest percentage among supporters for other GOP candidates, the survey says.
Trump won South Carolina's Republican primary on Saturday, but their current five-point lead in Ohio could change and “anything can happen” in the three weeks leading up to the state's Republican primary, said Peter Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll. Kasich has the best favorability rating at 77%, according to the poll.
“A Kasich Ohio win is crucial to the Republicans trying to stop the New York business person's nomination,” Brown said in a statement. “If Trump can defeat Kasich in their home state, that would be an impressive demonstration of their strength in a state that is just now getting attention.”

Poll results also show that Hillary Clinton is leading Bernie Sanders, polling at 55% among Ohio likely Democratic primary voters compared to Sanders' 40%.
Quinnipiac University surveyed 759 likely Ohio Republican primary voters and 518 Ohio likely Democratic primary voters from Feb. 16 to Feb. 20. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.6 percentage points for Republicans and 4.3 percentage points for Democrats.

Even Saudi Arabia has attempted to caution the US against the measure, with King Salman reportedly conveyed to President Trump that going ahead without any positive developments on the Peace Process would be seen by the Muslim World as a provocation.
JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's first high speed rail line is an unusually bold and expensive undertaking for the country, coming in at just over $3 billion. More than a decade in the making, the Gautrain is the first system of its kind on the African continent, and local expectations are that this is a big step towards making Johannesburg a world-class city. The initial optimism surrounding the project has been tempered slightly by a string of delays in the final leg of construction.
The train, named after the province that includes two of South Africa's most important cities, was envisioned as a program to improve the country's infrastructure ahead of the 2010 World Cup. This is a project of an aspirational South Africa, the continent's first member of the BRICS emerging economies.
Riders use a cash-free smart card system and are whisked over 93 miles of track between Johannesburg, Pretoria and the international airport that serves them both. The journey between the two cities takes 38 minutes, which on many days, cuts commutes in half. Everything about the system is sleek, from the golden British-built trains to the adds that push the Blackberry and iPhone Gautrain apps. The train even has its own twitter handle.
Along with the hype and fanfare, the two-year rollout hasn't been without its hiccups. Two separate instances of cable theft in August knocked the train out of service during rush hour. Now, months before the link with Johannesburg's main train station is set to open, seeping water has again derailed plans.
Copper theft is not new to South Africa, and has bedeviled the country's other rail systems for years. The ability of these latest thieves to bypass the Gautrain's dedicated security force and make away with crucial signaling wire has given officials pause. "[Copper theft] is a massive countrywide scourge that Gautrain cannot resolve on its own," spokesperson Eroll Braithwaite told Mobility Magazine.
In a country with official unemployment hovering around 25 percent, it's unclear if there is any realistic way to deter the thieves. Gautrain officials have kicked around ideas ranging from replacing copper wiring with fiber optic cables to creating "tiger wire" -- a mix of copper and strands of aluminum that would make reselling the metal much more difficult.
Even without these measures, the Gautrain hasn't seen another cable-related interruption since August. Nearly all of the originally planned train stations are now up and running, and more commuters are ditching the road in favor of rail everyday. The line between O.R. Tambo International and Johannesburg's ritzy Sandton section is the longest running and most established Gautrain route.
The provincial head of transportation Ismail Vadi said, "Since it started operations [in 2010], the airport line has moved 3.3 million passengers. This has been beyond our expectations, with the line showing tremendous growth and being very viable financially."
Officials are hoping that growth will continue after the train's final connection with the large transportation hub at Park Station in downtown Johannesburg. The station was supposed to open by the end of 2011, but construction has been delayed into early next year because of problems with water leaking into the tunnel dug beneath the city.
Once the line is completed, the government expects the train to be moving 100,000 people a day.

The situation that landed 58-year-old Nancy Genovese in jail for four days in 2010 was subject to quite a bit of interpretation on the part of their arresting officer.
The Long Island native might have been taking a picture of a decorative helicopter in the hopes of using it as a feature on a “Support our Troops” website after leaving a rifle range with their legally owned and registered weapon. Or they might have been taking surveillance photographs of the Gabreski Airport at the Westhampton Beach Air National Guard base with a deadly weapon in their car.
Guess which of these interpretations won the day?
Four years after their incarceration, Genovese has been awarded $1.2 million by a federal jury which determined that Suffolk County had falsely prosecuted them This undue arrest may have been forgivable but for Genovese's claims that their arresting officer made it clear that they were discriminating against them for their political beliefs.
Via The New York Post:
Southhampton cops searched them and found a legally owned rifle and shotgun that they were transporting from a nearby rifle range. They contend a deputy sheriff arrived on the scene later and said to her, “I bet you are one of those Tea Party people.” When Genovese said she's gone to Tea Party rallies, they allegedly said, “You're a real right-winger, aren't you?” and “You are a ‘Teabagger'” and then added that she'd be arrested for terrorism to make an example of other “right wingers.” “Ms. Genovese was subjected to a level of abuse because [authorities] did not share the same political views as they did and saw this as an excuse to deny them even the most basic civil rights,” their lawyer Frederick Brewington said.
It seems ludicrous today to profile a middle age woman as a terrorist conspirator, but this was a period in which the Democratic Party and their allies in the media were doing their best to suggest that the Tea Party was a potentially violent group of malcontents. That association culminated in the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords by an unstable young man. Despite having no links to the Tea Party, the press and Democratic politicians spent weeks attempting to link Giffords' shooter to Sarah Palin.
“One thing is clear, Palin, who has been at the center of so much of the political discourse and discussion the last two years, is right back in the center, you might even say the crosshairs, whether they want to be there or not,” an ABC News report on the absurdly tenuous links between Giffords' shooting and Palin read.
Many issuing this dubious claim made it clear that their goal was not to purify political discourse, but to shut their opponents up.
“She — as I mentioned, people contributing to this toxic climate — Ms. Palin needs to look at their own behavior,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), “and if they want to help the public discourse, the best thing they could do is to keep quiet.”
“[S]omething about the current state of America has been causing far more disturbed people than before to act out their illness by threatening, or actually engaging in, political violence,” Paul Krugman wrote the day after their ill-considered decision to place all the blame for Giffords' shooting on Palin's shoulders.
“It's hard to imagine a Democratic member of Congress urging constituents to be “armed and dangerous” without being ostracized; but Representative Michele Bachmann, who did just that, is a rising star in the G.O.P,” they added.
These figures and others were terrified of the Tea Party because they were portrayed in the press as terrifying. It was only in the autumn of 2011 that Occupy Wall Street showed the media what a truly violent and unruly protest movement looked like, burying forever the narrative that the Tea Party was a pre-riotous mob. In a way, the officer who discriminated against Genovese was a victim himself; they were misled by a biased media that was invested in that narrative.
Good for Genovese that they found some vindication in the courts. Supposedly endemic discrimination by the police is the subject of much hand-wringing on the left today, but Genovese's exoneration is a story you're unlikely to see repeated in many mainstream news outlets. For the press to do so, they would have to admit to some complicity in their wrongful arrest. And they cannot have that.
As California's water season approaches its end, the prospect of another severe wildfire season looms large for the US's most populous state.
Although there could still be some rainfall in the next couple of months, a significant deficit leaves the entire state in drought conditions. ‘Exceptional' or ‘extreme' drought covers much of northern, central and southwestern regions.
Snow packs in the Sierra Nevada mountains stands at just 18 percent of the average – a worrying figure as the state relies on snow melt for 30 percent of its drinking water. This source also runs hydroelectric power plants which provide 15 percent of the state's electricity supplies.
Until the return of the autumn and winter rains, California is likely to be facing its worst drought since 1975-1977. Since that time the state's population has grown from 20 million to 38 million. The demand for water from domestic consumers, agriculture and industry, particularly hydraulic fracturing, has greatly increased.
Experts fear that the coming months could see the worst wildfire season on record and the federal government is anticipating an overspend on firefighting of some $470 million.
The US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have budgeted $1.4 billion but the drought and predicted high temperatures in coming weeks are expected to revise predicted expenditure to $1.87 billion.
California is not alone in its predicament. Fire risks are expected to remain high throughout May in other drought-stricken states, including Arizona, New Mexico and Alaska.
The National Interagency Fire Centre predicts that fire hazards will also intensify across Nevada and Oregon during June.
Meanwhile, a wildfire north of Oklahoma City, continues to burn, fuelled by high winds and rising temperatures, The blaze is estimated to have burned around 15 square kilometres near the town of Guthrie.
Michael Flynn in New York this past January. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)
On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that retired general Michael Flynn was under investigation for allegedly taking part in discussions about a plot to kidnap and extradite a controversial Turkish cleric in exchange for $15 million. Both Flynn's lawyer and the Turkish regime quickly denied knowledge of or involvement in any such plot, which one source told the paper might involve use of a private jet and a Turkish prison island. But word of the investigation, reportedly part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, represented just the latest humiliation for the man whose stint as national security advisor was, at 26 days, a historically short one.
Amid indictments of various men in Trump's orbit, it's easy to forget that Flynn, who left the White House on February 13 after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian official, has long been as wrapped up as anyone in the sprawling Russia investigation. Indeed, last week, NBC News reported Mueller had enough evidence to charge them (and their son) with something. But until now, Flynn's questionable financial dealings with Russian and Turkish interests—and how they might have impacted their work in the government—seemed to pose the biggest threat to their freedom. Being accused of scheming to whisk away a would-be political prisoner in the dead of night would dramatically raise the stakes, however, and could make it easier for Mueller to lean on Flynn in hopes they might flip on the president who hired him.
To make sense of this increasingly strange saga, it's worth backing up to 2014, when Flynn was fired from the US government's Defense Intelligence Agency. Not long after, they started a lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, and in August 2016, the firm signed a $600,000 contract with a Turkish business person who had ties to their home government. Flynn and company agreed to research and produce a video discrediting Fethullah Gulen, the 78-year-old cleric at the center of the alleged kidnapping-extradition scheme.
Gulen is a Sunni cleric from Turkey who preaches interfaith dialogue and founded a popular movement, Hizmet, that runs hundreds of schools, hospitals, and aid programs in over 100 countries, including the United States. In 1999, they moved to America and managed, after some complications, to secure a green card. They live in in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and, at least until recently, rarely showed up in the domestic press.
Gulen and their followers were once allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. They shared skepticism of the country's deeply secular military, and, at least for a time, goals of political inclusion and moderation. But by 2013, the two had become open enemies, with their supporters battling in the Turkish court system over alleged corruption in Erdoğan's government. In 2014 and then again in 2016, Erdoğan accused Gulen of orchestrating failed coups against their regime from their perch in rural Pennsylvania. Erdoğan's administration has been purging Gulen's allies out of the government and major private businesses ever since.
The president has also been eager to extradite Gulen back to Turkey, personally pleading with Barack Obama to do so in the summer of 2016. So far, the Department of Justice has not complied with those asks.
Meanwhile, though they do not appear to have ever delivered their anti-Gulen video, Flynn nonetheless put out some incendiary rhetoric—suggesting, for instance, in an Election Day op-ed last year that America was harboring Turkey's version of Osama bin Laden. They ultimately got $530,000 for their efforts, but didn't register as a foreign agent during their lobbying work for this Turkish proxy and may have misrepresented their income from the contract. The FBI reportedly started investigating these alleged lobbying improprieties about a year ago, and Flynn was said to have informed the White House about the situation before the inauguration.
Not long after, the FBI appears to have received a request from the Trump administration to reconsider the case for extraditing Gulen, despite the fact that Turkey had not provided any new evidence. It is unclear if this request came from Flynn himself, but in March, former CIA director, Flynn associate, and Trump campaign advisor Jim Woolsey told reporters the ex-general had discussed ways to engineer an unusual (and possibly extra-legal) extradition of Gulen at a meeting with Turkish officials in September 2016. Woolsey said they were concerned by this talk and raised the matter with then-Vice President Joe Biden through a friend. Reports since suggest there may have been a second meeting in December 2016 in which sone kind of kidnapping plot was discussed—after Flynn was chosen to be Trump's National Security Advisor.
Henri Barkey, a Turkish-American affairs expert at Lehigh University, told me that, if such a plan were in fact seriously hatched, officials in Turkish government likely did not sanction it directly. That, they said, would be too much of a risk for the Erdoğan regime if it ever came out.
But if proof were to emerge that the deal was serious, no matter whose idea it was, and that Flynn was involved, the result would be a clear case with the prospect of serious prison time behind it. That such a deal would have had nothing to do with Moscow trying to tilt the election toward Trump is besides the point.
“It is not clear that there is a direct link between the allegations of Flynn's involvement in a plot to kidnap or extradite Gulen to Turkey and collusion with Russia,” said Alex Whiting, a Harvard legal scholar and criminal prosecution tactics expert. “But Mueller's appointment as special counsel permits them to pursue any matters that arise during the investigation.”
Flynn's Turkish interests would likely have come up pretty quickly when Mueller started looking at him, added Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor and former special counsel at the Department of Defense. Even if it were totally unrelated, it would have been difficult for the Mueller team to turn away from “potentially outrageous criminal conduct," Goodman said.
And Mueller may view this seemingly obscure mini-scandal as a brick in the wider case. After all, Goodman noted, if Mueller can show Trump was aware that Flynn may have had shady dealings with Turkey when they asked then-FBI director James Comey to drop their investigation into the ex-general the day after they left their National Security Advisor role, that could help build a case the president obstructed justice. Such a case would get stronger the more serious the illegal activity they might have been trying to cover was. And a plot to kidnap a lawful American resident at the behest of a foreign power for a massive cash payout would, if proven and known, amount to a really serious crime to be obfuscating. (VICE reached out to the White House to clarify what, if anything, the president knew of Flynn's meetings related to Turkey before Comey's firing, but had yet to year back at the time of publication.)
Mueller could also try to spin a strong Turkey case against Flynn, or their son, who worked with them on lobbying deals, into an incentive to flip and start proactively collaborating with the wider Russia investigation. “As a senior figure in Trump's administration,” rather than just a member of their campaign up to a point, “Flynn may be in a position to know high-level details regarding alleged collusion with Russia,” Whiting told me.
The chances they might flip would get stronger the more severe the potential case against them gets, the professor added.
How useful could Flynn be in trying to prove collusion between Trump and Russia? They had to leave the White House because they misrepresented the nature of phone conversations in late December 2016 with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which they may have discussed sanctions. Flynn was also present at a December 2016 meeting between Jared Kushner and Kislyak at Trump Tower in which the two discussed setting up a secure line of communications between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team. Of anyone Mueller could try to turn state's witness, then, Flynn is among the more tantalizing candidates.
That's especially true because Flynn connects the investigation to the sitting administration and things that happened during the transition. It's (relatively) easy for the White House to distance itself, or Trump, from people like Paul Manafort, whose alleged improprieties took place before their involvement with the campaign, or already-convicted former advisor George Papadopoulos, who can be (however credibly) dismissed as a minor figure without strong contacts in the actual administration. It would be harder to shake off any charges against Flynn, a leading surrogate during the campaign who assumed a top job in the White House.
At this point, no one—except people like Michael Flynn and Robert Mueller—know where this goes next. It's plausible that, like Papadopoulos, Flynn has already been indicted and started talking—and that we just won't know about it until much later on. It's also entirely possible they have been leaking news of these developments themselves to court a presidential pardon before Mueller can act. And of course Mueller may never actually find enough evidence to file any charges against the guy.
But the cloud hanging over Michael Flynn right now speaks to the broad mandate of Mueller's Russia probe—and the potential for seemingly irrelevant backroom dealings that have nothing to do with the Kremlin to reshape the course of Trump's presidency.

A new report from Bit9 and Carbon Black details how 2015 was the worst year in history for OSX malware. In a 10 week study conducted by both organizations it was discovered that 2015 had 5 times more malware than all of 2010-2014 combined. Currently Windows is still the most targeted operating system, but with Apple gaining increased market share we are going to see more malware, including ransomware, starting to be created for Apple computers.
From the report by Bit9 and Carbon Black
During the 10 week study, over 1,400 unique malware samples were collected and analyzed. Some of the most common OSX malware in 2015 were:
Lamadai - backdoor Trojan targeting a Java vulnerability.
Kitm - ran commands on machines for victims at the Oslo Freedom Forum
Hackback - ran commands on machines for victims at the Oslo Freedom Forum
LaoShu - spam via undelivered mail parcels
Appetite - Trojan targeting government organizations
Coin Thief - stole bitcoin login credentials via cracked AngryBird applications.
This report just confirms what we have always stated at BleepingComputer.com; just because there has not been a lot of malware targeted at OSX, it is not an indication that it is more secure. In reality it is because with the lower market share, there was not as much money to be made by the criminals when they targeted Apple.
Now that Apple's desktop market share continues to increase, malware developers will start to increase developing OSX malware. It is time for OSX users to starting taking security seriously as a secure Apple computer is becoming a thing of the past.
FarmVille developer has posted a $63 million net loss in its second quarter 2014 financial results.
The company has projected its net loss for the third quarter of the year to fall between $52 and $57 million. Earlier this year, Zynga announced that company founder Mark Pincus would step down from their role as Chief Product Officer to "focus on serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors."
In the same earnings call, Zynga announced its plans to take its first steps into the sports genre, starting with football. The company has announced its signing of a multi-year licensing agreement with the National Football League and NFL Players Inc., the marketing and licensing branch of the NFL Players Association.
The agreements will allow Zynga to incorporate the use of real-life NFL teams and athletes in its software. Zynga released NFL Showdown today in select regions, a game in which players run a team by stepping into the role of coach, general manager, and owner.
Zynga has also announced the signing of golfer Tiger Woods to an exclusive, multi-year, multi-platform partnership. The deal will see Zynga create "breakthrough mobile games that bring the world of Tiger Woods golf to life." The first of these is expected to launch on mobile platforms next year.
Temps is a cross-platform weather program for Windows, Linux and Mac that is beautiful, but eats more RAM in Megabyte than there are rainy days in England.
So, if RAM is not an issue on your device, you may read on if you are interested in a new weather application.
You may notice that Temps is a demanding application right when you start the 50 Megabyte download from the developer site. The 64-bit version for Windows has a size of more than 130 Megabytes unpacked which is gargantuan for a weather app.
The application is portable, and you may run it from any location though; so that is good and useful.
Temps
When you run Temps, you may notice two things. First, it requires an Internet connection to download weather information, and that it won't necessarily identify your current location correctly.
The data is pulled from OpenWeatherMap, and it uses a default API key on first start. The author notes that you may want to grab your own API key from the service -- the free version is sufficient -- so that you don't run into situations where too many users of the program try to download data from the service at once.
Next thing you may want to do is open the Settings of the program to change the location. Most cities and countries are identified correctly, so enter London, UK for instance to set the location to London, and have Temps download weather information for that location.
There are a couple of additional options available there. If you are from the US, you may switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and from the default 24-hour format to the 12 hour format.
Also, you may disable auto-start with the operating system, and disable showing the current weather as the program icon by default.
Weather information is limited to the current day, and the next four days. The app displays the temperature, and weather conditions (sunny, light rain, light intensity drizzle rain..), and a temperature graph for any of the four next days.
That's all there is to it right now.
As far as memory usage is concerned, it is quite high. Temps ran three processes on a Windows 10 64-bit test system on start which used more than 230 Megabytes of memory.
Alternative: check out our overview of the best weather programs for Windows.
Temp uses Electron which explains its size and memory hunger.
Closing Words
Temps is a beautiful minimalist weather application. It is resource hungry on the other hand, and it lacks information such as wind speed, humidity, or sunrise/sunset information that other weather apps offer.
Again, it is a beautiful program, but its resource requirements probably make it unattractive for the majority of users.
Now You: Do you use a weather application?

As with any good list, some ground rules are needed. The first is that the player in question had to be playing at United at the time at which their World Cup moment happened – sorry Fabien, you don't make the cut, though I suspect the fact that you won the thing probably eases the pain.
The second is that it has to be a moment of glory, so no David Beckham getting sent off in 1998, albeit that is an iconic moment. So, without further ado, the top five.
Norman is the Youngest!
On June 17th 1982, against Yugoslavia in La Romareda, Zaragoza, Norman Whiteside achieved the remarkable feat of supplanting Pele as the World Cup's youngest ever player. Aged 17 years and 42 days, Whiteside became an integral part of the Northern Ireland that advanced against almost all expectation to the second group stage of the tournament.
Whiteside, a United youth product, did not score at the finals, but their record as the youngest player ever to have taken part at a World Cup still stands, and will for at least another four years.
This is good news for Big Norm, because it means they don't have to change their twitter bio.
Bryan is the Fastest!
Staying in Spain in '82, and just over a week after Big Norm (or Young Norm, as they were presumably then known), had written their way into the record books, Bryan Robson decided they fancied a piece of the action.
England kicked off their opening game of the World Cup against France, and Steve Coppell's pace nearly allowed them to get on the end of a through-ball, near the right hand corner flag, seconds after the game had begun.
The French left-back did a fine job of marshalling Coppell and the ball slid out of play. Mick Mills grabbed the ball, and tossed it to Coppell, who paused, took a run up, and launched a long throw that would have made Rory Delap proud. As the ball made its way into the box the French defence crowded around Trevor Francis, who managed to flick a header on, into the path of the onrushing United captain. Robson, entirely unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box unleashed a flying/falling volley into the back of the net.
England were 1-0 up, 27 seconds into their World Cup campaign, and Robbo had scored the fastest goal an England player had every managed at a World Cup finals.
United boys run the group stages, 1998.
In 1998, United's class of '92 had begun to graduated to their national sides. Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and David Beckham were all in Glenn Hoddle's squad, but only Scholesey started the debut game against Tunisia.
Hoddle was more tactically astute than the England managers that dominated Scholes' time with the national team, and they played them in a midfield three which allowed them free reign to operate in their best position. And operate they did, scoring a sumptuous chip to extend England's lead against Tunisia, showing England what they could have had, if only they were bright enough to notice.
Becks didn't feature in the first game, but was brought on against Romania following an injury to Paul Ince as England succumbed to defeat. Gary Neville started that game, and all three started the final, crucial group game v. Colombia.
After Darren Anderton had opened the scoring, England were awarded a free-kick. There was only ever one outcome likely, as Becks did what they did best, and bent one to the keeper's right, from 30 or so yard out.
It all went a bit wrong in the next round, but those group stages, with United's young lads flourishing, foreshadowed the season that was to follow, and it was glorious.
Beckham's redemption.
Stop me if you've heard this before. England are not that good at penalties. Now, let me give you a minute to get over the shock of that…are you okay? Great.
With all that happened in the aftermath of David Beckham's sending off, against Argentina in 1998, that it would come down to a test of their nerve from 12 yards, against the same opposition in the group stages of the 2002 World Cup was an extraordinary moment of narrative perfection.
It was a moment they had earned. They had almost single handedly earned England's place in the 2002 World Cup. A fairly dismal qualifying campaign saw England needing at least a draw against Greece. We all know the story. There was a free-kick in the dying embers of the game, and Becks, again, did what they did best and began their rehabilitation in the hearts of the nation. (The hearts of the ridiculous bits of the nation that didn't already know how obviously brilliant they are, like we did.)
It is fair to say Becks has hit better penalties than the one which sealed their redemption. They just sort of walloped it as hard as they could and trusted to fate, and fate, that day smiled upon him. England might not be that good at penalties, but at that moment Becks was. They celebrated like they had undone a great wrong, like they had paid their penance. From then on their status as an England player was never in doubt.
Nobby and Bobby win the thing
8 years after surviving the Munich Air Disaster, Sir Bobby Charlton won the World Cup. As United fans, we naturally tend to focus on the 1968 European Cup win, and for all sorts of reasons, that was clearly a moment of staggering emotional complexity for Sir Bobby, but the England World Cup win was another truly remarkable achievement.
Charlton was absolutely key to England's progress in that tournament, scoring against Mexico in the group stages and getting both goals in their 2-1 victory over Eusebio's Portugal in the semi final. The first, a cool finish from the edge of the box following a rebound, and the second a Scholes-esque wallop from 18 yards.
In the final, Charlton and Franz Beckenbauer rather cancelled each other out, but Nobby Stiles played a crucial part in England's win, as they would do so many times for United, tigerish in their attempts to break down opposition play.
Their celebrations are iconic, with Stiles' toothless grin and Charlton's combover as indelible as Bobby Moore being held aloft with the trophy.
We might care more about their triumphs at Old Trafford, but it's still nice to see our boys doing well in the World Cup. Here's to Danny scoring a hat-trick against Italy at the weekend.
The first thing to note about the financial crisis is that the federal government never had any business intervening in the personal decision of whether you want to own a home. There is no rational economic argument, or any argument I know of, that says the market of buying and selling homes is imperfect in some way, requiring government action. Construction firms have plenty of incentive to build homes and sell them. People who have the wherewithal have plenty of incentive to buy homes if they so choose. For the government to intrude into homeownership was an off-budget, nontransparent, backdoor attempt at redistributing income. And when the policy became a way of transferring income to people who couldn't afford those homes, it was doomed to failure.
This provision of risky debt to low-income homeowners was exacerbated by a second misguided federal policy: the longstanding practice of bailing out private risk taking. Although this has gone on for decades in the U.S. and other countries, the Federal Reserve played a special role during the tenure of former chief Alan Greenspan. The Fed's implicit and almost explicit policy before the housing crash was to say to the financial markets: “Don't worry about the fact that there's a bubble. We'll lower interest rates and keep them low enough to prevent a collapse in asset prices.” This logic, broadly applied, was commonly called the Greenspan Put. The Federal Reserve was basically selling the market an option for getting out comparatively unscathed when things turned bad. The result has been a widely held assumption that market actors would not have to bear the full losses from their own risky behavior.
When people try to pin the blame for the financial crisis on the introduction of derivatives, or the increase in securitization, or the failure of ratings agencies, it's important to remember that the magnitude of both boom and bust was increased exponentially because of the notion in the back of everyone's mind that if things went badly, the government would bail us out. And in fact, that is what the federal government has done. But before critiquing this series of interventions, perhaps we should ask what the alternative was. Lots of people talk as if there was no option other than bailing out financial institutions. But you always have a choice. You may not like the other choices, but you always have a choice. We could have, for example, done nothing.
Unfair in the Short Term, Inappropriate in the Long Term
By doing nothing, I mean we could have done nothing new. Existing policies were available, which means bankruptcy or, in the case of banks, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Some sort of orderly, temporary control of a failing institution for the purpose of either selling off the assets and liquidating them, or, preferably, zeroing out the equity holders, giving the creditors a haircut and making them the new equity holders. Similarly, a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding might sell the institution to some player in the private sector willing to own it for some price.
With that method, taxpayer funds are generally unneeded, or at least needed to a much smaller extent than with the bailout approach. In weighing bankruptcy vs. bailouts, it's useful to look at the problem from three perspectives: in terms of income distribution, long-run efficiency, and short-term efficiency.
From the distributional perspective, the choice is a no-brainer. Bailouts took money from the taxpayers and gave it to banks that willingly, knowingly, and repeatedly took huge amounts of risk, hoping they'd get bailed out by everyone else. It clearly was an unfair transfer of funds. Under bankruptcy, on the other hand, the people who take most or even all of the loss are the equity holders and creditors of these institutions. This is appropriate, because these are the stakeholders who win on the upside when there's money to be made. Distributionally, we clearly did the wrong thing.
From the perspective of long-run efficiency, the question is also relatively straightforward. By the end of 2005, it should have been apparent that the U.S. economy was fundamentally misaligned. We had significantly overinvested in housing and significantly underinvested in factories, plants, and equipment. In effect, we needed a recession: a period to readjust the balance between the different types of capital.
More broadly, failure is an essential aspect of free markets. Failure shows capitalism is working, because it means resources are moving from bad uses to good uses.
There are other long-term problems with the bailout approach. Bailouts create moral hazards going forward, meaning market players will be more inclined to take excessive risks. Bailouts encourage inappropriate goals, such as propping up insolvent banks. Bailouts give the government ownership stakes in these institutions, which means that politics, not economics, is going to decide where these firms invest in the future. And bailouts set the wrong precedent for other industries.
The Only Plausible Argument
There is therefore only one reasonable argument for choosing bailouts over bankruptcy. Bailouts might make sense if bankruptcy imposed an externality—an unwelcome spillover effect. The argument for that goes as follows: When a given bank fails, it loses intermediation capital, or the ability to make loans. Any given bank knows a particular sector of the economy, a particular region of the country, or a particular kind of loan market. So if that bank fails, that specialized knowledge gets destroyed; therefore, at least in the short term, no one can easily make that kind of loan.
If that happened to one bank, you'd say it was no big deal; there are plenty of banks that have lots of knowledge. But if one large bank fails and defaults on obligations to lots of other banks, forcing some of them to fail, you might worry that contagion could lead to a lot of intermediation capital disappearing in a short period of time.
That story sounds somewhat plausible. But it has two key weaknesses, one theoretical and one empirical.
The theoretical weakness is that if a bank fails but its assets and its employees are bought by another bank, there is no reason for the intermediation capital to disappear. It just gets transferred to someone else. If you think that the good ideas for making productive loans are in the brains of the people of the failed bank, those people are probably going to go work at some other financial institution—a hedge fund, an insurance company, another bank. So you're not necessarily going to lose all the intermediation capital as a result of the failure. Indeed, the failed bank's employees may be put to work in more productive ways.
The empirical problem with the claim that bank failures destroy intermediation capital is that there isn't strong evidence to support it. Some evidence does show a correlation between bank failures and declines in output. But since declines in output should lead to bank failures, we don't know which is causing which. Thus, there isn't much quantitative data showing that bank failures lead to a large excess loss, over and above what you would expect when a negative shock hits the economy.
Because housing prices have declined, some people and institutions are worse off. Maybe it's the first bank in the chain that takes most of the hit. Or maybe the first bank passes some of the hit along because of its counter-party claims to some other bank. But that hit has to be taken. And in the U.S., it was a big hit indeed—plausibly several trillion dollars in housing wealth. The size of that loss doesn't demonstrate a spillover effect; it just shows that somebody has to experience the loss that the economy has already taken.
Twisted Incentives
For the first time in nearly 92 years, the rail budget will be part of the general budget this year. Much attention will be focused on the allocations for rail safety considering the three train derailments in quick succession in the last two months. On 10 November 2016, the Indore–Patna Express went off the tracks killing 150 people and injuring over 200; on 26 December 2016, the Sealdah–Ajmer Express slipped off the rails injuring 43 passengers; and on 21 January the Hirakhand Express derailed near Kuneri in Andhra Pradesh leading to 41 deaths (the toll continues to rise) and injuries to several passengers. The announcement of an inquiry into the causes of the latest accident was greeted with grim cynicism, black humour even, by the public and the media. The slight difference in the familiar aftermath this time around were the sabotage theories that were floated with the Maoists and Pakistan's ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) being blamed alternately. These theories have, for the time being, been set aside.
If appointment of safety review committees and submission of their reports were the only criteria involved, Indian railways would be the safest in the world. The plethora of reports of inquiries into accidents as well as those by high-level committees, contain recommendations that cover almost every aspect of the railways' functioning, especially on safety. The crux of the issue, as always, is about implementing these suggestions and finding the financial resources to do so. The Standing Committee on Railways, which gave its report on Safety and Security in Railways in December 2016, has again pointed to key areas that need urgent attention. These include the setting up of a separate department with safety as its sole priority. Underinvestment in railways has led to safety compromises and congested routes. Unmanned level crossings continue to be the biggest cause of casualties; in 2015–16, nearly 84% of accidents were due to derailments. The railways should completely switch to the Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches that do not witness higher casualties in case of derailments as the coaches do not pile upon each other. More than half of the accidents are due to carelessness of the railway staff, poor maintenance work and adoption of short-cuts. It must be noted here that the railway workers' unions have for long been complaining of the 1.42 lakh posts for safety lying vacant across the country and that security staff works under tremendous pressure and substandard working conditions.
The Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) and Development Fund have been getting increasingly exhausted and railway experts conclude that this is because the railways are not generating enough cash surplus. The DRF is the source to replace and maintain tracks, rolling stock and signalling systems. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has been criticised for making an inadequate provision of ₹3,200 crore for the DRF in the 2016 budget, cutting down the amount from that of the previous year. Their proposal seeking ₹1,19,183 crore for a dedicated Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (National Rail Safety Fund) was rejected. The finance ministry agreed to provide only 25% of the amount.
For far too long, the railway ministry portfolio has been a prize political allotment and run as such. Pleasing sections of vote banks and wooing yet others with announcements of “new” train halts and services (named to cater to regional pride) has dominated almost every railway minister's record. Prabhu has been accused of laying more stress on “public pleasing” measures like introducing free Wifi services at stations and upgrading catering and other allied services rather than attending to core issues like safety. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project of the proposed Mumbai–Ahmedabad bullet train, estimated to cost ₹97,636 crore, came in for particularly savage satire following the recent accident. Railway experts including a former railway minister have pointed out that the nub of safety measures like maintenance of sleepers, rolling stock and tracks has been paid scant attention in the past two years. The reports of the Anil Kakodkar High Level Safety Review Committee and the Sam Pitroda panel on railways, both submitted in 2012, have been quoted ad nauseam as have been those of successive reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
Quite apart from the ministry's increased attention to safety, it is important that the public and the media campaign for implementation of recommendations on safety measures. Critics have pointed out that most trains involved in accidents are the ones that do not have LHB coaches and which mostly cater to the poor. For the vast majority of Indians, the railways constitute the cheapest and easiest form of commute and long-distance travel. It is nothing short of criminal that successive ministers, given charge of this important portfolio, continue to play with the lives of our people while making unimportant and cosmetic changes.
About
The FLEXROUTE is here to fill the void fixed frame cable guides and fasteners (i.e. zip ties) could never truly accomplish: provide a universal, consistent, and secure solution that protects the frame and the cable. After years of watching a zip tie attempt this, only to wear and scratch the frame of a bike that was worth more than my car, it was clear a solution was needed.
In general, the only real option to secure very important and expensive systems, whether it be brake cables on a touring bike or lighting, radio, and GPS cables on a trophy truck, was to use a cheap cable tie. The cable tie, while great for fastening, can crush a cable housing and hamper system components, never uniformly secures a cable to a frame, and frankly just doesn't look good.
Since frames vary infinitely both in shape and size, the idea was to make something that was strong and durable, but able to adapt to a range of frame types and cable diameters. The FLEXROUTE, which still utilizes the great fastening capabilities of a zip tie, will flex and form around a frame providing uniform traction that a zip tie just can't accomplish on it's own.
| Design & Development
Once it was clear a solution was needed, the design process began, which was essentially a cycle from CAD, to the 3D printer, and out to the trail. Since the University of Nevada, Reno offers at cost FDM 3D printing for students and faculty, it allowed me to make a ton of prototypes without breaking the bank.
Over time I realized that this could work on everything that has a frame or support structure and a closed cable system. As I stepped back and took a more macro approach, I went back to the drawing board to see if I could make this work as a universal application. After designing and defining what this actually was, a provisional patent was filed with the USPTO.
| Variable Cable Diameters
A large part of the development process was spent designing the cable passage to be able to accommodate and properly secure a wide range of commonly used cable diameters. That meant measuring a ton of common cables used on bikes, off-road vehicles, computers, office equipment, and residential and commercial wiring. From this, I was able to re-design a cable passage that naturally adjusts and effectively secures the most commonly used cables.
| Simple Install
Easy user installation was always a design requirement. All cable systems may be different in function, but, for the most part, are closed and are not easily or quickly disassembled. The FLEXROUTE is designed to adapt to the cable and frame, not the other way around.
| Infinite Applications
What began as an answer for a specific problem, evolved into a universal solution with a wide range of applications.

| Quality
In order for the FLEXROUTE to be flexible yet durable while performing in extreme environments, material selection was crucial. After researching, comparing, and testing quite a few rubber compounds, I chose one that is highly regarded for its stringent electrical component requirements, sealing performance, and flex fatigue resistance. It is a high quality rubber compound commonly used to make power tool grips, automotive under-hood applications, weather seals, and even bridge expansion joints.
| Low-Profile Cable Tie Utilization
The FLEXROUTE doesn't replace the conventional cable tie entirely, it still relies on it's unsurpassed fastening capabilities. We saw that the conventional zip tie has many drawbacks both functionally and aesthetically, that is why we will be including the lowest profile nylon cable tie on the market, the Cobra Tie. Cobra zip ties offer superior tensile strength and robust quality that stand up well in a wide range of environments. Safer than a traditional tie, Cobra features a smooth, snag-proof contour with no barbs or spikes to injure an installer, technician or end user.
| Production
Certain critical project factors like mold and unit quality, production rate, and effective and timely communication are in the hands of the manufacturer. After screening companies all over the US, I went with a local injection molding company known for taking on specialized and complex biomedical projects, building high quality molds, and delivering on time. They were also chosen for their successful track record making complex components and the ability to eliminate a large portion of the overall shipping cost due to being local.
The injection molder will be crucial in the production process and will be responsible for 90% of the process once the funds are obtained. That is why a strong relationship has been established with them over the past several months.
Unlike many projects, since these parts will be injection molded at a fairly quick rate, we will be able to accommodate many orders (above and beyond what we are looking for from Kickstarter). Shipping times will increase for late backers due to the nature of a longer manufacturing time, but shouldn't be too bad. We will be in constant communication with all of our backers to let them know about the status of every step along the way: mold design/testing, production, packaging, shipping.
| Rewards
| Safe Use
The FLEXROUTE is simply a cable guide and is not intended for load bearing application
The FLEXROUTE was only designed to use the very common 5mm wide zip tie. It was not intended for narrower or wider zip ties.
Do not use if failure of either the FLEXROUTE or the zip tie would cause damage or injury.
| Timeline
Once the funding goal is reached and the project is completed, we will get these gears turning that have been in place for several months.
WEEK 1 (Project Funded): Manufacturer is notified and mold production begins.
WEEK 2: Funds released by Amazon
WEEK 6-8: Mold production and testing complete and manufacturing begins by our experienced local injection molder. (Production output at approximately 5,600 units/day)
WEEK 6-8: Packaging and Shipping begins.
Depending on the amount of orders received, packaging and shipping may take several weeks to complete. First come first served.
WEEK 8-12: Begin receiving the very first FLEXROUTE
Ragnarok is nigh!
The 1.10 version sees some major but subtle changes. After receiving a great many requests for some new iron and diamond armour, I have updated them. I really try to leave the textures from the original artists untouched but the requests have been very convincing. I tried many variants and finally decided keep as true to the base concepts was best. I hope you like them.
Lord Trilobite created this excellent work of art . It has been languishing since 1.6. I finally found a way to contact Lord Trilobite and they gave permission to bring it up to date (see the comments in the original thread link above). What a pleasure to work with these textures.
is simply excellent and I hope you enjoy playing with this resource pack as much as I did making the new textures.

The outgoing US administration has not given up on its hope of dealing one last blow to relations with Russia, which it has already destroyed. Using obviously inspired leaks in the US media, it is trying to threaten us again with expansion of anti-Russian sanctions, “diplomatic” measures and even subversion of our computer systems. Moreover, this final New Year's “greeting” from Barack Obama's team, which is already preparing to leave the White House, is being cynically presented as a response to some cyber-attacks from Moscow.
Frankly speaking, we are tired of lies about Russian hackers that continue to be spread in the United States from the very top. The Obama administration launched this misinformation half a year ago in a bid to play up to the required nominee at the November presidential election and, having failed to achieve the desired effect, has been trying to justify its failure by taking it out with a vengeance on Russian-US relations.
However, the truth about the White House-orchestrated provocation is bound to surface sooner or later. In fact, this is already happening. On December 8, US media quoted Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp as saying that the local authorities tracked down the origin of a hacker attack on their voter registration database after the election. The attack was traced to an IP address of the Department of Homeland Security. This was followed by an attempt to quickly cover up this information by a flood of new anti-Russian accusations that did not contain a single piece of evidence.
We can only add that if Washington takes new hostile steps, it will receive an answer. This applies to any actions against Russian diplomatic missions in the United States, which will immediately backfire at US diplomats in Russia. The Obama administration probably does not care at all about the future of bilateral relations, but history will hardly forgive it for this après-nous-le-deluge attitude.
This morning, Mastertronic rang the death knell for the budget boxed games range that used to be their “core business”.
It is no longer a core business, let alone ours,” said MD Andy Payne. “PC budget games are now sold online digitally, as we all know.”
The Steam-centric part of me thought as most of you probably did: well, duh. But another, younger part of me – the kernel that subsisted on games sold under the banner of Sold Out, M.A.D, Mastertronic and PC Gamer Presents – felt like a lifeline had been snipped.
As a 13-year-old, I read rave reviews for Rainbow Six: Raven Shield and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time until I knew intimately what it was like to play them. But I wouldn't play them – not for years.
For young British teenagers with access to a PC, options were limited by a few factors: price, age restriction and availability. A trip to GAME with 35 pounds in your pocket, to exchange for one of the games propped up by cardboard displays at the front of the shop, was incredibly rare. And the odds of a middling PC even reacting to a double click of its .exe once you got the disc home were poor.
The UK budget wave that began in the late ‘90s represented the perfect convergence, then: ageing games at prices which matched the national average in pocket money. Tall, four-sided swivelling stands filled with branded boxes from Sold Out, M.A.D and PC Gamer Presents became beacons for desperate children dragged around ASDA.
A lot of what was on those stands was chuff, obviously: Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Hooligans: Storm over Europe. The long-awaited digital adaptation of ‘Guess Who?'. But gosh: an awful lot of it wasn't.
The games sold by publishers like Mastertronic were, frankly, a bit old. The best they could do was ensure the titles they picked had matured well. For that reason, presumably, they tended to be single player and story-driven – the sort of thing that lasts.
Some of them were genre greats. Command & Conquer: Red Alert rubbed shoulders with Theme Hospital, and Shogun: Total War with Dungeon Keeper 2.
Others were wildly inappropriate for the audience buying them in supermarkets which, long before stricter guidelines were introduced, didn't push age ratings. Grand Theft Auto 1 finally got to spawn that generation of car-jackers, half a decade after the newspapers had lost interest. And GTA London had budding anarchists gleefully firing rockets at Buckingham Palace.
But best of all, Sold Out Software's orange-white uniform made these past hits indistinguishable on the shelves from underplayed commercial flops. Budget branding gave a second wind to Thief II and the later Broken Sword entries – games whose misshapen early 3D polygons could be forgiven by a young, new audience.
Occasionally, the grown-ups at PCGamesN reminiscence about these games. But it's difficult to know what in particular we learned from them. Maybe all that Tomb Raider taught us was that the distance from the fireplace to the pool is too far to run, which at best sounds like it could be spun into a useful metaphor of some kind.
Perhaps this strange stable of budget games actually left us worse-off, by setting us up for disappointment. By the time we played them, the genres Command & Conquer and Theme Hospital defined were stagnant, and would remain so for the next decade.
But while teenagers with enough about them to take advantage of Steam sales unquestionably have it better than we did, there's a sense of shared experience that's faded since digital distribution conquered the world. That's only going to recede further as Steam moves further away from being a curated space and hands more control to its users.
Our diet of budget boxed games wasn't curated for us, exactly – publishers like Mastertronic were limited by what they could get, and what they knew they could sell. But we were exposed to a reading list of games we otherwise wouldn't have been, at a time when we had too much time and too few options to ignore them. To Sold Out, M.A.D, Mastertronic and PC Gamer Presents: thanks for starting us on the right path for PC gaming.
For a glimpse at a place where there's still an appetite for boxed PC games, dive intoSlitherine's world of wargames.
Third part of a daily series on the Packard Plant.
The route was always the same.
After loading their pickup trucks with scrap metal from the abandoned Packard Plant, the revolving door of petty thieves drove past nine blocks of abandonment, crossed I-94 and turned into a massive, gated scrapyard called Strong Steel Products. There, they traded their metal treasures for money.
It's against the law for a scrapyard to knowingly buy stolen metal. The sentence – up to five years in prison.
The Motor City Muckraker spent four months investigating metal theft at the sprawling ruins of the Packard Plant and found a lively scrapping operation. The money is quick and easy – and the metal market is booming, producing record profits for scrapyards and modest earnings for scrappers.
At the Packard, with more than 40 abandoned buildings, scrap metal is plentiful. But it's the biggest appeal, said unemployed Carl Barnes, is its proximity to a scrapyard that ask no questions.
“Everyone knows they cool,” Barnes said of Strong Steel on Strong Street, where their friend later unloaded a steel beam for cash. “You be chill, they be chill. That's how we operate.”
Strong Steel is owned by Detroit-based Ferrous Processing & Trading Co., which also operates scrapyards in Flint, Taylor, Warren, Florida, Ohio and Canada. The company didn't return calls for comment.
Packard owner Dominic Cristini, who says metal thefts have cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars, blames Strong Steel for much of the loss.
“I'll probably get killed for saying this,” Cristini said half-jokingly, “but that's where they take it. It's a short ride.”
We followed scrappers from the Packard to Strong Steel, where other pickups full of scraps waited in a long line outside of the entrance. After getting paid between $25 to $250, they often retuned with more scraps from the Packard.
The company boasts about the importance of integrity on its website.
“We share a common commitment to doing the right thing,” the site reads. “We are in business for the long pull, and our reputation for straight forward dealing is one of our cherished assets.”
Scrapping may seem relatively harmless, but it can wreak havoc on buildings that could have been salvaged. Once gutted, the buildings become magnets for crime and are eyesores that drive down property values and accelerate the residential exodus.
Critics of scrapping say the practice won't end until the real profit-makers, the scrapyards, stop accepting illegal metal.
Coming tomorrow: Michigan lawmakers backed down from reforms because of pressure from scrapyards.

Theme Park Tech: Musical Roller Coasters
With roller coasters pushing the envelope of human tolerance, theme parks, engineers, and designers are increasingly turning to different ways to engage and immerse riders. Designers have placed riders into just about every possible position, flipped them in every conceivable direction, and changed train speeds more than a car on an L.A. freeway during Friday afternoon rush hour. However, a more elemental feature of theme parks is growing in popularity, and allowing designers to do more with roller coasters than just hit riders with ever-changing forces and visual stimulation.
Music has been a key component to the success in parks long before America's first theme parks started gaining popularity in the middle of the last century. Music is not only key to set the mood and atmosphere as guests stroll through a park, but it's also used to help tell stories on rides and during shows/parades. Without music, a theme park can be a very quiet place. However, only recently has technology advanced to allow designers to integrate music to enhance the roller coaster experience. Parks attempted to place speakers strategically on lifts and in other places along the track to play sound effects and short music clips, but they were rarely loud enough to be heard over the screaming of riders and the sound of the train roaring along the track. Indoor roller coasters had it a little better, but the music and sound effects were more of an afterthought than a real part of the ride.
Even with digital music hitting its stride in the early to mid-90's with CDs, mini-discs (I never had one, but I knew silly people who did), and the invention of the MP3 in 1995, there was no way to deliver music or sound directly to speakers on the train. CDs and mini-discs skipped, hard drives crashed, and solid state memory was still in its infancy with memory measured in kilobytes. Not only that, memory cost thousands of dollars to purchase enough storage for a single song and a program to decode and broadcast it.
In 1996, Disneyland, which installed the first roller coaster in the world with a steel tubular track (Matterhorn Bobsleds), re-launched the iconic Space Mountain as one of the first roller coasters with an on-board soundtrack. The music, a remixed version of a piece called “Aquarium of the Animals,” created an entirely new experience for long time fans, and changed the way guests thought about the roller coaster. However, while the soundtrack was “blasted” right behind the head of the riders, the speakers did not have enough power to overcome the sound of screams and the train echoing inside the enclosed building.
In 1999, Disney brought on-board sound into the 21st century with one of the first roller coasters specifically designed around a musical theme. Rock ‘n' Roller Coaster Featuring Aerosmith set the standard for music on roller coasters that was left unchallenged for more than 10 years. The coaster trains, designed to look like “stretch” limos, pump sound through 120 on-board speakers. The music was not initially ear-splittingly loud, but was definitely loud enough to overcome the sounds from the riders and train.
Even in the new millennium, ride designers were still having difficulty getting on-board speakers to overcome the sounds of the ride itself along with the riders. Improvements in battery technology and advancements in solid state memory and file compression eventually allowed for a crisp, clear delivery of music and sound effects to riders. 24-volt sound systems are now the standard for on-board coaster sound systems, and were first introduced in California Screamin' (Disney California Adventure). The 2005 complete redesign of Space Mountain and a 2007 upgrade of Rock ‘n' Roller Coaster also brought the boosted 24-volt sound system to the masses, and revitalized the aging musical coaster pioneers.
In 2008, the combination of music and roller coaster reached its pinnacle with the debut of three new musical roller coasters in a single park. Hard Rock Park, now appearing these days on NBC as a film set for “Evolution”, showed what can be done when you put a kickin' sound system on a roller coaster. Eagles: Life in the Fast Lane was a rather benign double-lift mine train-style roller coaster, but with a well synchronized soundtrack of songs from one of America's most popular rock/country bands, it made a simple ride far more interesting and exciting.
Maximum RPM!, which was probably more unique for its one-of-a-kind ferris wheel lift, blasted a peppy 80's-era soundtrack through the car's on-board sound system.
However, Hard Rock Park's signature coaster was themed around one of the most iconic rock bands of all time, Led Zeppelin: The Ride. The coaster was meticulously designed with input from the band, which required designers to play the selected song (“Whole Lotta Love”) in its entirety. With a 5-minute song and most coaster durations lasting under 3 minutes, designers had an interesting dilemma: come up with a 5+ minute roller coaster, pick a different song, or find a way for guests to somehow experience to enter song though a pre- or post-show. The later was the final solution, and with a cleverly integrated pre-show and loading process, riders would hear the first half of the song in a sound stage before boarding the coaster. Once on board, the song picked right up leading to a Robert Plant scream synchronized to the first drop. In order to further enhance the on-board audio experience, designers filled the track and supports with sand to reduce sounds coming from the train rolling along the track and positioned speakers in front of each seat and behind riders' heads. Those who had a chance to ride Led Zeppelin: The Ride for the year that the park was open, experienced what is still probably the greatest musical roller coaster ever built.
A year later in 2009, Universal, after much publicity, debuted one of the most technologically complicated roller coasters operating today. Hollywood Rip, Ride, Rockit not only features a booming on-board sound system, but gives riders the ability to create their own soundtrack and make a video of them rocking out to their selected tune. The coaster went through a series of technical issues, culminating with a flaw in the train design that left the coaster out of service for well over a year. However, after all of the issues and an unusual track layout, it is likely to continue to thrill guests for years with its hidden musical tracks that provide hundreds of musical options and customizable experience.
Even Six Flags is working to implement music and sound effects through on-board speakers with X2 (upgraded with on-board sound in 2008) and Bizarro (upgraded Superman Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England and Medusa at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2009). While the soundtracks for the upgrades Six Flags coasters are more sound clips than storytelling mechanisms, they still add a level of excitement that is noticeably missing if you happen to experience the coaster without the soundtrack.
Music plays such a huge role in theme parks, and designers are just scratching the surface of integrating music and sound effects on roller coasters. On-board sound has almost become a necessity on modern dark rides like Spider-Man, Transformers, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye, and Curse of DarKastle. As parks look to make new and more interesting coaster experiences, on-board music and sound is bound to play a larger role in future coaster designs.

Progressive Mechanical Loading for Injury Rehabilitation/Prevention
by Chris Mason
Progressive Mechanical Loading (PML) is a term I have coined to describe what I have found to be the most effective injury rehabilitation/prevention method in my nearly 30 years in the iron game. PML is deceptively simple, but as Occam's razor suggests, the most effective solutions need not always be overly complicated or exotic in nature.
Aristotle writes in their Posterior Analytics , “We may assume the superiority ceteris paribus [all things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses.”
PML involves the use of progressive resistance to condition tissue (skeletal muscular, connective, even osseous) to either prevent injury when the extreme forces of heavy loading or explosive training are employed, or when injury occurs, to facilitate a speedier and more complete recovery.
I first became aware of the the general concept from Louie Simmons (www.westside-barbell.com). I had torn my right pec major relatively significantly and had called Louie to receive counsel. In short, Louie told me to get back to benching almost immediately. Start extremely light (use 20+ rep sets), use high frequency, and very gradually increase the loading over time. I did exactly that, well almost exactly… I probably started heavier than I should have using 95 lbs. I think I did 9 reps the first time. All I did was the one set and stopped at 9 reps because it literally felt like the pec was going to completely tear from the bone with each rep (which Louie had warned me would happen). I moved the weight slowly with what can best be characterized as perfect form. I did this daily trying to get more reps each time. When I got to 20 reps I increased the load by 10 lbs and started over doing as much reps as possible. After about four weeks of daily benching (one set each day) I went to benching every other day continuously trying to progress in reps and resistance. When I got to the mid 200s for 20 reps I began to increase the loading and decrease the reps first doing sets of 12 and over the course of a few more weeks moving down to sets of 5-8 reps and so on.
The method worked, and worked very well. I believe it resulted both in faster and superior healing of the injury. I am now benching more than ever and have not experienced lingering problems from the injury. There is science to back the concept. My buddy Shaun did some post-graduate research at the University of Virginia (10 minutes from my home). The focus of their research was the regeneration of connective tissue. Convenient, eh? To make a long story short we were out having a drink one night at a local university haunt called Boylan Heights. Well, maybe more than one drink…. Anyway, while discussing the topic they told me about research which showed that when the skeletal muscle associated with damaged (in this case I believe it was a partially severed tendon) connective tissue is mechanically stressed it causes a chemical cavalcade which results in increased signaling for the repair of the damaged tissue. This information simply reinforced what I had discovered empirically. Rest for an injury is not ideal, rather mechanical loading of the tissue such that the injury is not exacerbated, but the tissue is still sufficiently stimulated to more aggressively repair itself, is what leads to optimized recovery.
I mentioned in the beginning of this article that PML can be used for both injury repair and prevention. For injury prevention a modified version of the technique is employed. In the spirit of full disclosure, what I am referring to here is just an extension of the concept of GPP (General Physical Preparedness) and the first couple of micro cycles in classic periodization. The difference is it is a highly specific adaptation of these concepts. Its primary use is for the seasoned lifter/athlete who has developed an excellent strength base and plans to try something new, or something they have not done in a long time. You see, the body's adaptation to exercise is extremely specific. For example, take a lifter who back squats, but never performs front squats with regularity. The primary movers for both movements are the same, but the relative emphasis on them varies due to the changes in the location of the load and thus the movement of the body and joints. The variation in movement is also dramatically different for the nervous system.
The variation in the movement pattern and thus variation in stress on the musculature and connective tissue can lead to injury if the more advanced athlete too quickly attempts maximal loads. This is because the force production capacity of the involved musculature may exceed the mechanical stress absorbing capacity of the connective tissues for the specific movement pattern of the front squat, or any new, or not regularly used movement. PML can address this by building the connective tissue for the specific movement pattern prior to the use the of maximal loads.
The basic principle of progression for this use of PML is similar to that used for injury repair, but differs in initial loading. The initial loading will be significantly greater than that used for injury repair. It will still be relatively light, but in this case the selected resistance should be heavy enough that it is difficult to complete 20 repetitions. The frequency is also less, more akin to that of your normal training, and the progression of resistance can be faster, but should still cover four to five weeks prior to reaching loads of 90% or greater.
Savvy use of PML will lead to less injury, faster recovery if injury does occur, and the ability to more quickly progress in one's strength or athletic training. Give it try, you will not regret the decision.
VICTORIA is so short of sperm donors that some women are flying interstate for IVF treatment, prompting calls to ease restrictions on importing sperm.
Fertility doctors say demand for sperm has surged since laws giving single women and lesbians access to IVF were brought in last year, with some patients waiting up to nine months.
The removal of anonymity has also made some men reluctant to donate, and restrictions that mean they can only give sperm to 10 families have also increased the need for more donors.
With just 184 registered sperm donors left in Victoria, fertility doctors say some patients are resorting to DIY inseminations using unscreened sperm, which carries the risk of infection.
Importing sperm is prohibited in Victoria unless approved by the Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority, which last year granted permission in just three cases. But states without specific reproductive legislation such as Queensland are routinely importing sperm, often from American sperm banks.
The stars turned out for the Los Angeles premiere of “Mechanic: Resurrection” at Hollywood's Arclight Cinema Monday night.
Celebrities such as Randy Couture, Chris D'Elia and Rosie Huntington Whiteley joined cast members Jason Statham, Jessica Alba and Sam Hazeldine on the red carpet, with revved-up fans screaming from every corner of the theater.
With the new film comes a new director, Dennis Gansel. Gansel stated that they saw the potential in a multi-million dollar franchise after seeing the 2011 reboot of the classic film, and hopes to expand the “Mechanic” series with additional sequels in the near future.
“I've always seen [protagonist] Arthur Bishop as sort of dirty James Bond,” Gansel said. “I saw this as the perfect opportunity to make the franchise bigger and better, and also by choosing more exotic locations, like Rio and Thailand.”
Gansel, a native of Hanover, Germany, also discussed their love of working with Hollywood's elite.
“I think people are so smart in the United States,” Gansel said. “People in Germany think Hollywood is all about the money, but it's not. [Producers] are all focused on the story here, and also about character development and making the stories bigger and better.”
Statham, who reprises their role as Arthur Bishop, returned with ease and excitement to the sequel. Statham's favorite part of shooting? The fight scenes, of course.
“A lot of the fight scenes were very memorable, Statham said. “The buildings [we shot in] were architectural masterpieces, and we did a lot of cool stunts underwater with scuba gear.”
“Mechanic: Resurrection” opens worldwide Aug. 26.
NISSAN TO GIVE LINCOLN A PUBLIC PLUG
New charging installation to be dedicated to Top Gear after show highlighted lack of EV infrastructure in the city.
Twin charging points, one for each presenter, to be installed in city centre
Nissan is to fund the installation of Lincoln's first public electric vehicle charging point, following the recent Top Gear feature which highlighted the lack of charging infrastructure in the East Midlands city.
In the television programme, presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May drove a pair of electric vehicles, including the Nissan LEAF, into the centre of Lincoln in an attempt to find somewhere to charge their cars.
Having failed to find any public infrastructure the pair were forced to charge at the University in the centre of the city, dangling cables through an open window.
Should the presenters choose to attempt the journey again in future, they will discover a newly-installed PodPoint charging unit dedicated to them. With two sockets, it would allow both Jeremy and James to recharge their batteries at the same time.
Charging will be free of charge to electric vehicle owners.
Councillor Fay Smith, Portfolio Holder for Environmental Services and Public Protection at the City of Lincoln Council, said: "The Top Gear programme highlighted the fact that Lincoln does not currently provide for electric cars and we're really pleased that Nissan is now funding a charging point. We're committed to reducing the city's carbon footprint, but know that we can't do it alone, so it's great that private businesses like Nissan are getting behind this and putting in the infrastructure."
The PodPoint charging unit is due to be installed before the end of the month and the presenters will be invited to return to Lincoln and be the first to plug in to the new charger.
Top Gear Executive Producer Andy Wilman said: "This is excellent news for the electric car community of Lincoln. If the charging point had existed when Top Gear were there, James wouldn't now be walking around with Jeremy's name tattooed on their bottom. Still, better late than never."
Nissan's Executive Vice President Andy Palmer said: "Research tells us that most LEAF owners will charge their car at home or at their place of work, but drivers like having the ability to 'top up' their charge when they are out and about, especially if they are making longer journeys. With its new charging points and the fame generated by Top Gear, Lincoln could find itself becoming a tourist destination for Nissan LEAF owners."
When Top Gear said that, "In the real world, [the Tesla Roadster ] doesn't seem to work," the electric automaker responded with a lawsuit Nissan is taking a different tack, putting a clever twist on the one-sided, anti-EV message that the British television show keeps broadcasting about the faults of plug-in vehicles. In the town of Lincoln , where presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May supposedly ran out of juice in a Nissan Leaf it was all staged ), Nissan will install two charging points, one dedicated to each of the TV stars.The EVSE – a PodPoint charging unit – will be put in the downtown area and the two sockets, will "allow both Jeremy and James to recharge their batteries at the same time." How kind.When the chaps aren't around, other plug-in vehicle drivers will be able to charge for free at the station, something that the local government representatives are obviously pleased about (as you can read in the statement after the jump ). The station should be operational by the end of August, and Nissan says it is going to invite May and Clarkson to be the first to plug in there. That's an event we look forward to seeing on an episode of Top Gear right about... never. Show full PR text
Welcome back to Faithless Looting, my weekly look at budget lists and budget formats.
There were some really fun submissions for contest #5. The request was for tribal decks, so fun submissions are practically a given. Two tribes really stood out, though. Brennon submitted a list of mono-black assassins, and Archivold took a Modern brew from rremedio and put it into Pauper with a Zubera Tribal theme.

While doing this Web comic, I have come across many different forms of social media. Tumblr is one of them. The basis of this site is that you follow certain people and see various blogs and images that they post. It's like every other social media site but with more teen angst. The oddest things that I've come across are images of characters being extra loving to their very young sidekicks. Art of Batman embracing Robin while kissing them on the forehead runs rampant through the blogs on the site. Let's also not forget images of Captain America with Bucky on their shoulders blushing as if something unsavory is about to happen. So if you're looking to feel creepy and dirty while looking at characters you love doing things to each other out of character, stop by Tumblr. You can thank me later.
James “Erotic Nightwing is the best Nightwing” Alvarez
A new study has found that the benefits of antipsychotic drugs outweigh the risks of any negative side effects. Photo by chuck stock/Shutterstock
May 5 (UPI) -- Columbia University researchers have found antipsychotic medications do not have negative long-term effects on patients with schizophrenia and other disorders.
Researchers from Columbia in collaboration with colleagues from the United States, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, China and Austria found the benefits of antipsychotic medications are much greater than their side effects.
Antipsychotic medications are prescribed to alleviate the symptoms of psychosis and to prevent possible relapse. Concerns have been raised recently about possible toxic effects, which could negatively impact long-term outcomes.
So researchers set out to examine the safety and effectiveness of long-term antipsychotic use to treat schizophrenia.
"The evidence from randomized clinical trials and neuroimaging studies overwhelmingly suggests that the majority of patients with schizophrenia benefit from antipsychotic treatment, both in the initial presentation of the disease and for longer-term maintenance to prevent relapse," Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, professor and chairperson of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeon and director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said in a press release. "Anyone who doubts this conclusion should talk with people whose symptoms have been relieved by treatment and literally given back their lives."
The research revealed that delaying or withholding treatment was associated with poorer long-term outcomes.
"While a minority of patients who recover from an initial psychotic episode may maintain their remission without antipsychotic treatment, there is currently no clinical biomarker to identify them, and it is a very small number of patients who may fall into this subgroup," Lieberman said. "Consequently, withholding treatment could be detrimental for most patients with schizophrenia."
The study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.
Who doesn't love Paris? This city has it all. While it may be crowded it is easy to see why throngs of people spill into the city year-round. The artistic spirit is more present here than anywhere in the world. From Renaissance at The Louvre, Impressionism at The Orsay, and contemporary alternative at Palais de Tokyo, Paris is filled to the brim with art. And the best part is even the streets are filled with incredible murals and graffiti. From lowbrow pop to politically-motivated and everything in between. The street art in Paris is stunning!
The 5th arrondissmeent and the 13th arrondissement are the mostly heavily painted of all the neighborhoods. You can't turn a corner without seeing spray paint, paper cut-out plasters and mosaics. These neighborhoods are replete with art. Lots of which is hidden down little alleyways or in otherwise inconspicuous places. Be sure to keep an eye out.
One thing that makes street art so amazing is its anonymity. Very few of these artists actually sign their name to their work. This creates a certain mystery to the art that keeps you guessing. This street art is often timing socio-political and its anonymous nature makes you wonder the backstory of all these artists. In fact, it is said that the Les Halles green market in Paris is the birthplace of street art. In the 70's this market was an urban construction site that artists would use as an outdoor canvas. Gérard Zlotykamien was supposedly the first to enter and decided to spray paint images that evoked a nuclear destroyed Hiroshima. From then on out street art grew and grew throughout Paris. Today, it is all over and more moving than ever.
The Paris Metro is also a good spot to see some art. Since the underground is constantly crowded, seeing some exotic public art helps make the commute easier to swallow. Let's face it, crowds in Paris suck. But, there's always a silver lining. And masterful public art is a good one.
Paris is most definitely a socially and politically aware city. One of it's best features to me. The city blends the upper crust with the starving artist too. They live within blocks of each other. And this blend (which being a New Yorker I am all too familiar with) is apparent down every block. Part of its charm however is that there does seem to be a peaceful co-existence. Most of the time.
Le Mur Des Je T'Aime or “Wall of I love you” in Montemarte is one of the city's best. On 40 meters of tile the words “I love you” appear in 250 languages. It truly is romantic up close. After all, Paris is for lovers.
Some of the dirtier graffiti is just as cool as the immaculate building-high pieces. Paris has a little grit to it. But, it wouldn't be Paris without it. You've got to take a little grime to give a city some authenticity. Paris is certainly unapologetic about each and every street. When visiting you'll have to learn to appreciate it.

Syria's Uncertain Air Defense Capabilities
May 6, 2013
Over the weekend of May 3-5, Israel carried out airstrikes against targets in Syria, specifically against a shipment of missiles believed to be headed towards Lebanon. This is the third set of Israeli strikes that has hit Syrian targets without reports of effective Syrian resistance or Israeli losses since the start of 2013. It also follows on the successful Israeli air strikes that destroyed a nuclear reactor under construction in the Deir ez-Zor region on Syria on September 6, 2007.
Israel's success does indicate that the purely military risks in enforcing some form of no fly or no move zone are now more limited that when the fighting in Syria began. At the same time, this does not mean that Syria could not put up a defense or that the US could simply rely on a few strikes or threats to either destroy Syria's air defense or intimidate it into complying with US demands.
The practical problem is that we do not know how many stand-off weapons were used, how far the Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft had to penetrate, or the real-world readiness of Syrian air defenses.
We do not know if Syria has seriously tried to halt IAF attacks. Syria has not been able to use these systems effectively against Israel since the early 1980s. Syria may be willing to wait out limited IAF strikes rather than reveal the electronic order of battle and send signals that would help Israel develop improved methods of suppression during a limited attack.
We know most of the Syrian longer-range surface-based air defenses are still largely active and provide overlapping coverage of much of the country. But they also have aging surface-to-air missiles (SAM) that have been only partially upgraded and are vulnerable to jamming and other electronic countermeasures, as well as antiradiation missiles.
There are no reliable estimates of what is left or active. Before the civil war intensified, the IISS and Jane's estimated that they included 25 AD brigades with some150 SAM batteries. These include a mix of aging low altitude defense systems, largely developed in the 1970s or earlier, using S-125 Pechora (SA-3 Goa), 2K12 mobile, short-range Kub (SA-6 Gainful), obsolete medium to high altitude defenses with S-75 Divna (SA-2 Guideline), and 2 AD regiments with 2 battalions each, which each had 2 batteries with S-200 Angara (SA-5 Gammon).
We also know that Syria has sought far more modern Russian systems like the S-300 and S-400 for more than two decades and every attempt has failed—largely because of Syrian financing problems and Russian sensitivity to Israeli views. It is also clear that Syria has had to relocate substantial parts of these forces to avoid rebel forces taking them. Syria had also over-concentrated them around its cities and near Israel before the civil war, leaving vulnerable "corridors" in the north and the west, while IAF aircraft could also fire from Lebanese airspace.
Syria has more modern short ranges and manportable surface-based air defenses. The IISS-Jane's estimates indicate they include the following mobile systems: 14 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko), 20 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin), 20 9K37 Buk (SA-11 Gadfly), 30 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher), 96K6 Pantsir-S1 (SA-22 Greyhound), and the 9K317 Buk-M2 (SA-17 Grizzly). The manportable systems include 9K32 Strela-2 (SA-7 Grail), 9K38 Igla (SA- 18 Grouse), 9K36 Strela-3 (SA-14 Gremlin), and the 9 K 338 Igla-SS (SA-24 Grinch).
The newest of these systems could be effective if their location was unknown but IAF aircraft had standoff weapons that allow them to strike outside the range of such systems and advanced countermeasures that will seriously degrade most of these systems. The Assad regime may also be scared of distributing them because of the risk that they would fall into rebel hands.
The Syrian air force had some 365-385 combat aircraft when the fighting started. It is not clear how many are now active but a rough estimate is probably about 50 percent with very low sustainability against an active air attack, limited pilot training, and low daily sorties generation rates. It had no modern air defense fighters and operational readiness standards have almost certainly degraded. Syrian holdings of air defense fighters included 85 aircraft with aging avionics and which are very vulnerable to both IAF and U.S. fighters, air-to-air missiles, and air combat systems like the AWACs. These include: 50 obsolescent MiG-23MF/ML/UM Flogger, 35 export versions of the MiG-29A/U Fulcrum with limited computer and radar capabilities for look-shoot down and long range BVR combat. According to the IISS, a large number of these systems were not operational before the civil war: 30 MiG-25 Foxbats and 2 MiG-25U Foxbats.
The rest of the Syrian air force was attack-oriented in spite of the fact that it had little chance of surviving Israel's air defenses. Again, the IISS and Jane's estimate it included some 105 obsolete MiG-21MF/bis Fishbed, 15 obsolete MiG-21U MongolA, 50 obsolescent MiG-23BN/UB Floggers, 50 limited-capability Su-22 Fitter D, and 20export versions of the Su-24 Fencer with limited computer and avionics capabilities. It is possible that the Syrian air force has rules of engagement that preclude the use of fighter aircraft for anything other than all-out war given the massive losses they suffered fighting the IAF in 1982.
This makes the Syrian forces vulnerable to U.S. military action to enforce some form of no fly/no move zone, but Syria still has a much larger and more capable mix of forces than Libya possessed. It would take a massive U.S. air and cruise missile attack to suppress it quickly and would be difficult for even two carrier groups to carry out and sustain. As a result, the United States would certainly desire land-bases from allies like Jordan and Turkey and the use of Qatari and/or Saudi bases.
Syria could also choose to ride out a U.S. threat and then constantly push the U.S. by appearing to prepare its forces, locking on radars, etc. These are tactics that would stress any U.S. forces enforcing a zone. Syria also knows all about them from U.S. operations in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia. In short, Syria does not have strong air defenses by U.S. standards but it is still very large. It would take a major U.S. air effort to accomplish quickly and the United States might well take some losses if Syria fought back and would have to have a sustained presence if Syria chose not to fight.
There is also the question of how broad a U.S. no-fly zone would really be. If the United States included civilian protection areas, it would have to be prepared to use airpower to stop pro-Assad ground forces as well. If it was a true “no fly” zone, it would have to deal with Syrian helicopters as well, and they have been key threats. (IISS pre-civil war estimates were 33 Mi-25 Hind D attack helicopters, Mi-17 Hip H and 30 SA342L Gazelle multi-role armed helicopters, and 40 Mi-8 Hip transport helicopters, and some 60 percent are probably still operational).
Moreover, "no fly" would presumably mean no Syrian missiles and rockets and Syria still has a significant inventory of such systems. In short, even though the events of the past weekend may suggest air power's efficacy in responding to the civil war, it will be no easy task to expand this into a wider campaign.

[UPDATE: EXIF Data is Wrong, it's f/1.6!] PSA: The LG V30's Main Camera Aperture May Not Actually be f/1.6 as Advertised
UPDATE 9/2/2017: LG Spokespeople have confirmed that the aperture is indeed 1.6 as expected. Carry on!
At IFA 2017 Berlin, LG took to the stage to unveil their latest smartphone — the new LG V30. With the latest SoC from Qualcomm and a slew of other impressive features, the LG V30 is to be LG's trump card for the rest of the year and until the LG G7 comes into the picture.
One of the highlights of the LG V30 is its rear camera setup. LG has chosen to go in once again with a standard lens and a wide angle lens, giving us a good choice between two different views for framing our shots. Of particular interest is the aperture value on the main shooter, as LG claims that the main camera boasts of an f-number of 1.6. This f/1.6 makes the LG V30 the widest aperture consumer smartphone in current times, beating close rivals like Samsung's f/1.7 on the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S7. The wider aperture would allow the phone to let in more light or decrease the shutter time. This should put the V30 one step ahead of its rivals on paper, giving it one more point that it can advertise for its superiority.
However, LG's claims for the main camera's f-number may not be as advertised. Early camera samples from the main rear camera indicate that the f-number on the rear shooter is actually f/1.69 instead of f/1.6. This was first pointed out by Russian blog Technot, which inspected the exif data from camera samples posted on a few notable Android sites. The exif data on the samples from Phandroid and GSMArena indicate that LG misled customers by mentioning that the V30 has an aperture of f/1.6. Other users on Reddit also confirm that the LG V30 indeed reports a f/1.69 aperture.
Here is the complete EXIF data from one of GSMArena‘s sample pics:
EXIF Data LG V30 EXIF data General ------- Byte order:Motorola (big endian) Main IFD -------- Camera make:LG Electronics Camera model:LG-US998 Software: Date/time:30-08-2017 06:56:43 PM Image description: Copyright: Orientation:Normal Title: Subject: Author: Comments: Keywords: Resolution:72 x 72 inches Exif sub-IFD ------------ Exif version:2.20 Brightness value:0 Colour space:RGB Date/time original:30-08-2017 06:56:43 PM Date/time digitised:30-08-2017 06:56:43 PM Digital zoom ratio:1 Exif image width:4656 Exif image height:3492 Exposure programme:Undefined Exposure time:0.00833333333333333 seconds Exposure bias value:0 File source: Flash present:Yes Flash mode:Compulsory suppression Flash fired:No Flash red eye reduction:No Flash strobe light:No detection function F number:1.69 Focal length:4.03 Focal length in 35mm film:0 Gain control: Image unique ID: ISO speed rating(s):50 Light source: MakerNote data offset:0 Metering mode:Centre weighted average Related sound file: Rendering: Scene capture type:Standard Scene type:Directly photographed Sensing method:One chip Shutter speed:8.338 milliseconds Spectral sensitivity: Subject distance range: White balance mode:Auto Interoperability sub-IFD ------------------------ Interoperability type:R98 Interoperability version:1.00 GPS sub-IFD ----------- GPS version: GPS date/time (UTC):30-12-1899 12:00:00 AM GPS altitude:0 metres GPS satellites: GPS status: GPS measure mode: GPS map datum: GPS differential: Thumbnail IFD ------------- Thumbnail orientation:Normal Thumbnail resolution:72 x 72 inches
The V30's f/1.69 aperture should ordinarily get rounded to f/1.7 for brevity. Instead, LG chose to ignore the hundredths digit entirely, truncating the number to f/1.6 in its own favor. The end result is a number that indicates that the V30 does indeed have an even wider aperture for a smartphone camera.
LG's advertising and marketing machinery does heavily bank upon this misleading claim. The official press release for the V30 does tout it as the first f/1.6 aperture camera lens and goes on to boast the f-number in several places.
The change from f/1.6 to f/1.69 may not seem like a big deal – it's only a difference of 0.09! Right? Not quite — when you put into context that the closest competition to the LG V30 can only manage f/1.7 aperture, then LG's claims start venturing into the territory of misleading advertisement. The previous LG flagship, the LG G6, sported an aperture of f/1.8, so LG V30's claimed f/1.6 aperture would indicate double the numeric improvement over the previous flagship. Having the aperture actually be f/1.7 would take away talking points from LG's latest flagship, dulling its edge against the competition and rendering much of this marketing misleading.
LG can be given the benefit of doubt in this case because of how EXIF data works. EXIF data can often be unreliable, especially when the software could be buggy. The samples originate from review units, with at least GSMArena mentioning that the phone is an early pre-production unit. This incorrect f-number situation could be a result of early camera firmware writing incorrect data (it's arbitrarily set, so it could be a mistake), or it could be a case of LG trying to mislead customers.
We hope LG clarifies the situation with the V30's main camera and corrects the misinformation regarding its aperture value.
Some new details have emerged out of the Game Informer cover story of Borderlands 2.
A post over at Gearbox's forums reveals that each manufacturer in the game will have their own unique visual style. This will be done to enable players to easily identify a weapons manufacturer and its quality. No manufacturer will carry the same looking gun.
NPCs in the game will be fully animated and will be able to move around their locations interacting with objects. Gearbox plans to make four seats standard for all vehicles, and class mods and artifacts will be making a comeback.
Borderlands 2's skill tree will be maintaining the three-branch system, and will have more defined abilities rather than simple stat boosts. However, it is unknown how many skills will occupy each branch.
Gearbox also mentioned two Gunzerker skills: one increases the fire rate of any weapon the longer the trigger is held down, and the second increases accuracy with same class weapons, or doubles damage for different class weapons while dual-wielding.

Spring? Posted by The Landing School on March 25, 2014 · Leave a Comment
What Spring? With yet another snowstorm in the forecast for tomorrow, we Mainers are getting a little stircrazy. We want to open the windows and put away the coats and most importantly get the boats in the water! But while we wait for old man winter to take their much-needed nap, we'll keep plugging away on building stuff.
This week the Composites students are finishing up with the molds for their kayaks. They should be ready to put these to use to build their boats next week. The Marine Systems students are moving on to their modules. These freestanding structures teach students about plumbing and wiring in a way that let's everyone gets in on the action, which can be tough to do with real boats and 30 students. They may look messy now but they'll be wired, plumbed and looking tidy in no time. The Wooden Boat Building shops are very popular right now. There's no thing like the smell of fresh cut wood. It's like catnip to some! In the small boats option, students start with raw planks which will be used to build the mast of their boat. Next door in the cruising boats option, consoles, gutters and other pieces of the Flyfisher are coming together nicely.
Although we're still weeks away from warmer weather, we'll daydream about Spring and the day all these boats hit the water.

If the Tennessee Vols hire a new head coach, there will also be a new coaching staff in Knoxville.
It's always an exciting time when a new coach is hired, which seems to happen a lot if you're a fan of the Tennessee Vols.
One of the fun parts of a new coach is seeing the staff that's assembled. Especially if it's a a first time head coach, or a head coach coming from a smaller conference.
We decided to pick four head coaches that are potential candidates at Tennessee. We picked one coach that's not currently coaching, a potential first time head coach and two coaches from smaller conferences.
Here's what we think their potential staffs could look like and how each assistant would be connected to the head coach.
Malware authors have written a worm for Orkut, Google-owned networking site that's big in Brazil.
The Scrapkut worm uses active code injection to spread between victims and their friends on Orkut. The malicious code appears on a victim's scrapbook, containing a link to a supposed YouTube video.
People who click on the link are redirected to an external site hosting malware that's disguised as a Flash upgrade. Users duped into installing the software get malicious Javascript code injected into their next active Orkut web session. This malicious scrapbook entry is then sent to all the victims' friends, recommencing the infection cycle.
An analysis by Symantec can be found here.
Judging by the counter on a web page associated with the malware (not the most reliable of indicators) about 13,000 users are already infected by the Scrapkut worm, which isn't - for now - doing anything particularly nasty other than spreading.
By contrast an earlier worm that spread across the Orkut network last December infected an estimated 655,000 people. Google plugged the cross-site scripting (XSS) error that made the attack possible hours later, thwarting tfurther propagation of that fast-spreading worm. ®
Ontario's police watchdog has cleared a Toronto police officer who says they punched an Occupy Toronto protester in the face during an arrest.
The Special Investigations Unit says it's unclear whether the force was "excessive," when considering the level at which Angela Turvey was resisting arrest.
The SIU says Ms. Turvey, 37, had a broken nose, a black eye and required seven stitches above their right eye, but it wasn't clear whether the injuries were from the punch or their head hitting the ground during arrest.
Story continues below advertisement
SIU Director Ian Scott says while they believe Ms. Turvey was punched in the face, they were interfering with the arrest of another protester and there are no reasonable grounds to criminally charge the officer.
The SIU says security video shows Ms. Turvey refusing orders to back away from police during a man's arrest, swinging at officers, then after the punch struggling on the ground with police as they are arrested.
The scuffle took place outside a downtown Toronto courthouse on University Avenue on March 30, a day when five Occupy protesters were arrested earlier when police moved to evict them from a camp set up near city hall.
The group had already been removed several months earlier from its original camp at St. James Park.
SIU investigators interviewed six officers and 14 other witnesses and examined security footage of the incident.
The agency is called in whenever someone is killed or seriously hurt while interacting with police.
Man wearing high heels, fishnet tights wanted over Melbourne fast food robbery
Updated
A man wearing black high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings is wanted by police over an armed robbery at a Melbourne fast food restaurant.
Police said the man, who was also wearing a pink scarf and a blonde wig at the time, approached staff at the counter of a restaurant on Fitzgerald Road at Laverton North on February 8.
They said they were holding a paper cup, which they claimed contained a detonator for an explosive device.
After demanding and receiving a quantity of cash, the man then fled the store on foot.
The man was also carrying a large brown bag.
Officers said they did not find any explosive devices at the restaurant when they arrived.
Police have released a CCTV image of a person they believe may be able to assist with their inquiries and have asked anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers.
The man is said to be of Caucasian appearance, about 183cm tall, of thin build, with a chiselled jaw and heavy stubble on their face, according to police.

Back in February, the story broke about a shifty group of “IT specialists” who were getting paid an exorbitant amount of money to service the email and computer systems of a couple of dozen House Democrats.
The locus of this mess are three brothers, Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan and Imran Awan's wife, Hina R. Alvi. Of the members they supported, three were on the House Intelligence Committee and five were on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Money problems abounded with the group involving bankruptcies and lawsuits. This is the curious part. Jamal was paid $160K per year, Abid was paid $161K and Imran $165K. All were paid well over three times the average House IT staff salary. The three owned an LLC, “Cars International A” (note the initials), and had taken a $100,000 load from a Doctor Ali al-Attar, who, in addition to having their medical license suspended for financial irregularities, had a relationship with Lebanese Hezbollah. (My posts here and here.)
An investigation was started into the theft of government equipment and breach of data systems, the Awans were suspended, and now, apparently have absconded to Pakistan.
One would think the Democrats would be all hot and bothered to get to the bottom of this and find out the extent to which their crack Hezbollah-linked IT staffers have compromised classified systems in the House as well as member accounts. But one would be wrong.
Wasserman Schultz is one of the members of the subcommittee that oversees the Capitol Police. At a hearing today, on the budget for the police force, Wasserman Schultz demanded that the Capitol Police return computers held as evidence and came within a whisker (of which they have more than their share) of threatening the police chief with a budget cut if they ignored them demand.
Transcript via Daily Caller:
“My understanding is the the Capitol Police is not able to confiscate Members' equipment when the Member is not under investigation,” Wasserman Schultz said in the annual police budget hearing of the House Committee On Appropriations' Legislative Branch Subcommittee. “We can't return the equipment,” Police Chief Matthew R. Verderosa told the Florida Democrat. “I think you're violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and you should expect that there will be consequences,” Wasserman Schultz said.
…
“If a Member loses equipment and it is found by your staff and identified as that member's equipment and the member is not associated with any case, it is supposed to be returned. Yes or no?” they said. Police tell them it is important to “an ongoing investigation,” but presses for its return anyway.
Them incredible claim is that if the member is not under investigation that the Capitol Police have to return equipment belonging to that member even if it is evidence in an ongoing investigation.
This is exactly one thing. It is obstruction of justice. Or two things. A grotesque cover-up.
What makes this so suspicious is that this is exactly the same way Debbie Wasserman Schultz handled the investigation into the alleged hacking of the DNC server. They refused to let the FBI examine the servers or treat them as evidence and the FBI, for unknown reasons, did what they told them to do.
Back in 2005, Matt Cavotta introduced us all to Taste the Magic, the very first Vorthos-centric column on the Magic mothership. When Matt was no longer able to continue writing their column, senior Creative Team member Doug Beyer continued the tradition with Savor the Flavor. For the five-year anniversary of having a Vorthos-centered column on MagictheGathering.com, Doug brought back a feature originally debuted by Matt called Okra-Twinkie-Tofu, or O-T-T as it is commonly referred to. O-T-T was one of my favorite features, and seeing as this year we will celebrate ten years of Vorthos columns, I thought, What better way to mark the milestone than by resurrecting O-T-T feature here on Gathering Magic?
For Those of Us Who Don't Know, What Is O-T-T?
As explained by both Matt and Doug before me, Okra-Twinkie-Tofu takes a look at some of the less-well-known words found gracing the faces of Magic cards, and the series attempts to place them into one of three defined buckets:
Original image found here.
Both Khans of Tarkir and Fate Reforged are filled with glorious morsels of delicious Magic flavor, so it seemed only right to kick off this reforged O-T-T by taking a bite out of our newest planar setting:
Tarkir is Down with O-T-T
Vizier: Rakshasa Vizier (KTK) An interesting and very real word, a vizier was the highest-ranking official in ancient Egypt, who was hand-selected by the pharaoh to supervise and run the country (much like a prime minister). Ainok: Ainok Guide (FRF) As far as I can tell, the word Ainok is completely made up. The term is used to refer to Tarkir's race of anthropomorphic hound-humanoids found living mostly in Temur and Abzan territories. Haruspex: Grim Haruspex (KTK) A strange yet very real word, haruspex is the word you would use to describe an individual trained in the art of haruspicy, a Roman form of divination involving the inspection of entrails. The term haruspex comes from a combination of the archaic word haru ("entrails, intestines") and the root spec (“to watch, observe”). How cool is that? Krushok: Battlefront Krushok (FRF) Krushok is a made up word used to describe the rhino-like creatures found roaming Tarkir. Krushoks can be seen on the cards Feral Krushok and Great Horn Krushok, and they do not look like they should be messed with—ever. Bivouac: Frontier Bivouac (KTK) While it this one sounds completely fake, bivouac is in fact a real word. Pronounced “biv-oo-ak”, which to me sounds like “biv-wak,” it is a temporary camp that has no tents or cover, a type of camp often used by mountaineers. Lammasu: Venerable Lammasu (KTK) The name for this creature type looks artificial, but it is actually a reference to an Assyrian protective deity. The deity would often be depicted as having a bull or lion body, eagle wings, and the head of a human. Colossodon: Tusked Colossodon (KTK) This is definitely fake-sounding, right? It appears that the word colossodon is actually a combination of the words colossal, meaning extraordinarily great in size, and the Greek donta, meaning tooth. Krumar: Krumar Bond-Kin (KTK) This one is a completely made-up Abzan term. When an orphan is created from war, the Abzan take in these orphaned children and raise them as soldiers of the clan. The word Krumar is what the Abzan use to refer to one of these orphans of war. Rakshasa: Rakshasa's Disdain (FRF) This one has to be completely bogus, right? Wrong. A rakshasa is a demonic being from Hindu mythology, often depicted as ugly, fierce-looking creatures with fangs, claws, and flaming-red eyes and hair. They would be shown as growling beasts, often drinking blood from the skulls of humans. It was believed that these terrible creatures possessed powerful magical powers. The rakshasa is classified in the lore as being amongst the Yatudhanas, demonic creatures who consume the flesh of humans.
Before I finish for today, I want to take a quick second and say that Seb McKinnon is quickly becoming one of my new favorite Magic artists. Two of the cards featured today (Grim Haruspex and Rakshasa's Disdain) were illustrated by the artist, and they are absolutely incredible pieces. Make sure you check out Seb's portfolio online here.
Until Next Time
I hope you enjoyed this revival of Okra-Twinkie-Tofu. If you would like to see more O-T-T in the future, express your desire down in the comments! If you would like to see me go back and revisit some older sets that may have missed out on the O-T-T treatment, tell me about that as well. That's all I have time for today; join me next week for more of that tasty Vorthos flavor.

French are Alone in Mali; Allies in Hiding Behind U.S., U.K. Inaction (Le Figaro, France)
"If America had entered the dance, the situation would have been completely different, especially in London. But Barack Obama doesn't want to engage the United States in a new war. Their arm had to be twisted over Libya, and it won't happen again. The result: many countries that generally align with Washington found in its total absence of 'leadership' one more reason to do nothing."

France - Le Figaro - Original Article (French)
Prime Minister David Cameron calls for a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union, sending a shudder through the E.U. France can expect little help from Cameron with their campaign in Mali. EUXTV VIDEO, E.U. TV: British Prime Minister Cameron speaks on Britain and Europe; calls for referendum on E.U. membership, January 23, 00:37:04
It is unjust to reproach France for going it alone to fight the jihadists in Mali. Critics alleging an ill prepared operation and inadequate efforts to obtain international support appear to betray a misunderstanding of the international reality. The indifference to threats we confront and the abandonment of any will to resist them is rather disquieting.
Everyone verbally supports French intervention, which is close to being unassailable from the point of view of international legality. That said, concrete offers of aid are being kept to a bare minimum. For most of our allies, the war is being run by France. It is not their affair.
The height of cynicism was achieved this week, during celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty, the foundation of French-German reconciliation. Angela Merkel and other German officials stressed how France is courageously defending the interests of Europe. Sincere thanks were offered to our armed forces. But the chancellor and other officials clearly excluded the possibility of taking any political risk to support a military operation is considering so essential.

This attitude is very German. It can be explained by the past and the well anchored refusal of the population to pursuing any military adventure. The concept of a parliamentary army requires that the Bundestag be consulted before any deployment of the German Army. That was the case for Kosovo and for Afghanistan. But Africa is a another affair.
Berlin's euro crisis ascendency in Europe incited every country to hide behind German refusal to do nothing. One cannot both demand that European countries tighten their belts and, at the same time, fight jihadists ...
Do not count on Great Britain, the second military power in Europe, which shared the direction of operations in Libya with France. The United Kingdom of David Cameron is in full retreat, which was shown by the speech in which the prime minister proposed a referendum on the country's membership in the European Union.

Chilling Future Awaits 'Girl Model' Recruits

In Girl Model, an alarming documentary about the trafficking of Russian child models to the Japanese fashion market, a garrulous modeling agent explains their philosophy: To expiate their own past bad behavior, they say with papal solemnity, they approach model recruitment as a religious calling, not to mention a fatherly responsibility to do right by the girls, give them a better life than they have now and protect them from harm.
This apparently includes hauling novices off to the city morgue to see how badly things can end for a recruit who doesn't do as she's told. As the rest of the film shows in quietly terrifying detail, it also involves dispatching barely pubescent girls to Tokyo without their parents, dumping them in sparsely furnished apartments without supervision and leaving them to fend for themselves as they run from casting calls to photo shoots without actually earning a penny.
Most of the girls are under 15 years of age. No doubt one or two make it in the business. The lucky ones make it home, severely in debt but physically unhurt.
The movie, made by Massachusetts filmmakers David Redmon and Ashley Sabin, doesn't directly address the legality of this slimy operation. But unless this disingenuous creep of an agent actually believes their own propaganda, you have to wonder what possessed them to open themselves to scrutiny by two filmmakers who are well-known for expose docs like Mardi Gras: Made in China and Camp Katrina.
Oddly enough, the idea for Girl Model came from the agent's chief scout, an American former model named Ashley Arbaugh, who's credited as a "creative consultant." Arbaugh, who went to college with Redmon, has a horribly compelling role in the movie: They pluck a 13-year-old Serbian beauty named Nadya from their home in a village near Novosibirsk and sends them to Tokyo. There, we learn, the demand for leggy innocents is endless.
Watching Nadya and hundreds of other skinny, bikini-clad hopefuls line up before scouts who mull their flaws in front of them as if they were fresh meat — "Her hips are too big," "She's nothing special," and so on — you wonder also whether any of the gathering public outrage in the West over the abuse of underage models has percolated through to the Eastern bloc.
If it has, it's not getting in the families' way. Nadya doesn't come from wealth, but it's far from clear that their loving parents are destitute; they want to build a more spacious house. For their part, this touchingly sweet kid is bemusedly thrilled to win the cheesy crown that makes them "Miss Elite Star." Basically, though, they want things "to be good at home."

Nadya's euphoria doesn't last. In Tokyo, they must find their way alone to the rundown flat they share with a slightly more well-heeled Russian girl who's soon sent packing for gaining a few ounces. As Nadya trudges through casting calls that bear no fruit, weeps through intermittent phone conversations with their mother when they can find a phone, and exhibits childish delight when they finally find a magazine photo of themselves all but hidden under a garish wig, their loneliness is pretty devastating.
But the emotional isolation of the brittle scout Ashley, a vision of Nadya's future if she's "lucky," made me want to throw myself off a cliff. A former model herself, Ashley is bright, articulate and seemingly crippled by ambivalence toward the lucrative living they earn as a de facto procurer for a man they know is just this side of a pimp. They have grown wealthy on the proceeds, and it's a perverse visual gift to the filmmakers that they live in a glass house in Connecticut, alone save for a couple of naked plastic dolls — "I had a third, but I dissected it" — that represent the babies they plan to have, though it's unclear with whom.
Is Ashley a sad case in a whole different way from the innocent Nadya, or an accomplished self-promoter, every bit as corrupt as their boss? They claim to hate the world that they see as a velvet prison, yet at times Girl Model feels like Ashley's private vanity project. (Do we need to see before-and-after footage of their stomach when they have surgery to remove the fibroid tumors that are preventing them pregnancy?)
They describe the slide of many would-be models into prostitution — it "may be easier than being a model," they say — with something disturbingly like relish. And by the end of the movie, they have exhausted our sympathy by showing themselves to be a smoothly practiced liar, snowing the anxious parents of a fresh batch of recruits with promises that their daughters will all be successful and never get into debt. By now we know enough that, when a postscript tells us what Nadya will do next, we're filled with dread.
One day after declaring war on ISIS members, Anonymous has already managed to take down over 3,800 Twitter accounts linked to various ISIS members and associates.
The hacktivism group quickly got its business together, created an official Twitter account for the whole #OpParis operation, and a new website where to centralize all ISIS accounts.
Besides scanning for ISIS Twitter accounts themselves, the hacking group has also opened access to the site to those interested. Anyone who comes across ISIS social media accounts can easily search the database and report any new terrorists and supporters.
The website is called #opIceISIS and will index ISIS members based on their real name, location, picture, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube accounts.
Before the Paris attacks, Anonymous waged war on ISIS members after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, earlier this year, during operation #OpISIS. That time, the group managed to take down tens of thousands of accounts.
With over 3,800 just on the first day, the group seems more determined this time around to finally put an end to the terrorist group.
Just before the Paris attacks, the Ghost Security Group, another secret hacking posse, revealed that they traced Bitcoin wallets holding more than $3 million / €2.8 million back to known ISIS members.
With Anonymous' most recent additions of known ISIS members to their database, law enforcement agencies and other hacking groups might be able to track down more accounts and hinder the terrorists' activities.
UPDATE: UK journalists are claiming to have seen some of the data collected by Anonymous activists. Also, after day #2 of the Anonymous-ISIS cyber-war, the hackers are claiming they have now taken down 5,500 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts.
Republican strategist Karl Rove refused to believe that President Barack Obama had been re-elected on Tuesday even after their employer, Fox News, announced that the election was over.
“The network — our network called on the basis of 74 percent of the vote being in,” Rove said immediately after Fox News called Ohio and the election for Obama. “One of the biggest blocks of votes in the state are the Republican suburbs inside Hamilton County and as they've started to come in, they've narrowed [Obama's] margin dramatically.”
“You went through this in 2000, you almost went through it in 2004, do you believe that Ohio has been settled?” Fox News host Chris Wallace asked the breathless strategist.
“No, I don't,” Rove replied. “And look, if we are calling this on the basis of 74 percent of the vote being in, and when 77 percent is in, secretary of state website — I have the Ohio director of the Romney campaign on the other end of the line refreshing the page every few seconds.”
“I think this is premature,” President George W. Bush's former senior adviser added. “I don't know what the outcome is going to be but we gotta be careful about calling things when we have like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote yet to count.”
“That's awkward,” Fox News host Megyn Kelly admitted.
After a commercial break, cameras followed Kelly down to the Fox News Decision Desk to “get to the bottom of it.”
“We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio,” one Decision Desk worker explained. “There's too much Obama vote that's outstanding there that we know is going to come in.”
“There just aren't enough Republican votes left for Mitt Romney to get there,” another Decision Desk staffer agreed. “As the late vote comes in, we would expect to see the president's vote to rise and rise.”
“What we're looking at is actual raw vote, city by city, county by county,” the first worker insisted. “And what we're seeing is sufficient vote in Ohio on the Democratic side to mean that Ohio will go for Obama.”

Part 2
Decluttering Your Bookshelf
I have one regret in all my years of moving. I was twenty, rushing through a move out of a pretty nasty apartment in Brooklyn. It was a desperate rental, that I shared with an older yoga guru of some sort. My Dad and I filled their car with all but three boxes of books, half of the ones I owned. The car was full.
We both just wanted to get the HELL out.
I stared at those last three boxes, mentally recalling which shelves and which books I'd be leaving behind. My Arden MacBeth (easily replaceable), Othello Variorum (not hard to replace but quite an investment)….I didn't need any of those right now. I left my roommate/landlord a note saying I'd be back for those boxes next week, knowing full well I wouldn't dare return, and said, “Let's go.”
That was over fifteen years ago and I still regret leaving that Variorum behind.
Now, having moved cross-country, lived in cute but not spacious Los Angeles apartments, downsized to make room for kids and moved cross-country once again. I'm a master at clearing my books before the end of the move drains all my will to even look at a box, never mind lift it.
(I should add here that I also have hoarding tendencies and a book buying compulsion, so you can imagine…)
Here are some guidelines to make decluttering your bookshelves painless and fun:
1. Forgive yourself for not reading. I always start with those books that I bought with every intention of reading but never made the time to do so. There's a reason you haven't ‘found' the time; it just doesn't mean as much to you now as while waiting in line to buy your textbooks or when Amazon popped up with those loved and dreaded “Suggested Books”. You aren't going to read it and that is okay. Life happens. Other interests happen. Let it go. Let it go!
2. Start the “Month of Maybe” pile. If you really cannot let it go, and trust me, I understand that feeling, then start your Month of Maybe pile. Find some place in your home that you see every day (I have the top of my bureau that is directly in my eye-line every morning), and pile no more than ten books there. You keep them for a month – set an alarm! If you haven't read it by then, or even just picked it up, then out it goes. It doesn't mean as much to you as it did at purchase.
3. Give books to friends as gifts. This has always been the most successful method for me. I used to work with a lot of teenagers who couldn't afford a book buying habit. One day I had an entire trunk of books to donate in my car when I went to see them, and offered up any they wanted. The looks on their faces diminished any fear I had of leaving behind my beloved theater theory books from college. All those quick read books I got to take my mind off being overdue with my first baby? These teens loved them! Whether they are given away in bulk or you just know that you have a friend who would love this one book, identify those gifts and go directly to drop off /mail them! Then donate any others immediately.*
4. If you really don't want to part with it, donate to your local library. Then you can always check the book out of the library if you have the urge to hold it in your hands again.
With this simple plan, the books will find new homes, and hey – they still exist in the world, so you can always come back to them later. Best of all, you now have room for more.
*About donations: Libraries are great, of course, but are sometimes overwhelmed with donations, so don't be miffed if they say, “Thanks, but no thanks.” You might also consider other non-profits: shelters, schools, hospitals. Some thrift stores are ok, but some don't really know how to deal with books. Surreptitiously check out their book section, and see if they seem to care. In Los Angeles, Out of the Closet is a pretty good bet. We, of course, buy books and accept donations. Always worth a shot. – Editor

Louisiana radio host Jeff Crouere this week compared sensitivity training for homophobic, racist or sexist employees to re-education camps in communist China.
Last week, the Miami Dolphins had reprimanded player Don Jones for tweeting that “omg” and “horrible” after seeing newly-picked St. Louis Rams linebacker Michael Sam kissing their boyfriend on an ESPN broadcast. The Dolphins hit Jones with fines, and banned them from participating in team activities until they completed sensitivity training.
In a column for Christian Post, Crouere called the training a “gay agenda re-education camp.”
“It seems the politically correct liberals in charge of the NFL are admirers of communism. In Red China, Cambodia, Vietnam and other countries communist tyrants forced citizens into re-education camps to ‘enlighten' their subjects about the wonderful ‘benefits' of totalitarianism,” the conservative radio host wrote.
Crouere complained that Americans were no longer free to participate in the “evils of racism, homophobia and sexism” without being “sent to ‘educational training,' to learn about the merits of the homosexual agenda and become more sensitive to the gay and lesbian lifestyle.”
“This type of ‘training' is an American styled re-education camp for Jones. They will undoubtedly emerge with a new and enlightened view of homosexuality,” they added. “With this toxic environment, imagine what our Founding Fathers would think about their country today.”
The idea that Jones was being sent to a re-education camp first came up while Crouere was speaking to a caller on their radio show last week.
“Jeff, I'm on my way to indoctrination camp,” the caller quipped. “It's a combination of re-indoctrination, indoctrination, thought change, whatever… I will be happy if I'm not thrown in jail.”
“They're rubbing it in our face, aren't they?” Crouere replied. “It's upsetting. It's over the top.”
By the end of the show, the radio host had adopted the talking point.
“Can't someone express their opinion about it?” they asked. “That was Don Jones, second-year player. They deleted their tweets, and now he's going to be fined.”
“I mean, I guess he's going to be sent to some re-education camp somewhere.”

× Medical Examiner rules Oklahoma inmate's death a homicide
CADDO COUNTY, Okla. – The death of an inmate at an Oklahoma jail has been ruled a homicide.
The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office determined Darius Randell Robinson died of strangulation, the autopsy report shows.
On April 4th, officials say Robinson, 41, was caught trying to escape from their Caddo County jail cell.
When jailers attempted to restrain him, Robinson allegedly charged them, KSWO reports.
The inmate was handcuffed, pepper sprayed and put in a neck hold on the floor.
When they stopped breathing, they were taken to an Anadarko hospital where they were pronounced dead.
Their autopsy results were released Wednesday.
The report showed Robinson died of strangulation.
Their death has been ruled a homicide, KSWO reports.
Robinson had been in jail since April 1, 2016 when they were arrested on four child support warrants.
[Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: haskell-src-exts-1.12.0
Fellow Haskelleers, I'm pleased to announce the release of haskell-src-exts-1.12.0! * On hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts * Via cabal: cabal install haskell-src-exts * Darcs repo: http://code.haskell.org/haskell-src-exts It's been a long while since the last update before this, but it is my definite hope that I will once again be able to update regularly. This major release primarily enables the (relatively) new quasi-quoter syntax. The "major" version bump is questionable, but better safe than sorry. The only backwards incompatible change is that pretty- and exact-printing now use the new quasi-quoter syntax, which makes the round-tripping 'exactPrint . parse' cycle fail for code using the old syntax. There are more changes in the pipeline, some larger and some smaller. Stay tuned! Changelog: 1.11.1 --> 1.12.0 =============== * Move from old [$...| quasi-quote syntax to the new [...| one. The old syntax is still recognized while parsing. * Allow symbols as variables when TypeOperators is enabled. * Rename ExplicitForall in ExplicitForAll, to be consistent with GHC and the Haskell' process.

The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV) says they are waiting to watch what will happen next in Vancouver's real estate industry as home buying demand slowed to normal levels in July.
“After several months of record-breaking sales activity, home buyer demand returned to more historically normal levels in July,” Dan Morrison, REBGV president said in a release.
Sales numbers
The number of sales in Metro Vancouver totaled 3,226 last month, down 18.9 per cent from one year earlier and 26.7 per cent from June. The number of sales of single family homes saw the largest decrease, down 30.9 per cent from the year before.
This is the first time home sales in a month have counted below 4,000 since January.

Inventory up
Meanwhile, new inventory increased year-over-year by 2.5 per cent. The sales-to-listings ratio was 38.6 per cent, the lowest for a July since at least 2013.
Prices continue to increase slightly
But prices continued to increase, with the benchmark price of a detached home now marked at $1,578,300, up 1.1 per cent from the month before and 38 per cent from July 2015.
Prices for these properties actually decreased in certain neighbourhoods, including Burnaby North (-1.7 per cent), Ladner (-0.9 per cent), and Tsawwassen (-0.2 per cent).
Apartment prices also increased again, up to $510,600 compared to $501,100 in June and $400,900 in July 2015, an increase of 1.9 per cent and 27.4 per cent respectively. Sales of these properties decreased by 7.3 per cent year over year.
Townhomes were up to a benchmark price of $669,000, a 1.8 per cent jump from the month before and 29.4 per cent year over year. Sales of these properties decreased by 20.7 per cent year over year.
“Home sale activity showed some moderating signs in late June and this carried into July,” Morrison said. “We'll wait and watch over the next few months to see if this marks the return of more normal market trends.”

Sales-to-active listings ratio is the red herring
Last month, UBC's Tom Davidoff, an associate professor at the Sauder School of Business and a real estate analyst, said the first signs of a bubble bursting might be sales volume slowing down and inventory rising.
June saw the lowest sales-to-active listings ratio for detached homes for the month, at 59 per cent, since the beginning of Vancouver's spike in home prices in 2013. July's ratio of 45 per cent is also the lowest for the month, down from 77 per cent this time last year.

The sales-to-active listings ratio is a key indicator of the health of the market. In layperson's terms, it is the supply and demand of properties. The lower the number, the better the market is for buyers.
Summer months are typically slower for real estate transactions than the busy spring and fall periods, but the data shows a departure from the repeatedly scorching hot statistics reported by REBGV each month for the last several years.
49ers defensive end Ray McDonald speaks with reporters outside the locker room at Levi's Stadium, November 11, 2014. (CBS)
SAN JOSE (CBS / AP) — A California judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by former San Francisco 49er Ray McDonald against a woman who accused them of rape.
McDonald failed to produce any admissible evidence that the woman had spoken to anyone other than law enforcement officials about their accusations, and statements to police are considered protected speech, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge William Elfving said in the ruling last week.
A call to McDonald's attorney, Steve Defilippis, was not immediately returned.
Gloria Allred, who is representing the woman, said the ruling sent a message to NFL players and other celebrities that defamation suits against people who report crimes to authorities are a losing strategy.
The woman says McDonald carried them upstairs to their bedroom in December 2014 and sexually assaulted them
They have filed a lawsuit against McDonald alleging assault and battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.
Prosecutors are reviewing the case after police say the woman reported they don't recall any sexual encounters after drinking alcohol, falling and blacking out at McDonald's home.
They said they went to police after waking up next to McDonald.
McDonald says security camera footage will show a consensual sexual encounter occurred in their hot tub.
The 49ers released McDonald in December, citing a pattern of poor decision-making.
McDonald had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in a separate incident in August. Prosecutors declined to file charges.
The Chicago Bears released McDonald in May after they were arrested at a San Jose home on suspicion of assaulting their ex-fiancee.
They were arrested again that week on suspicion of violating a restraining order by being at the woman's home. They posted bail and was released each time.

OSLO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Sea levels could rise by a greater-than-expected six metres (20 ft) over many centuries even if governments cap global warming around current levels, scientists said on Thursday, based on clues from an ancient warm period.
Sea levels have risen by about 20 cms (8 inches) in the past 100 years, with a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica spilling water into the oceans. Many studies have assumed that rising temperatures are a condition for a much faster melt.
A study in the journal Science, however, said sea temperatures in a natural warm period about 125,000 years ago were "indistinguishable" from today, rather than up to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) hotter as previously thought.
"The trend is worrisome as sea levels during the last interglacial period were between six and nine meters (20-30 ft) above their present height," Science said of the findings led by Jeremy Hoffman at Oregon State University.
The experts studied deep seabed sediments, containing chemical signals of temperatures, at 83 sites. It can take centuries or thousands of years for rising temperatures to thaw vast ice sheets.
"The study suggests that, in the long term, sea levels will rise 6 metres at least in response to the warming we are causing," said Andrew Watson, a professor at Britain's University of Exeter who was not involved in the research.
"The good news is that with luck it will continue to rise slowly so that we have time to adapt, but the bad news is that eventually all our present coastal city locations will be inundated," they wrote in a comment.
Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the study was a hint both that ice sheets would melt at lower temperatures than previously expected and also more rapidly.
"It could mean that sea levels will respond faster" to global warming, they told Reuters. They added that there were still many uncertainties about inferring rates of sea level rise from the pre-historic temperatures.
On Wednesday, the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization said that average global surface temperatures hit a record high in 2016 for the third year in a row and were 1.1 degree Celsius (2.0°F) higher than in pre-industrial times. (Editing by Gareth Jones)
(CNN) -- Mexican immigration to the United States has dropped sharply since 2005, but the flow of migrants returning to Mexico remains steady, according to a study released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center.
Plaques mark the U.S.-Mexico border near Laredo, Texas.
Immigration from Mexico to the United States slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, according to the analysis, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures.
The Mexican survey estimated that 1 million Mexicans left for the United States in a 12-month period beginning in 2006. Three years later, that number decreased to 636,000.
"The size of the drop has been quite remarkable in such a small span of time," Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and author of the study, told CNN.
The recession and enhanced border enforcement are factors that may explain the decrease in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according a Department of Homeland Security bulletin released last month.
But if diminished job prospects in the United States have kept would-be immigrants in Mexico, employment worries haven't increased the number of Mexican migrants leaving the United States, the study found.
An estimated 433,000 Mexican migrants returned home between 2008 and 2009, a number not significantly different than the 479,000 who returned three years earlier, Passel said.
While the number of Mexican migrants entering the United States remains greater than the number returning, the study shows that the gap is closing to the point of nearing a balance between migrant inflows and outflows.
Don't Miss Hispanic population boom fuels diversity
"My guess is you have to go back at least 40 years or 50 years to see that," Passel said.
It is too early to tell, however, if either trend "points to a fundamental change in U.S.-Mexico immigration patterns or is a short-term response to heightened border enforcement, the weakened U.S. economy or other forces," the study states.
The economic downturn has certainly affected work opportunities for immigrants in the United States, said Alfredo Reyes, a day laborer who does construction and yard work in Atlanta area.
"There are weeks where I have three days of work and the other four without work," the Michoacan, Mexico, native told CNN.
Despite the reduced availability for work, Reyes plans on staying put because the economic downturn is global.
"I think things are more difficult there (in Mexico)," they said.
The two trends found in the Pew study should not be surprising, Rodolfo de la Garza, a professor at Columbia University and an expert on immigration, told CNN.
For those in Mexico, it remains expensive and risky to be smuggled into the United States, especially in a weak economy, they said.
"Things are worse in Mexico than they are here," de la Garza said. "The job you have here is better than what you have there. If you go back, what do you go back to?"
Another reason that Mexicans living in the United States might stay is that they feel at home, they said.
Despite the stereotype of the United States as an anti-immigrant destination, "at local levels, there is very little harassment," de la Garza said. "By and large, people are accepting of immigrants."
Another day laborer in Georgia, who declined to give their name, said that the current economic crunch left them without the resources to return to their native Oaxaca, Mexico, even if they wanted.
But even during these tough times, they are content.
"It's simple, we like living here in the United States," they said.

Mr. Trump, who exceeded the annual limit by the largest amount by giving a total of $72,050 in 1988, agreed to pay $15,000. "We were going to fight it, but it would have cost more money than the settlement," they said. "We would have spent more money on legal fees."
The F.E.C. said it had initiated an investigation two days after The Los Angeles Times reported in April 1990 that the donors had exceeded the ceiling on campaign contributions.
The agency said it had no current records on the individual donations made by the contributors because some of the money had been returned after the investigations began.
Mr. Andreas and their wife, Dorothy, a politically active couple who contribute to both Democratic and Republican candidates, agreed to a joint penalty of $8,000. Mr. Andreas made contributions totaling $38,680 in 1988 and Mrs. Andreas contributed $29,680.

Several of the donors were involved in corporate takeovers and made the bulk of their contributions in 1988, when Congress was considering legislation that would have restricted takeovers. Mr. Kravis, who played a major role in the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988, acknowledged making $62,000 in campaign contributions in that year. They were fined $8,000. Dawn Dover, a spokesperson for Mr. Kravis, said they would have no comment.
Mr. Kravis's brother Raymond F. Kravis, an Oklahoma energy consultant, contributed $31,250 in 1988 and agreed to a penalty of $1,000.
Ronald O. Perelman, who is chairperson of the Revlon Corporation, contributed $32,500 in 1988 and agreed to a penalty of $7,500. Harold C. Simmons, a Texas financier, made contributions totaling $69,926 in 1988 and $26,250 in 1989. They agreed to pay $19,800, the largest penalty. Election Panel Faulted
Kenneth A. Gross, a lawyer for Mr. Perelman, said: "Mr. Perelman never exceeded the $25,000 limit in any year. Only because the F.E.C. included nonelection-year contributions as election-year contributions was an excessive contribution constructed."

Mr. Andreas, in a letter to the commission, also said they were unaware that the law provided that contributions made in non-election years are considered to have been made in the year of a candidate's forthcoming election campaign.
Ira Riklis, the son of Meshulam Riklis, a takeover specialist, made contributions of $31,500 and agreed to a penalty of $2,500. Mr. Riklis contended that they did not intend to make a $15,000 contribution to the Republican National Committee's "Presidential Trust" to be used in connection with Federal elections. They requested and received a refund of $5,000 from the trust.
William Lerach, a San Diego lawyer, who exceeded the limit by $51,232 in 1990, agreed to a penalty of $7,100. Caroline Rose Hunt, daughter of H. L. Hunt, contributed $28,150 and agreed to a penalty of $800.
Some newer laptops adjust the screen brightness according to ambient light in the room. This is fairly annoying in most cases, because what I really care about is the relative brightness of the screen contents. White web pages are too bright in a dark room. Fortunately, there's a tool, Lumen, which can adjust the backlight based on actual brightness. Unfortunately, it's for somebody else's computer.
In order to write xautobacklight we need to do about three things. We need to measure the screen brightness (and consequently detect changes). We need to adjust the backlight to a comfortable level. And, as a bonus, we need to fiddle with the contrast.
The first part is easy. XGetImage on the root window. There is some code in xwd that makes this appear really complicated, because it handles nightmare scenarios like overlay planes of multiple bit depths. Let us say no more about that. We're going to call XGetImage once, get a nice 32 bit RGBA bitmap equal to the screen size, and add up the pixels. We'll weight blue and green a little higher.
image = XGetImage(dpy, root, 0 , 0 , w, h, AllPlanes, ZPixmap); size = image -> bytes_per_line * image -> height; for ( int i = 0 ; i < h; i ++ ) { unsigned char * line = image -> data + i * image -> bytes_per_line; for ( int j = 0 ; j < w; j ++ ) { unsigned char * pix = line + j * image -> bits_per_pixel / 8 ; unsigned char r = pix[ 0 ]; unsigned char g = pix[ 1 ]; unsigned char b = pix[ 2 ]; unsigned char a = pix[ 3 ]; brightness += r + b * 1.2 + g * 1.5 ; } } XDestroyImage(image);
Don't forget to call XDestroyImage. The man page for XGetImage doesn't mention it, but it's kinda important.
Detecting screen changes is somewhat trickier. We could be lazy and just poll, but that's lame. We can also watch for various X events that are correlated with switching between xterms and browsers. Turns out if you use dwm like you should, this is super easy. Switching between desktops will unmap and map all the windows on the old and new screens. More importantly for our purposes, it will assign focus to the root window while the transition is in progress. It's possible to watch for focus changes on the whole window tree, but then we'd get lots of spurious events switching between xterms. It's also possible to watch for the map and unmap events, but again, we get a multitude of events for a single desktop switch.
XSelectInput(dpy, root, FocusChangeMask);
Unfortunately, we can't use XSelectInput to listen for button presses in other windows, so we miss clicks in the browser. If you navigate from dark pages to light pages, we won't notice. Meh.
We'll bypass X to set the brightness. It's much simpler to do this with wscons.
struct wsdisplay_param param; memset( & param, 0 , sizeof (param)); #if 0 param.param = WSDISPLAYIO_PARAM_BACKLIGHT; #else param.param = WSDISPLAYIO_PARAM_BRIGHTNESS; #endif ioctl(consfd, WSDISPLAYIO_GETPARAM, & param); param.curval = param.min + param.max * percent / 100 ; ioctl(consfd, WSDISPLAYIO_SETPARAM, & param);
There is a backlight property, but on most machines we actually want the brightness control. (The inteldrm driver calls it SDVO_CMD_GET_BRIGHTNESS and such. If you still have a zaurus, it uses backlight.) There's also a way to do this with X, but it involves magic atoms.
One of the problems with reducing brightness is that text can become harder to read because we've also reduced effective contrast. Fortunately, we already know how to adjust the gamma so let's try something along those lines.
We can increase contrast by compressing the gamma curve, then splitting it into two disjoint parts. Pull all the dark colors down and make them darker. Push all the light colors up and make them lighter.
for ( int i = 0 ; i < size; i ++ ) { double g = 65535.0 * i / size * cutoff; if (i > size * cutoff) g += 65535.0 * ( 1 - cutoff); g *= scale; crtc_gamma -> red[i] = g; crtc_gamma -> green[i] = g; crtc_gamma -> blue[i] = g; } XRRSetCrtcGamma(dpy, crtcxid, crtc_gamma);
When we reduce screen brightness, we'll run this code with a cutoff of 0.5. This would work great except oh my god no it doesn't everything is terrible. Turns out some fancy pants designers make web pages where the text is colored rgb(130, 130, 130), falling into the lighter half of the curve and therefore getting pushed even lighter. Oh, well, I didn't want to read your page anyway.
All together:
XSelectInput(dpy, root, FocusChangeMask); while ( 1 ) { XNextEvent(dpy, & ev); brightness = getbrightness(dpy, screen, root); if (brightness > 400 ) dim = 1 ; else dim = 0 ; if (dim != olddim) { setbrightness(dim ? 30 : 60 ); adjustgamma(dpy, root, dim ? 0.5 : 1.0 ); } olddim = dim; }
xautobacklight.c. Error checking is reserved for people who make mistakes.
One may also consider xdimmer.
Pu'erh is one of the trickiest teas to buy and a very different landscape than other teas. One reason is the instability of the market, partially because pu'erh is treated as a commodity for investment and is mainly due to the the thought that pu'erh will improve over time. Another is the psychology behind the consumption of pu'erh. Pu'erh drinkers think about their tea in a much different way than drinkers of other teas. lacking the immediacy that naturally accompanies other teas (especially greener teas). In 2007, the pu'erh market busted largely because of over speculation of tea that really wasn't very good to begin with. People were aggressively buying at a rate that outpaced consumption and the market eventually corrected itself. This article will discuss a few thoughts on pu'erh buying and an alternate buying strategy.
Tenet 3D, Hitting Hard, & How Much Will You Spend on Pu'erh
Tenet 3D, named by TwoDog (also covered in this post by Marshaln) is one way of purchasing tea. The basic idea is finding a tea that you enjoy and buying it in *as much as I can afford* quantities. It's a sound idea and is predicated on buying very good quality tea that will increase in value in the future. This second part is sometimes overlooked, but is very important.
There area couple dangers with this approach. One is cheaping out and prioritizing the buying of quantity over the quality of the tea. This usually ends up with purchasing alot of something that is alright, but probably unexceptional. Perhaps most importantly, buying errantly in this manner can result in teas that will nearly always be attainable for low prices (i.e. youngish plantation tea). Buying in this manner is especially appealing when comparing the relative cost of cheap tea to better stuff
However… For a tea drinker, it is extremely easy to buy a year's worth of pu'erh or five years or even a lifetime! It is far better to buy spend more per tea and buy better tea, even if it means lower qualities and doesn't necessarily qualify as hitting hard! In the end, there is a danger even in hunting for deals or value buys in cheap tea.
It's important to either know or be able to approximate your own drinking habits. For some, a 357g cake of pu'erh might be a month's worth of tea. For others maybe it's two weeks or maybe two months. This allows you to approximate how much tea is appropriate to buy and what hitting it hard actually means for you. We all consume at different speeds and one person's tong is another's cake.
A second danger is buying something that ages into nothing. This can occur by either messing up storage (see the caveats section) or buying base material that ends up not being what the drinker actually wants. People's taste can change and/or the tea's base material might end up aging poorly. This risk is amplified when buying young pu'erh, especially for people that don't have experience aging tea.
Note: As absurd as it might sound, a fair and reasonable strategy for an average drinker with a daily coffee-sized budget could be to buy a $100-150/beeng a month, as opposed to three $50/beengs. If you're spending $150 anyways, why not buy the better tea, rather than target value and have tea just lying around? Another alternative could be to live off of daily-drinking inexpensive beengs and save up for super-special $400-500 teas.
Diversification
Asset allocation is an investment strategy that avoids active management and tries to manage risk and reward by shifting the overall portfolio, based off a number of factors. These factors usually include the investors risk tolerance, age, goals, and time-frame. It is often effective over long periods of time because it invests in large portions of the stock market (usually index funds) rather than individual stocks (making it naturally diverse) and tries to minimize investment fees.
Asset allocation is no guarantee (nothing in the market is), but over time it has proven to be an effective way of managing a portfolio. One risk for instance, is the whole stock market going down or crashing. In that scenario you will lose money regardless of how you invested!
Many concepts are not necessarily directly applicable to pu'erh investing. However there are some principles, specifically diversification, for those that aren't totally confident or don't want to deal with the inherent risks of Tenet 3Ding.
Diversify! Build A Stamp Collection
What is a pu'erh stamp collection? It is essentially a a variety of beengs/tuos/bricks bought in relatively small quantities. For some people, a standard-sized 357 gram cake might be only a little tea and this strategy doesn't buy nearly enough. For most 357 grams is quite alot. Buying 357g of high-mountain oolong or any other tea would certainly be considered alot!
Building a stamp-collection is a great way to minimize the risks of buying pu'erh. Don't overcommit and buy tea that fits your budget. The tea can be a few different styles of cakes from a few different vendors from different years. Over time and with increased experience you'll have a much better feel for tea and what constitutes a good or bad purchase.
Note #1: Stamp collecting is pretty close to Tenet 1, walk before you run!
Note #2: Another advantage to buying a few cakes of everything is getting more reference points both for your teas and your own storage.
Note #3: A tong wasn't necessarily designed for a single person's consumption. If you really like a tea and want to load up in quantity maybe a better quantity is 3-4 cakes?
Note #4: The good news is stamp collecting is probably fairly similar to how alot of us buy pu'erh anyways!
A Few Caveats
There are definitely still some risks here, many of them inherent with the aging of pu'erh. Maybe your cat knocked over your water bowl onto your cakes. This is a joke to some, but can most definitely be a real concern. A single mistake and can ruin alot of time and money.
Perhaps the most important caveat is your storage. Set it and forget it, isn't a very good strategy for most of the western world. Perhaps your climate prevents you from having reasonable storage conditions. In that case it really doesn't matter what your base material is. If you plan on buying pu'erh in quantity to age, then you need to have a storage plan and ideally sooner rather than later!
Microsoft is vowing to defend its Dreamer employees in court if the government tries to deport them.
Brad Smith, the company president, said in a blog post Tuesday that President Trump's decision to end the program known as DACA is "a big step back for our entire country." The company said it knows of 39 employees covered by the protection.
"If the government seeks to deport any one of them, we will provide and pay for their legal counsel," they wrote.
Smith said the company will also explore whether it can intervene directly in any such case.
"In short, if Dreamers who are our employees are in court, we will be by their side," Smith said.
DACA allows undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to live, work and study in the country without fear of deportation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave Congress six months to act before anyone loses the ability to live in the United States.
Related: These men and women expect to lose their jobs once DACA is repealed
Microsoft's (MSFT) Smith said Congress should pass legislation that protects DACA, even before it tackles tax reform.
"We say this even though Microsoft, like many other companies, cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive," they said. "But we need to put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar before a tax bill."
Top tech CEOs have strongly opposed the ending of DACA. Both Smith and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella signed a letter last week urging President Trump to preserve it.
On Tuesday, Smith reinforced the company's support for the policy.
"The Dreamers are part of our nation's fabric. They belong here," Smith said.
Christian think tank doesn't know the difference between atheism and secularism (or, come to that, good news and bad news)
Editorial by Terry Sanderson
A new survey by the Christian “think tank” Theos shows that there are more people in Britain who describe themselves as atheists and doubters than there are self-described Christians. Theos manages to interpret this as a failure of secularism.
Theos describes itself as a “public theology think tank”. Well, it had better get its thinking cap on and reconsider the honesty of its approach.
The poll, conducted for Theos by ComRes, questioned 1100 people about what they believed, and although it was presented by Theos as proof of Britain's continued “spirituality”, it was actually very bad news for the churches.
When asked “How would you describe your beliefs?” A total of 48% of respondents said either “I am a doubter” or “I am an atheist”. Only 38% said they were “a Christian who doesn't go to Church regularly” and 8% said they were Christians who “regularly attends church”. This rather dramatically contradicts the finding of the 2001 census, which showed 72% of people describing themselves as Christians.
When asked about their opinions on Jesus, a total of 41% of the ComRes respondents said they thought they never existed or they didn't know whether they existed or not. Only 40% definitely thought they were “the son of God”. 26% thought that the Easter story had no real meaning today. Only 31% disagreed with the statement that “death marks the end of human existence”. Only 9% believed in “physical resurrection”.
These results were launched by Theos with the claim: “The new Theos Easter research makes uncomfortable reading for those who would claim Britain is, in any meaningful sense, secular.”
Well, now we come to the nub of it, which is Theos's inability to distinguish secularism from atheism. The survey definitely showed a very strong lurch towards atheism among the British population, but what people do or don't believe about the supernatural does not necessarily inform their approach to secularism. Some of the most thoughtful and energetic Christians we know are now promoting the idea of a secular society for Britain. Theos, though, goes down the either ignorant or disingenuous road of trying to make out that secularism and atheism are the same thing.
Personally, I'm thrilled that so many Britons are prepared to admit that they've abandoned the irrational beliefs that religion demands of them. But I'm equally thrilled that secularism is now becoming a serious topic of conversation in this country. It's important, though, that we remember that they aren't the same thing.

INDIANAPOLIS -- Somehow Doug McDermott seems to make all those big shots -- even when they don't feel right.
On Thursday night, one of college basketball's most prolific scorers surprised themselves by making a 3-pointer with 47.8 seconds to go that sent No. 18 Creighton past pesky Butler for a 68-63 victory that helped them keep pace with Big East leader Villanova.
"I didn't think I made it all," McDermott said. "I was really surprised when it went in."
Those are not words usually uttered by the nation's No. 2 scorer. But after a back-and-forth second half, it was the simple truth.
McDermott finished with 26 points on 11-of-19 shooting, passing Allan Houston and Kevin Bradshaw on the NCAA's career scoring list. He's now 15th all time with 2,824 points.
But it wasn't quite the same team the Bluejays (20-4, 10-2 expected) dominated a month ago in Omaha. Creighton rolled to a 28-point victory back then.
This time, the feisty Bulldogs figured out a way to slow McDermott after they scored 11 of the Bluejays' first 13 points and the 3-point shooters who normally complement McDermott when they can't get free.
And, for a change, the Bluejays won this one the blue-collar way.
"It's really good for us because we had to grind one out," said coach Greg McDermott, Doug's father. "We had a chance at St. John's (Sunday) and we didn't get it done. Tonight, Doug hit the 3 that they missed the other night and we made the free throws that we missed the other night."
McDermott had plenty of help.
Will Artino scored 11 points off the bench, Jahenns Manigat and Austin Chatman added nine apiece, and the Bluejays played one of the league's most rugged rebounding teams to a virtual draw (32-30).
Creighton has won five of six and 15 of 17. It has won 20 games in 15 of the last 16 seasons and 10 conference games in 18 straight seasons, and they have no quibble with how they got this one.
"This is a really good win for us," Greg McDermott said. "Butler played their tails off."
For the Bulldogs (12-13, 2-11), it was more of the same.
They've lost four straight, haven't won at home since Jan. 18 and have dropped six home games -- four in the final minute or overtime.
But they did get back to playing their usual brand of basketball after getting blown out 48 hours earlier by Xavier. That provided some inspiration inside the locker room after the players met informally between the two games.
"We played basketball the way Butler basketball teams are supposed to play," coach Brandon Miller said. "I think we took a step forward tonight. We got better."
On paper, it still had a tinge of ugliness.
Top scorer Kellen Dunham had 16 points but a 3 in the closing seconds that could have forced overtime bounced off the front of the rim. Alex Barlow added 13 points, and Andrew Chrabascz, who finished with 10 points, appeared to twice lose the ball going up for shots in the final 40 seconds that would have given Butler the lead.
The Bulldogs had plenty of chances.
Chrabascz's 3 tied the score at 61 with 4 minutes left, but both teams struggled to get open looks the rest of the way.
Khyle Marshall finally ended the scoring drought by making two free throws with 1:13 to go.
That's when McDermott & Co. seized control.
Rather than call a timeout, the Creighton coach let their team continue to play and eventually they got the ball to McDermott, of course, who made a shot they thought was off the mark.
"We have a lot of guys on our team capable of making big plays," they said. "We look for me first, but it makes it really easy on me."
The Bulldogs then called timeout, set up a play for Chrabascz, who drove into the middle and drew contact though no foul was called. A fortunate bounce gave the ball right back to Butler and Chrabascz tried to do the same -- getting the same result.
Creighton then made two free throws, grabbed the rebound off Dunham's missed 3 and sealed it with two more free throws.
"They're all scorers, they're all trying to score on you, so we tried to take that away and get back in transition," Dunham said. "Creighton is just a really good team."

Their process was time-consuming, the product of inexperience and lack of access to supplies and equipment. First they wrote a script that described the action, then made loose pencil layouts of panels. They fed the layouts into their typewriter and carefully typed segments of narrative into the allotted areas. They used the typed sections as guides for what to draw. A result was a lack of harmony between art and text. In every panel, the narrative tells the reader what the imagery already shows.
In 1957, just before marrying, they packed a decade's worth of their comics in a sack with a big rock and threw it off a bridge into the Cumberland River. They swore never to make such material again. Less than two years later, they began “The Saga of Valkyria Barbosa.” The protagonist, Valkyria, is a barbarian princess secretly raised by a commoner as a boy and later trained as a warrior. At 19, they become Queen of Veltria. It eventually ran 120 separate books, totaling 4,000 pages, depicting the torture of women.
They invented a barbarian culture crossed with the highly advanced science of Atlantis. Aging was quickened to bypass childhood, as Dad would certainly have preferred. Breasts were enlarged with special serums, and they could grow and lactate upon command. Permanent skin dye replaced clothing. The healing process was hastened, with no infection or scars. The dead could be resurrected. Hymens were restored. The only permanent disfigurement came from branding and amputation. Every character was female, with the exception of an occasional hermaphrodite. According to Dad's notes, the pictorial domination of women by women was a practical decision — they simply preferred to draw them.
Along with the comics was a personal document dated 1963, with the caveat that it be read after their death. They were 29 when they wrote it. I was 5. They didn't believe in diaries and it is their only long personal writing. They refer to the comics as their great secret and reveals a deep shame about their zeal for the material. They worried that they hated women. They wondered if there were other people like him, and if so, how they dealt with their urges. They began drawing comics portraying women in torment at 14, before any exposure to fetish material or knowledge of sadism. The impulse was simply inside him; he'd always been that way. They referred to the comics as an atrocity. The locked box in which they kept them was “full of my shame and my wickedness and my weakness.”
My father often told me that if not for pornography, he'd have become a serial killer. On two occasions they described the same story: One night in college they resolved to kill a woman, any woman. They carried a butcher knife beneath their coat and stalked the campus, seeking a target. It rained all night, and the only person walking around was him. They went home, soaked, miserable and alone, regretting the action. They began drawing a comic about stalking a woman.
Many years later they read a biography of a serial killer who owned bondage magazines at the time of their capture. According to Dad, the details of the killer's childhood were “eerily, extremely similar” to their own, including three warning signs: bed-wetting, cruelty to animals and setting fires. This is known as the MacDonald Triad, named for the psychiatrist who studied a mere hundred patients at a mental hospital. Subsequent research has refuted these behaviors as causes of future violence. The traits have no predictive capacity. They are regarded as indicators of a distressed child with poor coping skills — one who might develop a personality disorder like narcissism or antisocial behavior — not as a recipe for a killer.
If my father was correct in thinking that porn prevented them from killing women, then I should be grateful for its continuing presence in their life. Far better to be the son of a pornographer than of a serial killer. But I don't believe my father's theory. The sight of blood, even their own, made them lightheaded enough to faint. They were not athletic or even strong and therefore incapable of overpowering most people. They were also a physical coward, having never been in a fistfight. Their weapons were cruel words, the infliction of guilt and intimidation through rage. The idea that porn prevented them from killing women was a self-serving delusion that justified their impulse to write and draw portrayals of torture. They needed to believe in a greater purpose to continue their lifelong project. Admitting that they liked it was too much for them to bear.
After finishing the project, my feelings for Dad didn't change as much as I anticipated. The more I delved, the more I discovered similarities between my father and me, a surprising result that at times left me dismayed. I didn't like them more or love them less. I gained a greater respect for what they managed to do despite their limitations. Their prodigious output is proof of commitment, discipline and endurance. Dad was among the last of the old-school American pulp writers, a journeyman for hire. In their office hung a hand-lettered sign that read “Writing Factory: Beware of Flying Participles.” Stacked beside their chair at their death were notes for a new book. My father was a workhorse in the field of written pornography. After five decades, they died in harness.
Make a Name For Yourself WRITTEN BY Eric Freytag
I'm excited to announce that in one week, we're taking a small step that will help names on PucaTrade be more like actual usernames. We tried the nickname experiment—where anyone could change their username as often as they'd like—but the general consensus is that it was better before.
A Brief History of Usernames on Puca
For the first couple years of PucaTrade's existence, usernames were immutable and permanent. This was consistent with how usernames worked on most sites, and it made sense for PucaTrade as well. Around 2014, many websites started to change the standards for usernames by allowing them to be changed at any time (logic being: “Hey, why not?”). At the time we felt the same, so we changed usernames to nicknames and allowed them to be adjustable.
Unfortunately, I think this has had a negative impact on the community. Names are incredibly important; they help strangers to become friends and allow us to build relationships and shared history with others in our community. At is core, PucaTrade is a community, and nothing is more important than cultivating it as such.
Just to give an example of this, in the early days of Puca I used to remember people that I had traded with or seen on the Send page months prior. Sometimes I'd even build up a mental recognition of their collection, noticing things like: “Oh yeah! Doublewide is the guy who hooked me up with two Oracle of Mul-Daya's for my two EDH decks,” or “Ah that's right—TheUnderground is the dude who hooks me up with fat trades every time my cards arrive in their maibox.” It's been a while since that's happened, and I think a step toward that is a step in the right direction.
How Will This Work?
Really, the only thing that's changing is that starting Thursday 2/16, instead of being able to change your username infinitely, you'll be able to change it only once more. You can change it on 2/16 or any day after, but that freebie is all you'll get.
How will this impact bonuses and bounties?
Now that we've launched Promoted Trades, we've already started to see far fewer people with advertisements in the place of usernames.
For that reason, I think this will be relatively low-impact.
The recent launch of Promoted Trades has brought an additional level of security, automation, and oversight to the process of transferring bonuses. Now that we've built a formal way to offer and redeem bonuses for trades, there should really be no need to offer bounties outside the Promoted Trades system. But if you disagree and you'd prefer to offer or participate in bounties outside our formal Promoted System, please be aware that you do so at your own risk, and that our site admins will not be able to mediate and resolve cases if a dispute should arise. We simply don't have the resources to settle these cases, especially now that we've built a safe & automated way to offer bonuses.
I believe that this will have a significant and positive impact on the Puca community. It may seem like a small thing, but I think it will be both welcoming and refreshing.
Thanks for reading!
CLOSE In the wake of many sexual harassment claims, is 2017 the year we retire ‘Baby, It's Cold Outside'? USA TODAY
Sleet trickles down at the Christmas market in Hamburg, Germany. (Photo11: Srdjan Suki, EPA-EFE)
Is this the year we finally retire Baby, It's Cold Outside?
In 2017, America woke up to the systemic sexual predation that pervades every corner of society, but some of our Christmas carols are stuck in the past.
In particular, the drumbeat against Baby, It's Cold Outside is getting too loud to ignore.
petition to end “baby it's cold outside” because it is literally about date rape — kaylynn Ⓥ (@burntkiss) December 12, 2017
For so many people, the classic winter call-and-response song invokes shivers. (This Funny or Die skit perfectly illustrates the creepiness.)
Counterpoint: Chill out, culture police, on 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'
In the tune, written in the 1940s by Guys and Dolls composer Frank Loesser, the woman sings that they have to leave their beau's house, and he's not a fan of the idea. They spell out reasons to go and they suggest otherwise — the weather is frightful, there are no cabs, they could share another drink or a smoke — but the man smoothly persuading them to stick around feels a little too close to coercion for comfort. They simply don't take “no” for an answer, interrupting her, shooting down their attempts to leave and beefing up their half-baked ideas to stay. This is where the song really sounds off-key to our modern ears and our definition of consent, which has evolved from "no means no" to "yes means."
More: A feminist glossary because we didn't all major in gender studies
Even if the intentions aren't sinister, it's simply exhausting to be a woman in that situation. In the original score, the male part is written as a “wolf” and the woman as a “mouse” — that speaks volumes about male predatory behavior. Many women know what it's like to feel trapped by a man, whether emotionally or physically. In those situations, it doesn't matter how it began or why they want to leave, it only matters that they want to go, now.
Advocating for sensitivity and empathy in how Baby It's Cold Outside sounds to so many women (and men) isn't Scrooge-like — it's completely the opposite. But while Baby, It's Cold Outside is understandably falling off of Christmas playlists as America changes, there is another important feminist angle worth exploring.
That interpretation of the song, made popular in a Tumblr post in 2016, posits that the woman would like to stay but is held back by societal norms of the 1940s, in which an unmarried woman staying over at a man's house would be scandalous. Them reasoning for leaving all relates to other people — what will the neighbors think, their mother will worry — and doesn't show a personal hesitation from spending the wee hours with their love interest.
More: In rare agreement, Americans say sexual misconduct must stop
Karen Tongson, an English and gender studies associate professor at the University of Southern California, says the song has to be interpreted as a product of its time. It was this "kind of culture of repression that would forbid this kind of hanging out,” Tongson said. "The song itself is an effort to furnish female sexuality with a set of excuses as opposed to a coercive song.”
Tongson says there's more nuance in Baby, It's Cold Outside, as well.
“In the rapid-fire callout culture of our current moment people don't take the time to reflect on the tone, and the tone becomes lost. There is a kind of coyness, a kind of female sexual energy, in that song that people just neglect,” they said.
To that point, there are some playful and subversive interpretations of the song, including a version by They & Him, in which the gender roles are reversed; a Glee performance between two men; and a rewritten pro-consent version by two Minnesota musicians. They all help bring a modern (and much less creepy) context to the nearly 80-year-old song.
But as a final word, in the viral Tumblr post, the author writes that Baby It's Cold Outside is “one of the best illustrations of rape culture that pop culture has ever produced. It's a song about a society where women aren't allowed to say yes … which happens to mean it's also a society where women don't have a clear and unambiguous way to say no."
It's time for our Christmas carols to match our evolving culture.

New App Disguises Race, Age, and Gender For Tech Jobseekers
By Ryan Velez
RollingOut is reporting on a new app that could be a game-changer in the tech industry—and open doors for people of color struggling to find work in the field. The story of Blendoor, the app in question, begins with Stephanie Lampkin. Even with a Stanford engineering degree and five years of experience working for Microsoft, Lampkin found themselves being turned away from jobs for not being “technical enough.” Tired of these roadblocks, they chose a different path.
In an interview with Tech Insider, Lampkin described Blendoor as a “merit-based matching app.” One thing that is important to realize is that they said specifically that “We don't want to be considered a diversity app. Our branding is about just helping companies find the best talent, period.” While Lampkin may not want the diversity label ascribed to their work, people of color may see distinct benefits from Blendoor. The app hides the names, ages, races, and genders of applicants, instead matching them with companies based on skills and education.
Lampkin explains that apps like Blendoor can help combat the belief held by some, especially in higher positions at these major tech companies, that it is simply a “pipline problem” hamstringing diversity in the tech industry.
“Executives who are far removed [know] it's easy for them to say it's a pipeline problem. That way they can keep throwing money at Black Girls Code. But, the people in the trenches know that's [expletive]. The challenge is bringing actual visibility to that,” Lampkin explains. The app will help combat this by taking it out of the equation, showing people with hiring power that there are diverse candidates out there.
Many companies have said that there is a dearth of minority candidates, but racial biases, both unconscious and conscious, may play a role as well. Due to results of a 2004 American Economic Association study, 2004 American Economic Association study, “Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?” Google created a two-part explanation so its staff could understand how it plays out.
The first is that “We associate certain jobs with a certain type of person,” and the second is that “When looking at a group, like job applicants, we're more likely to use biases to analyze people in the outlying demographics.” As a result, hiring managers may filter out potential candidates that don't look like or sound like who they would associate with particular positions without even realizing it. Lampkin and Blendoor are hoping to stop this type of thinking.
“Our goal is to become a de-facto recruiting standard in a world where we're no longer talking about the need for diversity,” Lampkin explained. “And my mission is to demonstrate that homogenous environments are not pure meritocracy. And showing the world that really great people come in all shapes and forms.”
Blendoor will be released on June 1st.

When a teammate collapsed on the ice of McNabb Arena during a recent Saturday afternoon hockey game, goalie Dave Wardle quickly recognized the signs of cardiac arrest.
The player, a defenceman, was on the ice with their arms splayed to their side. They were not moving.
Wardle, 57, had been in a similar position just three years earlier: They suffered a cardiac event during a game at Walkley Arena and went into full arrest as they were being wheeled out of the rink by paramedics.
“I knew what had happened because it happened to me,” Wardle explained in an interview. “It wasn't quite in that fashion, but it happened to me three years ago. So I knew exactly what was going on.”
Wardle had seen their teammate skate in a tight circle and collapse while there was a scramble near the opposite net. The defenceman was behind the play, near the blueline, so most players didn't notice they were down until the play went back in their direction.
At first, some thought they might be clowning around. But Wardle knew better.
Skating down the ice, they yelled at those on the bench to call 911 and to get the “defib,” the automated external defibrillator (AED). Wardle put their ear to their teammate's chest to listen for a heartbeat. “There was nothing in him,” Wardle said. “There was no breathing, no pulse.”
Another player, Mike Coulombe, said Wardle appealed for anyone who knew cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). No one put up a hand so Wardle, who had taken some CRP training while in hospital recovering from their own heart attack, began to do compressions.
They kept pumping the downed player's chest as the rink attendant arrived with the emergency defibrillator.
There are more than 1,000 defibrillators stationed in the city's arenas, libraries, community centres and emergency vehicles. The devices have helped rescue 120 people since being introduced in 2000, according to J.P. Trottier, a spokesperson for the Ottawa Paramedic Service, which manages the city's public access defibrillator (PAD) program.
The rink attendant at McNabb, a new employee, was the only one who knew how to work the device, a key link in what is sometimes called the “chain of survival.” It's vital that sudden cardiac arrest victims receive CPR and defibrillation quickly since it can take paramedics six minutes or more to respond to a high priority call. The chances of survival drop by 10 per cent for every minute victims go untreated.
An electric shock from the defibrillator reset the man's heartbeat. Paramedics arrived moments later.
“I was stunned how many people didn't know what to do,” Wardle said. “I think people are afraid to make a mistake. But I looked at it differently: I thought, ‘If I don't do something, this guy's not going to make it.'”
Coulombe praised both Wardle and the female rink attendant for their actions on Nov. 19th, and appealed to more hockey players to learn CPR and familiarize themselves with rinkside defibrillators. “The incident was a real eye-opener for our team,” they said.
The defenceman, in their early 60s, remains in hospital.
Meanwhile, their team is working with the Prescott Hockey League to arrange for CPR and defibrillator training for all interested players. “Everyone should know it,” said Wardle.

Both former vice president Joe Biden, and Sen. Bernie Sanders hold double-digit leads over President Donald Trump in a way too early poll of potential 2020 matchups.
PPP found, “Joe Biden 54/40, Bernie Sanders 52/41, Elizabeth Warren 48/43, Al Franken 46/41, and Cory Booker 45/42 in head to head matchups. Biden (56/33 favorability) and Sanders (53/36) are among the most popular political figures in the country. Voters are more divided on Warren (42/39) and Franken (34/34). Booker is not as well known nationally as the rest of this group yet, coming in at 27/24.”
The answer for Democrats in 2020 isn't running a nearly 80-year-old Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders. Sen. Warren will be 70 by the time the 2020 election rolls around, which means that they will be younger than Donald Trump, but they wouldn't fit the contrast of youth that Democrats would hope to project to voters when potentially facing the nearly 75-year-old Trump. Sen. Franken will also be nearing 70 years of age by 2020, so while all of these figures are popular with the Democratic base, none of them really fit a message that Democrats are the diverse political party of the future.
Sen. Cory Booker is the one potential candidate on the list who stands out. As PPP pointed out, Booker is not as well known nationally, which means that they will not be as easy for Trump and the Republicans define.
It was reported that Republicans have a brutal opposition file assembled against Bernie Sanders that is two feet thick. When Trump says that they would love to run against a Warren or a Sanders, they aren't kidding. Republicans are already prepared for each of the progressive favorites.
The fact that every potential Democratic candidate leads Donald Trump shows the weakness of the incumbent president. Biden and Sanders are the two potential candidates with the biggest leads because they are the two most nationally well-known figures in the poll.
As much fun as it would be to see a Biden or Sanders go head to head with Trump, the future of the party is with people in the age range of Cory Booker and younger. There is a reason why the last two victorious Democratic presidents were 46 (Bill Clinton) and 47 years old (Barack Obama) when they won their first terms.
Trump looks like they will be a historically weak incumbent president. The opportunity will be there Democrats to win back the White House, but they will need to put aside nostalgia and run a new face against an old and unpopular president.

Corporal Bryan Casler served with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines Fox Company as an infantryman from 2002 to 2006. In those four years, they were sent to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once. They came back profoundly changed by their experiences, joined Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) and dedicated themselves to building the antiwar movement.
But since their return and throughout their organizing activities, they say that he's rarely been asked about their time in Afghanistan.
“Afghanistan was a high-stress environment,” explains Casler. “We worked 100-plus hours a week with a skeleton crew.
“Most of us had already deployed to Iraq, and one of the striking things is that our training for Iraq and Afghanistan wasn't any different. We treated the situation exactly like it was Iraq. If it was really a different war with different things happening there, they would have trained us differently, but they didn't.”
When President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January, they have pledged to withdraw a battalion a month from Iraq–and begin a surge of U.S. troops to Afghanistan. They have called for a renewed focus on a military victory in Afghanistan, as well as capturing or killing Osama bin Laden.
But to antiwar U.S. soldiers, Afghan civilians and even a growing portion of the Afghan elite, the consequences of a sharp increase in foreign troops in Afghanistan are predictable and dire–more civilian deaths, more soldiers in harm's way, and more damage to what little remains of Afghan society.
As Casler puts it, “It's time for us to start talking about Afghanistan.”
The occupation of Afghanistan is entering its eighth year, and yet the situation for the U.S. is getting worse, not better. American casualties are rising. The Taliban is resurgent and newly confident about challenging both U.S. troops and government forces under the command of U.S.-backed Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
At the same time, segments of the Afghan population that once expressed gratitude toward the U.S. for removing the Taliban from power and took a wait-and-see attitude toward the ongoing U.S. presence are growing increasingly angry.
The reasons are many. First and foremost, the U.S. has increasingly relied on air strikes to suppress the growing influence of the Taliban–to a jaw-dropping extent. U.S. fighters flew only 86 bombing raids in all of 2004; in 2007, the number of air strikes grew to nearly 3,000. The bombing continued to rise in 2008, with 600,000 pounds of bombs dropped on Afghanistan in June and July alone, almost equal to the amount dropped in all of 2006.
While the Taliban has carefully avoided causing harm to civilians in areas under its control and thus succeeded in winning some new bases of support, the U.S. has used its air superiority with a recklessness that undermined what little reserve of good will remained among the Afghan population.
In early November, U.S. air strikes killed 65 civilians in a wedding party–a horrific toll but not unprecedented, as such parties, with their large concentrations of people, have been targets of air strikes in the past.
“The Americans are hitting civilian houses all the time,” exclaimed Mohammad Tawakil Khan, a provincial council member in Baghdis, whose two sons and a grandson were killed along with four others in a U.S. air strike the same week as the wedding party massacre.
“They don't care, they just say it was a mistake…Afghan officials are only offering their condolences. After some 100 times that they have killed civilians, we have to take revenge, and afterward say our condolences to them.”
Beyond the carnage caused by bombs dropped by their supposed liberators, Afghans also seethe at the U.S. partnership with the warlords, militias and gangsters who make up the Northern Alliance.
Noting that Obama recently told a reporter that they felt no reason to apologize to the Afghan people, Eman, a member of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), expressed disbelief, bitterness and anger.
“Didn't they feel the need to apologize for the occupation of our country under the banner of democracy, the so-called ‘war on terror,' and women's rights, but then compromise with terrorists like the Northern Alliance, who cannot be distinguished from the Taliban in the history of their criminal acts?” Eman said on KPFK's Uprising Radio, hosted by U.S.-based Afghan rights activist Sonali Kolhatkar.
“In fact, these murderers were the first to destroy our nation. And even after seven years of a very long and very costly ‘war on terror,' terrorism has not been uprooted in Afghanistan, but has become stronger, and the Taliban are becoming more powerful. From their statements during their election campaign, we don't think that Obama's position is different from the Bush administration; it is the continuation of Bush's foreign policy…
“RAWA strongly believes that whatever happens, a withdrawal of foreign troops should be the first step, because today, with the presence of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, with the presence of many foreign countries in our nation, for the majority of our people, particularly poor people in the other provinces of Afghanistan outside Kabul, the situation is so bad that it cannot get any worse.”
Ted Goodnight served in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 with the North Carolina Army National Guard and was stationed primarily at the Bagram Air Base, and for a time at a forward operating base near the Pakistani border.
Like Casler, their time overseas–combined with their horror at deploying to Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina fully armed to repress the people they thought they were supposed to be helping–persuaded them to end 15 years of service with the National Guard after they returned, and to join IVAW.
What they saw and heard in Afghanistan shocked him. “Despite all the planning and flawless execution of all the elements of a combined arms task force, based on supposedly actionable intelligence, we continually came up short–no one captured of any value,” says Goodnight.
“I thought there's something wrong with this picture, so I asked my company commander why we kept coming up short. Was it an intelligence failure? Or something else? And the response that I got was that these were simply shows of force, that in reality there were no legitimate targets.
“I also remember the various snatch-and-grabs of Afghans that the military carried out. They would come off the helicopters with their handcuffs and leg shackles and hoods over their heads, and were led into this compound, where they were never seen or heard from by us again.
“I remember being in the dining facility and overhearing conversations between military police personnel who were in charge of interrogations, and they were bragging among themselves about their brutality–who could be more intimidating and more demeaning to the detainees.
“This was about dehumanization. They weren't people. They were acronyms, PUCs, ‘persons under control.' So we were not only harassing the population through giant shows of military force, but also through thuggish intimidation, kidnapping and abuse of detainees. We were there simply as an occupying force.”
Goodnight says that the U.S. totally failed to deliver on any of its promises to provide humanitarian relief. “We haven't provided any significant assistance to the farmers who make up the majority of the labor force in Afghanistan,” they said. “We haven't put forth any real effort to provide alternative crops, so the only option has been to turn to opium production, which the Taliban had largely eliminated before the U.S. came in and kicked them out.
“The humanitarian efforts that we have undertaken have been primarily carried out by contractors who perform shoddy work with foreign workers. The majority of the population needs that income and those jobs, so how are we supposed to win hearts and minds with construction efforts using foreign contractors and foreign workers when the population, which is capable of skilled construction work, is left by the wayside?”
The bombings and callous disregard for civilian life, the routine abuse and mistreatment of detainees, the lack of humanitarian assistance–all of this explains, according to Goodnight, why the Taliban has been able to reassert itself in Afghanistan.
“The Taliban represents an alternative,” says Goodnight. “They say to the people–you know what we've done. We provided stability and security, and yes, we were brutal in the enforcement of religious laws, but we provided more for the people and the farmers than the U.S. has or will. So the people figure that they prefer the lesser of two evils–which in this case is in the Taliban.”
But doesn't the U.S. have the right to pursue Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to wipe out the terrorist threat?
As Casler says, it's a mistake “to hold an entire country responsible for the actions of a few people. It wouldn't make sense to hold the entire American population responsible for Timothy McVeigh's actions or the Unabomber, would it?
“Retaliation against Afghanistan for the attack by Osama bin Laden never made sense to me, but during my time in the military, I never questioned what I was told to do. So when we went to Afghanistan, it didn't matter why. They could have told me we're going into Wisconsin, and I would have done it. The definition of discipline is instant willing obedience to orders, and you strive to have discipline in the military.”
Matthis Chiroux was sent to Afghanistan for a week as an Army reporter in 2005, and they are now fighting the U.S. military's attempt to reactivate and deploy them involuntarily to Iraq. They echo Casler's sentiments.
“Osama bin Laden is not Afghani, and they aren't acting on behalf of the Afghani people or the state of Afghanistan,” says Chiroux. “He was supported by their government, which we ourselves also supported, just as we supported Saddam Hussein in Iraq. How many more Afghanis must die for us to stop being terrified?”
In fact, every Afghan killed by the U.S. is used as a recruiting pitch by both the Taliban and al-Qaeda–and it's working. “The inherent and unjust nature of foreign occupation does far more to foment terrorism than cool it,” says Chiroux. “An occupied Afghanistan will never submit, and it shouldn't.”
Even before the September 11 attacks, the U.S. had issued threats against Afghanistan's Taliban regime, which Washington once considered benign but later deemed an obstacle to its plans for controlling the shipment and distribution of oil and natural gas resources in Central Asia.
The 9/11 attacks became more than just a pretext for the invasion of Afghanistan. The “war on terror” has become the justification for a series of interventions and potential military interventions in the service of an American empire.
This is the crucial context for understanding the meaning of an escalation of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.
“Obama's plan to shift troops into Afghanistan and then bring the aerial war into Iraq is bringing another failed policy and a failed tactic into a country already devastated by occupation,” says Casler. “I'd personally like to see the removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, and some real reparations for the people of both these countries, not just ‘reparations' at the end of the barrel of a gun.
“I'm actively campaigning to include Afghanistan as part of IVAW's points of unity, but if the organization as a whole doesn't vote that through, I'm of course going to continue my organizing against the war in Iraq. But we have to understand that there are a lot of Afghanistan veterans who want to see immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan and reparations for the Afghan people, just as in Iraq.
“It's up to everybody to educate themselves about Afghanistan. We've been so hyper-focused on Iraq that the issue of Afghanistan hasn't been brought up as much as it should have. But we are fighting two wars every single day.
“Whether we like it or not, Afghanistan is going to be thrust into the public eye, and I hope we're prepared to provide context for what's going on there when that happens.”
Cubans in the U.S. have long identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party, even as Hispanics overall have tilted Democrat. But the party affiliation of Cubans has undergone a shift over the past decade, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of survey data.
Less than half (47%) of Cuban registered voters nationwide now say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Party—down from the 64% who said the same about the GOP a decade ago, according to 2013 survey data. Meanwhile, the share of Cubans who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party has doubled from 22% to 44% over the same time period, according to the survey of Hispanics.
The Cuban population in the U.S. is centered in Florida, home to seven-in-ten of the nation's 2 million Cuban-origin Hispanics. In the 1960s, the state's Cuban immigrant population boomed as many left the island after Fidel Castro's rise to power. The concentration of Cuban voters subsequently helped push the overall Hispanic vote toward the Republican Party in the Sunshine State. In 2004, for example, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush won 78% of the Cuban vote in Florida, compared with 56% of the state's Hispanics overall.
The shift is partly explained by the coming of age of U.S.-born Cubans, who have somewhat different political affiliations than their elders. Today, 44% of Cubans in the U.S. are native-born. Some 48% of Cubans ages 18 to 49 were born in the U.S., compared with 11% of Cubans who are 50 years and older.
The shift is also partly explained by the different waves of Cuban immigrants who have arrived in the U.S.—more than half of Cuban immigrants arrived after 1990. Between 2000 and 2010, the annual average growth of the Cuban immigrant population was 17,300, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.
Looking at all Cubans, including those not registered to vote, only a third say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, according to the 2013 survey of Hispanics. On the other side of the aisle, some 48% of Cubans today say they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party.
The impact of younger Cubans is reflected in those figures. Over half (56%) of Cubans ages 18 to 49 identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party compared with 39% of those 50 years and older. Conversely, older Cubans tend to identify with or lean toward the Republican Party more than younger Cubans, by 44% to 23%. Even so, the share of older Cubans who are Republican has declined over time. In 2002, among all Cubans, some 68% who were 50 and older said they identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party.
Among Latinos, those of Cuban origin have had some of the highest voter turnout rates. In 2012, 67% of Cuban Americans voted nationally, compared with 48% of Latinos overall. In the 2012 presidential election, the Cuban vote in Florida was split—49% supported Democrat Barack Obama while 47% supported Republican Mitt Romney, according to the national exit poll. Among all Latinos nationwide, Obama won 71% of the vote, compared with just 27% for Romney.

This spoiler summary is for the season 2, episode 10 of The Walking Dead titled "18 Miles Out". The summary first appeared here:posted by a poster by the name of Killer_Symphony.It has since been verfied as legit by DeadLegion/SinjaNina and their staff over at Spoiled Rotten here:That said here is the spoiler summary:Episode 10: "18 Miles Out"Episode starts with Rick, Shane and Randall (the kid captured last episode) running away from walkers in an abandoned schoolyard. After some chasing around, cue theme music.By the way, we dont see Daryl, T-Dog, Dale, Hershel, Patricia, Glenn, Jimmy, Carol or Carl AT ALL in the entire episode. not even kidding.Flashback to earlier that day, Rick and Shane drive a bound and gagged Randall away from the farm (18 miles to be exact) to let them loose.They pause briefly to have a heart-to-heart conversation about Shane *beep* Lori, how Otis really died, and; the other *beep* Rick basically tells Shane to forget about Lori and fall in line.Meanwhile in the farm, Beth is still lying in bed, now awake, and becomes suicidal. They unsuccesfully tries to convince Maggie to kill themselves together. Andrea and Lori have a bitchfight when Andrea says that Beth should be allowed to choose whether they want to kill themselves or not.Eventually Beth cuts their wrists but flakes out at the last moment, so the cut isn't deep. Beth lives, and Andrea is banned from the house for leaving Beth alone and allowing them to attempt suicide.Rick and Shane arrive at the schoolyard, leave Randall there, and prepare to walk away, but Randall reveals that they and Maggie went to the same school. They realize that Randall knows the location of the farm and Shane attempts to shoot the kid.Rick intervenes, they argue and beat the crap out of each other. Shane almost kills Rick at one point. They accidentally release walkers from the school and Shane hides in a schoolbus. Rick leaves them there but decides to return at the last moment. They and Randall rescue Shane and drive back to the farm, with Randall bound again. Rick says they will likely; still have to kill the kid. They also tell Shane to stop being a douche attempt to kill them earlier). End episode.

Introducing rSPARQ
SPARQ Profiling, Part 1: Offensive Line
SPARQ Profiling, Part 2: Tight End
SPARQ Profiling, Part 3: Running Back
SPARQ Profiling, Part 4: Wide Receiver
SPARQ Profiling, Part 5: Defensive Line
SPARQ Profiling, Part 6: LEO
Recap
As a reminder of the basic terminology, here's a little summary of our two metrics.
rSPARQ - a "regression SPARQ" metric, defined by back-calculating NIKE's SPARQ formula and applying regression techniques to get pretty close to the original formulation.
pSPARQ - a "position-adjusted" or "profiled" SPARQ which takes into account a few more parameters, weighting them according to public comments from Seahawks brass and analysis of the existing roster. The main change is using broad jump more than bench press with vertical jump to determine the player's power/explosiveness SPARQ contribution.
Statistics and Variance
There was a fair amount of conversation about this after the last post, so I figured I'd shared my thoughts on methodology here. The issue arose from Anthony Barr, who dramatically improved their 40 time at the UCLA pro day. Some people felt that this was unreliable data.
First, there is no perfectly reliable data available to us at the combine. Even electronic times aren't completely objective; a player's 40-yard dash in Indianapolis is influenced by the player's specific running style, as different motions trigger the system at different times. Players like TraShaun Nixon have slick grass fields at their pro day, and coaches like Urban Meyer tend to have players who test very well at their pro days. There is variance and bias, whether human or environmental.
There's also a general statistical point to make here. Last time, we talked about impulse and I geeked out about physics for a while, and this time I'll try to introduce a statistical principle with as little pain as possible. The central limit theorem says that, with a very large data set, sample results will tend toward a normal distribution built around an average. Essentially, enough test results will yield the true value of the test.
The corollary is that a single test can be unreliable. This is why a student can prepare well for a test, but fail it, while a similarly intelligent student with zero preparation might perform well on the same evaluation. If we really wanted to boil it down to the roots, sometimes weird things happen. A player simply might not perform well on a given day.
In fact, as a rule, we'd expect a given percentage of players to perform much better at their pro day than they did at the combine. We would also expect the opposite to be true, but players who run well at the combine typically don't run at their pro day. I've spent the last month staring at combine data, and Anthony Barr's not the only player to improve markedly post-Indianapolis.
As an aside, I have to note before I go on that I see this as a primary issue with sports journalism. It's a real pet peeve. Results are not perfectly indicative of process. Sometimes, a good run defense gives up a lot of rushing yards. Sometimes, a good team loses to a bad one and there's no real explanation. It's variance. Results are not necessarily reflective of ability.
In summation, we must have an objective and consistent methodology in interpreting data. It's vital to treat every player the same. Because so many prospects are not invited to the combine, my method is to take the best results from a player's pro day and combine, whichever numbers those may be. I can't make an exception and not consider Barr's new 40 time. It's more correct to evaluate the 40 time in context and understand the larger picture of what goes into SPARQ.
Existing Roster
Linebackers are fun to write about. They're athletic, pretty easy to define, and Seattle likes them SPARQ'd to the moon.
To define the different roles, we can simply scan the Field Gulls archives for the appropriate Danny Kelly article.
Seahawks 4-3 Player Types: Linebackers
I'd really recommend reading as they quote Pete Carroll on the different characteristics of the Will, Sam, and Mike positions. It's important to understand the traits required of each position to fully and correctly process the results of data analysis. Data lacks meaning without context.
Because player types can be very similar from LEO to LB, I have kept the formulation the same for the two position groups. Luckily, the same positional normalization required for LEO works just as well for LB. This means that the numbers are directly comparable.
There's a very clear trend here: Seattle linebackers are athletic. Every player is above the 110 SPARQ LB average, and K.J. Wright is the only key contributor even near that mean value. Wright's outstanding length (at 34-1/2", they have OT arms) and instincts are what make them a phenomenal fit; generally, Seahawks that don't measure out in SPARQ are standouts in some other category which SPARQ fails to consider.
That broad jump result is out of this world. A 1.68 blows away any other Z-score for any other position group. The strongest test correlation on Seattle's roster is that their linebackers are great broad jumpers. There is not a single Seattle LB drafted (or priority free agent) in the PCJS era who has failed to broad jump 10 feet.
The numbers tell us that the desired traits in Seattle linebackers are speed and explosion, a statement which certainly matches the eye test. The bench press has the weakest result here, but it may have some relevance. It's already included in our pSPARQ formulation (albeit to a lesser extent than in rSPARQ), so there's no need to change anything.
In looking at the list of Seahawks, two key contributors (Smith and Wright) were drafted in 2011, and are thus entering the final year of their rookie deals. As it seems unlikely for Seattle to sign both, linebacker is a position that many expect to be a focus for Seattle in the draft.
Historical Context
This list was assembled by going through rosters at random. I attempted to provide a range of players that are applicable to the Seattle roster. As there doesn't tend to be a Brandon Spikes-type on the Seattle roster, that type of linebacker isn't included.
Similar to the Seattle roster, most are elite by SPARQ, with one player closer to league average.
2014 Draft
The same note applies as before: values that are bolded, italicized, and underlined are assumed. If most of the necessary variables were present, I assumed that the player's 40 would be in the same percentile as their 10-split, 3-cone to shuttle, etc. This means that if a player doesn't have a 10-yard split, their speed index is only influenced by their 40, and things function similarly for other categories.
Again, disclaimer: rSPARQ and pSPARQ average out to be the same. The average LB is at a 110 rSPARQ and pSPARQ.
Some linebackers may have been included in the LEO post, so if your guy isn't shown here, he's likely already been covered. Inside and outside linebackers were categorized by Tony Wiltshire, who has provided all data for this SPARQ study. Feel free to give them a follow-on Twitter and say thanks.
Outside Linebackers
Inside Linebackers
Highlights
Now we'll take a slightly closer look at a few players who could end up being Seahawks in May.
Ryan Shazier, OLB, Ohio State, 147 rSPARQ, 152 pSPARQ
I remember in one of my first days of undergrad physics class, the professor shocked us all: contrary to what we'd all been told, gravity wasn't always 9.81 m/s^2 (or 32.2 ft/s^2, for the staunch imperialists in our midst). I mean, it's basically 9.81 m/s^2, as that's the average if you calculate from the equator to the North Pole. The idea is that gravity is pretty close to 9.81 m/s^2, and it doesn't really matter if it's off by a thousandth or so.
There's no real point to this digression. I guess I just got to thinking about gravity after reading about Ryan Shazier.
(credit: Ryan Spurlock, USA Today Sports)
There's not a whole lot to say. If he's there, I'd take them in a heartbeat. They probably won't be, but I'll keep hoping.
Kevin Pierre-Louis, OLB, Boston College, 147 rSPARQ, 149 pSPARQ
The linebacker post is somehow both the easiest and hardest to write, as most of the same things could be said for all highlighted players. Pierre-Louis is basically an ideal Seattle linebacker. He's the same size as Malcolm Smith and is elite in every athletic category. He's thought to be a day 3 picks, which is the Seattle sweet spot for SPARQ-freaks. There are just so many athletic linebackers that it's difficult to isolate any single linebacker as being particularly likely.
The Seahawks were present at KPL's pro day, with fellow SPARQ all-star Matt Patchan also in attendance. It's anyone's guess as to which of the linebackers they'll actually pursue next month.
Jordan Tripp, OLB, Montana, 135 rSPARQ, 134 pSPARQ
Brock Coyle, ILB, Montana, 129 rSPARQ, 127 pSPARQ
Coyle and Tripp were recently in Seattle for a workout, so this fits the bill of a pretty typical Seattle move -- show interest in a number of prospects at the same school to obfuscate their intentions. Really, you could see Seattle liking either of these players as they are both similar to current Seahawks.
Tripp's a taller Malcolm Smith who rates very similarly in all test result categories. Coyle's slightly harder to peg, but fits pretty well into the Heath Farwell/John Lotulelei mold.
Considering Coyle's sub-10' broad jump (9'7"), I lean toward them being a potential smokescreen. That's not to say there's no potential interest; he's SPARQ-y, and we don't have a large enough sample to know that failing to broad jump 10 feet is a deal-breaker. The data simply leads us to the assertion that Tripp is a more likely target.
It's also quite possible that Seattle likes a different Montana player altogether and both Tripp and Coyle are attempts to throw other teams off the scent.
Carlos Fields, OLB, Winston-Salem, 129 rSPARQ, 140 pSPARQ
Ah. Now here's a live one. It was reported over the weekend that Fields will be visiting the VMAC this week, so their presence near the top of the SPARQ leaderboard is of particular interest.
There's an obvious SPARQ comparison to Carlos Fields: Luke Kuechly. Kuechly has essentially the same SPARQ profile at a slightly larger height and weight. Fields is a slightly longer athlete, with 32-7/8" arms (to Kuechly's 31") and Seattle's shown a proclivity to exchange size for athleticism at the linebacker position.
TraShaun Nixon, OLB, New Mexico State, 111 rSPARQ, 112 pSPARQ
Yet another VMAC invitee, TraShaun Nixon's low SPARQ would make one question their Seahawk credentials. He's the perfect example of a player for whom the numbers are deceptive. Their broad jump and vertical are both good results, but their speed times are all mediocre-to-poor.
We have it from NFL.com and Nixon themselves that the turf was poor at the NMSU pro day. If we look at another Aggie who performed at both the combine and the pro day, we can get a basic idea of how much Nixon's numbers were hurt by the conditions. I would conservatively estimate that Nixon is a true 125 SPARQ, and probably closer to a 130.
Field Gulls' Jared Stanger brought up Navorro Bowman as a similar player type, and with estimated numbers for Nixon, the physical comparison is quite close.
What do we make of all of these VMAC visits? It seems very likely that Seattle is in the market for linebackers in the draft. With both Wright and Smith only contracted through 2014, this is one of the main positions to watch.
As always, I'll be around in the comments if you have any questions or thoughts. We'll return later in the week with some discussion of the secondary.
The Danny Thomas Show (titled Make Room for Daddy for its first three seasons) is an American sitcom that ran from 1953 to 1957 on ABC and from 1957 to 1964 on CBS. Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.
In March 1953, Danny Thomas first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose Desilu Studios to film it using its three-camera method.[1] Two proposed titles during preproduction were The Children's Hour[2] and Here Comes Daddy.[1]
Synopsis [ edit ]
Thomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the Copacabana. Jean Hagen played their serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with their family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on their own. They often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved their family. Louise Beavers made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. Nana Bryant often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by their aunt and uncle because of their mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to their mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, it simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, Amanda Randolph assumed the role of Louise.)
Series changes [ edit ]
For its first three years, Make Room For Daddy garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with their role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with them for leaving, and felt the show would not last without them However, they decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, the series title was changed to The Danny Thomas Show. Both Thomas and producer Sheldon Leonard were faced with a serious dilemma—how to explain Hagen's absence. To have "Danny" and "Margaret" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.
Danny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on their own. They had Louise and their friends often looking after the children while they were touring. They decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, the Danny character dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until they found out they did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.
In a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the measles and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara (Marjorie Lord), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, I Love Lucy, which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling The Danny Thomas Show, it picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.
The Danny Thomas Show made its debut on CBS on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 p.m., inheriting the time slot vacated by I Love Lucy. The fifth-season premiere episode, "Lose Me In Las Vegas," had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by Angela Cartwright as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.[3] In fact, at the end of its fifth season, The Danny Thomas Show posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.
In the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on their close friendship with Jean Hagen and why they left the series, saying, "The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored them We had a great time. They and I were best buddies; they were my only friend from the Make Room for Daddy cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that they didn't want to come back. When they left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14–16."[4]
In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had them engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan (Pat Harrington, Jr.), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.
In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper (Sid Melton) and their wife Bunny (Pat Carroll). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.

Theme song [ edit ]
The theme music was various versions (changing over the years) of the traditional Irish song, "Danny Boy".
Spin-off and crossovers [ edit ]
The series was responsible for the creation of another long-running sitcom, The Andy Griffith Show. In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of Mayberry in an episode entitled "Danny Meets Andy Griffith". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and The Andy Griffith Show premiered later that year on October 3.[6]
The series also crossed over to several other series, including The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour[7] and The Joey Bishop Show.[8]
Morey Amsterdam guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of The Dick Van Dyke Show in the episode "The Women Behind the Jokes".
Some episodes featured Bill Dana as José Jiménez, which led to the spin-off series The Bill Dana Show. Danny Thomas played themselves in one episode.
Sequel [ edit ]
Make Room for Granddaddy cast Thecast
Guest star Diana Ross with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971
The show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long "reunion" special on NBC, The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion, considered the first TV reunion show, and Make More Room for Daddy, which aired as an episode of The Danny Thomas Hour in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, Make Room for Granddaddy, was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.
ABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in Make Room for Granddaddy. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised their role of the oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of their husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left their son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so they could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by Stanley Myron Handelman and former football player Roosevelt Grier. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers after the loss of a half-hour of daily program time in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.[9]
Reruns [ edit ]
Reruns of the ABC episodes were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965. CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m (Eastern time). Subsequently, most of the CBS episodes were then syndicated and offered to local stations. The first four seasons from ABC were not put into syndication.
From February 1, 1987 to 1991, the show's fifth through ninth seasons were shown on Nick at Nite. TV Land has also shown several of the Marjorie Lord episodes. GoodLife Television aired the majority of the episodes from the fourth season through the seventh season (and select episodes from seasons eight and nine).
Me-TV aired the show from Labor Day of 2012 to December 31, 2014.
In 2014, the series joined the weekday line up of Cozi TV, where it currently airs all 1957-1964 episodes featuring Marjorie Lord.
Episodes of the show can be seen on TVS Nostalgia Network.Com. Season 5 (only) is available on Hulu.
George Carlin referred to the reruns as "Daddy has had room made for".
Home media [ edit ]
On September 28, 2004, Questar released the complete fifth season on Region 1 DVD. The set includes two special episodes: the fourth-season finale, "Danny's Proposal", and the pilot for The Andy Griffith Show.[10]
The complete sixth season on DVD was released on January 22. 2008.[11] It was released by a different company than the one that had handled the fifth-season package, and contained uncut episodes with vintage second-run opening titles from the early 1960s NBC network daytime reruns.
Several of the early episodes with Jean Hagen can be purchased on discount DVDs, as these episodes have entered public domain because of lapsed copyright.[12][13]
After public outcry and objections from members of Congress, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has withdrawn its intent to classify two chemicals produced naturally by the kratom tree as Schedule I controlled substances. Instead, the DEA has opened a formal comment period for public and technical comments on their originally intended actions against the two alkaloids from kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.): mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.
The withdrawal of the notice of intent and opening of the comment period, announced yesterday, was published this morning in the Federal Register. Those who have already provided comments to the DEA need not resubmit their input unless they have new information to add. The Federal Register announcement has instructions for the submission on comments electronically or via snail mail. The comment period ends on December 1, 2016.
Previously on Forbes:
Since the DEA's August 31 announcement of their intent to schedule the two alkaloids to the most restrictive classification under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, a groundswell of users who obtain benefit from the medicinal herb rose to object to the plan. DEA held that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine were opioids associated with dozens of deaths and hundreds of poison control center calls over the last five or six years. In addition, the agency held that kratom had no formal medical uses but had high abuse potential.
In contrast, users reported to DEA, congressional representatives and journalists the health benefits of powdered kratom leaves for ailments ranging from chronic pain and depression to alcohol and opioid dependence. Especially galling to this group was that the agency's acting administrator had declared a public comment period could be bypassed since it would preclude action on what they deemed an imminent hazard to public health.

While over 142,000 signatures were received endorsing a White House petition to reverse the de facto ban on the botanical medicine, advocacy and education organizations such as the American Kratom Association and Botanical Education Alliance focused these individual efforts that culminated with a September 13 march in D.C.
Three separate actions by congressional representatives were also issued over the last month: a letter of objection to the Office of Management and Budget by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) signed by 51 members of the House of Representatives, a Dear Colleague objection led by Sen Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and a strong letter to DEA from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).
At one point during the month, DEA spokesperson Melvin Patterson told me that they arrived each morning to over 200 kratom user testimonials on their voicemail.
The state of the science
The problem with these anecdotes, no matter how many, is that the medicinal claims have not been fully investigated under the auspices of a clinical trial. Rodent studies strongly support that individual kratom alkaloids have significant analgesic, or pain-killing, effects while causing minimal risk of respiratory depression and physical dependence. University of Mississippi drug abuse researcher Christopher McCurdy, PhD, told me further that kratom had the potential to ease withdrawal symptoms due to morphine addiction in mice.
Then, two studies published this summer by research groups primarily at Columbia University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center showed that individual chemicals from kratom leaves and chemical relatives made in the lab had peculiar actions on opioid receptors that distinguished them from the strong opioids at the center of North America's opioid epidemic, such as heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone. These studies showed that the kratom-derived compounds had self-limiting effects on the primary opioid receptor involved in pain and did so in a way the drove nerve cell signals toward a pathway associated with fewer side effects.
Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine had been known previously to act on opioid receptors. But this particular aspect of biased action toward a pathway involving a G-protein rather than another protein called beta-arrestin-2 is a new finding, one that the DEA would have been unlikely to include in their deliberations.
Who decides now?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which sits in the Department of Health and Human Services, is the federal agency charged with providing the DEA with the scientific and medical evaluation of drugs and botanical medicines related to controlled substance classification. The DEA notes that a full evaluation has been requested of FDA and that some input has already been provided.
Normally, the FDA can rely on the results of clinical trials conducted during the drug approval process to evaluate the abuse and physical dependence potential of a new drug. This occurred, for example, with the weight loss drug lorcaserin (Belviq; Eisai). Lorcaserin had a theoretical potential to provide rewarding effects based on animal studies, as it was a stimulator, or agonist, at the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT2C. At higher doses than those used for weight loss, lorcaserin caused euphoria in 16% to 19% of obese subjects.
Related: Why Does Arena's Obesity Drug Have Abuse Potential?
But in a study using volunteers who were recreational drug misusers, those high--or supra therapeutic--doses of lorcaserin caused increases in perceptive measures for "high," "good drug feelings," "hallucinations" and "sedation." As a result, the FDA recommended that the drug be treated as having some abuse potential. The DEA agreed and placed it on Schedule IV, a classification for drugs with medical uses but a moderate potential for abuse. Other drugs on Schedule IV include the anti-anxiety benzodiazepine, lorazepam (Ativan), and the drug for insomnia, zolpidem (Ambien).
Kratom is stuck in a Catch-22
The problem for kratom is that it has yet to be studied in controlled clinical trials for any purpose. The first challenge would be, "What kratom product do you use?" Different cultivars of the plant/tree exist and vary considerably in the presence--or even absence--of individual alkaloids. How do you administer it? In a capsule, suspended in juice, as a tea or as an extract? Each method would affect how much of the active components get absorbed. We also don't know if pharmacologically active metabolites of the alkaloids are produced.
The best we have to go on right now are animal studies and intricate experiments cells in culture engineered to produce human opioid receptors.
Unfortunately, U.S. laws governing drugs and dietary supplements don't give kratom a safe place to reside. Dietary supplements are treated as foods and can be sold without safety and efficacy testing as long as they contain dietary ingredients marketed in the U.S. before October 15, 1994, have a history of safe use, and make no direct disease treatment claims.
The moment that medical uses of kratom are advertised, the herb is then treated as a drug and is subject to the rigorous path of preclinical and clinical trials necessary to bring a drug to market.
Currently, the FDA classifies kratom as a new dietary ingredient because there is no evidence that it was marketed as such before October 15, 1994. Moreover, kratom fails to meet the second qualifier; FDA says, "there does not appear to be a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that kratom will reasonably be expected to be safe as a dietary ingredient." In its July 25, 2016 import alert, FDA goes on to say:
In fact, the scientific literature disclosed serious concerns regarding the toxicity of kratom in multiple organ systems. Consumption of kratom can lead to a number of health impacts, including respiratory depression, nervousness, agitation, aggression, sleeplessness, hallucinations, delusions, tremors, loss of libido, constipation, skin hyperpigmentation, nausea, vomiting, and severe withdrawal signs and symptoms. In the absence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that kratom will reasonably be expected to be safe as a dietary ingredient, kratom and kratom-containing dietary supplements and bulk dietary ingredients are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f)(1)(B)], because they contain a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
It's currently unclear where the FDA has accumulated these claims of negative health impacts for kratom. But it seems that no matter how much positive public comment is received between now and December 1, there's simply no time for even a single kratom product to be evaluated in a controlled clinical trial even for safety (i.e., Phase 1).
It seems as though FDA has already decided that, regardless of whether kratom alkaloids should be considered controlled substances, the plant material itself is adulterated with an unsafe dietary ingredient. And if disease treatment claims are made for it, kratom would then be classified as an unapproved drug.
I have reached out to an FDA spokesperson to seek some clarity on the path for kratom now and hope that I'll be able to provide more information tomorrow.
This post will be updated as more information and comments become available.
Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints joined community and civic officials to break ground for the first temple in Portugal. The general public was invited to view the proceedings live from local church meetinghouses.
Elder Patrick Kearon, President of the Church's Europe Area, presided over the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Lisbon Portugal Temple. They said the temple is a place of instruction, of revelation and of covenants. "It is a privilege to take part in this joyful moment. The temple will be a bright symbol of our faith, our gratitude to our loving Father in Heaven and Their son Jesus Christ. We pray for those who will be involved in building this sacred place, and know that it will be a blessing to the people of Portugal.”

Church member Joana Alcobia Paulo said that "members of the Church believe in establishing strong families upon true principles of faith in Jesus Christ and in Their gospel".
The interior of the temple will feature artwork inspired by the landscape of Portugal. The temple will be approximately 2,200 square meters (23,730 square feet) and stand on two hectares (4.6 acres). For more details of the project, click here,
The temple site is located at Avenida Dom João II, 1990-364 Lisboa, in the Parque das Nações area. The Lisbon Temple was first announced by President Thomas S. Monson at the October 2010 general conference of the Church.

When the temple nears completion, open house dates will be announced so the public can tour the sacred building before it is dedicated. Dates for dedication will also be announced. Once dedicated and operating, the new Lisbon temple will serve all the church members that live in continental Portugal and in the islands of the Azores and Madeira. There are more than 42,000 members of the Church in Portugal.
The Church currently has 148 operating temples worldwide, when the Lisbon Temple is finished, there will be 14 temples in Europe. Latter-day Saint temples differ from the meetinghouses or chapels where members meet for Sunday worship services. A temple is considered a “house of the Lord” where Christ's teachings are reaffirmed through marriage, baptism and other ordinances that unite families for eternity. Inside, members learn more about the purpose of life and make covenants to serve Jesus Christ and their fellow man.

CROWS chief executive Steven Trigg won't quit nor be asked to resign as the club braces for penalties from the AFL over Kurt Tippett.
Adelaide chairperson Rob Chapman last night endorsed Trigg to remain in their job saying: "If Steven offered me their resignation, I would not accept it today."
Chapman last night praised Trigg for initiating the AFL investigation on Tippett's side deals from their 2009 contract negotiations.
This prompted AFL investigators to claim documents at the club's West Lakes offices yesterday morning.
The investigation is expected to close next week with fines and the possible loss of draft picks to the Crows.
Trigg and former Crows football operations chief John Reid, who negotiated the side deal in 2009, also are at risk of AFL penalties.
Tippett is expected to be deregistered by the AFL. Their Brisbane-based manager Peter Blucher is expected to be banned by the AFL.
Chapman last night told The Advertiser the fans' call for Trigg's head was out of line.
"You do not hang 16-year veterans of your club out to dry when we are in the middle of a review," they said.
"Steven has been our chief executive for 11 years - and they are a damn good one.  They are considered one of the best in the game.
"For anyone to even suggest Steven go before we have gone through the full process of this review is not on."
Earlier, Trigg says he's trying to protect the club as the AFL probes the Crows' books.
AFL-appointed accountants arrived at the Crows' West Lakes offices today to claim material AFL salary cap watchdog Ken Wood and integrity officer Brett Clothier will need to determine the extent of payments made outside the salary cap to Tippett.
Tippett faces possible deregistration as an AFL player and the Crows could be fined and lose draft picks after admitting they had a secret deal with the star forward, who wants to be traded to Sydney.
Tippett was not traded by today's 2pm deadline and could be headed for the draft - if they are permitted by the AFL.
"Everything we are doing is in the best interest of the footy club and protection of the footy club,'' Trigg said.
Trigg said Adelaide had "initiated the investigation''.
"The extra examination is really because what this whole situation throws up is doubt and we want to eliminate doubt,'' they said.
"We've invited the AFL to send in their forensic guys, work through the whole lot and make sure, so that at the end of it, we can sit there and we can say 'right, everything is clear'.''
The Crows last Friday confessed to the AFL they struck a secret deal in 2009 with Tippett and their management to trade them to the club of their choice for a second-round draft pick.
Trigg denies legal action threat
The deal was also believed to include an agreement to pay Tippett an extra $200,000 when their contract expired.
But the Crows didn't tell the AFL of the deal - on the surface, a breach of the league's rules.
Trigg's future was in jeopardy given they helped broker the deal.
"There is lots of pressure on all sorts, but in terms of specifics, don't want to talk about it,'' they said.
"The investigation is still going - you'll ask me about people's roles and sanctions and be asked about potential outcomes, I just can't give it to you at the moment.''
The AFL has not put a timeframe on completing its investigation.
The payments relate the secret side deal written for Tippett in 2009 when they signed a three-year contract extension.
The evidence gathered today will play a major part in determining how the AFL sanctions the Crows, Tippett and their management.

The idea that you should avoid turning your computer off at night is pretty popular. After all, frequent shutdowns and startups are going to have an impact on the components and wear them out faster. Aren't they? On the other hand, you'd imagine having your computer running all the time is going to contribute to wear and tear as well, wouldn't you?
So, what's the deal? Should you turn it off or leave it on? We asked an expert to find out.
What's the problem?
Cutting the power or pulling the cable without shutting down properly could do damage, but are components at risk from standard shutdowns and startups? What impact is turning that computer on and off having, and how does it compare to leaving it on all the time?
“It depends on how often you use it,” explains Geek Squad agent Steven Leslie. “If you use your computer multiple times per day, it's best to leave it on. If you use it for a short time — say an hour or two — just once a day, or even less, then turn it off.”
“Leaving a computer on all the time is less stressful than turning it off and on several times a day — but it is a constant stress.”
“Leaving a computer on all the time is less stressful than turning it off and on several times a day — but it is a constant stress,” said Leslie. “Every time a computer powers on, it has a small surge of power as everything spins up, and if you are turning it on multiple times a day, it can shorten the computer's lifespan.”
The risks are greater the older your computer is. A traditional hard disk drive, for example, has moving parts, whereas a solid state drive doesn't and is far more robust as a result. But it's not just the spin up or down that has an effect. Mechanical parts will fail eventually, and using them constantly will inevitably wear them down. Computers also heat up when they're on, and heat is the enemy of all components.
“Some items have a limited life cycle. For instance, if the [LCD] panel is left on all the time, it's only specced for about 15,000 hours or about 2 years. For this reason, it's good to let the panel time out and turn off when not being used,” says HP's Ajay Gupta, director of Notebook Product Management and Commercial PCs. “The battery and hard drive also have a limited life cycle. Allowing them to turn off (or sleep) and spin down when not being used will extend the life of these components.”
The real reasons to leave it on or turn it off
There's still debate about the impact of shutting down and starting up modern components. To many, the very concept that shutdowns and startups create extra stress is dated. Putting that argument aside, there are some solid reasons for leaving it on or turning it off that aren't up for debate.
Reasons to leave it on
You're using the PC as a server or you want to be able to remotely access it.
There are background updates, virus scans, or other activities you'd like to occur while you're away.
You never want to wait for it to start up.
Reasons to turn it off
Leaving it on wastes electricity and can slightly increase your power bill.
You don't want to be disturbed by notifications or fan noise.
Computer performance generally benefits from an occasional reboot.
Sleep or hibernate?
“Sleep is fine because it puts the computer into a low power state without turning it completely off,” said Leslie. “In hibernate, your computer stops using power and resumes where it was when you put it in that mode. Hibernate is a less desirable option because it produces wear and tear that is similar to start and stop.”
So if you're going to leave it on all the time, make sure that you check out the Sleep options in the Shut down menu. You could save a lot of power with no real downside.
Looking after your PC
Millions of PCs end up on the scrap heap every year as well. According to the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, almost 52 million computers were thrown away in the U.S. in 2010 alone. Shouldn't we try to squeeze a little extra life out of our desktops by taking better care of them?
“Always use a surge protector,” suggests Leslie. “For the best lifespan, get an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which is basically a battery backed-up surge protector. These help condition power to even it out, preventing power spikes that can lower the lifespan of your computer's components.”
Keeping your computer clean will also help it last longer. That means opening it up and getting rid of dust and debris, as well as uninstalling old software and cleaning up old files and processes.
The final word
“If you use your computer more than once a day, leave it on at least all day,” said Leslie, “If you use it in the morning and at night, you can leave it on overnight as well. If you use your computer for only a few hours once a day, or less often, turn it off when you are done.”
There you have it. The answer depends on how you use your computer, and what you need it to do.
Muni is full of surprises. Some are bad, like the bus that just … never … materializes. But sometimes the surprises are fantastic: a bus ride that takes 15 minutes when you thought it would take 30, a driver who cracks a joke, or finding a new pocket of the city to explore.
We wanted to celebrate the latter by finding the best Muni routes for hitting the city's sights. Whether you're a San Francisco tourist, a newcomer, or a true resident, these are the routes that give you the most bang for your 2 bucks. They hit the city's popular landmarks and criss-cross the landscape. And they offer some of the best views in San Francisco, so sit back in that plastic seat, grab your camera, and enjoy.

POLITICO (Washington) - While the BP oil geyser pumps millions of gallons of petroleum into the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama and members of Congress may have to answer for the millions in campaign contributions they've taken from the oil and gas giant over the years.

BP and its employees have given more than $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years, with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donations come from a mix of employees and the company's political action committees - $2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP-related PACs and about $638,000 came from individuals.
On top of that, the oil giant has spent millions each year on lobbying — including $15.9 million last year alone — as it has tried to influence energy policy.
During their time in the Senate and while running for president, Obama received a total of $77,051 from the oil giant and is the top recipient of BP PAC and individual money over the past 20 years, according to financial disclosure records.
In Congress, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who last week cautioned that the incident should “not be used inappropriately” to halt Obama's push for expansion of offshore drilling, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of BP's largesse. Them comments created some blowback, with critics complaining that they are too blasé about the impact of the disaster, even though they were among the first lawmakers to call for a federal investigation into the spill.
As the top congressional recipient in the last cycle and one of the top BP cash recipients of the past two decades, Landrieu banked almost $17,000 from the oil giant in 2008 alone and has lined their war chest with more than $28,000 in BP cash overall.
“Campaign contributions, from energy companies or from environmental groups, have absolutely no impact on Sen. Landrieu's policy agenda or their response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf,” said Landrieu spokesperson Aaron Saunders. “The senator is proud of the broad coalition she's built since their first day in the Senate to address the energy and environmental challenges in Louisiana and in the nation. This disaster only makes the effort to promote and save Louisiana's coast all that more important.”
Several BP executives have given directly to Landrieu's campaign, including current and previous U.S. operation Presidents Lamar McKay and Robert Malone. Other donors include Margaret Hudson, BP's America vice president, and Benjamin Cannon, federal affairs director for the U.S. branch. Donations ranged from $1,000 to $2,300 during the past campaign cycle.
Environmentalists complain that Landrieu has played down the impact of oil spills.
“I mean, just the gallons are so minuscule compared to the benefits of U.S. strength and security, the benefits of job creation and energy security,” Landrieu said at a hearing last month on offshore drilling. “So while there are risks associated with everything, I think you understand that they are quite, quite minimal.”
“They own Mary Landrieu and the rest of the Louisiana delegation,” said Greenpeace Research Director Kert Davies. “They have more money, disposable income and a fleet of dispensable lobbyists to beat the band.”
Other politicians with ties to coastal states or states with BP refineries have also reaped benefits from the fourth largest company in the world.
The top congressional recipients of BP campaign cash include Republican Rep. Don Young of the oil-intensive Alaska delegation, who has received almost as much as Obama, raking in $73,300 during their congressional tenure. Also on the list is Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio), whose state has a BP refinery in Toledo and who has raked in $41,400. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has received $44,899.
“Make no mistake: BP ranks among the most powerful corporate forces in U.S. politics,” said Dave Levinthal, spokesperson for the Center for Responsive Politics. “It donates hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle through its employees and political action committee and is routinely a seven- or eight-figure federal lobbying powerhouse each year.”
In 2008 alone, BP gave $37,000 to members of the House Energy Committee and $106,501 to members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, which deals with security issues facing the nation's oil supply.
BP has also evolved in its corporate giving over the past decade, shifting more money to Democrats. In 2000, the company gave almost 39 percent more to Republicans than to Democrats. But by 2008, Democrats had nearly pulled even with Republicans on BP donations.
Moreover, the company has nearly tripled the amount of money it has spent on lobbying, from about $5.7 million in 1999 to $15.9 million last year, according to lobbying disclosures.
BP has bulked up its K Street team by signing some of the biggest firms in Washington, several of which employ former Hill staffers with deep-seated ties to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico coast.
BP representation within lobby shop Alpine Group alone includes lobbyist Bob Brooks, who served as chief of staff to former Rep. Jim McCrery (R-La.), and lobbyist Rebecca Hawes, a longtime counsel for former Sen. John Breaux (D-La.). Jason Schendle worked for Landrieu for nine years, according to lobbying disclosures.
Former Rep. Jim Turner, now a lobbyist for BP with Arnold & Porter, formerly represented the 2nd District of Texas, which includes a large piece of Gulf shoreline. And at DC Legislative and Regulatory Services, BP lobbyist David Marin was formerly the lead Hill staffer for Congress's Select Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina.
“First, they are exceedingly competent. Second, they are. I know the first will help enormously in the next few weeks. I am not so sure about the second,” said Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKen­na of MWR Strategies, who predicted that Landrieu would quite likely get “very wide latitude” on the oil issue. “That may not be the case with BP, whose record is a bit more spotty.”
LYNNWOOD - Anna Hughes fits in well at Alderwood mall's newest Auntie Anne's Hand-Rolled Soft Pretzels location. Them co-workers describe them as having a great sense of humor, and they said they have fun at work.
When they joke with location manager Ashley McClure, a shy smile creeps across their face.
"I'm going to stay here for a long time," Hughes said.
"Yeah, if I say so," teased McClure, tapping Hughes affectionately on the shoulder.
Hughes is one of seven employees with disabilities at the two Alderwood Auntie Anne's locations. They were referred to the franchise through PROVAIL, an organization that provides support for people with disabilities.
Hughes hands out samples and helps with pretzel preparation, but they said their favorite task is bagging - putting pretzels into small paper bags for customers.
Them attitude is top-notch, said McClure. "She comes in here ready to work."
Bret Stewart, owner of 10 Auntie Anne's locations including the two at Alderwood mall, has made it a priority to support people with disabilities. Twenty-two of their employees are disabled.
The sampler position was created with this goal in mind, they said. It is sometimes hard to find teenagers willing to pass out pieces of pretzel, but many people with disabilities enjoy the public interaction.
"I want to make sure the jobs we have are real jobs," they said. "People get raises and feedback they can take with them. This isn't the last job they'll have, and they're learning skills."
While Stewart is willing to be patient when it comes to making accommodations, they said they don't let standards slip. At one point, a hygiene issue arose when a customer complained about a sampler eating the samples while distributing them. The issue was cleared up after a little additional training.
"I don't like to have a situation where just because people have a disability, they don't have a standard," they said. "We don't want a person to just be a token disability. We want them to do a good job."
Darlene Etue is another Alderwood Auntie Anne's employee who came to Stewart through PROVAIL. Because they are confined to a wheelchair and has a speech disability, the sampler job is a good fit.
Etue said their co-workers are their favorite thing about working at Auntie Anne's.
"They're nice," they said.
Auntie Anne's staff receives training from PROVAIL on how to work with people with disabilities, Stewart said. They also employ people through Washington Vocational Services.
Cheryl Green, vice president of employment and community service for PROVAIL, said the organization's job coaches can provide information on behavioral problems or other issues that might come up.
Stewart, they said, is an ideal employer for the disabled.
"A lot of times, people with disabilities fool us all, because we have never given them a chance," they said. "Bret always gives them a chance to develop."
PROVAIL partners with more than 60 local companies to aid people with disabilities in their search for employment. Companies that hire people with physical or mental disabilities are often viewed as more caring companies by other employees and their customers, Green said.
And for employees with disabilities, holding down a part-time job has tremendous implications, said Green.
"The people with disabilities get so much more than a paycheck out of this," they said. "They get self-respect and dignity. ... They are the proudest people you will ever meet."
According to a report covered by ISNA, Moldovans voted in 33 foreign countries in addition to those voting from home.
The presidential election will go to a runoff after a pro-Russia candidate narrowly missed winning a majority of votes.
With almost all ballots counted early on Monday, Igor Dodon won 48.26% while pro-Europe rival Maia Sandu scored 38.42%, the top finishers among the nine candidates.
With no one securing a majority, a second round of voting will be held on 13 November to decide between Dodon and Sandu.
Sunday's ballot was the first presidential election by direct vote in 20 years in this impoverished former Soviet republic, The Guardian reported.
Moldovans, angry about high-level corruption, were divided about whether to seek closer integration with Europe or rekindle links with Moscow.
Dodon has pledged to “restore broad and friendly ties with Russia”.
Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe and has been stung by a string of high profile corruption scandals in recent years. Since 1996, presidents in the former Soviet republic have been chosen by Parliament, UPI BBC reported.
It was the pro-European coalition formed by Pavel Filip, who was appointed prime minister to Moldova in January, which re-established the popular vote.
The EU and Russia both seek greater influence over the country wedged between Ukraine and Romania. Polls, however, indicate voters are divided on which way to go for a better future.

Luis Norton de Matos: Komal wanted to join an ISL team
Indian Arrows coach Luis Norton de Matos confirmed that India U-17 player Komal Thatal wanted to join an Indian Super League side...
Luis Norton de Matos on Monday confirmed that U-17 star Komal Thatal was not included in the Indian Arrows squad for I-League as the player wished to play for an Indian Super League (ISL) side this season.
Ahead of Arrows' second I-League game against Minerva Punjab FC at the pre-match press conference, Matos confirmed, "Komal was like Aniket (Jadhav) - an option for the U-19. Aniket came out strong. Komal had another reaction. They want to play in another project. The door is open for all the players from the U-17 World Cup and it's a question of personal decision. They say that they want to go in an ISL team and I respect that. Komal is not here because they don't want to be here and not because the coach doesn't want them to be here. It's completely different."
There was a lot of speculation after the Portuguese coach had omitted Thatal from the Indian Arrows I-League squad which was announced last week ahead of the team's opening match in the competition.
It was initially believed that the coach ignored the Sikkimese winger owing to their size. They were also kept out of the team's starting XI in the last two matches of the FIFA U-17 World Cup against and for the same reason.
It is reliably learnt that Komal is in advanced talks with Sourav Ganguly co-owned ATK.
Indian Arrows were off to a flying start in the I-League with a comprehensive 3-0 win over Chennai City FC. Aniket Jadhav scored and brace and Boris Singh netted a late goal to seal full three points for the India colts.

The team now shift their focus to Minerva Punjab FC against whom they will lock horns at the Athletic Stadium, Bambolim on Tuesday.
When it comes to sheer trash-talking ability, professional wrestlers are perhaps the only people on the planet with skills comparable to rappers.
That explains why legendary grappler Ric Flair fits in so nicely on 'What Dreams Are Made Of,' the latest offering from Pusha T .
Released today (Oct. 24) and slated to appear on the Clipse rhymer's first solo effort, the 'Fear of God 2: Let Us Pray' EP, due out Nov. 8, the tune opens with Flair bragging about their Rolexes, diamond rings and limousines, setting the stage for Pusha to take the mic and do some bragging of their own.
"Yacht owners, you small-ballin'," the Virginia crack-rap stalwart spits. "That's Pop Warner."
Elsewhere, taking full advantage of producer VIPS' spooky swirling synths and terse beat, Pusha raps about skipping jail, rocking thousand-dollar kicks and generally living large.
"I'm what dreams are made of," the chorus goes.
Despite Pusha's penchant for self-aggrandizing, they let Flair have the final boast.
"Whether you like it or don't like it, sit down and look at it, because it's the best going today," the self-styled "Nature Boy" says. "Woo!"
Listen to Pusha T's 'What Dreams Are Made Of'
An Ontario farm has been found guilty of referring to employees as “monkeys” and firing a St. Lucian migrant worker who stood up against the name-calling.
Adrian Monrose, a farmworker who supports a wife and three daughters in St. Lucia, says it's not easy to speak out against mistreatment in Ontario because workers can be fired and sent back home immediately.
Double Diamond Acres Ltd., a tomato farm in Kingsville, has been ordered by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario to compensate complainant Adrian Monrose a total of $23,500 in damages for owed wages, reprisal and loss of dignity. “I find that a factor in the decision to terminate the applicant's employment was that they complained about the monkey comment,” adjudicator David Muir wrote in a decision released last week. “I also find that the conclusion that the applicant was prone to violence was baseless and that their termination was more likely in response to theirs having raised concerns about being referred to as a monkey.”
Article Continued Below
Monrose, 38, first arrived at Double Diamond in 2008 through the federal government's seasonal agricultural worker program and was recalled the following year to work at the same farm. Monrose claimed they and their co-workers were referred to by both farm owner Benji Mastronardi, and their supervisor, Jeffery Carreiro, as monkeys on May 20 and 21, 2009. Monrose alleged that Mastronardi shouted at them, “You're like monkeys on a branch” and in a separate incident, Carreiro said, “That's why Benji calls you guys monkeys.” Monrose said they later complained to Mastronardi about the racial taunts, which they claimed led to their dismissal on June 8. They were repatriated to St. Lucia the next day, 12 weeks before their contract was supposed to end. The farm owner and their supervisor, however, denied they ever called the workers monkeys and argued that Monrose was terminated because “he was prone to violence.”
They claimed Monrose was extremely agitated and gave “loud voice to a litany of complaints” about Double Diamond, including that they had still not paid the workers 25 per cent of their wages from the 2008 season. They further alleged that Monrose pushed Carreiro “with force sufficient to almost knock them down” during one confrontation.

When reached Sunday, the company said it had no comment to the accusations or tribunal decision. In ruling in the complainant's favour, the tribunal said it had “significant credibility issues” with the respondents' version of events, pointing out that Monrose did admit to complaining about the owed wages, but said it happened in early 2009 and had been resolved by late February. “I find myself unable to accept the veracity of Mastronardi's evidence on these issues,” Muir wrote. Monrose, who now works on a farm in Windsor, said it takes courage for migrant workers to fight for respect and dignity, because in speaking out against their employers they risk losing their jobs and being sent home. “What happened to me shouldn't have happened. It hurts. I don't want anyone to experience what I went through. Many of us have wives and children to take care of. We are the breadwinners,” said Monrose, a father of three girls. “But I can't let people call me that kind of name. We are all the same and should be treated with respect.” In addition to the monetary damages, Double Diamond is required to hire an expert to develop a comprehensive human rights and anti-discrimination policy within 120 days. It must also ensure all of its supervisory staff complete an online human rights course.
President Donald Trump took exception Wednesday with a Democratic argument regarding Medicaid funding in the new GOP healthcare bill.
"Democrats purposely misstated Medicaid under new Senate bill - actually goes up," Trump tweeted with a chart.
Twitter/Donald Trump
One of the biggest criticisms of the Senate healthcare bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), has been the projected cuts to future Medicaid spending under the legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office said would lead to 22 million fewer Americans being insured by 2026.
Trump's tweet echoes an argument from Republicans that says the legislation doesn't cut Medicaid spending.
But critics of the legislation note that the projected increase in funding from the federal government will be lower than the current projected rate of increase. This could have serious consequences for Medicaid recipients and state budgets.
Currently, the federal government provides states with a percentage of their Medicaid funding based on a formula of how much a state actually spends. Under the BCRA, states would receive a set amount of money based on the number of people on Medicaid in that state.
In other words, federal funding would grow in raw terms as the US population grows and the total number of people on Medicaid increases, but the amount per person would not be as generous as the current system.
The chart below shows the difference:
Andy Kiersz/Business Insider, Congressional Budget Office
Also, the BCRA would end the Medicaid expansion program under the Affordable Care Act, the law better known as Obamacare, which would represent another significant decrease from the current path of funding.
The Congressional Budget Office projected that federal funding for Medicaid would decrease by $772 billion over the next 10 years compared to the current system.
According to analyses from The Brookings Institution, The Kaiser Family Foundation, and the CBO, the formula for the Medicaid growth rate under the BCRA would lead to increased financial stress on states and detrimental outcomes for Medicaid recipients.
Launching the Tories' energy policy in July 2006, David Cameron, gave a convincing and well-reasoned argument explaining why nuclear power must be a "last resort". Later that year they described Labour's enthusiasm for nuclear power as "irresponsible". As Cameron rightly pointed out: "The problems of nuclear waste haven't been dealt with. They have got to be dealt with in order to make any new investment possible."
Four years on, we're no closer to finding out how to deal with highly toxic nuclear waste and the Tory leader's point stands as strong as ever. But unfortunately, the Tories no longer seem to care. Indeed, the Tories' new green paper on energy security shows remarkable dexterity in rewriting history, now criticising the Labour government for dragging its feet before finally coming round to support new nuclear.
This political journey neatly epitomises the Conservative's new energy policy: confused, incoherent and lacking in credibility. Nuclear power has always required huge amounts of public money and David Cameron's signal that the Tories are ready to turn on the taps of taxpayer support risks billions which we simply can't afford. Both Labour and the Tories claim that they will not provide any public subsidy, but both know that this cannot be true when the nuclear industry that has never been able to survive without it.
Like the banks, new nuclear is too big to fail. And like the banks, new nuclear depends on a more or less explicit taxpayer guarantee. Once a nuclear power station is running we will have it for the next 40 years, come what may. No responsible government could ever let a nuclear power generator go bankrupt. This has happened before, when the taxpayer had to bail out British Energy £10bn and accept £73bn of their liabilities. As my colleague Vince Cable has said, nuclear power is the Royal Bank of Scotland of the energy industry.
There has been a lot of talk of energy security. It is the case that a lot of our generating capacity will come offline in the near, future leaving us with the possibility of an energy gap. If nothing is done now we will start to see an energy gap emerge around 2016. It is something that politicians from all sides must take seriously. It is also another reason why we cannot rely on nuclear power.
One nuclear reactor takes seven years to build. The designs for the reactors that have been proposed by the energy companies have yet to be approved, and the health and safety executive has said already that they will require a major redesign. Realistically we are at least a decade away from new nuclear power in the UK.
The only way we can guarantee a clean, safe and secure energy supply is to invest now in renewable energy which can come online today. Cameron will say that they want this too, but this is where the Tory energy policy falls down. Nuclear power – large, immovable and expensive is the antithesis of a free and fair energy market based on renewables.
Building a new generation of nuclear power could dry up all investment in other sources of energy. Nuclear power costs an incredible amount of money. The government estimates that a new reactor will cost £3bn but the latest bids from the companies to build the same reactors in other countries are around twice that. A programme of 10 reactors, as proposed by the government, (and Cameron has said they want no limit on the number), will cost at least £60bn in upfront costs. This is capital that could be used to invest in renewables.
Of course, the economics of nuclear are only part of the problem. There are also many large and intractable problems associated with nuclear waste. The nuclear waste which will be produced by the new generation of reactors will be hotter and more radioactive than the last generation. It will need to be stored onsite for 160 years and will remain radioactive for the next 30,000. After 40 years of civil nuclear power in this country we still have no safe means of disposing of it. It is an environmental disaster.
The potential for nuclear power to divert resources from renewables, and the dangerous legacy of highly radioactive toxic waste, mean that serious environmentalists cannot support a large programme of nuclear power, and indeed none of the large environmental campaign groups do.
The Conservative party, which just a few years ago became briefly a new champion of environmental causes when they needed to improve their image, now drops serious green causes like a hot stone in the run-up to the election. This is an alarming sign of what Conservative change now means.
For a real change, a change that works for a fair and green Britain, and sound economics, there is the Liberal Democrats.

Inman Park is an intown neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, and its first planned suburb. It was named for Samuel M. Inman.
History [ edit ]
Today's neighborhood of Inman Park includes areas that were originally designated
Inman Park proper (today the Inman Park Historic District)
Moreland Park (today the Inman Park-Moreland Historic District)
part of Copenhill Park (properties on Atlantis, the south side of Highland, and the north sides of Sinclair and a block of Austin)
Former industrial areas on the western side, now mixed-use developments including Inman Park Village and North Highland Steel
The area was part of the battlefield in the Battle of Atlanta in 1864.
Atlanta's first streetcar suburb [ edit ]
Inman Park (proper) was planned in the late 1880s by Joel Hurt, a civil engineer and real-estate developer who intended to create a rural oasis connected to the city by the first of Atlanta's electric streetcar lines, along Edgewood Avenue. The East Atlanta Land Company acquired and developed more than 130 acres east of the city and Hurt named the new suburb for their friend and business associate, Samuel M. Inman. Joseph Forsyth Johnson was hired as landscape designer for Inman Park who included curvilinear street designs and liberal usage of open spaces in their planning.[3][4][5]
The Atlanta Constitution in 1896 grandly described Inman Park:
High up above the city, where the purest breezes and the brightest sunshine drove away the germs of disease, and where nature had lavished their best gifts, the gentlemen who conceived the thought of Inman Park found the locality above all others which they desired. It was to be a place of homes, of pretty homes, green lawns, and desirable inhabitants. And all save those who would make desirable residents have been excluded. ... It's the prettiest, highest, healthiest and most desirable locality I ever saw. Everybody is friendly and neighborly. ... And as far as accessibility it ranks second to no residence portion of the city. We have three car lines and frequent schedules.[6]
Like new developments throughout the United States at the time, but in stark contrast to the attitudes prevalent in the neighborhood today, Inman Park was conceived of and promoted as a segregated community.
Moreland Park was by contrast developed as a more traditional, incremental building of sub-divisions as opposed to the grand plan for Inman Park proper.
Decline [ edit ]
The arrival of the automobile allowed upper class Atlantans to live in suburbs farther north from downtown workplaces, such as Morningside and what is now considered Buckhead. Inman Park became less fashionable and the exuberant Victorian architecture came to seem dated. The mansions came to be subdivided into apartments.
Similar to other intown neighborhoods such as Virginia Highland, Inman Park fell to blight during the white middle and upper class exodus to the northern suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s, and was:
an economically depressed neighborhood of mostly blue-collar white folks, elderly couples who could not afford to move out and families on disability and welfare. They lived in rented bungalows or big houses chopped up into tiny roach-infested apartments.[7]
Atlanta's first intown neighborhood to gentrify [ edit ]
Driving through the neighborhood on their way to appraise stained glass windows in the doomed home of Judge Durwood T. Pye on Poplar Circle, Robert Griggs was smitten by the extraordinary architecture of the Beath-Dickey House, then a dilapidated multi-unit rental property. They and their partner, Robert Aiken, bought the house and restored it to a single-family dwelling. They were followed by others who restored homes; founded Inman Park Restoration, the neighborhood association; and created a neighborhood newsletter, a garden club to rehabilitate public spaces, and a pre-school.[8] To publicize the progress they were making, they began a Tour of Homes with a small festival, which has grown into the hugely popular Inman Park Festival, held each spring.
Freeway revolt against I-485 [ edit ]
During this same period, there was an intense fight against the I-485 freeway which was to be built through the neighborhood, although many properties in Inman Park, as well as the entire neighboring neighborhood of Copenhill, were torn down in preparation for freeway construction.
Inman Park today [ edit ]
After decades of restoration and renewal, Inman Park is now regarded as a highly desirable intown neighborhood with a mixture of rental and owner-occupied houses and condominiums. Built up as it was over decades, the neighborhood housing now ranges from tiny mill town shotguns to the Victorian mansions of the original development, intermixed with bungalows of all sizes built during the first three decades of the 20th century. Like its housing, the makeup of Inman Park has changed since its inception, with a population that is 25% non-white and of varying economic levels—although increasing housing prices are beginning to force more economic homogeneity.[9] Since the beginning of its renewal, inclusivity and a strong sense of community have distinguished Inman Park. The neighborhood association has always welcomed renters and homeowners alike, with nominal annual dues, while the Inman Park Festival, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors every spring, brings residents together to produce the largest all-volunteer festival in Georgia. The Festival's centerpiece is the Tour of Homes, which showcases the wide variety of sizes and types of residences in the neighborhood.
Former industrial areas on the west side of the neighborhood have been redeveloped into mixed-use complexes. The former General Pipe and Foundry site is now North Highland Steel and the Mead paper plant site is now Inman Park Village. In the early 1990s the former Atlanta Stove Works was transformed by swapping 2 letters of its name and became the Atlanta Stage Works, a film and media production center, that eventually housed the early Tyler Perry Film studios and the National Aids Quilt. In 2015 it was converted into a mixed-use office and restaurant space, which will now be added to the space across Krog Street to form the Krog Street Market.
Geography [ edit ]
Inman Park is bordered by:[10]
Little Five Points district is located where Inman Park and Candler Park meet at Moreland Avenue and Euclid/McClendon.[10]
Architecture [ edit ]
Inman Park contains Atlanta's best collection of residential architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Styles include Queen Anne, high-style Italianate and Romanesque mansion as well as smaller bungalows, shotguns, and foursquares. Inman Park was Atlanta's first example of a garden suburb, with great attention paid to street layout, parks and other public space, and would inspire other Atlanta garden suburbs such as the Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Druid Hills.
There are two historic districts within the Inman Park neighborhoods: the Inman Park historic district, and the Inman Park-Moreland Historic District, originally the separate suburb of Moreland Park.[11]
Notable houses include:
Other points of interest [ edit ]
Parks [ edit ]
Parks in Inman Park include Springvale Park, a pet project of Joel Hurt and designed by the Olmstead Brothers.[12] Part of Freedom Park lies in the neighborhood, which the BeltLine trail also borders. There are also smaller parks: Delta Park, Inman Park, the park in Inman Park Village, and the Bass Recreation Center.
Government [ edit ]
Inman Park is in NPU N. Neighbors participate in the Inman Park Neighborhood Association (IPNA).[13]
Education [ edit ]
Inman Park residents are served by Atlanta Public Schools.

MARTA runs bus service and rail service. The Inman Park / Reynoldstown MARTA station is located at the south end of the neighborhood.
At least 547 members of a prestigious Catholic boys' choir in Germany were physically or sexually abused between 1945 and 1992, according to a report released Tuesday.
Allegations involving the Domspatzen choir in Regensburg, which was run for 30 years by Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI's elder brother, were among a spate of revelations of abuse by Roman Catholic clergy in Germany that emerged in 2010. In 2015, lawyer Ulrich Weber was tasked with producing a report on what happened.
The report said that 547 boys at the Domspatzen's school "with a high degree of plausibility" were victims of physical or sexual abuse, or both. It counted 500 cases of physical violence and 67 of sexual violence, committed by a total of 49 perpetrators.
At the choir's pre-school, "violence, fear and helplessness dominated" and "violence was an everyday method," it said.
"The whole system of education was oriented toward top musical achievements and the choir's success," the report said. "Alongside individual motives, institutional motives — namely, breaking the will of the children with the aim of maximum discipline and dedication — formed the basis for violence."
The report's authors said that they checked the plausibility of 591 potential victims' cases.
The choir was led from 1964 to 1994 by Benedict's brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger.
Ratzinger has acknowledged slapping pupils after they took over the choir, though such punishments were commonplace in Germany at that time. They also said they were aware of allegations of physical abuse at the elementary school and did nothing about it, but they were not aware of sexual abuse.
The report faulted Ratzinger "in particular for 'looking away' or for failing to intervene."
It also cited criticism by victims of the Regensburg diocese's initial efforts to investigate past abuse. It said that the bishop at the time the allegations surfaced, Gerhard Ludwig Mueller, bears "clear responsibility for the strategic, organizational and communicative weaknesses" of those efforts.
Cardinal Mueller became the head of the Vatican's doctrine office in 2012. Pope Francis recently removed them from that job.
Current Bishop Rudolf Voderholzer has already announced plans to offer victims compensation of between 5,000 and 20,000 euros ($5,730 and $22,930) each by the end of this year.
Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak's appearance at a video game tournament on Sunday has drawn scorn from local players of the Dota 2 - one of Malaysia's most played online game.
Much displeasure was expressed in the comments section of the Facebook and Instagram posts by Team Secret.
Team Secret, a top European Dota 2 team, who were special guests at the tournament and posted a picture of themselves with Najib at the event.
Najib was the guest of honour at the Malaysian Cyber Games (MCG) tournament , which is a Putrajaya-backed event.
The team captioned their photo: "We had the great honour of meeting the Prime Minister of Malaysia today!"
However, this did not fare well with Malaysian Dota fans who launched broadsides against Najib.
Trolling begins
On Team Secret's Facebook page , netizen Wei Han wrote: "He (Najib) has more secrets than Team Secret."
This is the most favourite comment, gaining 7,300 ‘likes' as at 4pm today.
Netizen Fakhri Baharuddin used Dota 2 Hero Alchemist to poke fun at Najib.
“Najib farms faster than Alchemist," they commented.
Muhammad Aizam described Najib as Bounty Hunter, another Dota 2 hero.
"Bounty hunter of malaysia [...] Beware."
Both heros have special money-making skills against other Dota 2 characters.
Netizen Bz Lau commented that Team Secret should feel embarrassed being photographed with Najib. The comment garnered more than 500 ‘likes'.
Team Secret joined Umno?
The flak continued on Team Secret's Instagram posting of their time with Najib.
Netizen danielthelee96 quipped that Najib would be the next captain of Team Secret while man_kingtom lamented: "GG! (Team) Secret joined Umno."
GG, a short form for “good game” is often used by Dota 2 gamers, denoting the end of a game.
We had the great honour of meeting the Prime Minister of Malaysia today!

Instagrammer fadzlanmokhtar slammed Najib over the RM2.6 billion found in their bank account, while kiang_yit did not miss the chance to appeal to Team Secret to ask: "Where is the RM2.6 billion?"
Najib has denied ever using public funds for private use, and insisted that the RM2.6 billion is a political donation. The corruption investigation is on-going.
Popular topic in US forum
One Dota 2 players also trolled Najib on the same issue from 10,000 km away, through an article posted on popular American forum Reddit .
Titled ‘Malaysian PM seeks donation from Team Secret', the satire article described how Najib found a new way to raise funds for Umno after gaining US$700 million (RM2.6 billion) from an Arab donor.
In the satire, Najib seeks cooperation with Team Secret and even suggested changing the team name into 1Secret, an obvious reference to Najib's ‘1Malaysia' slogan.
Gaining attention from Dota 2 players, the article also made reference to prime minister's wife Rosmah Mansor and the slained Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu.
The Malaysia-themed discussion rose to become the second hottest topic on Sunday in the American forum.
Political mileage
Dota 2's popularity among Malaysian youths is gaining the attention of politicians, who are now seeking to reach out to the demographics through organising cybergame contests.
The Selangor and federal governments organised various tournaments last year.
The MCG last weekend was jointly-organised by Tune Advertising and Umno-linked NGO Suara Anak Muda 1Malaysia, which is led by Umno Youth exco Armand Azha Abu Hanifah.
Other sponsors are Ministry of Youth and Sport, Ministry of Communication and Multimedia, Malaysia Commission of Multimedia and Communication, Multimedia Development Corporation, Telekom Malaysia and Astro.
The winners of MCG would be chosen to represent Malaysia to compete in international e-sport tournaments.
However, a veteran Dota 2 player told Malaysiakini Najib's move to get their game on is backfiring as gamers feel politicians are invading their space for political mileage.
"So a lot of players reacted by expressing their displeasure to the global Dota 2 community,
"Hopefully, Dota 2 professional players will be more circumspect in the future when dealing with authoritarian regimes."

The origin of the phrase Science Fiction has some cool meaning behind it. Etymonline says the phrase was first used in 1929, which was a play off the existing term scientifiction from 1916. Digging deeper into the etymology of both science and fiction reveals deeper meanings.
Science comes from knowledge acquired by study. To have that paired up with fiction really makes an incredible oxymoron.
Having a wife who is an English teacher really helps to give feedback on my comics before they go live. In the third panel where the Worm says, “What an oxymoron! Knowledge AND fiction?!”, the comic originally said, “Pretty ironic! Two opposites together. Knowledge and fiction.” I did hesitate on using the ironic term, because it's often misused. I thought I had used ironic correctly, but my wife suggested that science fiction is more of an oxymoron. 🙂
This oxymoron by itself felt like it was enough for a webcomic, but there wasn't much of a pun. I'm trying to make the Spudart webcomic to not fit in the type of webcomic where there has to be a pun or joke. But it's hard to resist the expectation that people have for a webcomic to have that pun at the end.
In searching for the pun, I continued to look up the word origin second half of science fiction. Maybe there would be something funny!
The word fiction didn't really reveal all to much. Dissimulation, ruse; invention, fabrication. The invention part seemed cool, and that coolness ties back in with my original thoughts of what science fiction means–something simply cool.
I rather like that rhythm in the comic of starting with something simple like an observation. Then going into the detailed research, and then coming back circle to the the simple observation. This pattern ties up the experience many people have when learning. There's the initial curiosity. The exploration. Then the resulting circle comes back to the initial curiosity. Learning is so much fun. I love sharing this process through this Spudart comic.
To help illustrate the conversation in this comic, I designed three sci-fi posters. Therefore, today's webcomic comes with the extra bonus of three movie posters. I wanted these to be really quick posters, because I knew they would be tiny in the comic. If there ends up being a larger demand for the posters, I'll go and add more detailing and shading. They are a fun exploration of taking classic sci-fi posters and putting in the Spudart comic characters.
Each poster has a blog post explaining the original inspiration and details such as fonts and background story.
↓ Transcript Etym: When I see the word "Science fiction," I normally think it means *Totally cool*
Etym: When you look at the etymology of SCIENCE
Paper: The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia" meaning knowledge.
Worm: thus Sci-fi is Knowledge fiction. What an oxymoron! Knowledge AND fiction?!
Call-out box: Side point. Some claim Science Fiction is not an oxymoron...
Worm: ...because science and fiction aren't contradictory.
Worm: They say the double noun construction in Science Fiction may allow for the first noun to qualify the second noun—effectively making the phrase Scientific Fiction.
Worm: Implying that science is not really science, but a quasi-science.
Worm: However, the origin of Science does mean knowledge acquired by study, not quasi-knowledge (depending on your political leanings).
Worm: Science fiction combines the technical and knowledge-driven aspects of science with the imaginative and creative aspects of literature.*
Etym: Preach it, Worm--
Etym: and when you look at the etymology of "fiction"
Paper: "fiction" comes from Old French ficcion meaning dissimulation, invention, fabrication
Worm: thus Sci-fi is Knowledge invention. Which means *Totally cool*
Let me begin by being clear about the oil sector in Canada and who is running the show.
Canada's energy strategy is determined in the boardrooms of a handful of multinational corporations and by the governments of foreign countries through their state-owned oil companies.
The strategy is communicated to the federal and provincial governments through closed-door meetings with lobbyists and at state dinners over dessert in foreign countries.
It is supported by legislative changes that reduce environmental protection and public participation.
Five multinational oil companies control 78% of current oil sands production. These companies are Suncor, Imperial Oil (whose parent is Exxon Mobile), Shell, Canadian Natural Resources and Cenovus.
And new, primarily state owned companies, such as Norway's Statoil, and China's Sinopec, Petro China and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC), that recently purchased Nexen.
Harper: doing what's best for big oil
So what is big oil's plan for us?
They want to rapidly extract oil sands heavy crude called bitumen, mix it with imported diluent to allow it to flow through pipelines and export it as diluted bitumen to the US Gulf Coast along Keystone XL and to Asia along Northern Gateway and TransMountain's twin.
This wasn't always the plan. As recently as 2008 Alberta's multinational oil producers planned to invest in upgrading and refining here in Canada ensuring the oil sector grew along with the extraction of raw resources.
These projects would have taken Alberta's already strong downstream activity up a notch, stabilized the industry and securely established a domestic value-added supply chain.
When running for re-election in 2008, Prime Minister Harper promised that bitumen would not be exported to Asia but would be upgraded to Synthetic Crude Oil because of the value added benefits, meaningful job creation and control over environmental standards upgrading represents.
Their government continued to publicly support upgrading oil in Canada right up until Enbridge filed its application for Northern Gateway.
But Harper's promises obviously did not concern big oil.
Exporting raw bitumen is not good for Alberta's value added, and it's not good for the environment—it's only good for a handful of very large companies. And these companies got their way.
Economy vs. environment, the false trade-off
The oil sector has set up a fairy tale of woe.
It has attempted to create a fear in uniformed Canadians that if we don't hurry up and approve these bitumen export pipelines, economic opportunities will be lost.
They want to avoid transparency and accountability by having us focus on a false dichotomy.
These oil pipelines are not a competition between economic gain versus environmental, cultural and social cost—this is a fabricated trade-off developed by oil interests to pit ordinary Canadians against ordinary Canadians.

A painting depicting Nelson Mandela as a corpse undergoing dissection has provoked disgust and been compared to witchcraft by the African National Congress.
The artwork is a parody of Rembrandt's 17th-century masterpiece The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp. It shows Mandela lying in a loincloth while Nkosi Johnson, an Aids activist who died aged 12, points to their arm stripped of flesh. The spectators include archbishop Desmond Tutu and politicians FW de Klerk, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma.
The artist, Yiull Damaso, argues South Africa must confront a subject that remains almost taboo: the future death of Mandela.
Now frail and in retirement, the country's first black president turns 92 later this month. The painting has the same name as Rembrandt's and has been on display for two days at the Orpheo Twins store in Johannesburg's Hyde Park shopping centre. Its reproduction on the front page of this newspaper's edition on Friday provoked a furious response from the ruling party.
“The ANC is appalled and strongly condemns in the strongest possible terms the dead Mandela painting by Yiull Damaso,” said Jackson Mthembu, a party spokesperson. “It is in bad taste, disrespectful, and it is an insult and an affront to values of our society.
“In African society it is a foreign act of ubuthakathi [bewitch] to kill a living person and this so-called work of art ... is also racist. It goes further by violating Tat' uMandela's dignity by stripping them naked in the glare of curious onlookers, some of whom have seen their apartheid ideals die before them.”
Mthembu added that Mandela was an international icon who should be cherished and respected. “That is why we are more shocked and disgusted this so-called art that depicts a dead Madiba.
“Why would anyone dream of a dead Madiba? Why would newspapers including the Mail and Guardian put to prominence this work of rubbish in their publication? Why would a respected public space and business site, Hyde Park, be a home for the creation of such insulting work to our icon, our leaders and all of us?”
But Damaso (41) from Johannesburg, is unrepentant, insisting that they are using the image to convey a political argument.
“The idea just popped up in my head,” they said. “We have Nelson Mandela, one of the great leaders of our time, and the politicians around them are trying to find out what makes them a great man. Nkosi Johnson, the only one in the painting who's no longer alive, is trying to show them that Mandela is just a man. So they should stop searching and get on with building the country.”
Damaso—who caused controversy a decade ago by depicting Mandela with dreadlocks—said they had received a phone call from a friend of the family claiming one of Mandela's daughters was distraught after seeing the image. But they insisted: “I knew the family would not be happy but I hope they will listen to my side of the story and my huge admiration for Nelson Mandela. I'm trying to convey a message to politicians.” Damaso, whose own grandmother died two weeks ago, added: “The death of Nelson Mandela is something we're going to have to face, not only as a family but all of us as individuals and as a nation.”
The Nelson Mandela Foundation declined to comment.
‘Despicable'
The Congress of South African Trade Unions also expressed outrage.
“It is despicable that the artist, and the Mail & Guardian who published it, should exploit our icon's image to produce a painting which they must have known would provoke an angry reaction and thus increase its profitability in the sale room,” said spokesperson Patrick Craven in a statement.
Cosatu called for it to be removed from public view.
The mall's marketing manager Nicola van Kan said while they felt the painting was controversial, they supported the freedom of expression and art.
“He [Damaso] explained the piece and we were happy with that.”
M&G deputy editor Rapule Tabane said the artist was grappling with the state of the country's current politics, and the meaning of Mandela in that context.
“You might say that it asks the question ‘what killed the special spirit that Madiba brought to our national life?',” they wrote in an SMS to the South African Press Association.
“It should not be seen as a reflection on or anticipation of the literal death of Madiba as a person, but as a inquiry into the state of the nation and its iconography.
“That is the kind of work artists do all the time. We draw no conclusions as to whether this painting is good art or not, but we believed there was a story to report, and that to do so without reproducing the image made no sense under the circumstances.” - guardian.co.uk
Kylie Jenner is reportedly pregnant, with sources close to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star saying they are expecting a child with their rapper boyfriend.
A new report from In Touch Weekly claims that Kylie and boyfriend Tyga have been getting very serious, and that sources claim the 17-year-old may be pregnant.
Kylie is eight years younger than Tyga, who is 25. This has many fingers pointing to mom Kris Jenner, who is famously involved in their daughters' reality television careers.
Celeb Dirty Laundry noted:
“Of course, blaming the lack of parental supervision is normal when 17-year-olds get pregnant, but in this case, it's completely justified. Not only has Kris Jenner actively encouraged Kylie to date Tyga and other famous musicians and celebrities, but she's been completely AWOL when Kylie has been jet-setting around the world with their 8-years-older boyfriend. What mother would let their still-teenage daughter go around with their 25-year-old boyfriend without any form of adult supervision?”
This is not the first time the rumors have circulated that Kylie Jenner is pregnant. A similar report emerged last month, prompting Kylie to take to social media to dispel the rumors.
“I'm not trying to become a rapper, I'm not getting married, & I'm not pregnant…” they tweeted.
That speculation was prompted when Kylie was photographed visiting their family's gynecologist.
While Kris Jenner may not have commented on the rumors that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, they are reportedly trying to take some action.
“Kris is furious about the baby news,” a source told In Touch. “She was screaming, telling Kylie they were going to kill them and that they should have never let this happen.”
“Kris tried to ban them [in December] from dating Tyga,” the insider claimed. “Kylie told them to mind their own business, and Kylie has barely spoken to them since. They pretty much ran away from home. Although they say they live with Khloe now, they really spends most every night at Tyga's house.”
Radar Online reported that Kylie's family has also tried to have their end things with Tyga, and even Kylie's famous older sisters have joined the cause. Said a source, “Kourtney and Khloe are doing everything they can to keep them from him.”
Kylie Jenner themselves has not commented on the reports that they are pregnant.

Earlier this week Rich Homie Quan revealed that he's lined up a Drake feature for their upcoming debut album, which they promise will drop before 2014 is over. We also had a chance to catch up with the Homie while they were on the "Under The Influence" tour, where they expanded some more on their album's features, among other things.
After revealing three things that make them feel some "Type Of Way" (he listed: "A sexy girl","A lame ass nigga hatin'" and "getting that [platinum] plaque [for "My Niggas"]"), Rich Homie broke down a few of their lyrics, and then it was on to album talk.
"Album will be a classic, I will be dropping the album this year," the ATLien says. "You can expect Drake on my album, you can expect Boosie on my album, you can expect Thug on there, you can expect Wayne. I gotta get Nicki on there, I gotta get Big Sean on there. A lot of these my idols, people I looked up to coming into the game."
What other features would you like to see on their debut? Watch the full interview below. Peep our last "Under The Influence" interview with the headliner Wiz Khalifahere.
WASHINGTON (January 25, 2017)—Reports that the Trump administration has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to remove its web content on climate change, and that scientific work will need to be vetted by political staff before release, are the latest possible signs that the administration could target science and clamp down on public access to information. As of this morning, epa.gov/climatechange was still up, but an administration spokesperson confirmed that EPA scientists must vet their research before sharing it publicly.
Sidelining or suppressing climate science is an abuse of power, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Below is a statement by Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
“This is not how a democracy should work.
“Demands to shut down informational websites and prevent the release of scientific findings are straight out of Orwell. We don't live in a world of ‘alternative facts' – you can't delete climate change and you can't overrule the laws of physics by preventing scientists from talking about them.
“Climate change is real. Its effects are visible today, and its causes are known. Trying to hide that information from the public doesn't change it—it just makes it harder to work towards solutions, putting communities and generations to come at risk.
“It's simple: Public servants should be free to state simple scientific facts. Americans have the right to see and benefit from taxpayer-funded research, and scientists have the right to share their findings openly and honestly, without political pressure, manipulation or suppression. Political staff should never be in charge of deciding what scientific conclusions are acceptable for public consumption.
“The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will likely be voting next week on whether to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator. They need to get a clear answer whether Pruitt was aware of these actions and approved of them—and whether he'll actually enforce the EPA's scientific integrity policy. If Pruitt doesn't commit to honestly presenting scientific information and defending the rights of government scientists to do their work unimpeded, that's all the more reason to vote no on their nomination.
“President Trump and their representatives in the EPA and other agencies are accountable to the public interest, and the scientific community will continue to expose and resist abuses like these.”
Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, was reprimanded for a tweet attacking Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.). (Brian Snyder/Reuters)
White House social-media director Dan Scavino Jr. violated a federal law that bars public officials from using their positions for political activity when they urged President Trump's supporters to defeat a GOP member of congress, the Office of Special Counsel has concluded.
As a result, Scavino was issued a warning letter and advised that additional violations of the law could result in further action, according to a June 5 letter that the office sent to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which filed a complaint about Scavino's tweet.
Scavino's April 1 message called on the “#TrumpTrain” to take out Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) in an upcoming primary, referring to them as “a big liability.” Amash is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group that Trump had blamed at the time for derailing legislation that would have repealed parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
Even though Scavino was tweeting from their personal account, their page at the time listed their official White House position and featured a photo of them inside the Oval Office.
[White House social-media director misused official position by going after GOP lawmaker, ethics experts say]
The Office of Special Counsel concluded that their tweet violated the Hatch Act, which restricts government employees from attempting to influence an election through their official authority.
“Mr. Scavino has been advised that if in the future they engage in prohibited political activity while employed in a position covered by the Hatch Act, we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law, which could result in further action,” Ana Galindo-Marrone, chief of the office's Hatch Act Unit, wrote in a letter to CREW.
Federal employees who willfully violate the Hatch Act can be removed from their positions or barred from federal employment for up to five years.
CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement that the rules make clear that “government officials aren't allowed to use their position for campaign activity.”
“OSC has made clear with this ruling that they are going to enforce these important rules and work to keep the government free from inappropriate politics,” they said.
Neither Scavino nor other White House officials immediately responded to requests for comment.
In April, a White House official had said that Scavino's tweet did not violate the Hatch Act, “as it clearly comes from their personal account and not their official White House account.”
But after complaints about their tweet attacking Amash, Scavino quickly altered details on their personal Twitter page, removing the reference to their current post at the White House and photos of Trump supporters at a rally holding signs. Later, they also removed a reference noting that they were director of social media for Trump's campaign.
Scavino's personal account now features a photo of them golfing, with the simple bio: “Personal Twitter Handle! I will be back.”

Washington Junior High student Tanner Wigand moved slowly and deliberately, a small crucible of molten metal grasped tightly as they moved to pour the liquid-tin into a mold made by a fellow student.
The liquid oozed from the container as Wigand poured, filling a sand-mold made by a classmate before cooling into the shape of a starfish.
"The beauty of the casting process is, however complex you can make that shape, the liquid will fill it," Kevin Fleischmann, an education from the American Foundry Society, told the students. "That's why we can make shapes in the casting process that you can't make in any other manufacturing process."
The students in Jeff Koch's metals technology class at Washington learned how to pour molten metal and create molds as an introduction to careers in the metal-casting industry. Students at Wilson Junior High also took part in the program, called Foundry in a Box.
Eck Industries, a Manitowoc-based aluminum foundry which specializes in casting parts for airplane engines, military vehicles, and hybrid engines, sponsored the program in Manitowoc schools. Employees and staff at the business raised funds as a way to honor the second-generation owner of the company, Robert Eck, who died Sept. 1.
"What happened is the chairperson of our company passed away, and the the employees and staff had a collection in order to sponsor Foundry in a Box in local schools," said David Weiss, vice president of engineering and research and development at Eck Industries. "Robert Eck was our chairperson, and they would have wanted that to be done. We thought we would do something to honor them for all their years in the foundry industry."
Students used casting kits to create their own tin castings by pressing an oil-based molding sand into a small match-plate mold, melting tin in a microwave oven, and pouring the molten metal into the mold.
"When you have a positive on the plate and pack sand around it, you take the pattern out and you have a negative in the sand," Fleischmann explained to the students. "Basically the pattern creates the pattern in the sand. We fill that space with liquid metal."
Students created tin starfish, arrowheads, and lizards using the molds.
Sparking an interest
The goal of Foundry in a Box is to educate students on the metal casting industry and instill an interest in metal casting careers.
"A lot of people are not familiar with metal casting. This region has a lot of metal casting jobs. We are looking for employees," Weiss said. "We want to make people aware of what the possibilities are in metal casting and familiarize people with manufacturing."
There are slightly less than 2,000 metal casting businesses in the United States, according to Leo Baran, the American Foundry Society director of membership services. Many are small, privately owned companies like Eck Industries, which employs 225 — and the industry is facing a shortage of skilled workers.
"The metal casting industry has gone through some hard times in this country," Weiss said. "It is coming back in a big way. We're looking for more and more employees to do all the jobs."

The troubles of Rep. Todd Akin, Republican candidate for the senate in Missouri, derive from their absolute opposition to abortion, even in cases where a mother's life is in danger or in cases of incest and rape.
The ‘personhood' bill they co-sponsored with Paul Ryan would have had the effect of making all abortions for any reason illegal. That bill spoke of ‘forced rape,' which Akin says is what they meant when they spoke of ‘legitimate rape.'
On the impermissibility of abortion in case of rape, ironically enough Akin's position is the same as the leading authorities of Sunni Islam in Egypt. Yes, Akin is upholding . . . shariah (or at least one strain of thought within shariah). But even fundamentalist Muslims would disagree with them about forbidding abortion where the mother's health was at issue, and most Muslims are more open-minded about abortion and when life begins than they are.
The right wing of the Republican Party (increasingly all that exists of the Republican Party) has a general problem of starting with its platform and reasoning back from it to a premise from which it would follow, no matter how absurd and fantastical the premise.
So, the GOP knows it supports Big Oil. Since burning petroleum puts carbon dioxide in the air, which causes global climate change and potentially great harm, Republicans should rethink their partisanship for oil, coal and natural gas. Instead, they deny that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect and climate change.
Likewise, Akin started from a premise that a fertilized egg is a legal person, and that abortion is always forbidden. Presented with the conundrum of whether a woman should be made to bear the child of their rapist, they tried to deny that women can get pregnant from rape. Actually, on the order of 32,000 American women get pregnant that way every year. Akin's position, and their reasoning, are common among Republican representatives and senators today.
Akin is the son of a clergyman, and is an engineer, and they have a divinity degree from an evangelical seminary in St. Louis. They want to socially engineer us all, to and impose on us their invented tradition of Christianity (real, historical Christianity was diverse in its attitude toward abortion over the centuries; St. Augustine, e.g., allowed it because they believed that the embryo did not receive a soul until weeks into its development. Belief that there is no baby until the ‘quickening' has been widespread.)
Many politicized evangelicals in the United States have led a bizarre charge against Muslim law (sharia) being recognized by the courts here.
They are shameless, however, in wanting to impose on all Americans the Christian version of sharia. If they don't believe in abortion, why don't they just not have one? Why are they busybodies, wanting to make laws for the rest of us?
Ironically, sharia has historically often been a flexible tradition. The shariah that some evangelicals are so stridently warning us about looks more like St. Augustine than like Todd Akin.
Muslim authorities hold that the embryo does not receive a soul until 120 days into the pregnancy. Although Muslim clergymen have tended to consider all abortions a sin, they have often been willing to see it as an understandable sin for which there should be no punishment, as long as it takes place in the first 119 days. Almost all Muslim authorities allow abortion where the mother's life is in danger. Some permit it in case of rape or incest.
The contemporary Shi'ite Muslim clerics often permit abortion under certain specific circumstances. Supreme Leader Ali Khameneih allows abortion where the fetus has an incurable and debilitating disease. Ayatollah Yusuf Sanei in Iran has even given a ruling that dire poverty might excuse an abortion.
On the other hand, it may be that the Catholic and evangelical positions on abortion being absolutely forbidden have had an effect on contemporary Muslim jurists. Egypt, for instance, prohibits abortion, and the prestigious al-Azhar seminary in Egypt (a thought leader for Sunni Muslims) in 2008 issued a ruling condemning abortion even in case of rape. (The ruling is advisory, not binding on the secular Egyptian judiciary). Strident Salafi interpretations of the law are also increasingly common, and a departure from broad-minded Sunni rationalism.
Todd Akin and Paul Ryan, in other words, hold the same position on rape and abortion as the leading shariah authority in Egypt.
The popular preacher Yusuf Qaradawi also opposes abortion under all circumstances, but they admit that other authorities disagree with him, and they entertain the possibility that rape may justify an exception to the prohibition.
Thus, on the issue of abortion, the same range of views exists as in Christianity. But the absolutism of Akin's evangelical position, on the personhood of the fertilized egg and on the absolute prohibition of abortion under any circumstances, on pain of legal punishment, seems not to have a parallel in Muslim thought about shariah.
In other words, the bogey man with which some evangelicals are trying to scare Americans, of shariah, turns out to be a far more rich, elastic and forgiving tradition than their own sometimes is.
In the British legal tradition, precedent and custom are considered to have legal weight in deciding cases. It doesn't really matter where the precedent occurred, if it is thought relevant. Thus, the US Supreme Court justices have often cited the decisions of courts abroad, including the Indian Supreme Court. India's courts have repaid the compliment, being in the same British tradition.
So, actually American courts considering a divorce case between two Muslim spouses might well refer to Muslim law in making their judgment. The same is true for Christian and Jewish customs relevant to a dispute. The law is not religious in itself, but religion can come into it by virtue of having been incorporated into customary practice. The anti-Shariah movement could end up undermining the minority rights of Catholics and Jews, as well.
There is substantially less likelihood (of course!) that American courts and legislatures will impose Muslim shariah on us all, however, than that Akin and their soul-mate, Paul Ryan, will find a way to put us in their straightjacket of Christian fundamentalist shariah.
And it turns out that given its humane traditions, the wide range of positions its jurists have taken, and the lack of centralized religious authority in the Sunni branch, at least, Islamic law is often more tolerant and supple than the fundamentalist Christian equivalent. And, at least it spares us the illogic and inhumanity of the personhood of the cytoblast. But the most hard line Muslim legal positions sometimes approximate those of Paul Ryan and Todd Akin. They are our Salafis.

Wood. What would we do without it? Besides the basic essentials of life – water, air, food, Kardasians; one could make an argument that the most important substance to our very existence on this planet is wood. After all, what would the ancient cave men burned once they discovered fire? And what would maritimers of old build their ships from? What would the second little pig have built their house out of? What kind of nickle would we have ended up being warned not to take?
No, wood in its various uses is like sign posts for the evolution of the human species. There isn't an aspect of our lives that it doesn't touch, or hasn't touched in the past, only to make way for more modern, practical human-made substances. We build our shelters out of it, use a form of it in daily correspondence, and make sporting equipment, musical instruments and hell, just about everything out of it. It seasons our food (cinnamon), is an essential part of Tabasco and Balsamic vinegar production, and of course puts the cue in barbecue.
So it should be no surprise that along the way it's become an integral part of the production of alcoholic beverages, including bourbon, scotch, sherry, brandy, port and of course wine. But beer is not to be left out of this company. Storing, aging and serving beer in wooden barrels was common before the advent of metal kegs.
Of course as stainless steel became more available and more practical, wood began to take a back seat in the beer world. But modern brewers have a strong sense of tradition about them and so many have begun to look at wood again and the awesome influence it can have on their beers.
Dogfish Head is no stranger to the marriage of wood and beer, producing several that are aged in one type of wood or another. The one I want to look at today is Palo Santo Marron. Let's Taste.
Dogfish Head Brewing, Palo Santo Marron, $14.99, 4-pack
THEM: PSM is an unfiltered brown ale. That's pretty much it. There isn't a lot else said about it, or to say about it. Twelve-percent ABV, 50IBUs.
But the real story behind PSM isn't in the grain bill or hop schedule anyway, it's in the wooden 10,000 gallon tanks that it ages in. Of course Sam does nothing conventional so you can expect that this isn't just any old wooden barrel. No, the barrel is made out of Paraguayan Palo Santo wood that is more commonly used by some South American winemakers. Palo Santo (which in Spanish means “Holy Wood”) refers to Lignum vitae a trade wood from the genus Guaiacum, or either Bulnesia sarmientoi or Bursera graveolens.
Santo Palo wood is known for its density and is used in many hard wood applications such a construction, cricket bats, and, mortar and pestles. In one telling of the Arthur Tale, Merlin's wand was made out of Lignum vitae because it was believed to have magical powers.
The wood is credited for the “caramel and vanilla complexity unique to this beer”.
But the wood isn't all, the 10,000 gallon tanks (which stands fifteen feet high and measures ten feet in diameter) was the largest wooden barrel produced in the US since prohibition. DFH currently has two other tanks of the same size sitting next to it, both manufactured from oak.
Marron? Well according to my research, it's either a species of crayfish, or a French description of a certain variety of chestnut. Knowing Sam, it might just go either way.
ME: I'd love to try this beer without the wood aging because I think it would be an excellent comparison to demonstrate what the Palo Santo wood is bringing to the party. First, there's an ever so slight roast in the nose, and the slightly darker than tan color of the head is definitely influenced by dark grains. I'm also getting touches of caramel, chocolate and a light spice in there as well. The flavor is owwww so smooth in the front with an amazingly silky mouth feel delivering caramel, chocolate, a nondescript woodiness, vanilla and perhaps a touch of coffee . For all the flavor in the front, the back is surprisingly clean with just a little stickiness left coating the mouth and not a whole of bitter. I can sense the booze in this. It comes at the end like the lingering reminder of a shot or sip of bourbon. Especially when you burp. Maybe 12%ABV is a little too much to ask of this beer to hide. You wouldn't think so though, because this isn't any mamby-pamby beer. It's packed with all kinds of things that your mother told you were good for you. Ok, maybe not, but they SHOULD have.
I'll admit I ended up liking this one a lot more than I thought I would. I liked the smell, and loved the flavor and mouth feel, but the alcohol on the back end made it finish a little harsh for me in the beginning (I got used to it). Still, not a bad beer. Let's give it a 4-PACK, although I have no doubt some of you out there will really enjoy this one.
Time for another beer….

UAB Cannabidiol Program
Overview
The UAB Epilepsy Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham will be conducting a study of cannabidiol, or CBD, in children and adults with severe seizure disorders that are not controlled by existing treatments. CBD is a plant-based supplement derived from the cannabis plant. It is a light, oily liquid that will be delivered orally. All those enrolled in the study will receive CBD.
Access to the program
If you are interested in being considered for the UAB CBD Adult or Pediatric Programs, you will need to submit a cover letter checklist, referral letter from your primary treating neurologist, and the medical record information included in these instructions. The letter should state your primary treating neurologist's referral for you to be treated in the CBD study. Templates of the cover letter checklist and primary treating neurologist referral letter are available through the links at the bottom of this page. A printable copy of these instructions is also included in the links at the bottom.
You will need to have your medical history/records mailed with the cover letter checklist, and referral letter from your primary treating neurologist. The medical records should include, at the very least, the following information:
Report of most recent Brain MRI (Include date of MRI report)
Report of most recent Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Include date of ECG report)
Report of video/EEG monitoring confirming the diagnosis of epilepsy,
Digital copy of a routine EEG along with the formal written report performed within 3 months prior to submitting these records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review,
Documentation of failed AEDs, including one trial of a combination of two concomitant AEDs, without successful seizure control.
Documentation of between 1-4 baseline anti-epileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to submitting these records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review.
Current Medication List
If applicable, documentation of VNS or RNS implantation and evidence that settings have not been adjusted within 3 months prior to submitting these records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review,
If applicable, provide report of Corpus Callostomy or other prior epilepsy surgery (Include the date of the surgery).
If on ketogenic diet, documentation that you have been on stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months.
Documentation indicating seizure type(s), and number of seizures of each type per month
Documentation of seizure calendar for at least 3 months prior to submitting these records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review; the patient will need to provide an updated calendar at the time of enrollment.
Results of routine laboratory studies, including but not limited to CBC, CMP, LFTs, renal panel, UA, and levels of all AEDs within 3 months prior to submitting these records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review. If any AED dose was adjusted within 3 months prior to submitting these records for review by the CBD Treatment Approval Committee, level on the new dose will need to be provided.
Results of any metabolic or genetic testing that have been completed, including any laboratory diagnostic genetic testing that have confirmed the diagnosis for the epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, etc.)
If your referring neurologist has any questions, please have them call the Program Manager at 205-975-8883.
**Please note, you have to contact your current treating neurologist to obtain this documentation and you or your referring neurologist are responsible for getting this information to the CBD Program Manager for review.**
Instructions for Submitting Documentation/Proof of Alabama Residency

First it starts with a 5K. Next thing you know your child has moved onto a 10K, then a half marathon, then even a full marathon. Spending hours every week feeding this disgusting habit. And by disgusting I mean nipple chafing and foot blisters.
Why do people run? In our last episode we talked about the health benefits of running, which I'm pretty certain a lot of people probably run for that reason, maybe even exclusively, or at least get started for health reasons — but MAYBE lots of people also run because… well… they get high.
What do we conclude?
It seems pretty clear that you can get high from running. Now, whether this is relatively mild changes in pain perception, or slightly elevated mood following running, or getting outright blitzed mid-run seems to vary between runners, but it's good to know at least the mild form is repeatable! We still don't really know the mechanisms–there might be endorphins, but that's a hard thing to be sure of. Endocannabinoids seem like a pretty likely candidate too, but the case is far from settled! The best evidence we have suggests that a 30 minute run at 70-80% of your maximum heart rate (not too fast!) seems to make most runners feel good.
Smoking pot recreationally before running doesn't seem to have the negative effects you might think it does–since it's a bronchodilator. But since it also increases heart rate, it doesn't seem like it would be helpful to smoke up pre race (maybe just for a training run). Whether or not pot is a performance enhancing drug is still being sorted out, but there's no blaring sign that you *shouldn't* occasionally smoke up before running if it's legal in your jurisdiction. Just take ‘er easy.

"Automatically electronic trading kicks in and they don't know the difference between a fictitious story and the truth and immediately started to buy and took us right back to the day's highs." More than 180,000 front month 10-year Treasury futures contacts traded in the period between 1:09 and 1:12 p.m. ET (1709 to 1712 GMT). US stocks sharply cut gains briefly and then bounced back. The dollar pared gains against the yen, and the euro extended declines against the dollar. In the energy market, crude oil prices fell as much as 70 cents a barrel in a three-minute period following the tweet, but just as quickly reversed those losses as it became clear the AP message was false. US gold futures spiked by more than $US5 an ounce, or 0.4 per cent, immediately after the tweet, but by five minutes later were trading lower.
Shortly after it became clear that the AP tweet was bogus, global equity markets resumed their upward trend, with Wall Street higher on strong corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 127.41 points, or 0.87 per cent, at 14,694.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 13.95 points, or 0.89 per cent, at 1,576.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 30.05 points, or 0.93 per cent, at 3,263.61. European shares posted their biggest one-day gain in seven months, while the euro hit a two-week low against the dollar after weak German data sparked speculation the European Central Bank could cut interest rates. The euro fell as low as $US1.2971 and market watchers say it may break decisively out of the $US1.30-to-$US1.32 range that has held for the past few weeks. It was last trading 0.5 per cent lower on the day at $US1.3000. MSCI's world equity index, which is heavily weighted toward US shares, was up 1 per cent.
The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was unchanged with the yield at 1.6945 per cent. Twitter flash crash Reuters data shows that the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 14.6 points, or 0.93 per cent, in the space of three minutes when news of the tweet hit the market. With the S&P valued at roughly $US14.6 trillion at the moment of the false tweet, that three-minute plunge briefly wiped out $US136.5 billion of the index's value. "We see this every time this type of news comes out: liquidity evaporates quickly. High-frequency traders cancel their orders on even one little tweet," said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. "They provide so much liquidity and don't have obligations like market makers did in the past."
Investors are also on edge following two fatal explosions last week at the Boston Marathon that led to a lockdown in Boston on Friday as police hunted for one of the suspects. Among the day's biggest gainers on Wall Street, Netflix Inc shares jumped 25 per cent to $US217.68 a day after reporting earnings that beat expectations and strong subscriber growth. Brent crude oil hovered around $US100 a barrel in choppy trading on Tuesday after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from China and Germany darkened the outlook for fuel demand. The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index for April fell to 50.5 in April from 51.6 in March as new export orders shrank in China. The PMI's 50-point level divides growth from contraction. The data followed lower-than-expected GDP growth for China in the first quarter which helped spark a sharp sell-off last week.
Loading June Brent crude fell by more than $US1.50 but recovered to trade up 5 cents at $US100.44 a barrel by 2:06 p.m. (1806 GMT). US crude for June delivery was down 3 cents at $US89.16. Reuters
Why it's so hard for women to get justice for online abuse
Updated
Late last year, two young women went to their local police station in Sydney after they were threatened with rape. The police didn't know what to do.
"We're not sure we know how to prosecute this," officers reportedly told them. "These cases are hard."
It was "hard" because the abuse perpetrated against these women had happened online. A 25-year-old man, Zane Alchin, is accused of posting a screenshot of a woman's Tinder account alongside a derogatory caption.
When other, female users called them out on their cruelty, they allegedly responded with explicit and violent remarks, allegedly calling them "sluts" and referring to "the best thing about raping feminists".
But this event is not an isolated one.
According to a report by the UN Broadband Commission for Digital Development Working Group on Broadband and Gender, 73 per cent of women globally have already experienced online violence.
Cases of perpetrators facing the justice system, however, are rare. Only 5 per cent report harassment to the law enforcement system, and as internet culture writer Amanda Hess has noted, cases of online harassment against women are rarely pursued further.
Women are not taken seriously, abuse online is not seen as "real", and the path to justice is muddy within existing legislative frameworks.
'Sexual Violence Won't Be Silenced'
One of the women who went to police, along with others, have formed advocacy group Sexual Violence Won't Be Silenced (SVWBS), started a petition against harmful comments allegedly made by Alchin and the reams of similar cyberhate.
When the campaign launched and received media attention, "the responding officer was suddenly very well versed" in procedure, advocate Mariko Takedomi Karlsson said.
Alchin was later charged under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act of the offence of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence (a crime which carries a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment) after making rape threats to several women on Facebook.
When their case goes to court on March 1, the outcome could be a turning point for how instances of online harassment of women are addressed.
One of the first Australian cases which successfully prosecuted an online troll was in 2010, when a man was jailed for posting child pornography on Facebook tribute pages of dead children.
But while the law is clear on the penalties for posting such reprehensible materials online, getting justice isn't straightforward. Prosecuting online abusers is certainly an option under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act.
Reporting, prosecuting online harassment is 'incredibly difficult'
But as SVWBS points out, the lack of guidelines and procedures makes reporting, charging, and convicting online harassment incredibly difficult.
In the US, after having endured years of relentless slander and harassment online, 28-year-old video game developer Zoe Quinn recently dropped harassment charges made against the instigator, their ex-boyfriend.
Quinn was bombarded with malicious abuse, rape and death threats simply because they were a woman in a predominantly male gaming community.
But in February they dropped the charges because, they explained, it was too easy for the defence to argue they "deserved it" and that what they suffered "wasn't that bad".
Said Ms Quinn: "It's not time yet. I'm not the right person to win this fight or set this precedent... It's been a really, really long two years and I am more than a little tired."
Ms Quinn now lives with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the harassment they endured, which included a foot-high "stack of threats and photos of me that people had printed out", performed lewd acts with, "and sent to my family".
Ms Quinn's story points to the difficulties of getting justice for online harassment, as well as the increasing toxicity of many internet subcultures.
Dr Emma Jane, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, is conducting a long-term study into gendered cyberhate.
She's found the rate of online abuse against women in their studies is increasing, and is often fuelled by internet subcultures.
On anonymous bulletin boards like 4chan, misogyny is a game.
"You can watch rapey dudes competing to see who can break the largest number of taboos, elicit the largest emotional response in targets," Dr Jane told the ABC.
Many Australian women, particularly those visible in the media through their professions, live through daily threats of violence.
Last year, over 1,200 of those women spoke out by naming and shaming their trolls under the hashtag #EndViolenceAgainstWomen.
Some participants reported feeling "intimidated" or "silenced" by threats. But these feelings only emphasised the importance of finding better solutions to stamp out the abuse, and in some cases prosecute it.
In New Zealand, a 'promising response' to trolling
New Zealand has developed a promising response to the problem. Last year, the Government passed the Harmful Digital Communications Act, making it an offence to "send messages and post material online that deliberately cause serious emotional distress".
It is punishable with fines of up to $NZ50,000 ($46,000) for individuals.
Among a range of other stipulations, the Act defines an online incitement to commit suicide as an offence, as "kill yourself" and its variations are common, and dangerous, refrains from trolls. The procedures on seeking justice are swift and clear.
I suspect that gendered cyberhate is offering us a window into the sorts of conversations men have been having about women in private for a very long time. Men need to call each other out on this sort of attitude University of New South Wales senior lecturer Dr Emma A Jane
Campaigners hope the Alchin's case, if proven, would set the kind of precedent women need for safer internet use.
If they are not convicted, however, the awareness the case raises may point to solutions for managing online abuse outside the legal system.
Social media platforms, for instance, could be doing more to curb online harassment — a fact the former Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo, has acknowledged himself.
"We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years," Mr Costolo wrote in an internal memo to staff last year.
Still Twitter recently pledged to do more to tackle abuse in its network, announcing a new safety council made up of harassment experts, specialist charities and reporting features to be introduced in 2016.
Ultimately, Dr Jane says, the broader culture of misogyny needs to be addressed if we're to make the world safer for women, both online and off.
Part of this responsibility lies with men.
"I suspect that gendered cyberhate is offering us a window into the sorts of conversations men have been having about women in private for a very long time," Dr Jane says.
"Men need to call each other out on this sort of attitude."
But while increased public awareness of and advocacy for this complex issue is growing, and globally changes are afoot, Dr Jane is under no illusion that it will be an easy process, and warns women are in for a hard fight.
"This is going to be a long and difficult struggle."

• A mid-torso joint that allows them to bend their spine forward and back, it also rotates from left to right, like the waist joint.
• Their elbows and knees are double jointed, which allows free range of movement and the ability to fully crouch their legs.
• The hips can now allow the legs up and over the wasteline allowing for those very spider-like poses.
• Their ankles have a second pivot joint for extra steep ankle poses, as well of full range of motion in the main joint.
• Their feet have an articulated toe piece to make those perching poses more natural.
• I got a lot of feedback about some of my more lackluster photos of Batman, so I purchased better photo eqipment, seems to have made a difference, Thanks for the tips!
Faced with a direct challenge from Apple Music, rival Spotify will contact App Store subscribers to its Premium music service to suggest that they switch to $10/month web billing rather than $13/month iTunes billing, reports The Verge. Spotify is marketing the switch as a way for Apple users to save $3 per month on its Premium service, giving Spotify a greater ability to compete with Apple Music's $10/month offering.
Earlier this year, Spotify was said to have instigated American and European Union antitrust investigations into Apple, claiming that music labels were being pressured by Apple to end deals for free, ad-supported streaming music services ahead of Apple Music's launch as a paid service. Spotify has complained that Apple's 30% “tax” on rival services gives it an unfair advantage over competitors in the App Store.
According to the latest report, an email planned by Spotify will note that “the normal Premium price is only $9.99, but Apple charges 30 percent on all payments made through iTunes,” explaining the higher price of in-app Spotify subscriptions. The email will then offer users a tutorial on shutting off iTunes auto-renewal and transferring their accounts to Spotify's web site, including a “Happy-Go-Lucky” playlist for dancing with the “bit of extra cash in your pocket each month.” As the strategy of contacting customers outside of the App Store to offer the lower-priced subscription option is not prohibited by Apple, rdio has used a similar tactic, noting the lower web subscription price in its FAQs.

It's bad enough that drones have been welcomed by Congress into American skies, as well as already being used around the planet to conduct surveillance and bomb select countries from remote locations.
The latest proposed addition to the drone spy program is even creepier: disposable computers with software programs funded by DARPA to be dropped as self-destructing “bombs.”
Now, not only will drones surveil and hack from above, but they will drop a payload to interface with hidden computers on the ground, completely integrating a full-spectrum data transmission and control grid.
The name of the project, as well as its announcement at a hacker convention called ShmooCon, had this non-techie convinced that it had to be satire or a hoax, but the project has also been noted by Forbes and Wired, which only serves to illustrate how far off into our dystopian technocratic police state we have wandered. It seems that we are being acclimated to how funny and cool our futuristic spy toys have become. This fun has culminated in the planned dropping of F-BOMBS (Falling or Ballistically-launched Object that Makes Backdoors) to combat “Bad Men With Guns.”
The F-BOMB introduces the idea of disposable surveillance as a guard against forensic evaluation and the ability to track the source of the drop. Creator, Brendan O'Connor, has received DARPA funding to implement a software package into their nearly non-traceable surveillance hardware as cheaply as possible with easy-to-obtain components.
Back in August, another DIY project was introduced as the Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform (since renamed Project Vespid). This modified military drone was put together from parts legally obtained on the Internet by two hackers (intelligence agency consultants, actually) Rich Perkins and Mike Tassey, who presented their work at a Black Hat conference. The release was supported by a breathless Wolf Blitzer who seized upon the announcement to illustrate the new threat of being hacked from above. Brendan O'Connor has reduced the DIY cost of similar capabilities to no more than a few hundred dollars with their F-BOMB project.
O'Connor summarizes the value and capabilities of their new Sacrificial Computing for Land and Sky concept in the video that follows, highlighting that their surveillance tool can be planted manually, or dropped from specialized drone aircraft:

Similar to the creators of the home-made WASP hacking drone, O'Connor states that they are merely exposing the vulnerabilities of networks and their users.
Despite its name, O'Connor says the F-BOMB is designed to be a platform for all sorts of applications on its Linux operating system. Outfit it with temperature or humidity sensors, for instance, and it can be used for meteorological research or other innocent data-collecting. But install some Wifi-cracking software or add a $15 GPS module, and it can snoop on data networks or track a target's location, O'Connor adds. As is often the case with these kinds of hacker projects, they say the devices are only intended for penetration testing–finding security flaws in clients' networks in order to fix them–and wouldn't comment on what DARPA might do with the technology (Source)
However, this rings false (or profoundly naive), as O'Connor also has received their funding from the very organization that is at the forefront of using taxpayer money to eradicate privacy around the world, including that of American citizens. As a result, the government already can:
Hack your personal information (source)
Monitor your private phone calls (source)
Read your private e-mails (source)
Spoof cell phone towers (source)
Break down firewalls (source)
Jam cellular frequencies causing denial of service (source)
Disrupt and manipulate Wi-Fi signals (source)
Track your every move (source)
Although O'Connor said that they wouldn't comment on what DARPA might do with the technology, their own business website Malice Afterthought indicates a solid working relationship with military intelligence:
Our principal, Brendan O'Connor, has taught at the US military's cybersecurity school as well as working for both VeriSign and Sun Microsystems in their security divisions; they have also worked for DARPA and startups as a combination engineer, dreamer, and mad scientist capable of making even the most challenging tasks into reality.
We should all know by now that we don't have to be technology experts to envision some rather dark applications that are no longer security challenges, but are part of an agenda to fundamentally alter our reality and perceived social contract within a supposedly free society. That reality has little to do with protecting citizens' data and privacy, and everything to do with covering the tracks of government's ubiquitous intrusion into our private lives, as well as ramping-up their violation of the Constitution by presuming guilt over innocence, and subjecting citizens to their mad science and mad dreams.

A professor at the University of California, Berkeley has apologized for sharing Twitter memes that the university said “crossed the line” into anti-Semitism.
Hatem Bazian, a lecturer in the department of ethnic studies, retweeted a status with two offending images. One showed an Orthodox Jewish man smiling and raising their arms above the caption: “I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs & steal the land of Palestinians.” The other showed North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un wearing a kippah, saying that they had converted to Judaism with the caption: “Donald Tlump: Now my nukes are legal & I can annex South Korea & you need to start paying me 34 billion a year in welfare.”
Bazian told J., the Jewish News of Northern California that they had not carefully examined the text of the tweet before retweeting it while traveling. “As a Palestinian, my issue is with Zionism … and not with Judaism or Jews,” they added.
“The image in the tweet and the framing relative to Judaism and conversion was wrong and offensive and not something that reflects my position, be it in the past or the present,” Bazian told J. “In the future, I will make sure to include that retweets don't represent an agreement or support for the ideas that are shared and only my own postings reflect my positions on issues.”
University spokesperson Dan Mogulof criticized Bazian for the tweet.
“While we do not believe that all criticism of Israel's governmental policies is inherently anti-Semitic, the social media posts in question clearly crossed the line, and we are pleased they have been deleted,” Mogulof said.
(As of Sunday, the retweet is still up.)
As a graduate student, Bazian co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine, the leading pro-Palestinian campus group.
Bazian drew controversy for an anti-Israel protest they led as a graduate student in 2002, when they asked Berkeley students to “to take a look at the type of names on the building around campus — Haas, Zellerbach — and decide who controls this university.”

Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.
The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members.
Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel.
Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense.
The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011.
How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court
A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012.
Image copyright AP Image caption Angry small investors harangued the accused outside the court
The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank.
Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way.
Taint of corruption
Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia.
If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m.
Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. They also served as Spanish economy minister, and their fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption.
Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared.
Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases.
French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend themselves against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him.
In a separate case last year, they were acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when they were finance minister.  They are accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.
Amazon pulled a controversial Halloween costume from its U.K. site after receiving criticism that the outfit was insensitive to transgender people. (Photo11: Twitter screenshot)
Amazon pulled a controversial Halloween costume from its U.K. site after receiving criticism that the outfit was insensitive to transgender people.
The "Lady Boy Drag" Halloween outfit was available on Amazon and eBay's website in the U.K. earlier this week, Cosmopolitan reported, citing PinkNews, a gay news service in Britain.
The costume was comprised of a clingy sequin dress with male genitalia sewn to the front and was sold by a company called Orion Costumes, according to Cosmopolitan.
A black wig and inflatable breast could be purchased separately to complete the "tastelessly brilliant" look, according to the Amazon ad.
Reviewers and people on social media slammed the outfit and questioned why Amazon decided to list the product.
The costume is no longer available on Amazon, and a link to a version sold on eBay is no longer active.
"All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account," said a statement from an Amazon U.K. press representative, which was sent to The Huffington Post on Tuesday. "The product in question is no longer available."

There is a need to increase privacy in bitcoin transactions. So says Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell disclosed some methods to improve the privacy in their recent post on GitHub.
Maxwell reminds, that the privacy and security were the issues that cause the creation of bitcoin
“The importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses) provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle. Advanced monitoring capabilities have substantially undermined this protection in practice, but at the same time technology has improved tremendously and we can now do much better than pseudonymous addresses.”
In the discussion Maxwell said that some methods are available with Bitcoin Core version 0.11.
“The idea is that a daemon could run along side your Bitcoin Core and submit your transactions via a high latency privacy network, or the like. If widely used this would greatly discourage the common practice of running spy nodes that suck up everyone's connection slots watching for TX broadcasts”
Maxwell highlighted that Bitcoin Core developers should develop new methods to defend the privacy of transactions.
“Bitcoin Core should have a comprehensive plan to give users state of the art technology in this regard, but we must respect the challenges of deploying new technology in an already existing ecosystem. Progress can be made in a series of larger and smaller initiatives” says Maxwell
The discussion on GitHub coincided with the renewals discussion on the size of bitcoin block. This spring key developer Gavin Andresen works to change bitcoin's block size to 8MB. The new block size will be introduced in 2016. And from 2016 onwards, the size is expected to double every two years.
The new size of the block caused lengthy discussions on Reddit. Some people are worried that the new size of the block will delegate more power to the bitcoin mining firms and will affect the privacy of transactions in a bad way.

Jan. 14, 2014: Are we there yet?
One of the fastest spacecraft ever built -- NASA's New Horizons -- is hurtling through the void at nearly one million miles per day. Launched in 2006, it has been in flight longer than some missions last, and it is nearing its destination: Pluto.
“The encounter begins next January,” says Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute and the mission's principal investigator. “We're less than a year away.”
A new ScienceCast anticipates what New Horizons might find when it reaches Pluto in 2015. Play it
Closest approach is scheduled for July 2015 when New Horizons flies only 10,000 km from Pluto, but the spacecraft will be busy long before that date. The first step, in January 2015, is an intensive campaign of photography by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager or “LORRI.” This will help mission controllers pinpoint Pluto's location, which is uncertain by a few thousand kilometers.
"LORRI will photograph the planet against known background star fields," explains Stern. "We'll use the images to refine Pluto's distance from the spacecraft, and then fire the engines to make any necessary corrections.”
At first, Pluto and its large moon Charon will be little more than distant pinpricks—“a couple of fat pixels,” says Stern--but soon they will swell into full-fledged worlds.
By late April 2015, the approaching spacecraft will be taking pictures of Pluto that surpass the best images from Hubble. By closest approach in July 2015, a whole new world will open up to the spacecraft's cameras. If New Horizons flew over Earth at the same altitude, it could see individual buildings and their shapes.
Stern is looking forward to one of the most exciting moments of the Space Age.
An artist's concept of the New Horizons spacecraft at Pluto. More
“Humankind hasn't had an experience like this--an encounter with a new planet--in a long time,” they say. “Everything we see on Pluto will be a revelation.”
They liken New Horizons to Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in July 1965. At the time, many people on Earth, even some scientists, thought the Red Planet was a relatively gentle world, with water and vegetation friendly to life. Instead, Mariner 4 revealed a desiccated wasteland of haunting beauty. New Horizons' flyby of Pluto will occur almost exactly 50 years after Mariner 4's flyby of Mars—and it could shock observers just as much.
Other than a few indistinct markings seen from afar by Hubble, Pluto's landscape is totally unexplored. Although some astronomers call Pluto a “dwarf” planet, Stern says there's nothing small about it. “If you drove a car around the equator of Pluto, the odometer would rack up almost 5,000 miles—as far as from Manhattan to Moscow.” Such a traveler might encounter icy geysers, craters, clouds, mountain ranges, rilles and valleys, alongside alien landforms no one has ever imagined.
“There is a real possibility that New Horizons will discover new moons and rings as well,” says Stern.
Yes, Pluto could have rings. Already, Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Numerical simulations show that meteoroids striking those satellites could send debris into orbit, forming a ring system that waxes and wanes over time in response to changes in bombardment.
“We're flying into the unknown,” says Stern, “and there is no telling what we might find.”

Internet and telephone services resumed in Damascus on Saturday after a three-day blackout, an AFP reporter and state news agency SANA said, as a watchdog said they were up in most parts of Syria.
“Internet is back in Damascus and in parts of Damascus province,” the correspondent said, adding that mobile phone lines were also back up.
State news agency SANA confirmed the reports, saying the outage had been due to maintenance.
“All communication lines are back up in Damascus, after maintenance works were completed,” the agency said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added that “communications lines are back in most of Syria's provinces.”
SANA resumed its wire service as soon as Internet services resumed, and the state television's website was also back up.
Several anti-regime activists went online after services resumed.
“Facebook has lit up,” said a Damascus-based opposition activist via the Internet.
Activists in Aleppo and Raqa in the north, as well as Damascus province, contacted AFP via the Internet, to confirm services had resumed.
“At the moment, Facebook is the place for Syrians to congratulate each other for having the Internet back,” a Damascus-based activist who identified themselves as Lena said via the Internet.
Activists and human rights monitors said ordinary civilians were harder hit by the blackout than the opposition as they were unable to use cell phones even to call for emergency assistance in the event of casualties from the persistent violence rocking the country.
The Syrian authorities said the interruption to normal service was purely for maintenance but Washington said the move was a deliberate ploy to impede communications among rebels and opposition activists.

If you believe that the Bible is complete and that there is no more cannon, that is ok with me. But the bible does not require it to be so. The following verses from the bible are the ones most often shown to me to prove that the bible is completed.
Can the bible be added to?
Revelation 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away their part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
The argument is that the caution in this verse is referring to the bible as we have it today and that John was anticipating the current state of affairs. This is, however, an argument from silence because nowhere in the bible does it tell us that John had this in mind. We would have to assume this was their intention. The reality is, the bible as we have it did not exist at that time and was not even being considered, so if this was their intention, no one in their audience would have understood it that way. They would only have known that they were referring to the Book of Revelation itself and not some book of books that would be put together generations in the future. Further, similar wording is found in Deuteronomy 4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
Of course, many books were added after Deuteronomy so we are left to interpret this as referring to this specific book. Besides, the warning is towards people, nothing here says that God cannot add to it. It should also be noted that there are many references to books that are no longer in existence, such as the epistle of Laodicea which Paul admonishes us to read in Colossians 4:17, and the Book of Nathan the Prophet mentioned in 2 Chronicles 9:29.
Is the bible inerrant?
Another verse that is offered is 2 Timothy 3:16-17 “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”
I find this verse is actually quite a weak endorsement of the bible, holding scriptures in rather low esteem. Even if we insist on translating inspiration of God as ‘god breathed', the fact is, the expression means to be inspired. The movie Saving Private Ryan was inspired by events of the Second World War, but this does not make the movie true or even remotely historically accurate. Many people are inspired by God, but being inspired by God does not guarantee that you will succeed or even be any good. So it was not written by God, but rather inspired by him. The scriptures are of great value, but according to 2 Timothy they do not represent the inerrant word of God.
2 Timothy also advises that scripture is profitable for doctrine. Profitable does not mean necessary. Apples are profitable for your health but you can live your entire life without eating a single apple and still be quite healthy. In fact, just because something is profitable does not make it good.Marijuana grow-ops come to mind. In the end, this verse tells us that scriptures is inspired but not necessarily accurate or even true, and is profitable but not at all necessary.
But can a book contain errors and still be of value? Of course it can. The argument is that how can we accept anything the bible says if we feel it may be translated incorrectly or have parts missing. This is a flawed argument. Clearly the bible contains a lot of wonderful teachings; the problem is we cannot make a clear determination of many of the doctrines. This false dichotomy that a bible cannot be scripture if it may have errors is a logical fallacy, making truth mutually exclusive to error. If something has an error it cannot be true. You cannot trust the drugs at a pharmacy that sells chocolate bars. So no, I am not advocating that we dismiss the bible as a pathetic jumble of nonsense; rather, I think we have to reconsider what it means to be scripture. One of the best definitions is found in 2 Peter 1:21 “for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy ghost.” Scripture, which is inspired and profitable, is anything written when a holy person is moved upon by the Holy Ghost.
And why, if the bible may contain errors, can we still have confidence in God's word?
Because God's Word is not written down. This brings us to the next verse that is used to argue that the bible is inerrant:
Doesn't the bible teach that Gods word will not pass way?
Matt 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
What is God's word? Is God's word the bible? The bible certainly contains writings of inspired people who did their best to record their understanding of Gods teachings, but every time we learn of God's word in the bible, it is always spoken, never written. For that matter, the New Testament has only a very few passages that are the words of Jesus, all the rest are the teachings of Paul, John or some other disciple. It is their interpretation of God's word. If I was to make a statement and declare that it shall not pass away, this has no bearing on how well someone else records my statement or how long this written version lasts. If the local government were to make a public announcement that a certain park is closed, the fact that no notices are sent out does not negate the park closure. Even if someone came and removed all the signs from around the park does not mean the governments statement has passed away, only that the notices advising people of their statement has gone missing. The same is true with God's word. Clearly there have been places on the earth where the bible has not gone. Much of Asia was without the bible until very recently. This lack of access did not negate Gods word.
Scripture versus Canon
A final point is the notion of canon, which being interpreted is the official documents of a religion that are revered as official and authoritative sources of doctrine. All canon is scripture, but not all scripture is canon. My journal, at least part of it, is scripture for me and my family; but it is not canon in the sense that my family can look to it as a source of doctrine. As we read in 2 Peter, that which is written by a holy person under inspiration from the Holy Ghost is scripture. Were the epistles of Paul intended to be canon? The bible does not say, but I wonder if we treat it as such simply because of tradition since Christians have called it canon for hundreds of years.
The bible can be accepted as scripture, but the bible does not require itself to be complete, nor inerrant. In the past, although prophets quoted scripture that came before them, they always had a new message that was pertinent to the times in which they taught. The Christians of the New Testament times did not have the New Testament, rather they relied on the teachings of the living 12 apostles; and at no point did the church leadership of the time declare their teachings complete. The New Testament books we have today were written decades after the church was organized. And what of the other sheep Jesus referred to in John 10:16 that they had to go teach? I suspect they also had holy men of God who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Perhaps someday they will be found and added to the bible.
At least, that is the way I see it.
Anonymous submission to Conflict Minnesota
On June 26th, anarchists and anti-fascists wearing balaclavas, communists carrying banners, liberals wearing Bernie Sanders shirts, and even a few autonomously self-organized and unaffiliated folks came together to successfully shut down the Traditionalist Worker Party and Golden State Skinheads attempted rally on the capitol steps of the California statehouse in Sacramento. In the melee, 7 brave comrades sustained injuries from stabbings on the part of the scumbag Nazis and racist skinheads. However, despite a few of our own sustaining these injuries the day was still a victory for those who desire to see such disgusting, hateful organizations like TWP and GSS shut down and completely crushed. The fascists failed to recruit anyone, their rally was never able to even start, and if the video footage that has been seen is any indication they were completely routed from the capitol very swiftly. In solidarity, anti-fascists in Minneapolis have hung a banner for our comrades in Sacramento who took the fight directly to the enemy. It reads
Solidarity with Sacramento Antifa, Bash the Fash!
We have experienced white supremacist terror here in our own backyard with the shooting at the 4th Precinct occupation by the very same sort of alt-right white supremacists that the Traditionalist Youth Network attempts to recruit. We know well enough that in order to stop the spread of these hateful organizations is to silence them with utmost force by directly and physically confronting them. It is thanks to forebears here in Minneapolis who founded Anti-Racist Action that organized white supremacists tend to avoid the Twin Cities metro area, and we intend to keep it that way by any means necessary. Fascists and racists are still not welcome here, and as we've seen they're certainly not welcome in Sacramento either!
Solidarity with all who resist!
Death to fascism!
Ashley Johnston, who was killed fighting for the Kurds in Syria. A Defence spokesperson confirmed the dead man was a former Army Reservist but would not confirm their name. Ms Olan said: "He was a hero. They went all the way from here to fight for humanity. We will have them in our hearts forever." The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in London, announced on Thursday that an Australian man was killed in an IS assault against a position of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) near Tal Hamis in Hasakeh province. The YPG posted a Facebook tribute to Mr Johnston, who they called "Heval Bagok Serhed".
"We the YPG regretfully inform you of the death of one of our bravest Western fighters Heval Bagok Serhed.  They are the first Western fighter to be martyred fighting the evil of ISIS. Rest in peace our brother," the Facebook group "the Lions Of Rojava" said. "Throughout their time in Kurdistan they had a positive impact on my people's lives though their humility and kindness to everyone they met. They were taken from us in a heroic assault on ISIS positions in a small village near Shingal. Their squad of eight fighters were in a truck which had broken down and it was critical that they dislodge ISIS form their positions so they pushed on fearlessly with little regard for the own safety. "They where massively outnumbered and outgunned but fearless in the face of this as they knew another ISIS death meant saving the lives of countless civilians. They were a fearless and exceptional soldier as well a great man. "Please keep their family and loved ones in your prayers and remember them and their heroic actions, which saved their comrades." It is believed that Mr Johnston was with Jordan Matson, an American volunteer who has criticised the Australian government for making it a jailable offence to fight for the YPG.
Fairfax Media also spoke to a Kurdish Syrian translator, Sabry Omar, who saw the Australian, who they named only as "Ashley", on Mount Sinjar in Iraqi Kurdistan last month. "He was on the frontline when they were injured - I saw them in hospital, but they were not seriously hurt," they said. "A suicide bomber in a car exploded near them and their eyes were injured." Mr Omar last saw Ashley on some social media sites, on January 28 or 29, they said. "His nickname was Gabar - which is the name of a Kurdish mountain in Turkey. "He had many tattoos ... I am sure they must have been a professional soldier in Australia from their level of experience [as a fighter] ..."
The news of the Australian's death travelled fast through Kurdistan and the Kurdish controlled enclave of Jazira in north-eastern Syria. Mr Rahman said dozens of Westerners had joined the YPG's ranks. "There are foreigners fighting on all sides of Syria's war ... They are volunteers, they don't get paid anything at all," they said. "The YPG isn't actively recruiting foreigners, but people from countries like Canada, the United States, Britain, Spain, Australia, Holland, Austria and France have travelled to Syria to join their ranks," they said. A spokesperson for Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the government could not confirm the man's name.
A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said: "We are aware of reports that an Australian male has reportedly been killed in northern Syria (on Tuesday 24 Feb). "The Australian government's capacity to confirm reports of deaths in either Syria or Iraq is extremely limited. Due to the extremely dangerous security situation, consular assistance is no longer available within Syria. Australians who become involved in overseas conflicts are putting their own lives in mortal danger. Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone. Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately. For further information, please see www.smartraveller.gov.au ." DFAT has urged all Australians in the Middle East fighting IS to return home. In October, Attorney-General George Brandis warned that any Australian fighting for the YPG would face prosecution under the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act and a possible jail sentence of up to 20 years. YPG has been linked to Kurdish group PKK, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation according to the Australian government. In a message on Facebook, Jordan Matson said: "Ashley was a good man who never complained and was always positive. They came to defend their country even after their country labelled them a criminal for doing so."
A Twitter account called KurdishPhoto posted on Thursday: "Ashley from Australia. You are a freedom fighter, a martyr and will forever live in the hearts of the Kurdish people".

The second suspect wanted in connection to the murder of Italian tourist, Carlo Marigliano has turned themselves in to Little Rock police. Charina Fort, 31, of Little Rock, turned themselves in to police around 5:30 p.m. Saturday evening. They have been charged with capital murder. Andre Jackson, 32, of Little Rock, was arrested and charged with capital murder in the homicide of Carlo Marigliano, 31.
Police say Marigliano was shot while driving a rental car Friday, July 28 on North Shackleford Road and then crashed their vehicle into the side of an apartment building. They were pronounced dead at the scene. According to the victim's family, Marigliano was visiting Little Rock from Italy and spoke limited English and was traveling with an Italian tour group when they decided to break away and explore the city alone.
They prolly lookin for dope. Why else would they had broken away from their group if they couldn't even speak no English. Knowmsayin. Cause a mufucka wanna get high. Sheeit.
They go lookin for the first niggas they see. Axe em for dope and shit. Errybody who come to Murica and wanna get high think you just go axe any black person you see for dope. Like we all dope dealers or sumpin. That shit be makin some niggas angry. Fo real.
If they were hustlas, they musta short changed them niggas or sumpin. Either that, or they said the N word. Cause a nigga ain't gonna shoot a mufucka for no reason. Balee dat.
But I bet they came short on their paper. Instead of a $20 they gave them a $10 or sumpin. Then looked at them niggas crazy. Disrespeckin they ass and shit. Ain't no nigga gonna let a white mufucka disrespeck their ass. Hell nah.
How they pose to know that mufucka didn't speak no English. That ain't they job. They hustlas. Knowmsayin. You get that shit right the first time. Don't be playin with a mufucka by giving them the wrong bill. Then lookin at them crazy. Because they ain't gonna axe you twice.
When you fuck with a nigga's money, you fuckin with their emotions. You might as well be fuckin their main babymamma. I don't give a fuck if you just 20 cents short on your money. A real nigga with shoot your ass for that shit. That's how they make a name for himself. Show other niggas how hard they be.
Them Italians probably let you slide on that ole bullshit. Come short on your money when you wanna get high and they'll let you pay it next time. They be like, “alright den. Just pay me next time. It's cool.”
Fuck that. That be that ole white boy bullshit. Punk ass white boys be soft as pillow. Knowmsayin. That's why niggas always be robbin they ass. Rapin they hoe and shit.
Tourists come to Murica and think erry nigga they see either play basketball or sell dope. That's cause the racist media make us look bad. Always wanna put black folks on the news when they kill a mufucka. Or carjack someone because they need a ride.
This Italian tourist that couldn't speak no English came up to me once. I was chillin in da club. Drinkin my little grape drank and shit. They axed me if I was a Basketball-American. I say, “What the fuck is you talkin bout you dumb bitch. Get on outta here for I take my dick out on you in front of errydamnbody.”
They started gigglin and shit. Like they didn't know what I said. But they knew. Errybody know English when they need to. Even them illegal mufuckas that pick all the berries. They just pretend they don't understand your ass. But when you say, “hello” to they ass. They say “hello” right back. It just sounds different when they say it. It sounds like they be saying hola, but they really be saying hello. Knowmsayin.
Errytime I speak to a Meskin they look at me crazy. Then they always say, “pinche mayate.” Them mufuckas think I don't know what that shit mean. That's how you say, “I don't speak English” in Meskin. I took Meskin in 9th grade. I know what they're talking about. I ain't stupid.
Sven is in.
Vancouver Canucks head coach Willie Desjardins told reporters that prospect Sven Baertschi will make their playoff debut Thursday night in a do-or-die Game 5.
The Canucks recalled the former Calgary Flames forward in advance of Tuesday's Game 4 versus their old team but went with Linden Vey instead.
Desjardins confirmed that injured forward Alex Burrows will not return to the series, but did not name their Game 5 starting goaltender.

Baertschi, 22, has appeared in just three games with the Canucks this season, scoring two goals (2-0-2) and registering four penalty minutes.
“He's got real good skill, he's a good skilled played, has good speed and a real good shot,” coach Willie Desjardins told reporters. “He's a guy that can break open a game.”
The Swiss forward was recalled from AHL Utica, where they have put up 15 points in 15 games.
Vancouver's struggling offence has averaged just two goals per game through four contests versus Calgary in this opening round and needs a scoring boost.
Prior to joining Utica, Baertschi played 15 games with the Flames this season, recording four assists and six penalty minutes.
Baertschi was selected by Calgary 13th overall in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft but fell out of favour with the Flames and was dealt to Vancouver at the March trade deadline in exchange for Vancouver's second-round pick in the 2015 draft.
The Canucks trail the Flames 3-1 in the series.

Transport chiefs in the Spanish capital, Madrid, have launched a campaign discouraging "manspreading" - men encroaching on other seats by sitting with their legs wide apart.
Bus operator EMT is putting up new signs showing a seated male figure, legs akimbo, next to a big red cross.
A similar campaign is planned for the city's Metro system.
The move follows an online petition by a women's campaign group, which garnered more than 12,000 signatures.
Manspreading - which was accepted as a word in the online Oxford dictionary two years ago - is already discouraged in some other cities around the world.
Image copyright EmT Image caption EMT is using this pictograph on all its buses
EMT said in a statement (in Spanish) that the aim of the new signs was to remind male travellers "of the need to maintain civic behaviour and to respect the space of everyone on board the bus".
The women's group Mujeres en Lucha (Women in Struggle) said in its online petition that it was not uncommon on public transport to see women "with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because there is a man next to them invading them space".
It's hashtag #MadridSinManspreading (#MadridWithoutManspreading) has been widely used on social media.
In 2014, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided to crack down on the manspreading scourge with signs on the city's Metro that read: "Dude... stop the spread, please."
The US city of Philadelphia also launched a "Dude, it's Rude" campaign, while Seattle's transport provider put up signs showing an octopus with its tentacles draped over bordering seats.
New Delhi: India needs an excellent research, development and innovation ecosystem to become a knowledge economy, the government's top scientific advisor said on Wednesday, underlining the need for more academia-industry collaboration.
Delivering the first APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial Lecture, R. Chidambaram, principal scientific advisor, government of India and chairperson, scientific advisory committee to the cabinet, stressed the need to take risks and getting used to the occasional failure when developing new advanced technologies. The lecture was jointly organised in Delhi by the Confederation of Indian Industry and Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam International Foundation.
The former Atomic Energy Commission of India chairperson, who played a key role during India's nuclear tests at Pokhran in 1998 along with Kalam, said while Indian industries were at the forefront of nuclear and space technologies, other industries lagged behind in terms of innovations. “One major reason why collaboration between academia and the industry hasn't happened in disciplines other than space and nuclear technology is because most other industries are quite far behind in terms of adopting new technology, so there's not enough incentive for academia to collaborate."
Chidambaram urged the industry to invest more in research and development of new technologies, saying it will help attract young talent. They said the central government's Department of Commerce was in the process of undertaking a comprehensive programme to promote collaboration between industries and universities. “Steps are being undertaken to identify gaps from the demand side of things, and to rope in academia to solve technology roadblocks experienced by manufacturers," they explained.
Chidambaram expressed confidence about the government's willingness to put aside scientific inertia and adopt new technology such as nuclear energy and genetically modified crops.
Citing Kalam's vision, Chidambaram said improvement in the quality of life in rural areas was the most reliable yardstick to gauge the success of any technology.
At a panel discussion preceding the lecture, former Department of Science and Technology secretary Thirumalachari Ramasami pointed to the importance of forging strategic global alliances with other smaller economies, which would lead to a shared market for innovations.
An active shooter pinned down police with gunfire outside a San Diego, California apartment building for more than five hours before they were taken into custody. A SWAT team and crisis negotiators were on the scene.
The shooter barricaded themselves in a bedroom in a sixth-floor apartment.
When police arrived at the building in response to a domestic violence call around 9:10 a.m. local time, the suspect fired rounds at police through a closed door when officers arrived, nearly hitting them. The officers returned fire, San Diego PD said.
A negotiations team was in contact with the gunman for several hours, Lieutenant Scott Wahl said during a briefing. They reiterated that people in the area were safe as long as they remained inside.

"He's been actively shooting, sporadically," Wahl said, adding that police didn't believe the suspect had taken any hostages and that the woman involved in the domestic violence call was "safely with us."
"What we're hoping is that the suspect is going to surrender peacefully... we've got them safely contained, safely isolated," Wahl said.
Police closed Curlew, Brant, Albatross and Front Streets between Laurel Street and W. Ivy Street, which are between San Diego International Airport and the San Diego Zoo.
A “full ground stop” was issued at the airport, also known as Lindbergh, meaning no flights were allowed in or out. Later, the airport was allowing planes to leave, but not land.
Police asked residents near the Brant Street in the Bankers Hill neighborhood to remain inside, away from windows until further notice.

The SWAT team arrived on the scene as a man was shooting at a police dog from the window of the apartment complex, KFMB reported.

Police described the gunman as a black man who is 32 years old; 5 feet, 11 inches; and about 290 pounds with black hair.
Washington Elementary School was placed on lockdown with access to the campus restricted, a school district spokesperson told the San Diego Union-Tribune. As a precaution, City Tree Christian School was locked down as well. Both schools are near the active shooting scene.

Eyewitness Austin Kinghorn thought at first that they were hearing more thunder from a rain storm last night, they told the Union-Tribune's Sandy Coronilla. They counted six or seven shots while they were inside the building, then “counted meticulously once I got out here. I was counting in my head, there were 48 shots fired.”
A man who lives next door to the suspect said that there is now a bullet hole in their shared wall, they told KSWB, adding that they hid in a bathtub.

By 1 p.m. local time, police gave the all-clear for air traffic to resume, despite the continued standoff because the shooter was isolated in a location where they believed they would not be able to shoot at any aircraft. The school lockdowns were also been lifted.
"At this point we have no information on injuries and hope it stays that way," Wahl said during a second update. When asked if the gunman has been cooperative, they replied: “I would not say cooperative until they surrender.”

The hype around Pokémon X & Y has finally ended, as many 3DS gamers around the world are now immersed in establishing their teams and training 'mon. Naturally we're left to wonder how the excitable build-up has translated to sales, and we'll have a good idea on Wednesday for Japan, though we'll need to wait for detailed figures in mid-November for North America.
In the UK, meanwhile, both titles have performed well. Pokémon X is — at the time of writing — marked as the number one video game on Amazon UK, and the official UKIE all-format charts give a clear picture of the performance of both titles at launch. X has come in third place, with Y behind in fourth place; those are strong results considering that sales are split between the two versions and the fact they're single format — GTA V and FIFA 14 are the predictable top two, while PS3-exclusive Beyond: Two Souls came behind Y in fifth. In comparison to the releases of Pokémon Black and White 2, X and Y have sold roughly double the number of copies, showing the added sales power of a new generation.
Elsewhere, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD has come in 10th place in its second week, a reasonable result considering the limited Wii U install base. The ever-green Animal Crossing: New Leaf sits in 18th, while Mario Kart 7 drifts into 40th position.
So there you have it, and it's also a win for X over Y. Which did you pick up?
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Thai teenager born and raised in Japan lost an appeal on Tuesday against a lower court ruling that upheld their deportation order, highlighting the country's deep reluctance to accept foreigners even as its population ages and shrinks.

The Tokyo High Court ruled that Utinan Won, a 16-year-old high school student living without a visa, should leave Japan. Won's mother had already left Japan after lower court judges said their son could win residency if they returned to Thailand.
“Of course I want to stay in Japan,” Won told reporters after the ruling. “I'd waited so long for this decision. I'm so sad and pained that it was made so quickly.”
The High Court judges made their ruling in little more than 10 seconds, with cries of “Why?” and “Terrible” coming from a packed public gallery.
Won's case has drawn sharp focus on the plight of hundreds of children who, like him, live on “provisional release” - a status that allows those without visas to stay in Japan while banning them from working and travelling freely.
Last month, Reuters exposed the agonising pathway to residency offered by the Japanese immigration authorities and courts to some families living on provisional release: Children can stay in Japan legally if their parents return to their country of origin.
Tokyo District Court judges said in June Won could win a special residence permit if their mother - who at the time was also on provisional release - left Japan, and if they found another guardian.
Won's mother, Lonsan Phaphakdee, returned to Bangkok in September to give their son a chance to continue life in the only country they have known. Won now lives with a Japanese man who has been supporting the family.
The High Court judges said in a written ruling: “We must say that the (lower court's) decision and the deportation order are legally legitimate.”
Although Won does not read or write Thai, they are able to speak the language and is young enough to adapt to life back in Thailand, the judges said.
Won's lawyer, Koichi Kodama, said the judges did not take into consideration the fact that the mother had left Japan and only re-evaluated evidence submitted to the lower court.
Wearing their school uniform and sneakers, Won remained impassive throughout the ruling, their head bowed slightly. Representatives from the government, the defendant in the case, were not present at the hearing.
Their lawyer said Won had not yet decided whether to appeal against the latest ruling.
After just six days on the market, LG has cancelled its latest smartwatch, the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE. An LG representative tells Android Police that due to "a hardware issue" the company has had to halt sales of the device.
LG told the site, "Late in the quality assurance process for the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, our engineers were made aware of a hardware issue which affects the day-to-day functionality of the device. After further investigation, the decision was made to cancel the rollout of the Urbane 2nd Edition LTE due to the complicated nature of the issue."
We were able to confirm the cancellation with LG. The company hasn't gone into detail about what exactly is wrong with the device, but we were told that there was "no danger to the user," and "there are no safety issues or concerns with the product." LG told both Ars and Android Police that it had not yet decided if the device would ever be for sale again.
The Urbane 2nd Edition LTE was Android Wear's first watch with built-in LTE and the first (and so far only) Android Wear watch to ship with Marshmallow. The watch even got a big plug on Google's official Android blog last week.
The watch has been on sale for about six days, both online and in Verizon and AT&T stores. Today, the online listings from both carriers are gone: Verizon's page for the Urbane 2nd Edition LTE shows an error message that aptly notes "Oops! That wasn't supposed to happen...," and AT&T redirects customers to a page for the first LG Watch Urbane. The watch also seems to be scrubbed from LG's site. We haven't heard of a recall yet, but if you happened to buy an Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, we'd suggest trying to return it.
Shocking footage has emerged showing a schoolgirl being snatched by a man on a busy street in east China.
The girl in red jacket was not aware that they had been followed on their way home from class.
They were put into a minivan by the man and the van, driving by the man's accomplice, left the scene quickly.

The incident was believed to have happened in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province on December 11.
The man approached the girl as soon as the minivan's door opened.
The girl tried to resist the man's assault as they firmly held onto the minivan's door but they got pushed into the vehicle.
The snatching has alerted a few members of the public, they attempted to block the van but it soon drove off.
According to ifeng.com, police are looking for information and they are trying to track down the minivan.
There is no further information disclosed by the police yet.

Despite being the world's lingua franca, English is the most difficult European language to learn to read. Children learning other languages master the basic elements of literacy within a year, but British kids take two-and-a-half years to reach the same point.
In the most extensive cross-national study ever, Philip Seymour of Dundee University and their team compared the reading abilities of children in 15 European countries. They found that those learning Romance languages such as Italian and French progressed faster than those learning a Germanic language such as German and English. “Children do seem to find English particularly complex and problematic though,” says Seymour.
The team focused on the earliest phase of learning to read. They tested the children's ability to match letters to sounds, their capacity to recognise familiar written words, and their ability to work out new words from combinations of familiar syllables.
Seymour's findings might explain why more people are diagnosed as being dyslexic in English-speaking countries than elsewhere.

In languages where sounds simply match letters, some symptoms just would not show up, says Maggie Snowling, a dyslexia expert at the University of York. The condition would be more difficult to diagnose in children who speak these languages, though subtle symptoms such as impaired verbal short-term memory would remain. “People might be struggling, but no one would notice,” they say.
Consonant clusters
The Germanic languages are tricky because many words contain clusters of consonants. The word “sprint”, for example, is difficult because the letter p is sandwiched between two other consonants, making the p sound difficult to learn.
Another feature of English that makes it difficult is the complex relationship between letters and their sounds.
In Finnish, which Seymour found to be the easiest European language to learn to read, the relationship between a letter and its sound is fixed.
However, in English a letter's sound often depends on its context within the word. For example, the letter c can sound soft (as in receive) or hard (as in cat). Many words like “yacht” don't seem to follow any logic at all.
Historical accident
However, the things that make English difficult to read might have contributed to Britain's rich literary tradition. Words like “sign” and “bomb” are difficult because of their silent letters, but these hint at relationships with other words. The connection with words like “signature” and “bombard” is obvious.
Mark Pagel, an expert on language diversity at the University of Reading, acknowledges the irony that despite being the international lingua franca, English is the most difficult to learn. The dominance of English has more to do with historical accident than any innate superiority of the language, they say.
“People who speak English happen to have been the ones that were economically and politically dominant in recent history. Those forces greatly outweigh any small difficulties in language acquisition.”

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a private research university in Troy, N.Y., has a bone to pick with the Education Department. School officials are taking issue with the government's characterization of the university's financial management, which was highlighted in a recent Washington Post article.
[The surprising list of colleges whose financial management has the government worried]
The Post reported that Rensselaer is one of 450 colleges the department has required to post a letter of credit assuring the availability of cash in exchange for access to federal financial aid. Colleges are asked for this form of collateral when the government grows concerned about the way their finances are being managed.
A majority of the colleges asked to post these letters, including Rensselaer, failed a federal review of their income, debt and assets, known as a financial responsibility test. The Education Department asked Rensselaer to provide a letter of credit pledging $4 million out of concern about the school's debt and pension liabilities, some of the same reasons that Moody's Investor Services held a negative outlook on the college from 2009 through late 2015.
The credit ratings agency revised its outlook to stable in November, citing expectations of continued improvement in Rensselaer's operating performance and increases in revenue and enrollment. Still, Moody's remains concerned about the school's “very high financial leverage, weak expendable financial resources depressed by a relatively large pension liability and thin unrestricted liquidity, including use of operating lines of credit.”
Officials at Rensselaer did not answer questions posed by The Post but issued a statement on Sunday disagreeing with the Education Department's judgement. See below:
The Flynn effect describes the observed improvement in cognitive performance over time among individuals of the same age. We examine if the Flynn effect varies across three European regions and whether there are sex differences in the extent of improvement over time. Using SHARE-data, with a study population of 34,300 non-institutionalized individuals, aged between 50 and 84 years, we find that the Flynn effect is larger in regions which experienced the most rapid pace of development over time (Southern Europe), than in regions with relatively higher levels of development but less change over time (Central and Northern Europe). With respect to sex differences in the Flynn effect, we find that women, on the whole in Europe, have a larger Flynn effect than men. In the regional analyses, non-significant trends indicate that women gain more than men in Northern and Central Europe.
Codemasters' cars wot go fast management game, F1 Online, has now entered open beta and since it's a microtransaction-scoffing online sort of thing, that means anyone can play it right now without spending so much as a penny, in any sense of the phrase. Ace car-pilot Brendan took a look at the game for us almost exactly a month ago today and found it an enjoyable snack rather than a feast, although not without complaining about how “Facebookey” the whole thing can be. I'm tempted to try it as building a team from scratch sounds like fun, but if it starts trying my patience I'll probably forget about it, leaving Team Pay To Win languishing in a garage with a half-built car.

FOUR PROVINCES, FOUR professional rugby teams, four chances at making a career.
Ireland has often been something of a closed shop for young rugby players, the limited opportunities both ensuring that those who rise to the top are of the very highest quality but also meaning that the numbers in the player base have plateaued.
James Coughlan has been a major success in Pau.
Whereas moves abroad in the early years of professionalism were rife as the provinces found their feet in business and organisational terms, there had been a wholesale decrease in Irish players heading abroad ever since.
That trend appears to be reversing, with several Irishmen heading abroad to both England and France in the last number of years and many of them making strong successes of their moves.
That can only be a good thing for Irish rugby as a whole. The top-tier internationals are being kept in cotton wool at home of course, but players at a wide range of different stages in their careers are getting away and actually playing games.
Niall Woods – the former Ireland international who now represents professional rugby players and a host of sports media figures through their Navy Blue agency – has a number of men in the exiles boat, all of them making an impression abroad.
Lock Mark Flanagan has joined the Bedford Blues in the English Championship after two excellent seasons in France's Pro D2. Kilkenny man Peter Lydon was London Scottish's player of the season after joining from Stade Français in 2014.
Darren O'Shea will be playing in the Premiership having helped Worcester to promotion from the Championship last season. Jerry Sexton has earned a pro deal with the growing force that is Exeter after stints at two Pro D2 outfits since leaving Ireland.
Willie Ryan, a man plucked from Cork Con in the Ulster Bank League, had a strong season with Rotherham Titans in 2014/15. Former Lansdowne captain Charlie Butterworth has pitched up in beautiful Jersey following a season with Ulster.
Later in their careers, Dave Ryan will play in the Top 14 with Agen this season, while James Coughlan is regarded as a son of Pau after driving them into the French top flight.
Each of Woods' clients had their own reasons for getting out of Ireland, but their desire to ensure they found the right club is reaping rewards. Coughlan is perhaps already one of the most successful Irish exiles of them all.
“The president in Pau has said it's probably the best signing they have ever made,” said Woods, who also represents Ireland internationals such as Marty Moore, Jordi Murphy, Tomás O'Leary and Rhys Ruddock, as well as the likes of Isa Nacewa and Andrew Conway.
“Everyone here would probably know that because he's never injured, gets man of the match eight or nine times last year and had always been like that in Munster.
“Simon Mannix knew that from Munster, and knew that they worked very, very hard. He's the kind of person that Simon wanted in the team and it's worked.
“James could have gone to the UK a few years before, but they didn't. The thing with them was asking ‘do I want to end my career not starting?' They didn't.
He's 34, but I would say James could play until he's 36 or 37. They have another year on their contract and we'll look to extend again.”
Coughlan may have seasons ahead of them yet, but he's at a different point in their career than the likes of Lydon, O'Shea, Ryan, Butterworth and Flanagan. Those promising players are still working hard to establish themselves and turned to the Championship as an arena to do so.
O'Shea is in the Premiership a year after moving to the Warriors, while the impressive work of Lydon, Ryan and Flanagan means they have high hopes of taking that same step too.
Another potential future move could be home to one of the provinces, returning with the experience of racking up game time that some Irish players in their early 20s yearn for.

Woods' past as a prolific wing for London Irish and Harlequins means they know the English game inside out, has a strong contact base on that side of the Irish Sea and is therefore able to find the right move for their clients.
“Having played in England, I know the standard of the clubs and the standard of the Championship,” said Woods. “It's getting stronger every year, but it's a matter of getting the right club. It's not just about going to the Championship to any club.
“It also depends on the player. I've been lucky with the clients I have in that we've been able to decide where they will go.
“The Championship clubs like Irish players because we work hard as a nation. Everyone knows that, there's no bullshit with 99% of Irish players and they'll get on well with the other players in general.
If they're English-qualified it makes them even more attractive. It means the clubs don't have to mark the guy as an overseas player, and they actually get funding for every English-qualified player they have.”
Being English-qualified, as Lydon and Flanagan are for example, also means the players are more attractive to Premiership clubs when their form makes the top tier sit up and take notice.
Woods points to Rotherham as an example of a feeder to the Premiership, having provided 16 players to top flight clubs over the course of two recent seasons. Northampton have links with Moseley, while Saracens are closely tied to Bedford.
As Coughlan and Ryan attempt to make a mark on the Top 14, the efforts of second rows O'Shea and Sexton to impress with Worcester and Exeter, respectively, in the Premiership will be intriguing to follow.

Sexton, the younger brother of Ireland out-half Johnny, had spent a year with Auch in France before they linked up with Woods. After a short and ill-fated spell with Mont-de-Marsan at the beginning of last season, Sexton had returned home with the intention of playing club rugby with St. Mary's, but Woods got to work.
“I was in contact with Rob Baxter at Exeter and we spoke about Jerry,” said Woods. “He's EQP (English Qualified Player) and they have Johnny's traits of maybe being cranky and working hard; Jerry has that too.
“We got them a three-month trial and they went over. In the second month, I met Rob and they were really happy with him; Rob felt he'd gone way past the other lads who were there. They take nothing for granted and he's on a full contract now for the next year.”
22-year-old Sexton made their Premiership debut last season, while 6ft 9ins O'Shea has already run the Worcester lineout at the same age. The future looks bright for both locks, and Flanagan at Bedford, a second row who is brought tracked by several clubs.
Opportunities to play have been vital for all the players Woods has found contracts for outside Ireland, but there is of course more to the moves than pure rugby. How does the remuneration compare?
Woods says they have had only one client whose sole focus was taking the most lucrative offer, regardless of whether it brought a positive lifestyle and more playing chances.
“The sterling is so strong that you might actually get paid more in the Championship than here,” said Woods. “In some cases, it would be more or less the same. That brings it down to the individual: ‘I can get 20 games in England or be third or fourth choice in my province.'
Woods won eight caps for Ireland during their own playing days.
“At the age of 22 or 23 I'd be telling guys not to be as concerned with the money. It's more or less the same most of the time, maybe €5,000 or €10,000 more. If you go and play 20 games for a good club in the Championship and get noticed, your salary is going to go way up if you get picked up in the Premiership.
Not everyone is going to make it, but there are loads of examples of guys doing that.”
Retaining strength in depth at home in Ireland is naturally a priority, but the hope is that the trickle of successes enjoyed by Woods' clients so far becomes more of a stream in time.
Players like Lydon, Ryan, Flanagan and Coughlan, in a very different way, have opened the eyes of many other Irishmen to the possibilities abroad. Woods may find themselves in even greater demand if that continues.
As we recognize February 12, the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers, we must move beyond words on pages to preventative action in the field. In South Sudan, $1.2 billion U.S. was budgeted for the Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) — once again picking up the pieces after war and placing time, money and resources solely on reactive solutions. Yet when conflict erupted in South Sudan in December, we once again witnessed the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

At this moment there are more than 55 state and non-state armed groups operating on three continents that are using child soldiers. Amongst this group, 32 are persistent perpetrators that have been on this list for at least five years in a row. Seven of these persistent perpetrators are state armies — nation states using children in their military. Despite numerous international legal mechanisms that exist, children are still being recruited with impunity. Ongoing conflicts in the Central African Republic, Mali, South Sudan, the DRC, Syria and Somalia illustrate the extent to which children are still used as weapons of war and mass atrocities. Bosco “The Terminator” Ntaganda, notorious rebel leader in Congo, has been sitting in an ICC prison since March of last year. Thomas Lubanga was found guilty in 2012 and sentenced to 14 years in prison for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting of children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate actively in hostilities — it took six years to bring them to justice. International law is slow, and while it is essential it must not be the only tool employed to end the use of child soldiers globally. We must use all means at our disposal to recognize early warning indicators of youth recruitment and abuse and take a holistic approach to preventing the use of child soldiers. This means not relegating the issue of child soldiers as a “minor” or “secondary” problem to the conflict, but seeing how fundamentally child soldier recruitment and use is directly linked to the severity and impact of conflict.
Article Continued Below
The responsibility to end the use of child soldiers cannot rest solely with the humanitarian sector or at the level of UN resolutions. It requires the inclusion of new actors, not traditionally thought to have a role to play in preventing of the use of child soldiers, such as police forces, judicial authorities, religious leaders, as well as the military. These actors must be prepared to recognize opportunities to intervene, trained on appropriate interventions, empowered to act and encouraged to collaborate with the humanitarian sector. If we had acted in 2004, 2007, 2012 … when the first signs of recruitment of children were taking place in the Central African Republic, perhaps many lives could have been saved and we'd be talking about children thriving rather than people being lynched in the streets of Bangui. The abuse of children in conflict has long-term consequences and leads to a cycle of violence that if not addressed can always provide a spark to future conflicts. Action must be taken in times of peace in fragile states — recognizing the connections between child labour, trafficking, piracy, and criminal activities to child soldiery. We must not wait until conflict breaks out before we intervene and only concentrate efforts on rehabilitating those that we have failed to protect, but rather we must work across the full spectrum of actors, to find new solutions for prevention. We must be bold in this effort for the attainment of peace, it is our responsibility to the world's children.

Believe it or not, this Uttarakhand teacher has outscored British legendary hunter Jim Corbett in shooting down man-eaters.
Popular among locals as the double-barrel saviour, Lakhpat Singh Rawat, 50, has gunned down 45 man-eaters in 13 years, while Corbett had killed 33 during 1907 and 1938. Rawat had hunted one tiger too as their 35th kill in 2011, while “Corbett had shot down 19 man-eater tigers and 14 leopards," says deputy director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, Saket Badola.
But, Rawat modestly says the number of more kills doesn't make them greater than Jim Corbett, “who is known the world over as a great conservationist.”
The Uttarakhand government has requested Rawat to cock their gun again and relieve the hill state of a leopard which has killed 13 people in Pithoragarh district since 2012.
Rawat, who comes from Gairsain area, some 350 kilometres from the state capital, says hunting runs in their blood. Their grandfather too was a passionate hunter. But they hunted their first man-eater in 2001.
Rawat can't forget the moment when they were called to hunt a man-eater leopard which had devoured 12 children in Gairsain in 2000. Around the same time, they participated in a district shooting championship and stood first. Former education secretary Umakant Panwar came second. Impressed by their shooting skills, Panwar helped Rawat get the license for a double-barrel gun.
Rawat says their highest score has been 12 man-eaters in one year. “That was 2009. I was granted a permit by forest officials. I had to finish the job in the shortest time to avoid revenge killing of innocent leopards by villagers.”
They reminisce that Uttarkashi man-eater leopard, which had mauled five persons to death in 14 days during 2004, was their toughest kill."His area of operation spanned 40 square kilometres. I realised they identified the noise of our vehicle and swiftly changed positions to dodge us," they say.

Despite initial hopes among advocates that the charges against the CBC host would bring positive change, the trial has shed light on a justice system riddled with barriers and stigma to reporting sexual assault crimes
For eight days in February, a fleet of news vans lined the street beside Toronto's Old City Hall courthouse. Outside, dozens of reporters milled around, hashing out their next updates; in the dock sat one of the country's most prominent media personalities, accused of violently sexually assaulting several women.
On Thursday, the spotlight will again land on Jian Ghomeshi as a verdict is handed down in the first trial to emerge from the barrage of allegations against the former Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio star.
Jian Ghomeshi acquitted of all charges in sexual assault trial Read more
Many will be watching closely, keenly aware that the decision in the trial could have repercussions across the country for groups that range from sexual assault survivors to defence lawyers.
Ghomeshi was known for their smooth interviewing style on the radio show Q and celebrated for their socially progressive views.
When they first emerged in the fall of 2014, the accusations against Ghomeshi stunned the country. Within weeks, what had started as a trickle swelled to more than 20 separate accusations, as women came forward with their own stories of being slapped, punched, bitten, choked or smothered by the radio host.
Ghomeshi denied all the accusations, pleading not guilty to four charges of sexual assault and another of choking to overcome resistance.
Their trial, tinged with power and celebrity – and played out in the age of liveblogs and Twitter – has given Canadians an unprecedented window into how the country's legal system addresses sexual assault allegations.
Those who work with sexual assault survivors worry that even before the verdict is delivered on Thursday, the events in court could discourage victims from coming forward. “This trial has impact,” said Farrah Khan, who runs a sexual violence support and education program at Toronto's Ryerson University. “Survivors are listening, the community is listening.”
This trial has impact. Survivors are listening, the community is listening Farrah Khan
Canada's record is already dismal when it comes to reporting and securing convictions in sexual assault crimes. Advocates say that fewer than 10% of sexual assaults are reported, while a 2012 study from the University of Ottawa suggested that the conviction rate is around 0.3%.
Khan's group is one of several organisations across Canada that is planning events to mark the day, including a rally in support of sexual assault survivors at Old City Hall on Thursday evening. “No matter what the verdict is, we want people to know survivors are seen, heard and believed,” said Khan.
The trial shed light on a system riddled with barriers and stigma to reporting crimes, echoing advocates' longstanding complaint that the justice system is inadequate when it comes to sexual assault crimes. One flashpoint was a controversial defence strategy called “whacking”, which seeks to whittle away at sexual assault allegations by undermining the testimony of complainants.
Regardless of Thursday's decision, many will likely question whether this tactic was at play during the trial.
Breese Davies of the Criminal Lawyers' Association argued that blame does not lie with defence lawyers, whom they credited with doing an exemplary job. “We have an adversarial system because we collectively have decided over hundreds of years that that's the best system to get at the truth and to figure out what happened – is to have someone tell their story and have that story be tested.”
Pushed by the defence, the three female complainants in the Ghomeshi trial each revealed new information, describing actions that are not unusual for sexual assault survivors but could hurt the prosecution's case against Ghomeshi. The first complainant said they had emailed Ghomeshi twice after they allegedly pulled their hair and punched them in the head, including one of a picture of themselves in a bikini. They had hoped to bait them into talking to them about the alleged incident, they told the court.
Television actor Lucy DeCoutere – identified after they waived their right to a publication ban – told Ghomeshi they wanted to have sex with them in an email sent one day after they allegedly choked and slapped them DeCoutere said they didn't remember writing the email, and pointed out that their continued correspondence with Ghomeshi didn't mean the alleged assaults did not take place.
The third complainant admitted they had not told police that they had engaged in sexual activity with Ghomeshi after they allegedly put their hands around their neck and squeezed as they were kissing on a park bench. They said they had been embarrassed and hadn't thought it was relevant.
The checks and balances are necessary, said Davies, given what is at stake. If convicted of sexual assault, Ghomeshi, 48, faces a maximum sentence of 18 months behind bars. The charge of choking carries a potential life sentence.
Jesse Brown, the journalist who broke the story of the allegations against Ghomeshi, wasn't expecting much to come from Thursday's verdict. “My first thought was that he's going to walk, as soon as the charges were laid. Because that's what happens in these types of cases.”
For Brown, the lingering questions that remain as the trial wraps up revolve around how it was reported; articles reflected the aggressive defence strategy and repeatedly described the witnesses's credibility as being “damaged” or “destroyed”, they said.
“The defence was very good at making a dramatic, theatrical display and the media ate it up and spat it out,” they said. “We had the media misreporting things and taking a side without even knowing it.”
The defence was very good at making a dramatic, theatrical display and the media ate it up and spat it out Jesse Brown
Coverage of the trial contrasted sharply with the response when the allegations against Ghomeshi burst into public view. After Ghomeshi fired off a 1,590-word missive on their penchant for consensual “rough sex” and what they called “a campaign of false allegations”, complainants began coming forward with claims dating back decades. Survivors of sexual assault rallied around them, using the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported to share their own stories and take aim at the cultural norms that had kept them silent for so long.
“One thing that I heard again and again was that this was a turning point, it was a watershed moment, nothing would ever be the same,” said Brown.
But the message that has emerged, they said, was that it might be better for survivors to stay silent.
“The media's decisions and the ways that they presented all this, it's just the most crushing disincentive to anyone who might have been thinking about coming forward about Ghomeshi – or about anyone else,” said Brown, who added that some of those who had originally come to them with serious allegations against Ghomeshi later told them they were thankful they hadn't gone to the police.
Jian Ghomeshi trial: why the prosecution's case fell apart Read more
Regardless of Thursday's verdict, the trial has offered campaigners an unprecedented opportunity to shine a light on the shortcomings of the justice system when it comes to sexual assault, said Amanda Dale of the Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic, which provides legal support for victims of abuse. “I think the scrutiny is actually a good thing because it blows the lid off the myth that the criminal system has been working.”
Some have used the media attention to call for the creation of specialised sexual violence courts, in which the judges and prosecution are trained in areas such as trauma and intimate violence, while others launched an online campaign to encourage media to more carefully weigh the words they use when reporting on sexual violence.
Changes are already afoot, with Ontario announcing earlier this month that it will launch a pilot project this spring to give free legal advice to survivors of sexual assault in select cities. The representation would be available to all survivors, regardless of whether they choose to report the assault.
Once Thursday's verdict is handed down, the push will be on to capitalise on the momentum of the Ghomeshi trial to bring about change. “The groundwork has been slowly laid for over 30 years and then you get these moments where an opportunity presents itself,” said Dale.
Ghomeshi faces another trial in June, stemming from allegations that they touched the buttocks of a former CBC employee and said to her: “I want to hate-fuck you.”
Managers of CBC apologised last year to their employees and audience after a damning report concluded they knew of Ghomeshi's inappropriate behaviour but chose to instead protect the popular radio host. The report detailed how higher-ups at the network consistently ignored complaints regarding Ghomeshi, and instead proved “all too ready to believe their version of the truth”.

Don't you know that to be a liberated woman, you need to have the sex life of a chimpanzee?
That's the latest propaganda to come out of the New York Times.
The Soviet Union may have had its pitfalls–you know, like the murder and starvation of tens of millions of people. But women had great sex lives!
A comparative sociological study of East and West Germans conducted after reunification in 1990 found that Eastern women had twice as many orgasms as Western women… In contrast, postwar West German women had stayed home and enjoyed all the labor-saving devices produced by the roaring capitalist economy. But they had less sex, and less satisfying sex, than women who had to line up for toilet paper.
Tied up in this quest for women's liberation is the lie that promiscuity equals empowerment. They basically use the sexual crusader male stereotype as a target for equality. Female orgasms are the bedrock of social justice, apparently, and a solid foundation on which other rights can be built.
Some might remember that Eastern bloc women enjoyed many rights and privileges unknown in liberal democracies at the time, including major state investments in their education and training, their full incorporation into the labor force, generous maternity leave allowances and guaranteed free child care.
They were indoctrinated and forced to work. If they produced another little communist, they were given some time off. Sounds like a dream.
The Soviet Union was very good at convincing youth to join their movement. Tell the kids with raging hormones that they are right to follow their base instincts, and you have a supporter. Make it easy for them to shirk responsibility for their decisions by legalizing abortion.
State-run women's committees sought to re-educate boys to accept girls as full comrades, and they attempted to convince their compatriots that male chauvinism was a remnant of the pre-socialist past.
That is what the author of that article, the New York Times, and the “progressive” left truly admire. The fact that a society was able to forcibly re-educate the barbaric male oppressors.
To the left, equality means dragging everyone down to the same level. They laud the fact that women were forced to labor for the Soviet regime, saying “Communists invested major resources in the education and training of women and in guaranteeing their employment.”
They gloss over the poverty, brutal conditions, and authoritarian state power. Instead, they tout the state as a replacement for husbands and families.
Communist women enjoyed a degree of self-sufficiency that few Western women could have imagined. Eastern bloc women did not need to marry, or have sex, for money. The socialist state met their basic needs…
The missing truth is that sex was all the pleasure anyone in the Soviet Union could extract from life. It was the one thing the government hadn't taken from them.
Perhaps those living in freer countries did not have to rely on one fleeting animalistic pleasure in order to feel fulfilled. They had the freedom to seek pleasure elsewhere. They could pursue true happiness.
Perhaps when people care about their lives, their future, their children, they don't need to base their lives around sexual pleasure. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with sex, but there is something wrong with making it the central theme of your life. Clearly, it was an escape for women who had nothing else going for them in the Soviet Union.
It is common for people to hold onto whatever pleasure they can squeeze from a horrible situation. It is a psychological defense mechanism to say, “This is what I want! I may not have the freedom to speak my mind or choose my job, but at least I have great orgasms!”
The author concludes that heavy handed government intervention was worth it in order to liberate women.
Those comrades' insistence on government intervention may seem heavy-handed to our postmodern sensibilities, but sometimes necessary social change — which soon comes to be seen as the natural order of things — needs an emancipation proclamation from above.
We just have to put up with a touch of genocide and a dose of forced labor, and we will be free at last!
Normally, a very select committee would be holding its first meeting, round about now, as the search begins for a new governor-general. If that committee exists, it should be disbanded.
Stephen Harper should ask Governor-General David Johnston to stay at their post for a sixth year, and they should announce that extension now. Otherwise, a complete novice could arrive at Rideau Hall unprepared for interesting times.
By convention, the head of state in Canada serves for a five-year term, although that convention isn't ironclad. For example, Vincent Massey (1952-1959), Canada's first Canadian governor-general, George Vanier (1959-1967), its most beloved, and Roland Michener (1967-1974), their successor, all served approximately seven years.
Story continues below advertisement
More recently, Adrienne Clarkson (1999-2005) served six years, and that is the precedent we need to consider here.
In the wake the June 2004 election, Paul Martin had formed a weak minority Liberal government that the opposition Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Quebecois were threatening to bring down as soon as Parliament convened in early October.
Whether Mr. Martin would ask for a dissolution and a new election in the event their government was defeated, whether the governor-general would grant that request, or whether then-opposition leader Stephen Harper would be asked to form a government was a matter of considerable debate.
Mr. Martin asked Ms. Clarkson to stay on for a sixth year. Canada would have needed their experience and judgment in the event of a parliamentary crisis. We face the same possibility today.
Canada's 28th governor-general has served their country well. Mr. Harper asked Mr. Johnston to expand the governor-general's contribution to economic diplomacy. They have travelled the globe representing Canada in 31 countries, seeking to increase goodwill between this country and China, South Korea, India and other trading partners, even as officials sought to negotiate closer economic ties.
Such travel can be exhausting, and it would be understandable if Mr. Johnson, who is 73, wanted to hang up their gloves. Unfortunately, we can't let him.
Mr. Johnston's tenure will end October 1, smack in the middle of the general election. A new G-G would have to be sworn in either before the writ is dropped in early September, or after the Oct. 19 poll. In either case the timing would be awful.

We could have a hung Parliament. We could have the Liberals and the NDP proposing to enter into a coalition. We could have Mr. Harper trying to form and maintain a minority Conservative government.
This would be no time for a new and untested governor-general to confront a constitutional maze. Mr. Johnston has already been on the job four and a half years.  They are a recognized authority in constitutional law. They have acquitted themselves admirably from their first day in office. They need to stay.
There is one alternative. Mr. Harper could announce a new governor-general within the next few weeks, who could be sworn in in June. This would give the new G-G the summer to swot constitutional law. But the optics would be terrible. Mr. Harper would be implicitly admitting that they feared defeat on Oct. 19 and was determined to impose their choice on their successor.
No, the prime minister of the next government – whether it is Mr. Harper, Thomas Mulcair or Justin Trudeau – should have the time and liberty to appoint a selection committee and then to choose Mr. Johnston's successor from whatever shortlist the committee provides.
Mr. Harper might also consider asking Mr. Johnston to serve until the end of 2017. The prime minister would be hard pressed to find an abler governor-general to represent and speak for the best that is Canada during its sesquicentennial.
But whatever Mr. Harper decides, they should decide it now, not the least so Mr. Johnston has time to prepare.

Those who know this governor general well speak of their deep sense of duty to community and country. They will surely stay on, if asked. Mr. Harper should ask.

Lawyer's Sanction Hiked After Calling Ethics System a ‘Hideous Aberration of Justice'
Lawyer Patrick Rocchio didn't mince words in writings and testimony contesting a disciplinary matter in Indiana, calling the discipline system “a hideous aberration of justice” and the ethics rules “frivolous and antiquated.”
They failed to persuade the Indiana Supreme Court, which decided to increase Rocchio's sanction because of their contempt for the disciplinary process and their lack of remorse, the Legal Profession Blog reports. They will be suspended for 180 days, without automatic reinstatement.
Rocchio, who practiced in Michigan and sometimes in Indiana, was accused of failing to include the required words “advertising material” in a 2008 letter to a prospective client. They also are accused of failing to note on their website that they took inactive status in the state the next year.
The Indiana Supreme Court opinion (PDF) quotes from Rocchio's brief, which said: “My experience with the Indiana attorney disciplinary system is a hideous aberration of justice: a disciplinary commission and staff attorney with a self-image of pompous arrogance; a hearing officer who permits themselves to be used as a rubber stamp.”
Rocchio also went on the attack in correspondence and in their testimony before the hearing officer, criticizing the disciplinary rules as “frivolous and antiquated … rules of behavior conceived over cigars and brandy … during the late Victorian era by a group of self-impressed lawyers.”
To win reinstatement, Rocchio will have to demonstrate an attitude “of genuine remorse,” a proper attitude toward the ethics rules, and exemplary conduct in the period after the discipline.
A ComicsAlliance favorite for their super inky, wildly expressive style in Dark Horse books like Abe Sapien: The Devil Does Not Jest , B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth , and Conan the Barbarian , James Harren is going to make their 2000 AD debut next month in a story starring Judge Dredd . An arguably heroic, tough-as-nails and ultra-violent police officer/judge/executioner in a nightmare fascist dystopia, Dredd is the perfect vehicle for Harren's graphic talents. As such, writer Rob Williams envisioned the seven-page story -- in which Dredd enters the mind of a catatonic Psi Judge -- specifically for Harren to draw, and you can get a first look at the results below. 2000 AD editor Matt Smith gave us the crucial info about Harren and William's short:
Rob had been talking with James about doing a Dredd story together. Rob asked me if I was up for the two of them doing something together, and when I gave the thumbs up they wrote the script for 'Save Him' specifically for him, knowing James's forte was big monsters. The post-Day of Chaos story starts with Dredd being brought before a catatonic psi-cadet called Salas, whose only words have been Dredd's name. Dredd has never met the cadet before, and while he's in the room with them things get very weird indeed... James has had great fun taking apart the city, cramming seven pages with as much destruction and action as possible! After Guy Davis and Dave Stewart's fantastic work for the Judge Dredd Megazine in 2010, it's great to see another BPRD artist bring their flair to 2000 AD.

The Nashville Symphony and the musicians' union have reached agreement on a long-term pact that will mean raises for the musicians and needed labor peace for both sides.
The Symphony announced the four-year agreement with the Nashville Musicians Association in a press release on Monday evening.
The agreement, which goes into effect immediately, provides 3 percent pay increases for the first two years of the deal. The musicians may enter into a wage renegotiation for each of the last two years of the deal.
Last year, with the Schermerhorn Symphony Center facing foreclosure, the musicians took a 15 percent pay reduction and worked on a one-year deal.
"We are thrilled that we have reached an agreement which recognizes our musicians' critical importance to our organization and the sacrifices they have made," Nashville Symphony president & CEO Alan Valentine said in a prepared statement. "We look forward to working with our immensely talented orchestra as we continue to focus on restoring the Nashville Symphony to full fiscal health, and we are grateful for our musicians' continued commitment to that goal."
The labor deal comes amid a year on the upswing for the Nashville Symphony, which reported gains in fundraising and ticket sales. The organization had to tighten its belt last year when benefactor Martha Ingram stepped in to stave off foreclosure and the nonprofit organization's banks forgave millions in debt.
The 2013-14 season saw the Nashville Symphony sell 166,000 tickets, which was a 26 percent increase from the previous season. Fundraising is up 71 percent to more than $6 million.
An audit released earlier this year showed the Symphony had reduced its debt to under $23 million and cut operating expenses by $10 million. In addition to musicians, Symphony executives, including Valentine, also took pay cuts.
"The Nashville Symphony has experienced a significant turnaround in the past year, made possible in large part because of the genuine spirit of teamwork and cooperation we have established with our musicians," Valentine said. "This agreement reflects the strength of that spirit, and we are now poised to deliver another year of outstanding music and community engagement programs to the people of Middle Tennessee."

As of now, state elections officials have reported that just shy of 6.5 million votes were cast in the duel between Brown and Republican Neel Kashkari.
That means that backers of any potential 2016 or 2018 ballot measures to write state law could qualify their initiative for the ballot with as few as 325,000 valid signatures. Compare that with the existing threshold for a statutory initiative, which is 504,760.
Big, big difference.
"It's going to cost a lot less to qualify for the ballot," said Beth Miller, a GOP political strategist who was a top aide to former Secretary of State Bill Jones.
For initiatives that seek to rewrite the state constitution, California's governance blueprint, the threshold for qualification could drop to close to 521,000 signatures -- compared with its current level of 807,615.
And for a coming election cycle where everyone already expects a torrent of ballot initiatives, from legal pot to tax hikes and beyond, these super-low thresholds could make it a lot easier to get an issue in front of voters.
Before anyone sounds the alarm over the potential boost in political power of well-heeled interest groups, consider that low initiative thresholds in 2016 and 2018 could also provide a boost to all kinds of grass-roots political efforts -- efforts, some would argue, that are exactly the kind of populist power envisioned when California created its direct democracy system in 1911.
The actual threshold for initiatives won't be known until a formal certification of the Nov. 4 vote, which comes next month. Still, most expect the dismally low turnout -- now at just a little above 37 percent of registered voters statewide -- to set a new record for low participation in a California gubernatorial election.
Now, consider a couple of other changes the low Brown-Kashkari vote totals could make to the initiative process.
First, backers of initiative efforts often turn their energy and money to the ballot box when they fail to get action on their issue(s) at the state Capitol. Case in point: this fall's defeated Proposition 46, which grew out of a Sacramento stalemate on the issue of loosening the state law that caps pain-and-suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits.
An easier path to the ballot may make activists on an issue less patient with the bickering and negotiating inside the Legislature.
"I think that people who are frustrated with the legislative process will be looking to use the initiative process more quickly," said strategist Miller.
But then consider the law signed by Brown this fall to make small but important changes to the initiative process. Those changes will allow initiative backers more time to gather signatures; a chance for the backers to amend their proposal even after filing it with state officials; and a window of time for legislators and the governor to enact a law rather than see the issue head to the ballot.
Of course, even this tweak in election law would be impacted by the expected new, and low, threshold for initiatives: It mandates legislative hearings on a proposal after it has collected just 25 percent of the signatures needed for qualification. At current rates, that means that anyone who can get about 82,000 signatures will force the Legislature to engage on the issue.
The threshold for getting an initiative on the ballot in California has waxed and waned in the past. But don't forget, the last record low turnout for a gubernatorial election was in 2002 ... which made it easier for critics of then-Gov. Gray Davis to qualify the recall measure that removed them from office in 2003.
The new low bar for initiatives will last only for two election cycles. But even those election cycles will be different from earlier eras, under a still hotly debated change that was pushed through by Democrats in 2011: moving all initiative and referendum propositions to November ballots and off June statewide ballots. Translation: The statewide ballot on Nov. 8, 2016 and Nov. 6, 2018 could be long -- very long.
A powerful Congressional panel approved a proposal to increase military veterans' access to medical marijuana on Thursday.
By a vote of 24 to 7, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment that would allow doctors in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) to recommend medical cannabis in states where it is legal.
Under a current internal V.A. administrative directive, federal policy is “to prohibit V.A. providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a Veteran's participation in a State marijuana program.” That policy technically expired on January 31, 2016, but it remains in effect in practice until such time as the department institutes a new one replacing it.
The amendment approved by senators — now attached to the budget bill that funds V.A. — would prevent the department from spending any money to enforce the internal prohibition on doctor-recommended cannabis in legal states.
The committee adopted a similar amendment last year by a vote of 20 to 10, and the full House did so by a vote of 233 to 189. But the provisions were later stripped out by the conference committee that merged both chambers' separate legislation into a final V.A. appropriations bill.
The amendment “simply allows the V.A. patients in states with medical marijuana programs to discuss that option with their V.A. doctor of physician,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the measure's lead sponsor said in a brief debate before the vote.
“We often talk about how our soldiers stand up for us, and we need to stand up for them,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), the amendment's co-sponsor, added.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), whose state's voters strongly approved a medical cannabis ballot measure last November, voted against the veterans amendment but acknowledged, “I see where the trends are heading on this topic.”
Sen. John Boozman (R-AR) initially voted yes on the amendment during the roll call vote but then asked to switch their vote to no.
Many military veterans use marijuana to treat physical pain resulting from war wounds or to manage the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The American Legion, which represents more than 2 million veterans, endorsed rescheduling marijuana in a resolution adopted at its conference last year, and has pressured the Trump administration to support a change in cannabis's status under federal law.
Veterans Affairs Sec. David Shulkin has made comments on a number of occasions indicating that they believe medical marijuana has the potential to help veterans but that current federal policy has erected roadblocks to research and access.

Google, a data mining and extraction company that sells personal information to advertisers, has hit upon a neat idea to consolidate its already-dominant business: block competitors from appearing on its platforms.
The company announced that it would establish an ad blocker for the Chrome web browser, which has become the most popular in America, employed by nearly half of the nation's web users. The ad blocker — which Google is calling a “filter” — would roll out next year, and would be the default setting for Chrome when fully functional. In other words, the normal user sparking up their Chrome browser simply wouldn't see the ads blocked by the system.
What ads would get blocked? The ones not sold by Google, for the most part.
The Chrome ad blocker would stop ads that provide a “frustrating experience,” according to Google's blog post announcing the change. The ads blocked would match the standards produced by the Coalition for Better Ads, an ostensibly third-party group. For sure, the ads that would get blocked are intrusive: auto-players with sound, countdown ads that make you wait 10 seconds to get to the site, large “sticky” ads that remain constant even when you scroll down the page.
But who's part of the Coalition for Better Ads? Google, for one, as well as Facebook. Those two companies accounted for 99 percent of all digital ad revenue growth in the United States last year, and 77 percent of gross ad spending. As Mark Patterson of Fordham University explained, the Coalition for Better Ads is “a cartel orchestrated by Google.”
So this is a way for Google to crush its few remaining competitors by pre-installing an ad zapper that it controls to the most common web browser. That's a great way for a monopoly to remain a monopoly.
There's more to the story, however. The real goal for Google appears to be not just blocking ads sold by other digital suppliers besides Google, but to undermine third-party ad blockers, which stop Google Ads along with everyone else's.
According to the Financial Times, Google will allow publishers what it's calling “Funding Choices.” The publisher could charge the consumer a set price per page view to use third-party sites that block all advertising. Google would do the tracking of how many pages users view, and then charge them. Users could then “white list” particular sites, allowing ads to be shown on them and removing the charge. If users decided to pay to block ads, Google would receive a portion of that payment, sharing it with the publisher.
Web users will quickly recognize their only options: pay to use the internet, or uninstall the ad blockers and surf the web for free. At least 11 percent of all web users, and perhaps as many as 26 percent of all desktop users, have third-party ad blockers on their devices, a number that will likely grow in the next few years. But it's easy to see how Google's policy would depress ad blocker usage — except for the case of Google's ad blocker, which creates preferences for Google's own ads.
Google has already been found to have paid off ad blockers to keep its own ads intact. But this new policy creates an internet landscape where Google ensures viewing of its own ads, to the relative disadvantage of competitors.
Senior Vice President of Google Sridhar Ramaswamy describes the concept as a way to support internet websites and users alike, by making online ads less annoying and helping to “maintain a sustainable web for everyone.” It's hard to build a coalition in favor of annoying ads. And publishers would be guaranteed a revenue stream, either through charging consumers for an ad-free experience, or from the ads themselves. So the policy aligns the interests of virtually everyone on the web content side.
Improving Google's bottom line and crushing anyone who tries to compete is just a nice side benefit.
With the Federal Trade Commission still at just two members for the foreseeable future, and the acting chairperson favoring a laissez-faire approach to internet oligopolies, it's unlikely any action will be taken in the near term to stop Google from operating as what former FTC official Jonathan Kanter calls “prosecutor, judge, and jury for ad quality.”
Other experts believe that the Department of Justice might take the lead in antitrust enforcement against Google, especially in light of such a forcing event. That's especially true if the department's antitrust division sees the Coalition for Better Ads as a cartel, which the FTC does not typically enforce.
In a New York Times op-ed in April, author Jonathan Taplin laid out the path forward for regulators: It's time to break up the Alphabet.
Raviv Drucker is a prominent Israeli journalist and political analyst with their own program (co-hosted) on Channel 10 News. He's one of my favorites, because he's supremely well informed, doesn't suffer fools (gladly or otherwise) and back in the day was generous with their knowledge toward novice journalists who speak Hebrew with a weird accent (could be me; I'm not saying…). Below is the blog post they published on Friday in response to the claim, put out by Tzipi Livni and Yair Lapid, that the (still unofficial) collapse of the Kerry-sponsored talks is all the fault of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. The tone here is one of sarcasm, rage, and deep sadness. A note on the translation: Israeli journalists generally refer to Abbas as Abu Mazen, which is their kunya. (Translated with permission of the author.)
Yair Lapid issued a statement: Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas] is the one at fault. They made a demand that was completely beyond the realm of acceptability. Israel is committed to the diplomatic process — of course we're committed — but there is no way to make peace with a man like Abu Mazen. The people in Tzipi Livni's inner circle are also saying that Netanyahu came a long way [in these negotiations] and Livni is angry — really boiling mad — at Abu Mazen for blowing the whole thing up.
These two representatives of the governing coalition's so-called peace camp have set a new record in hypocrisy and revulsion. Their spin and self-delusion are nauseating, and are for only one purpose — strengthening their positions in the government. And the Israeli public will pay a heavy price for their venality. Ehud Barak could learn a thing or two from these novice politicians.
Just a few facts — not that facts are of any particular interest to Livni or Lapid. Israel blatantly and flagrantly violated the terms of agreement with the Palestinians. Upon entering these negotiations, the Palestinians agreed to shelve two of their three conditions (withdrawal to the pre-1967 boundaries and a freeze on settlement building). In return, the delighted Netanyahu committed “only” to the release of Palestinian prisoners. And then they simply did not release the fourth round of prisoners. Why? Just because. Because they felt like it. Instead, they decided that they had a condition: Abu Mazen should commit to keeping the negotiations going. Did you hear Livni and Lapid, the Knights of the Diplomatic Process, say anything about this flagrant violation of the agreement? Nope. That might have caused tension between them and Netanyahu. Heaven forbid. And then Abu Mazen “blew everything up” by submitting requests to join 15 international organizations under the auspices of the UN. Wow, what a painful violation. Once upon a time the Palestinian Authority was held responsible for releasing terrorists, or for turning a blind eye to information about terror attacks. Now their terrible violation is submitting requests to join international organizations. What a catastrophe. It's a good thing we have 200 atom bombs to protect us from this threat to our existence.
Livni is not angry at Netanyahu for making a joke out of the negotiations, or for being responsible for more settlement growth than at any time in the history of the occupation. Lapid is not “boiling mad” because Israel suddenly made its security demands so onerous that it was impossible for Abu Mazen to meet them. Livni has nothing to say to the Israeli public about the fact that for eight months Netanyahu has prevented them from presenting a map of the negotiations, which have not progressed one centimeter. All that matters is keeping their seat as Minister of Justice while telling us with a straight face that the only reason they stay in politics is for the sake of the diplomatic process.
It's all so depressing.
A group of moving companies in San Diego have banded together in protest of the Chargers move north to Los Angeles.
At least two dozen moving companies from the San Diego area have vowed not to assist the team relocate from San Diego to L.A.
"We decree, henceforth, that we shall unite as a perfect union of professional movers in agreeance to not aid the San Diego Chargers' move to Los Angeles," the group stated on its newly launched website, WeWontMoveYouChargers.com. "Our loyalties to the city run deep. We know our Chargers belong at home right here in America's Finest City."

The group, which also got eight L.A. moving companies to join the boycott, is "totally fine" moving team owner Dean Spanos out of San Diego.
Unable to reach an agreement for a new stadium to keep the team in place, Spanos announced last Thursday that they will move the team to Los Angeles. The team's temporary headquarters will be at an office complex in Costa Mesa.
A 5.5 percent increase in real estate tax assessments pushed Orange County's total taxable property values above the half-trillion-dollar mark for the first time, the Orange County Assessor's Office reported Wednesday.
The county's 2016-17 tax roll totaled $526 billion, with real estate accounting for nearly $506 billion of that.
The assessments are used to gauge how much property tax owners will pay next December and April, when the first and second installments come due.
The increase of $27.1 billion in total assessments means the bulk of local property owners will have a tax hike this year.
It also translates into increased revenue in all Orange County cities to pay for roads, police, fire, pensions, parks and dog catchers. The county, public schools, water districts, libraries and other special tax districts will see increased revenue, too.
Still, the county's 900,000-plus owners of homes, apartments, office towers, warehouses, factories and other buildings will get a slight – make that tiny – break this year. The biggest tax hike allowed for most owners under Prop. 13 will be just over 1.5 percent, instead of the maximum allowable increase of 2 percent.
In other words, the owner of a home assessed at last year's median price of $582,000 will see their or their tax bill increase by about $89 instead of the maximum allowable $116, a $27 savings.
The savings might be more significant for the owner of a $50 million office building: Their or their tax bill will be about $2,400 cheaper this year.
The reason is inflation was a tad lower last October, on which the tax-hike rate is based. Tax hikes have been below the maximum 2 percent in just 10 of the 42 years since Prop. 13 took effect, assessor's figures show. Taxes have gone up in 41 of those years.
Some property owners who had tax cuts in past years due to falling real estate values may see even higher tax hikes this year – some as high as 30 percent or more – due to the market recovery.
Under Prop. 13, county assessors can boost your taxable assessment back to where it would have been had property values not dropped.
Owners of Orange County's 25,000 boats, 809 aircraft and 95,549 businesses also will face tax hikes on taxable “personal” property they own. The countywide assessment for such “unsecured” property is up $297 million to $15.8 billion.
Irvine remains Orange County's most valuable city, with a tax roll of $65.9 billion, the assessor's office said. Newport Beach ranked second with a $50.5 billion tax roll, followed by Anaheim with a tax roll of $41.4 billion.
Orange County's smallest city has the smallest tax roll. Villa Park, population 5,948, has a total tax roll of $1.7 billion.
Lake Forest, home to the Baker Ranch new home development, had the biggest percentage gain in its tax roll this year: Up 8.1 percent. Seal Beach's 1 percent increase was the county's smallest gain.
Tax assessments are pegged to property values on Jan. 1.
Prop. 13 gives real estate owners a huge tax break.
Under the voter-backed 1978 initiative, a home or building's assessment is based on its fair market value when a new owner buys it.
In subsequent years, tax hikes are capped for that owner by the rate of inflation, up to a maximum of 2 percent a year. The 2 percent maximum remains in effect so long as the owner retains title to that property, even when property values are soaring by 20 percent or 30 percent a year.
Residents who disagree with the assessor's property appraisals normally have up to Sept. 15 to file an appeal through the Orange County Clerk of the Board's office. But Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish extended the appeals deadline through Nov. 30 for a second straight year.
Owners with questions about how their assessment was reached can call the assessor's office at 714-834-2727.

It's a story that weaves a tangled web of violence and has had long lasting consequences for those involved. Now, the victim and their family are speaking out in the hopes that the case will show the ripple effect crime can have.
Alondre Cooley lives in constant pain and needs around-the-clock care, a lifestyle the 21-year-old never envisioned for himself. He's paralyzed after being shot in the face in 2014.
"It did change my life. I can't do everything I used to do," Cooley said.
It happened on March 29, 2014 at 11:30 p.m. on Edward J. Nettles Lane in West Montgomery near Freewill Missionary Baptist Church.
Alondre didn't know it, but members of their family had helped police bust a local drug dealer. Enraged, prosecutors say the drug dealer hired their longtime friend and fellow member of their crew, Jacquees Boone, to settle the score and take out a member of Alondre's family. That night, they spotted Alondre walking to their girlfriend's house.
"The victim was walking down the street in their neighborhood and the defendant rolls up on them in their car, sticks a gun out of their window and shoots them once, hits them in the jaw causing them to be paralyzed from the neck down," said Deputy District Attorney Samuel Ford. "He was walking down the street minding their own business and all of a sudden their life changed forever. The bullet entered the left side and traveled down to their spinal cord where it's still lodged."
Alondre's family members also retaliated, shooting Boone the very next day. Boone is now also suffering paralysis.
"A family member snitched on the defendant's friend and the victim was shot as a result of that. The victim's family heard about it and the retaliation came the next day," Ford explained.
Ford says Alondre Cooley was not involved in any criminal activity and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Alondre was able to identify their shooter since the two men know each other from the neighborhood.
A jury found Boone, 25, guilty of attempted murder in February. The trial lasted for two days and the jury deliberated for three hours.
"I'm so glad they found them guilty for shooting me. I didn't want anyone to let them get away with that," Alondre said.
"We had eyewitness testimony and we had the fact that the defendant was shot the next day. We didn't have a whole lot of evidence, but we felt like we had enough to maintain a conviction. So it was very important for our office and for the community that we come back with this verdict," Ford said. "It's unfortunate for both sides. Nobody wins in this situation."
For Alondre, the road to recovery is only just beginning. They spent several months in the hospital and just recently started being able to talk again. Their therapy is painful but he's determined to walk again and move on with their life.
"This changed their whole life, our whole lives. We would have never thought this would happen. They got shot due to something that didn't have anything to do with him. These people get out there with these guns and kill people and hurt people for no reason. He's 21-years-old and bed-bound and they have a 1-year-old daughter that they haven't played with or been able to see reach any milestones. They were a baby when this happened," their sister, Shandra Cooley, said.
"I wouldn't wish this tragedy on anyone and their family. And I'm just so grateful for the Montgomery Police Department and the District Attorney's Office that justice has been served. And I'm just truly blessed to have my son alive," their mother, Sheron Cooley, added. "He's going to walk again."
Members of Alondre Cooley family's accused of shooting Jacquees Boone are set to stand trail in the coming weeks.
"It's just going to show that two wrongs don't make a right but the wonderful thing about our criminal justice system is that the defendant is going to have their opportunity in court to be the victim and whoever shot them is going to have to answer up to their charges," Ford said.

Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday three key members of the national security team for their administration -- signaling they will make good on the hard-line agenda on which they campaigned.
Unveiled Friday were nominations of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor. Sessions and Pompeo would be subject to Senate confirmation, while the position of national security advisor is not.
All three men take an uncompromising approach to national security and differ sharply from the Obama administration's doctrine. The trio indicate that Trump intends to stand by some of their more controversial national security positions from their campaign, rather than appointing more moderate-leaning candidates.
Sessions is most known for their tough stance on immigration, much like Trump, and backed the Republican presidential nominee's proposal early in the campaign to temporary block all foreign Muslims from entering the US -- a position Trump has since walked back.
Flynn has a reputation for a fiery temperament and has courted controversy with their strident positions on Islam and terrorism, as well as their penchant for sending out conspiracist tweets.
Pompeo, who was not a Trump supporter during the primary, co-authored an "additional views" report to the Benghazi Committee's report on its investigation into the diplomatic mission attack in Benghazi, believing the Republican-led committee's report was not hard enough on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.
Despite Trump's anti-Beltway "drain the swamp" pledge, all three candidates have or have had official positions in Washington. Flynn, who was pushed out of the Defense Department in 2014 , runs a firm that does lobbying. And Sessions and Pompeo come directly from Congress, which has a near-historic low approval rating.
But the trio have also served as thorns in their party's side at times. Flynn was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for their contentious management style, according to US officials, though they say it was because they raised warnings about Islamic terrorism. Sessions was a leader of the opposition to the ill-fated Gang of Eight immigration reform compromise bills negotiated by their more moderate Republican colleagues and Senate Democrats. That bill passed through the Senate, but ultimately died in the House. And Pompeo pushed for more strident findings on the Benghazi Committee, which was already widely criticized by Democrats as being a politically motivated witch hunt against Hillary Clinton.
In fact, Pompeo, Sessions and Flynn have been some of the toughest members of their party on Clinton's use of a private email server, with Flynn leading " lock them up " chants at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer and Sessions criticizing the handling of their investigation by FBI Director James Comey.
As attorney general, Sessions would be ultimately in charge of the prosecutorial decisions made on investigations like the one Comey oversaw on Clinton -- and could clash with the bureau director, who is serving a 10-year term. Trump has pledged to have a special prosecutor investigate Clinton, though they have hedged on whether they will pursue that since being elected.
The move to reinforce Trump's tough campaign rhetoric with their nominees comes as their transition organization has made an effort to portray the President-elect as courting moderates for other positions in the administration -- including publicizing meetings with former critics South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, both on the topic of secretary of state. But so far with the exception of GOP Chairman Reince Priebus being named chief of staff, they have drawn from outside the establishment for their Cabinet and advisers.
Hard-line positions
Sessions, Pompeo and Flynn all have taken strong positions on hot-button issues.
Flynn is especially critical of Islamic terror, including a vocal Twitter feed on which they have written "fear of Muslims is rational." Sessions also defended Trump when they called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" temporarily in the face of terrorism.
Trump has since walked back that position, most recently saying they will pursue a policy similar to after September 11 that requires immigrants from high-risk countries, most of which are Muslim-majority nations, to register in a tracking system.
Flynn has also been criticized for their closeness to Russia, including appearing on a Russian television network and sitting alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner celebrating the network, RT. But they have said they didn't take money directly from Russia for their appearance and said they went to tell the Russians to crack down on Iran's involvement in Middle East conflicts.
The willingness to engage with Russia corresponds with Trump's own positions, which drew criticism during the campaign. Trump has repeatedly expressed respect and admiration for Putin, and said they would look to work with Moscow as President.
In addition to their tough position on Clinton's responsibility for the Benghazi attacks, Pompeo has advocated for strengthening the American surveillance apparatus again, calling for the restoration of surveillance powers that were curtailed in bipartisan reforms after the disclosures of Edward Snowden.
"Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed," they wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.
National security experience
Friday's picks come from a variety of backgrounds and have different levels of experience on issues related to foreign policy, national security and intelligence.
Flynn is a former defense intelligence chief and retired lieutenant general, bringing hefty national security experience to the table. But they have also drawn criticism from within defense community ranks for their management style and for their tendency to espouse positions that are outside of mainstream intelligence and defense thinking.
Sessions, who would oversee both a domestic and national security portfolio at the Justice Department, has a long legal career with experience as their state's attorney general and as a prosecutor. In the Senate they served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Pompeo is a graduate of West Point and a veteran of the Army. They have a law degree from Harvard, founded an aerospace company and managed an oilfield service and manufacturing company before joining the House, where they serve on the House Intelligence Committee.
While Pompeo has been active on issues of intelligence, they have no experience from within the actual intelligence community agencies, leaving Flynn as the most experienced member of Trump's team on national security and intelligence. Trump has not yet indicated who they will pick for other key national security posts, including at the Pentagon and to be the Director of National Intelligence.
Flynn will have Trump's ear as their close adviser and will be close to the President-elect in the White House, making it likely that they will have a strong influence over the whole administration's posture.
Vapor recovery is the process of recovering the vapors of gasoline or other fuels, so that they do not escape into the atmosphere. This is often done (or required by law) at filling stations, in order to reduce pollution. The negative pressure created in the (underground) tank by the withdrawal is usually used to pull in the vapors. They are drawn-in through holes in the side of the nozzle and travel through special hoses which have a return path. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a proposal under the Clean Air Act that would waive requirements for systems used at gas station pumps to capture potentially harmful gasoline vapors while refueling cars. The proposal is part of the Obama Administrationâ€™s initiative to review outdated and redundant rules and ensure that regulations are beneficial without being unnecessarily burdensome to American businesses. Beginning in 2013, states that meet the new criteria would have the option to do away with vapor recovery systems at the pump since an estimated 70 percent of all vehicles will be equipped by then with on-board systems that capture these vapors. The result of the proposal would be the continued protection of air quality and public health while potentially saving affected gas stations more than $3,000 annually.
!ADVERTISEMENT!
Since 1994, gas stations in certain areas have been required to use gasoline vapor recovery systems. The systems capture fumes that escape from gasoline tanks during refueling. However, as required by the Clean Air Act, automobile manufacturers began installing onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR) technologies in 1998, making gas stationsâ€™ systems redundant. Since 2006, all new automobiles and light trucks (pickups, vans, and SUVs) are equipped with ORVR.
ORVR works as follows: The gas tank and fill pipe are designed so that when refueling the vehicle, fuel vapors in the gas
tank travel to an activated carbon packed canister, which adsorbs the vapor. When the engine is in operation, it draws the gasoline vapors into the engine intake manifold to be used as fuel.
Vapor emissions from refueling, if allowed to escape, can contribute significantly to ground-level ozone, sometimes called smog, as well as to other types of harmful air pollution.
The Clean Air Act allows EPA to establish criteria for waiving federal requirements for vapor recovery systems on gasoline pumps when ORVR systems are widely available in the vehicle fleet. EPA is proposing to establish June 30, 2013, as the date by which a sufficient portion of the vehicle fleet will be equipped with such technology. By that date, EPA projects that more than 70 percent of vehicles on the road will have ORVR technology.

Fellmongery is the preparation of animal skins for tanning. A pollard is an animal that has had its horns removed. In 1949, official statistics still listed Ireland's “principal products” as including “fellmongery, laces, pigs' heads, pollard and snuff”.
Yet in that same year, 1949, my mother's family moved into the Dublin Corporation house where I would later grow up. A poor, primitive, backward economy could build social housing on a large scale for people who lacked decent homes.
And the rich, developed, globalised Irish economy of 2015 can't.
In the late 1940s, when my family was housed, Ireland was still recovering from the drastic economic effects of the second World War. The average industrial wage was £5.59 a week for men and £2.97 for women.
In real terms, that's less than a third of average industrial wages in 1998 before the Celtic Tiger bubble. Fewer than a third of households in 1949 had more than four rooms to live in. More than 60 per cent of households had no piped water supply. Nearly half had no sanitary facilities – only 255,000 houses had a flush toilet.
And yet the State could build social housing.
Health and education
People were badly educated – in 1950, a grand total of 4,500 students sat the Leaving Certificate exam and the number in all our universities combined was 7,900. The entire output of Irish broadcasting was seven hours of radio a day. There were just 43,000 phone lines in the State, only a third of them domestic.
And yet the State could build social housing.
The Irish economy, dominated by agriculture and food production, was a paltry thing: total exports in 1949 amounted to just £61 million.
Almost all of this went to the UK as raw product – the characteristic Irish export was a live cow in the hold of a cattle boat. In order of scale, the leading Irish exports in 1949 were cattle, horses, fresh hen eggs, ale/beer/porter, chocolate crumb, dead turkeys and tinned beef. This makes tinned beef our leading manufacturing export.
And yet the State could build social housing.
The estate I grew up in, Crumlin in southwest Dublin, was built by the local authority, Dublin Corporation, with funding from the central government. The process actually started in the 1930s, during the Great Depression: 250 acres of south Crumlin were acquired by compulsory purchase in 1934 and the building of over 3,000 houses began more or less straight away.
The project was far from perfect. The houses were too small – most, like the one I grew up in, had just two bedrooms for big (often extended) Irish Catholic families. (Our household, by no means untypical, had three adults and five children.) Services and facilities were slow to follow.
But the rent was affordable and the houses were a hell of a lot better than what most people had before.
My mother had been living (with seven other people) in what was essentially a one-room cottage in the Liberties; my father grew up in a little hovel off the Dublin quays.
The “market” never had and never would give them a decent place to live – the State did so instead. For all the problems, people in Crumlin had a secure roof over their heads and the chance to build a good community. We had homes.
Why could the State do this in the hungry 1930s and the postwar 1940s but not now?
Not because we can't but because, as Enda Kenny put it last week, “interference in the market” must be avoided. The desperation to avoid the simple conclusion that government should build houses for people who need them is about ideology, not resources. Fine Gael, in particular, seems incapable of understanding housing as anything other than a market.
Free-market ideology
And still, after all we've been through, 75 per cent of the Government's promised “social housing” is to be built (supposedly) by the private sector.
There is an almost obsessive fear of stating the obvious – that a large proportion of people will never be decently housed by “the market”. Those citizens need a State that's not afraid to clear the ground of narrow ideology and build on the foundations of real human needs. That might involve relearning another forgotten word – republic.
Department of Justice: Title IX Protects Trans Students From Discrimination
The feds weigh in on the case of a transgender boy in Virginia, affirming their right to self-identify under federal law.
The Department of Justice today jumped into one Virginia transgender boy's fight against discrimination in their public high school.
Gavin Grimm, 16, of Gloucester County, Va., was denied access to the boys' bathroom at Gloucester County High School, despite self-identifying as a boy.
As The Advocate reported June 11, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Grimm against their school district, seeking a court order requiring the school to allow them to use the boys' restroom when the new school year begins.
The DOJ affirmed in Tuesday's court filing that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects the right of transgender students to use the restroom that matches their gender identity.
“I just want to use the restroom in peace,” Grimm said in a press release earlier this month. “Since the school board passed this policy I feel singled out and humiliated every time I need to use the restroom.”
In its filing, the DOJ wrote, “The District denied them equal treatment and benefits and subjected them to discrimination based on sex in violation of Title IX … when it passed a policy banning their continued use of the boys' restrooms because the School Board did deem them to be 'biologically' male,' despite their use of those facilities without incident for seven weeks.
“Under Title IX, discrimination based on a person's gender identity, a person's transgender status, or a person's nonconformity to sex stereotypes constitutes discrimination based on sex. The term 'sex' as it is used in Title IX is broad and encompasses gender identity, including transgender status. ...
“Prohibiting a student from accessing the restrooms that match their gender identity is prohibited sex discrimination under Title IX. There is a public interest in ensuring that all students, including transgender students, have the opportunity to learn in an environment free of sex discrimination.”
The DOJ urged the court to “allow them to resume using the boys' restrooms at Gloucester High School when they return for the first day of classes on September 8.”
Asaf Orr, staff attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, issued this statement:
“We commend the Department of Justice for taking the steps necessary to uphold the promise of Title IX and ensure that transgender students are affirmed and supported in school. Allowing schools to discriminate by forcing transgender students to use a separate restroom is demeaning and exposes them to relentless harassment and abuse from peers. The federal government's position is not only consistent with decades of legal precedent, but also the experiences of many school districts throughout the country that are implementing inclusive policies without incident. As those districts have learned, affirming a transgender student's gender identity is an important part of creating a safe and inclusive school where all students can thrive.”
The ACLU argues that the school's revised bathroom policy also violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
“The school board's policy is deeply stigmatizing and needlessly cruel,” said Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and HIV Project, in its press release earlier this month.
“Any student — transgender or not — should be free to use single-stall restrooms if they want extra privacy. Instead of protecting the privacy of all students, the school board has chosen to single out transgender students as unfit to use the same restrooms as everyone else.”
After Grimm started using the boys' restroom, some parents and other residents of Gloucester County complained, resulting in the adoption of the policy last December, requiring transgender studies to use single-stall restrooms.
 They are currently the only student in the school affected by the policy, which isolates them and subjects them to stigma, the suit argues. The ACLU asks that the policy be changed and that the school district pay damages to Grimm and their mother in an amount determined by the court.
This year brought the discovery of new human ancestor in South Africa, 211 new species in the Eastern Himalayan, and the first new antibiotic in almost 30 years. As 2015 comes to a close, here is a look back at some of the top scientific breakthroughs, discoveries, and announcements.
A new human ancestor: Homo nalendi
In September, scientists announced the discovery of a previously unknown human ancestor, homo nalendi, found in a cave in South Africa. The unearthed fossils represented at least 15 individuals characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied humans. The homo nalendi fossils are the largest collection of a single species found in Africa, adding yet another branch to the human family tree.
CRISPR gene-editing advancements
This year, scientists hit a number of breakthroughs using the gene-editing technology CRISPR. Researchers in China reported modifying the DNA of a nonviable human embryo, a controversial move. Researchers at Harvard University inserted genes from a long-extinct woolly mammoth into the living cells -- in a petri dish -- of a modern elephant. Elsewhere, scientists reported using CRISPR to potentially modify pig organs for human transplant and modify mosquitoes to eradicate malaria.
Hundreds of new species discovered
In 2015, the World Wildlife Foundation published a 4-year report begun in 2009 announcing the discovery of 211 new species in the Eastern Himalayan region, including 133 plants, 39 invertebrates, 26 fish, 10 amphibians, one reptile, one bird, and one mammal.
Free-flowing water on Mars
In September, NASA scientists presented what they said was the strongest evidence yet of the presence of water on Mars: flowing salty streaks of water that vary with the seasons. Scientists were also able to detect the presence of waterlogged molecules, called perchlorates. This discovery makes the presence of living organisms on the planet more likely.
Cancer-detecting blood test
Researchers in Sweden developed a blood test that can detect cancer at an early stage from a single drop of blood. The test can accurately detect the disease 96 percent of the time and classify the type of cancer correctly 71 percent of the time. Differences detected with the test can also be used to help doctors determine the best course of treatment.
First new antibiotic in 30 years
Early this year, scientists discovered a new antibiotic, the first in nearly 30 years, that may pave the way for a new generation of antibiotics and fight growing drug-resistance. The antibiotic, teixobactin, can treat many common bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, septicaemia, and C. diff, and may be available in the next five years.
Map of "epigenome," a second genetic code
In February, a team of geneticists from across the country finished building the most comprehensive map of the human epigenome, a culmination of almost a decade of research. The team was able to map more than 100 types of human cells, which will help researchers better understand the complex links between DNA and diseases.
Brightest galaxy in the universe
This year NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, one of the agency's most powerful telescopes, located the brightest galaxy in the universe to date. The galaxy emits 300 trillion suns worth of light. Researchers believe a supermassive black hole may be behind the galaxy's unusual luminosity.
A new bionic lens
Ocumentic Technology Corp. has spent $3 million toward eight years of research and development and, finally, in May, promised an eight-minute surgery to provide patients with bionic lenses that can improve eyesight to three times better than 20/20 vision.
Changing human leukemia cells into immune cells
In March, Stanford University scientists revealed a method that may be able to force malicious leukemia cells to change into harmless immune cells, called macrophages. This discovery could lead to transforming human cancer cells into macrophages, which can then digest and destroy cancer cells and pathogens.
In almost every technoscientific controversy participants could take better account of the inescapable complexities of reality and the uncertainties of their knowledge. Unfortunately, many people suffer from significant cognitive barriers that prevent them from doing so. That is, they tend to carry the belief that their own side is in unique possession of Truth and that only their opponents are in any way biased, politically motivated or otherwise lacking in sufficient data to support their claims. This is just as clear in the case of Vibram Five Finger shoes (i.e., “toe shoes”) as it is for GMO's and climate change. Much of humanity would be better off, however, if technological civilization responded to these contentious issues in ways more sensitive to uncertainty and complexity.
Five Fingers are the quintessential minimalist shoe, receiving much derision concerning its appearance and skepticism about its purported health benefits. Advocates of the shoes claim that its minimalist design helps runners and walkers maintain a gait similar to being barefoot while enjoying protection from abrasion. Padded shoes, in contrast, seem to encourage heel striking and thereby stronger impact forces in runners' knees and hips. The perceived desirability of a barefoot stride is in part based on the argument that it better mimics the biomechanical motion that evolved in humans over millennia and the observation of certain cultures that pursue marathon long-distance barefoot running without obvious harm. Correlational data also suggests that people in nations that more often eschew shoes suffer less from chronic knee problems, and some recent studies find that minimalist shoes do lead to improved foot musculature and decreased heel striking.
Opponents, of course, are not merely aesthetically opposed to Five Fingers but mobilize their own sets of scientific facts and experts. Skeptics cite studies finding higher rates of injury among those transitioning to minimalist shoes than those wearing traditional footwear. Others point to “barefoot cultures” that still run with a heel striking gait. The recent settlement by Vibram with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit, moreover, seems to have been taken as a victory of rational minds over pseudoscience by critics who compare the company to 19th century snake oil salespersons. Yet, this settlement was not an admission that the shoes did nothing but merely that recognition that there does not yet exist unequivocal scientific evidence to back up the company's claims about the purported health benefits of the shoes.
Neither of the positions, pro or con, is immediately more “scientific” than the other. Both sides use value-laden heuristics to take a position on minimalist shoes in the absence of controlled, longitudinal studies that might better settle the facts of the matter. The unspoken presumption among critics of minimalist shoes is that highly padded, non-minimalist shoes are unproblematic when really they are an unexamined sociotechnical inheritance. No scientific study has justified adding raised heels, pronation control and gel pads to sneakers. Advocates of minimalist shoes and barefoot running, on the other hand, trust the heuristic of “evolved biomechanics” and “natural gait” given the lack of substantial data on footwear. They put their trust in the argument that humans ran fine for millenia without heavily padded shoes.
There is nothing inherently wrong, of course, about these value commitments. In everyday life as much as in politics, decisions must be made with incomplete information. Nevertheless, participants in debates over these decisions too frequently present themselves as in possession of a level of certainty they cannot possibly have, given that the science on what kinds of shoes humans ought to wear remains mostly undone.
At the same time, it seems unfair to leave footwear consumers in the position of having to fumble with the decision between purchasing a minimalist or non-minimalist shoe. A technological civilization sensitized to uncertainty and complexity would take a different approach to minimalist shoes than the status quo process of market-led diffusion with very little oversight or monitoring.
To begin, the burden of proof would be more appropriately distributed. Advocates of minimalist shoes are typically put in the position of having to prove the safety and desirability of them, despite the dearth of conclusive evidence demonstrating that contemporary running shoes are themselves safe. There are risks on both sides. Minimalist shoes may end up injuring those who embrace them or transition too quickly. However, if they do in fact encourage healthier biomechanics, it may be that multitudes of people have been and continue to be unnecessarily destined for knee and hip replacements by their clunky New Balances. Both minimalist and non-minimalist shoes need to be scrutinized.
Second, use of minimalist shoes should be gradually scaled-up and matched with well-funded, multipartisan monitoring. Simply deploying an innovation with potential health benefits and detriments then waiting for a consumer response and, potentially, litigation means an unnecessarily long, inefficient and costly learning process. Longitudinal studies on Five Fingers and other minimalist shoes could have begun as soon as they were developed or, even better, on running shoes in general when companies like Nike and Reebok started adding raised heels and gel pads.
Monitoring of minimalist shoes, moreover, would need to be broad enough to take account of confounding variables introduced by cultural differences. Indeed, it is hard to compare American joggers to barefoot running Tarahumara Indians when the former have typically been wearing non-minimalist shoes for their whole lives and tend to be heavier and more sedentary. Squat toilets make for a useful analogy. Given the association of western toilets with hiatal hernias and other ills, abandoning them would seem like a good idea. However, having not grown up with them and likely being overweight or obese, many Westerners are unable to squat properly, if at all, and would risk injury when using a squat toilet.
Most importantly, multi-partisan monitoring would help protect against clear conflicts of interest. The controversy over minimalist and non-minimalist shoes impacts the interests of experts and businesses. There is a burgeoning orthotics and custom running shoes industry that not only earns quite a lot of revenue in selling specialized footwear and inserts but also certifies only certain people as having the “correct” expertise concerning walking and running issues. They are likely to adhere to their skepticism about minimalist shoes as strongly as oil executives do on climate change, for better or worse. Although large firms are quickly introducing their own minimalist shoes designs, a large-scale shift toward them would threaten their business models: Since minimalist shoes do not have cushioning that breaks down over time, there is no need to replace them every three to six months. Likewise, Vibram itself is unlikely to fully explore the potential limitations of their own products.
Finally, funds should have been set aside for potential victims. Given a long history of unintended consequences resulting from technological change, it should not have come as a surprise that a dramatic shift in footwear would produce injuries in some customers. Vibram Five Finger shoes, in this way, are little different from other innovations, such as the Toyota Prius' electronically controlled accelerator pedal or novel medications like Vioxx. Had Vibram been forced to proactively set aside funds for potential victims, they would have been provided an incentive to more carefully study their shoes' effects. Moreover, those ostensibly injured by the company's product would not have to go through such a protracted and expensive legal battle to receive compensation.
Although the process I have proposed might appear strange at first, the status quo itself hardly seems reasonable. Why should companies be permitted to introduce new products with little accountability for the risks posed to consumers and no requirements to discern what risks might exist? There is no obvious reason why footwear and sporting equipment should not be treated similarly to other areas of innovation where the issues of uncertainty and complexity loom large, like nanotechnology or new pharmaceuticals. The potential risks for acute and chronic harms are just as real, and the interests of manufacturers and citizens are just as much in conflict. Are Vibram Five Finger shoes made for running? Perhaps. But without changes to the way technological civilization governs new innovations, participants in the controversy are provided with neither the means nor sufficient incentive to find the answer.

If The UK Wants People To 'Respect' Copyright, Outlawing Ripping CDs Is Probably Not Helping
from the you-earn-respect dept
If one set out to burn up the credibility of #copyright in a single act, saying there could be liability for CD ripping just might be it. — Matt Schruers (@MSchruers) July 18, 2015
We had two separate stories late last week about copyright issues in the UK, and it occurred to me that a followup relating one to the other might be in order. The first one, from Thursday, was about the UK's plan to try, once again, to push a new "education campaign" to teach people that "copyright is good." We've seen these campaigns pop up over and over again for decades now, and they tend to lead to complete ridicule and outright mockery . And yet, if you talk to film studio and record label execs, they continually claim that one of the most important things they need to do is to teach people to "respect" copyright through education campaigns.My guess is they say this because an education campaign is something they can actually, so they can make it look like they're "doing something" no matter how ineffective it will be. And, you can go back centuries and find that no education campaign has ever worked in magically making people respect anti-copying laws.That brings us to story number two: on Friday, the UK's High Court confirmed that ripping your legally purchased CDs and DVDs to make a digital copy for personal use is no longer legal (something that the government had only "made" officially legal a few months ago). The court even left open the possibility that anyone who relied on the official change in regulations to rip their own CDs might now face punishment for doing so.This court ruling came about after an organization run by the record labels, UK Music, challenged the legal change.Combine these two stories, and you have to wonder what the recording industry is thinking. As Matt Schruers noted on Twitter, this latest court ruling can only serve to destroy any credibility that copyright might have held for people:And this is the part that legacy copyright industry extremists still don't get. You don't get respect for copyright through propaganda education campaigns. You get respect through. And that means respondingto things that people do. People want to rip music to make it more convenient to listen to. You should support that. You shouldn't try to make it illegal. You shouldn't sue your biggest fans. You shouldn't go after people for obviously non-commercial use of works. You shouldn't put ridiculous statutory damages on works. You shouldn't tax blank media. You shouldn't pull works down from the internet because a few seconds in the background contain some copyright-covered music. You shouldn't try to pass laws that limit free expression.And yet, the recording industry does, and then they think that a lousy (and misleading) education campaign will make people "respect" copyright? What are they thinking?

Not a Definitive List...
Often, when you log into your Linux VPS, you are looking to get some work done. However, no one can claim that the thousands of developers who create the software available on a typical Linux machine are always completely serious.
Linux has a history of including some fun "Easter eggs" in its software. In this article, we'll tell you about some fun commands and options to lighten up your day. Not all of them are "Easter eggs", but we think you'll enjoy them none-the-less.
Text Editors
Vim and Douglas Adams
Those of you familiar with Douglas Adams, writer of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, will appreciate a relevant help option included in the vim text editor.
If you haven't already, install vim. In Ubuntu/Debian, you can type:
sudo apt-get install vim
In CentOS/Fedora, you can type:
sudo yum install vim
Open the editor from the command line:
vim
Type the following to access a special vim help menu:
:help 42
What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything? *42* Douglas Adams, the only person who knew what this question really was about is now dead, unfortunately. So now you might wonder what the meaning of death is...
Type the following, twice, to exit vim:
:q :q
Emacs Games
Not to be outdone, Emacs, the text-editor famous for including everything but the kitchen sink, includes a surprising number of games that can be accessed from within the editor itself.
First, install emacs. On Ubunut/Debian, this would be:
sudo apt-get install emacs
On CentOS/Fedora, execute this command instead:
sudo yum install emacs
You can find out what games are available by checking out this directory:
cd /usr/share/emacs/*/lisp/play ls
5x5.elc decipher.elc gametree.elc meese.elc spook.elc animate.elc dissociate.elc gomoku.elc morse.elc studly.elc blackbox.elc doctor.elc handwrite.elc mpuz.elc tetris.elc bruce.el dunnet.elc hanoi.elc pong.elc yow.elc bubbles.elc fortune.elc landmark.elc snake.elc zone.elc cookie1.elc gamegrid.elc life.elc solitaire.elc
To execute them, open Emacs:
emacs
Next, type the Esc key, followed by x (for execute), and then type the name of the game you wish to start:
Esc-x pong
To quit Emacs when you are finished, type Ctrl , followed by x , and then Ctrl and c :
Ctrl-x Ctrl-c
Apt Commands
Apt-get Cows
On Ubuntu and Debian, the apt-get package manager has had an embedded Easter egg for a long time now.
If you type the help command for apt-get, you will get a hint:
apt-get help
. . . . . . -c=? Read this configuration file -o=? Set an arbitrary configuration option, eg -o dir::cache=/tmp See the apt-get(8), sources.list(5) and apt.conf(5) manual pages for more information and options. This APT has Super Cow Powers.
The last line tells us that the Easter egg is active in this version of apt. Type:
apt-get moo
(__) (oo) /------\/ / | || * /\---/\ ~~ ~~ ...."Have you mooed today?"...
Aptitude Cows?
With apt-get's affinity for cows, users may be curious as to whether aptitude , another apt tool, also implements a fun Easter egg.
We can check the help like before:
aptitude help
. . . . . . -u Download new package lists on startup. (terminal interface only) -i Perform an installation run on startup. (terminal interface only) This aptitude does not have Super Cow Powers.
Well that is disappointing. Let's try it anyways though:
aptitude moo
There are no Easter Eggs in this program.
A fairly straight forward answer. But persistence is important. Let's add some verbosity:
aptitude -v moo
There really are no Easter Eggs in this program.
And again...:
aptitude -vv moo
Didn't I already tell you that there are no Easter Eggs in this program?
If you keep adding more "verbosity", you will eventually get this:
aptitude -vvvvv moo
All right, you win. /----\ -------/ \ / \ / | -----------------/ --------\ ----------------------------------------------
It doesn't look like too much. Let's add another "v":
aptitude -vvvvvv moo
What is it? It's an elephant being eaten by a snake, of course.
This is a reference to the book The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
Strange Options for Common Programs
There are some strange options available in some common programs that you may wish to check out.
Insult Users with Sudo
You can configure sudo , used to elevate the privileges of a command, to insult users when they type in an incorrect password.
To do so, edit the sudoers file with a tool called visudo , which edits and validates modifications to the sudo configuration file.
sudo visudo
Near the top, add a line that reads:
Default insults
Save and close the file.
Next, empty the cache that stores your password for a certain amount of time and then mistype your password for a sudo command:
sudo -k sudo ls
[sudo] password for demo: # Type an incorrect password here Have you considered trying to match wits with a rutabaga? [sudo] password for demo: My pet ferret can type better than you! [sudo] password for demo: Wrong! You cheating scum!
Script Kiddie Output for Nmap
Nmap is a commonly used network exploration tool that can be used to perform security audits on your system.
Install it on Ubuntu/Debian with the following command:
sudo apt-get install nmap
On CentOS/Fedora, install it by entering:
sudo yum install nmap
Nmap provides you with the unusual option of being able to output its data in "script kiddie" format.
Let's see what the normal output looks like first, by running the command against the Nmap website itself:
nmap scanme.nmap.org
Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-09-18 17:43 UTC Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (74.207.244.221) Host is up (0.072s latency). Not shown: 998 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE 22/tcp open ssh 80/tcp open http Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.40 seconds
Now, let's enable the alternate output with these options:
nmap -oS - scanme.nmap.org
$tart|ng NMap 5.21 ( http://Nmap.org ) at 2013-09-18 17:45 UTC Nmap $cAn r3p0rt F0r scanM3.nmaP.oRg (74.207.244.221) Ho$t 1z Up (0.071z laT3ncy). Not sh0wN: 998 cl0$Ed p0rt$ POrT ST4TE $ERV!C3 22/tcp opEn Ssh 80/tcP 0p3n HtTp Nmap d0n3: 1 iP AddrESz (1 h0$t Up) $canNed !n 1.34 secondz
Basically, it replaces certain letters with similar looking characters to emulate "hacker" language or leet-speak.
Command-line Star Wars
There are two different network-reachable, command line Star Wars tributes accessible from your terminal.
ASCII Art Star Wars Through Telnet
Simon Jansen, Sten Spans, and Mike Edwards created a full Star Wars tribute in ASCII (text) animated art accessible through telnet. In layperson's terms: you can watch a text version of Star Wars in your terminal!
First, download telnet , a precursor to SSH, if it is not already installed:
On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install telnet
On CentOS/Fedora:
sudo yum install telnet
All you have to do from here is point telnet to the correct server:
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
/~\ R2-D2! |oo ) Where are you? # _\=/_ # \\ / _ \ // \\//|/.\|\\// \/ \_/ \/ |\ /| \_ _/ | | | | | | []|[] | | | _______________________________/_]_[_\_____________________________
When you've had enough, hold Ctrl and ] . You will be given a prompt where you can type "close":
Ctrl-] close
Star Wars Traceroute
A newer tribute to Star Wars has been achieved by Ryan Werber by naming the network hops to a specific address.
If you run traceroute , a program that traces the path of packets to a remote host, you will see the intro to Star Wars in the network names along the way.
Simply type:
traceroute -m 254 -q1 obiwan.scrye.net
The route will begin to populate. After a few stops, you will begin to see the magic:
. . . . . . 15 Episode.IV (206.214.251.1) 77.506 ms 16 A.NEW.HOPE (206.214.251.6) 87.194 ms 17 It.is.a.period.of.civil.war (206.214.251.9) 77.699 ms 18 Rebel.spaceships (206.214.251.14) 78.171 ms 19 striking.from.a.hidden.base (206.214.251.17) 87.624 ms 20 have.won.their.first.victory (206.214.251.22) 86.249 ms 21 against.the.evil.Galactic.Empire (206.214.251.25) 77.505 ms 22 During.the.battle (206.214.251.30) 85.622 ms 23 Rebel.spies.managed (206.214.251.33) 78.121 ms 24 to.steal.secret.plans (206.214.251.38) 77.049 ms . . . . . .
After going through the introductions to Episodes IV, V, and VI, Ryan then continues with other avenues of entertainment:

Installing More Fun
There are a few programs that you probably don't need for any other purpose, but can be fun if you have some time.
Learn from your Typos
If you've ever accidentally typed sl when you meant to list a directory's contents with ls , then you may want to install a program "sl".
On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install sl
On CentOS/Fedora:
sudo yum install sl
Now, whenever you accidentally type "sl" instead of "ls", you'll have to smile:
sl

A train will chug across your screen each time.
Fun with Cowsay and Fortune
If you need some more cheap amusement at the command line, and didn't get your fill of cows from the "apt" Easter egg, you can download cowsay and fortune .
On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install fortune cowsay
One CentOS/Fedora:
sudo yum install fortune cowsay
Cowsay inserts any input into a word bubble and draws an ASCII cow to talk to you:
cowsay "hello, I'm a cow"
__________________ < hello, I'm a cow > ------------------ \ ^__^ \ (oo)\_______ (__)\ )\/\ ||----w | || ||
The fortune program spits out quotations, fortunes, jokes, nonsense that can be piped into cowsay:
fortune | cowsay
________________________________________ / Q: What looks like a cat, flies like a \ | bat, brays like a donkey, and | | | \ plays like a monkey? A: Nothing. / ---------------------------------------- \ ^__^ \ (oo)\_______ (__)\ )\/\ ||----w | || ||
If you're not too fond of cows, you can get other characters as well:
fortune | cowsay -f tux

Conclusion
This guide probably didn't impart any essential knowledge or improve your Linux abilities, but hopefully it helped you relax and perhaps even explore your system a little bit.
Let us know in the comments if you have any other good Easter eggs or unusual, fun commands.
By Justin Ellingwood
After being hit in the head with a bullet shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve, state Rep. Armando Martinez plans to file legislation aimed at reducing or preventing celebratory gun firings.
"If my legislation could help save a life, you know, then definitely that's what we're gonna be looking at doing,” the Weslaco Democrat said Monday in a phone interview from the Valley Baptist Medical Center shortly before they were released.
What exactly that legislation will look like is unclear, but it would possibly work to regulate or prevent celebratory gunfire, they said. The next legislative session starts on Jan. 10.
“Something dealing with celebratory gunfire, definitely,” Martinez said. “But I need to talk to our sheriff's department and maybe our (district attorney) and see exactly what type of ideas they have as well, so that way we can get an idea of how we're going to do it and propose it.”
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Martinez, who said they are “doing great,” was hit in their head with a bullet just north of Weslaco early Sunday morning, while enjoying New Year's Eve festivities with their family and friends. Martinez described the shot as feeling as a sledgehammer “hit them over the head.” Their wife observed a hole on the top of their head, and Martinez was taken to an emergency room in Weslaco. A bullet was found in their skull, and they were transferred to Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen where they underwent surgery to have the bullet removed.
“A couple more millimeters and we wouldn't be having a conversation today,” Martinez said.
The Monitor reported that the sheriff's office has launched a deadly conduct investigation, which Martinez said is still underway. A spokesperson with the Hidalgo County Sheriff's office could not be immediately reached for comment Monday.
Martinez said that there were a lot of people in the area celebrating the start of the new year by firing guns in the air before they were hit.
“I think that's something that definitely needs to change.” Martinez said. “Growing up, we grew up around guns. You know, I have a (concealed handgun license). I'm a hunter. But everybody knows better than to get a gun and fire it up in the air because what goes up must come down.”

Las Vegas has already started looking ahead to next season and they've installed three teams as favorites to follow the Broncos as the top team in the NFL. The Westgate SuperBook in Vegas has the Patriots, Seahawks and Steelers listed as 8-1 favorites to secure the Lombardi Trophy in Houston.
The Broncos are considered a 14-1 shot to repeat while the Panthers are given 10-1 odds to take the final step that eluded them this time around. The Cardinals and Packers join the Panthers at that number while the Bengals slot in next to the Broncos. The Cowboys are ninth at 16-1 while the Chiefs, Colts and Vikings are at 20-1.
On the other end of the spectrum are the Browns. Hue Jackson is considered a 200-1 shot to lift the trophy in their first year on the sideline in Cleveland, which is way below the 49ers — the book's 31st choice at 60-1 — and everyone else in the league.
Doubling its minimum wage, Seattle tried to quote the rockstar economist, who actually warns a $15 wage could risk losing jobs
Thomas Piketty, the economist and author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century, has ignited the economic left in a way that hasn't been seen since the first flames of the Occupy movement. The nerdy, unassuming Frenchman has become the patron saint of the class struggle.
But did everyone read every page of Piketty's entire 600-page tome before quoting it?
Nope, if Seattle's new minimum-wage law is any evidence.
First, the basics: the new Seattle law promises to raise the minimum wage in the city from $9 an hour to $15 an hour, citing the statistic that nearly one-fourth of the city's employees earn less than that. It won't happen all at once: large employers, with over 500 employees nationally, have until 2017 to raise the wage to $15 for their workers, and then raise it every year according to inflation. Small employers have until 2021 to get there, and will be required to pay their workers up to $17.25 an hour by 2024.
The fines can add up for scofflaws: a company could pay a maximum of $20,000 for violating the law.
The push for the higher minimum wage in Seattle far predates the publication of Piketty's blockbuster book this spring. Yet there is no question that this is a coup for labor activists, who have poured a lot of passion and push into the millennial-driven Fight for 15 movement.
The authors of the law were happy to welcome Piketty, the economic data-cruncher and rockstar, warmly into the fold, giving them a quote and a compliment right at the top of the Seattle ordinance:
Whereas, the noted economist Thomas Piketty wrote in their landmark book Capital in the 21st Century, the need to act on income inequality as "[r]eal wages for most US workers have increased little if at all since the early 1970s, but wages for the top one percent of earners have risen 165%, and wages for the top .1% have risen 362%"
One problem: Piketty didn't write that. It appears nowhere in their book. That quote, and those numbers, are from Paul Krugman, in the New York Review of Books, in their analysis of Piketty. Maybe it's the case of potato-potahto: if you've seen one rock-star economist, you've seen them all.

Still, the spirit of the quote in the Seattle bill is sound. In their book, Piketty does make a strong argument to raise the national minimum wage higher from its current, pathetic federal level of $7.25 an hour.
Piketty gives a few reasons for a hike in the minimum wage, which is 80-years-old in the United States.
The most important is to fix income inequality; Piketty is reproachful that the US abandoned the economic golden age of using a higher minimum wage as a lever for equalizing income:
“There is no doubt that the minimum wage plays an essential role in the formation and evolution of wage inequalities … the United States used the minimum wage to increase lower-end wages in the 1950s and 1960s but abandoned this tool in the 1970s.”
In their book, Piketty squarely blames the weak and stagnant minimum wage for playing an "important role" in wealth inequality in the US; they point out that the highest point for purchasing power for the US minimum wage was in 1969, when the $1.60 an hour wage bought $10.10 in today's dollars.
They cheer for various studies on the minimum wage in the US between 1980 and 2000 – most notably by David Card and Alan Krueger – showing that “the US minimum wage had fallen to a level so low in that period it could be raised without loss of employment.”
On the strength of all that, no wonder Seattle picked Piketty as the patron saint of this particular bill.
But there's a catch, some context here that's missing and crucial. Piketty is not completely gung-ho on raising the minimum wage -- at least, not very high. Ever the academic, seeking to be fair, they do offer warnings that, above a certain point, a much higher minimum wage could lead to fewer jobs.
The problem is this: there's raising the minimum wage modestly, which Piketty doesn't think will hurt employment. They believe employers will still hire people at the higher rate of $9 an hour even if they're currently paying the pittance of $7.25 an hour for payroll.

But $15 an hour may be another story in Piketty's eyes.
So is Seattle's plan to keep raising the minimum wage at the rate of inflation every single year -- an "indefinite" time period that Piketty suggests could be harmful to job growth.
Piketty seems warier of the consequences when it comes to sharply raising the minimum wage, or even nearly doubling it, the way Seattle is doing. (Seattle's plan calls for a minimum wage that will rise as high as $17.25 in 10 years, up from $9 in Washington State now).
They suggest that a sharply higher minimum wage, or one that rises indefinitely, could create a "negative impact" in employment, which means fewer jobs:
On the basis of these studies, it seems likely that the increase in minimum wage of nearly 25% (from $7.25 to $9 an hour) currently envisaged by the Obama administration will have little or no effect on the number of jobs. Obviously, raising the minimum wage cannot continue indefinitely: as the minimum wage increases, the negative effects on the level of employment eventually win out. If the minimum wage were doubled or tripled, it would be surprising if the negative impact were not dominant.
In short, Piketty makes an argument for minimum wage as one lever to fix inequality, but they also point out that raising it in certain ways-- as Seattle is doing with cost-of-living increases-- can hurt job growth.
Besides, belying Seattle's bill, Piketty says that raising the minimum wage is not the preferred long-term way to fix inequality. For that, Piketty favors structural changes to make workers more skilled:
The best way to increase wages and reduce wage inequalities in the long run is to invest in education and skills. Over the long run, minimum wages and wage schedules cannot multiply wages by factors of five or 10: to achieve that level of progress, education and technology are the decisive forces.
Piketty, of course, is a theorist and not a policymaker or psychic. While their grasp of the past is backed up with numbers, we don't know if their predictions for the future will be correct. It's entirely possible that employers will be willing to pay $15 an hour, and that it won't hurt job growth. The opposite could also be true.
That means that Seattle will be the testing ground for their theory – and that of many others – that a very high minimum wage will hurt job growth.
It may be that Seattleites are willing to take the risk of fewer, well-paying jobs rather than many jobs that force people to struggle to make ends meet.
That may not be the message that the city wants to send to employers just now, however. And Seattle's enshrinement of Piketty doesn't explore the subtleties of their argument: even if they are effective as an inspiration to fix wealth inequality, they are pointing out the pitfalls as well.  They are saying that the minimum wage is one tool to fight inequality, and there's a limit to its power; investments in education and technology have to do the rest.
It's also a lesson to others who would adopt a vogueish talking point, even one that is widely discussed and analyzed and rooted in appealing economic research: read all the way to the middle of your landmark books when using them to write the law. You may find a surprise.

If the filled plate looks like the symbol, with lots of fruits and vegetables, they said, “then we're good, it's as simple as that.”
The Agriculture Department has created a Web site, ChooseMyPlate.com , that elaborates on the guidance reflected in the plate's design. It includes tip sheets with recommendations like eating fish twice a week and avoiding high-fat, salty foods like salami and bologna.

Officials said they planned to use the plate in a campaign to communicate essential dietary guidelines to consumers, emphasizing one message at a time for the best effect.
The first part of the campaign will encourage people to make half their plate fruit and vegetables. Later phases will urge consumers to avoid oversize portions, enjoy their food but eat less of it and drink water instead of sugary drinks.
Nutritionists often criticized the food pyramid, which was first advanced in 1992, for being misleading or hard to understand. Some gave the plate cautious praise on Thursday.
“It's better than the pyramid, but that's not saying a lot,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University .

Dr. Nestle praised the plate for being generally easy to understand, but they said that labeling a large section of the plate “protein” was confusing and unnecessary, because grains and dairy products also are important sources of protein and most Americans get far more protein than they need.

But they said the emphasis on fruits and vegetables was a significant step.
“Americans aren't used to eating this way, so this is a big change,” Dr. Nestle said.
The plate was created by the Agriculture Department with advice from the first lady's anti-obesity team and federal health officials. The Agriculture Department said that it had conducted focus groups with about 4,500 people, including children, as it developed the plate.
The project, with the Web site and related educational materials, cost about $2 million. That money will also help pay for an educational campaign about the plate over the next year, officials said.
Get really cozy with your favorite downtown environment when you start thinking about the MLS stadium of the future, a structure that could blur the line between soccer home and public park.
The world's largest sports architecture firm, Kansas City-based Populous, and its leading soccer design principal, Bruce Miller, set to work on designing a view into the future, an exclusive look for FourFourTwo at what to expect from MLS stadia in 20 to 30 years.
“Really it is like a concept car,” Miller says. “It is to stir thinking and have some fun with where we think things are going and technologies that we think are really interesting. We let our imaginations go crazy with what the possibilities could be.”
Top 20 stadiums FourFourTwo's 20 best stadiums for soccer in the U.S.
First and foremost, Miller says that future soccer stadiums will firmly root themselves inside the urban core, so that the “edges between what is stadium and what is city become blurred and there is a space that might be a stadium one day and the best public park you could imagine the next, and the day after that there is a music festival.”
With that thought in mind, we've dubbed the Populous creation “Urban Park,” easily transferable to nearly any downtown environment, more so than, say, a baseball field, because of its rectangular geometry. And it fits better than an NFL building due to scale.
While MLS continues to gain traction in North America, Miller sees a trend toward larger buildings and expects in 20 years to hit the sweet spot of stadiums scaling to as many as 40,000 fans.
But to blur the lines between stadium and city, Populous has done two key things with Urban Park. First, you'll see mixed-use towers at the corners. These areas can serve specific city needs — retail and dining, for example —during the day, facing the city streets, and then turn toward the pitch for game day as hospitality areas, a meshing of uses that allows a more intimate seating bowl.
Second, and most striking, Miller says to expect the technology of blended artificial and natural grass to make it so the pitch itself can be in use for far more than just soccer.
“That is maybe controversial because the soccer players want their grass to be sacred, but that is one of the things we took as supposition, is the quality and durability of the pitch makes it able to be used on non-game days,” Miller said.
And from there, Populous had fun with it beyond kids running amok on the grass during a family picnic, designing a completely movable pitch. Miller says the futuristic design includes a pitch that can rise up on non gamedays to reduce the vastness of the stadium for a park-like setting and reveal space underneath for parking, for example. Also, they designed in a stage that can rise out of the “pop the top” pitch, creating a theater or concert venue.
“It will become a community asset with large open space in the middle of the city, and that open space becomes a magnet for people in the city,” Miller says.
Expect a futuristic stadium to also boast the latest technology when it comes to sustainability, which is why Urban Park uses a translucent-fabric retractable roof loaded with photovoltaic panels to create a net-zero energy structure and one that even adds energy back to the grid. And to match the park environment, Miller's team added in zip lining for those off days and a stadium edge that softens into the city with community gardens.
Technology within the seating bowl will change the viewer experience too, with fans gaining live stats about a player as they move across the pitch, enhancing the experience in a communal-style engagement.
And while Urban Park puts a focus on technology, why not go all in on augmented and virtual reality and create a stadium capable of using holographic technology and projection systems to allow fans to watch an away game virtually in the home Urban Park?
The technology could also allow fans to relive past games, whether historic worldwide contests or the home team's big games from yesteryear. And when used as a concert, turn the projection system around to play video on the stands and intensify the experience for those on the field.
With an intimate seating bowl designed for the intensity of a 90-minute game, the future of stadiums will further brand a team as part of the city, creating an Urban Park that blurs the line between city and stadium.

Just in time for Christmas, the Occupy Oakland riots of 2011 have been immortalized in a new video game simulator called, “Riot: Civil Unrest.”
Players can be police, and choose “whether to use smoke grenades, rubber and plastic bullets, tasers or even live ammunition,” among other tactical options.
Or they can be rioters, and “attack authority with Molotov cocktails, fireworks, paper-bombs, rocks, street furniture and the power of the media.”
For what it's worth, hurling a reporter at a police line almost never works.
According to the Merge Games promo, “rather than attempting to popularize violence to a desensitized video game generation, the developers set out to create a game in which force and violence work short term but patience and passive actions yield far more positive outcomes.”
Merge Games say it sold 10,000 copies in the first 24 hours — at $11.69 apiece, with the introductory discount.

The latest attack on Donald Trump is that they once talked of making money in a down housing market, which is exactly what you'd expect from a real estate investor, right?
Apparently Hillary doesn't agree:
When Trump got their wish for a housing crash, millions of Americans lost their homes. This guy can't be president. https://t.co/tnngHNVqoL — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 24, 2016
Sen. Elizabeth Warren jumped in as well last night, saying Trump was “drooling over a housing meltdown” and asking them audience, “What kind of man does that?”
Tonight I called out @realDonaldTrump in not-so-subtle terms. Watch this. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt — Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 25, 2016
Does what, exactly? Buying foreclosed properties and selling them for a quick buck?
Who would do such a thing???
@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2016
Boom.
Yep, Senator Warren is a gigantic hypocrite and engaged in some of the behavior they now criticize. From National Review in May 2015:
They owe at least part of their considerable financial success, it seems, to snapping up these properties in their native Oklahoma and turning them for a profit — though today that's not a practice they endorse for the many people looking to emulate their success. The Boston Herald reported on these purchases during Warren's Senate run in 2012, noting that they invested in “the often topsy-turvy real-estate market of the 1990s” and that their actions “don't seem to square with their public statements about the latest real estate boom and bust.”
And…
Warren bought two homes after they'd fallen into foreclosure. And though they spent money fixing up the Hickman home before selling it, records suggest they sold others at a significant profit without making any meaningful upgrades.
What kind of woman does this? (Sarcasm, of course.)
Earlier in the day, Trump issued a statement defending their past comments, saying he's a “business person” who “made a lot of money in down markets,” which is “the kind of thinking our country needs.”

CPEC toll income to be thrice the budget of Pakistan: BoI
LAHORE: Only the toll income generated by the route of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), after the completion of the project by 2030, will be three times of the national budget of Pakistan, an official said on Wednesday.
“It is on top of the business, economic, and employment creating activities of special economic zones (SEZs), and other industries,” Zulfiqar Ali, director Board of Investment (BoI) said while briefing Lahore Economic Journalist Association (LEJA) a local venue.
“The national investment agency is targeting to increase the foreign direct investment (FDI) to $250 billion for infrastructure development and other industrial activities by 2025, including joint industrial cooperation between Pakistan and China.”
Ali said that Pakistan had already started development of seven SEZs with Chinese cooperation out of which three each were being established in Sindh and Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
“Furthermore, nine more Priority SEZs have also ben approved for Rashakai KP, Dhabeji Thatta, Boston Economic Zones Balochistan, Allama Iqbal SEZ, Faisalabad, Maqpoondas Northern Are3as, Islamabad Capital Territory Model SEZ, Federal Government Industrial Park on Pakistan Steel land at Port Qasim, Mirpur Industrial Zone and Mohmand Marble City, Federally Administered Tribal Areas,” they said.
The BoI chief said CPEC is the second chance for the industrial and economic development of Pakistan after 1960s industrialisation drive. “The CPEC is as important for China as it is for Pakistan,” they saoid.
Ali added that through CPEC and Gwadar deep sea port, the distance between the Jaboti deep sea port of Africa will reduce to only 5 days. “That is the gateway to reach African markets for China that is heavily invested there,” they observed.
Moving ahead, they said the government's recent efforts have resulted in a gradual increase in FDI. “The FDI in FY15 was only U$900 million, which increased to $2.3 billion in FY16 and further rose to $2.4 billion in FY17,” they said adding it was encouraging as the steps taken by the government were paying off in shape of FDI.
They told the journalists that as an outcome of government's negotiation with the Chinese, early harvesting projects of energy sector had already started adding into the national grid. “It is expected that there will be no power outages in 2018 and by 2020 maximum energy will be added into the national grid by 2020,” Ali said.
Replying to a question, the BOI director dispelled the impression that the government was favouring Chinese investors by giving them special concessions. “For the BoI and the government of Pakistan, every foreign investor is equal. Besides, same level of returns on investment is available to the local ones,” they added.

THE GUERRILLA ANGEL REPORT — A Bronx man whose surveillance photo was distributed by NYPD police following a brutal knifing of Jamar McLeod, a man defending their trans woman partner at a NYC McDonald's, has been arrested. Police identified them as Keith Patron, 44, of Morrisania. There is not many additional details from the police at this time.
I reported on the story 2 days ago: “Yup, another vicious attack resulting from a trans person's use of a public bathroom. This time it was the trans woman's boyfriend who was knifed by an irate customer at a Greenwich Village (NYC) McDonald's after they became angry when trans woman Jalisa “JoJo” Griffen attempted to use the women's restroom. A melee with anti-gay slurs ensued and Griffen's boyfriend was cut severely in the face by a razor.

The arrested man's sister is reportedly giving a different account of what happened. They refused to give their name but they supposedly said it was self-defense: “Someone kneed them and hurt them and they were trying to defend himself. The girlfriend was edging on the boyfriend to defend her.”

In another penalty for mishandling a trust established by President John Adams, the city of Quincy will be forced to pay more than $3 million to the Woodward School for Girls and the trust.
In another penalty for mishandling a trust established by President John Adams, the city of Quincy will be forced to pay more than $3 million to the Woodward School for Girls and the trust.
That's on top of the $1 million the city was ordered to pay the Woodward School for Girls and the Adams trust last year. And it's on top of the legal fees the city has accrued in a case that started eight years ago.
So all in all, the city's total expenditures in the case will end up being around $5 million, if not more.
Last month, Norfolk County Probate Court Judge James Menno ruled that the city must pay $2.3 million in damages plus interest to the Adams Temple and School Fund, created by John Adams in 1822, and to the Woodward School, a private girls school in Quincy Center and the trust's sole beneficiary.
Menno has told attorneys in the case he'll decide by Christmas what the city should pay in interest. The amount is expected to fall somewhere between $983,000 and $1.2 million. James DeGiacomo, the manager of the Adams trust since 2011, said Thursday.
“From our standpoint, it's a fair result based on the evidence,” DeGiacomo said.
The trust was established in 1822 when John Adams donated land to the city with a stipulation that some of the income from the land be spent on education. The Woodward School became the beneficiary of the Adams trust in 1953.
The legal dispute began in 2007 when the Woodward School sued the city – the trust's manager at the time – after the school stopped getting routine payments from the trust.
Mayor Thomas Koch on Thursday said they look forward to moving on from a case they inherited from former Mayor William Phelan and that involved administrations spanning five decades.
“It's unfortunate it even happened,” Koch said.
Koch, who took office in 2008, said their administration fought the case in court because they believe the damages being sought were too harsh, and they contend the trust wasn't established to benefit Woodward School.
“John Adams never mentioned the Woodward School in their will,” Koch said.
Patrick Strawbridge, an attorney for the Woodward School, has said the girls school is the proper beneficiary and there's no legal basis to argue otherwise.
In 2011, Norfolk County Probate Court Judge Robert Langlois stripped the city of its trustee duties, appointing DeGiacomo as the new trustee, and said the city mismanaged the trust for 50 years by ignoring prudent investment advice, keeping poor records, making cheap land sales and using some of the trust to pay city employees.
As a penalty, Langlois ordered the city to pay the school and trust $3 million. The city appealed the judgment, and the case went before the state's Supreme Judicial Court.
In July 2014, the state's highest court upheld the ruling but sent the case back to probate court to recalculate the damage amount.
In November 2014, Judge Menno ordered the city to pay about $1 million that was linked to real-estate deals and other transactions not directly tied to the trust's investment history. Menno's most recent ruling that ordered the city to pay $2.3 million plus interest is tied to the trust's investment history.
Koch said they didn't know offhand the total amount the city has spent for legal fees in the Woodward case.
In late 2013, the city said it had already spent about $543,000 on its legal costs in the case and $100,000 to cover some of Woodward's legal fees.
The city now has a sizeable deficit in its court judgments account. This year's budget holds only $200,000 for judgments.
The account also has to fund payments to private property owners who filed claims for property damage stemming from the city's snow-removal operation this past winter.
On Monday, city officials told the city council that the city thus far has agreed to pay $273,000 in damage claims, mostly for fences broken by plow trucks.

Press Conference will be held Thursday at 10:00 AM
Germantown, MD – Yesterday afternoon, an ambulance arrived at Germantown Reproductive Health Services, a late-term abortion clinic in Germantown, Maryland, and transported one of LeRoy Carhart's abortion patients to a local hospital.
The woman had been in contact with pro-life activists prior to their abortion, but continued on with the 2-day procedure. During their second day of the procedure, their husband slept in the care with their three young children while they were inside the abortion clinic.
Video of the incident taken by a local pro-life activist shows that Carhart got into the ambulance and went with the patient to the hospital even though they have no hospital privileges anywhere, and hasn't since 1987.
The woman appeared to be conscious enough to pull a sheet over their head as they were wheeled to an awaiting ambulance. The extent of their injuries are unknown at this time.
This is the second medical emergency involving a Carhart abortion patient this year. On Feb. 7, 2013, Jennifer Morbelli died from complications to a 33-week abortion after Carhart left town and was unavailable to provide emergency assistance to them or their family. Carhart remains under investigation by the medical board in relation to that incident.
“How many more women must be injured or killed by LeRoy Carhart? We need the medical board and other Maryland officials to halt the endless delays and take swift action to protect the public from this shoddy abortionist,” said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. “We predicted this would happen and no one listened. Now it's time for Maryland authorities to buck up and do the right thing before anyone else lands in the hospital or the morgue.”
A press conference will be held by local pro-life leaders to address specific demands for action against Carhart before more women suffer.
The press conference will be held on Thursday, July 11, 2013 at 10:00 AM EDT at Germantown Pregnancy Choices, 13230 Executive Park Terrace, Germantown, MD 20874, which is directly across from Carhart's late-term abortion clinic. Press Conference participants will include the Christian Defense Coalition, the Maryland Coalition for Life, and other local pro-life groups and individuals.

Beyoncé may be an international sensation married to hip-hop star Jay-Z, says Tom Horan in the London Daily Telegraph, but they had a remarkably sheltered upbringing. Raised in a middle-class suburb of Houston by strict parents, the 27-year-old singer-actor attended private school and rarely dated. “People would be surprised as to the lack of experiences I've had,” they say. “When I was 12, 13, I had my first boyfriend till I was 17. I went to their prom, but I had to be home early. We didn't—you know. My mom and dad, they weren't having it.” After Beyoncé achieved early success as a 19-year-old with the group Destiny's Child, their parents made sure stardom didn't go to their head. “We were in a record store, and my song was playing, and I started singing,” they recall. “And there were some really cute guys talking to me and I was like, ‘Oh yeah! I'm hot!' And my mom said, ‘I'm talking to you,' but I kept singing. And so they slapped me in the face! My dad said, ‘What are you doing?' My mom said, ‘She thinks she's hot stuff 'cos their single is out. You are still my child. Now go and sit in the car.' It was the best thing they could have ever done to me, because for the first time, I realized I was losing sight of what was important.”
AT&T Wireless finally announced how it will price the Nokia Lumia 830, which Microsoft bills as "the affordable flagship." Unfortunately, this otherwise intriguing device is no flagship, and now we know it's not affordable either: The 830 will cost $100 with a two-year contract, or $450 if you buy it outright. And I'm sorry, everyone. But that's just too expensive.
I've been sitting on my Lumia 830 and Lumia 735 reviews because I was waiting on the pricing. So I'll get those posted this week, of course, but let me ruin the surprise for the 830: Despite my initial excitement about this handset when I first saw it back in August, it simply isn't worth this price.
Part of the problem, of course, is that the Lumia 735—marketed with a silly "selfie phone" tagline—has risen above and beyond my expectations while the Lumia 830 has done the opposite. I had such high hopes for the Lumia 830, but the camera is less impressive than I'd hoped, and while the device is thinner and lighter than the brick-like Icon, it's also heavier and bulkier than the wonderful Lumia 735. These two devices are night and day in real-world use.
OK, I'll stop ruining my pending reviews. Let's just look at the Lumia 830 pricing and move on.
AT&T Wireless announced this morning that it will be the first carrier to bring the Lumia 830 to the United States. The pricing breaks down as follows:
No-contract pricing is $449.99.
Two-year contract pricing is $99.99. This is pretty much the way most people have purchased smart phones over the past few years, but AT&T is following T-Mobile's lead by offering alternatives ...
Next 18 pricing is $0 down and $18.75 per month, or $337.50 spread out over the life of the 18-month contract.
Next 12 pricing is $0 down and $22.50 per month, or $270 spread out over the life of the 12-month contract.
In the good news department, AT&T is offering a limited-time bonus when you purchase a Lumia 830: You can get a free Fitbit Flex, a value of $99.99.
The obvious question here is: What is the "right" price of the Lumia 830?
And while there will be a lot of debate around this, with people pointing at both unusually inexpensive flagship phones (Nexus 5, starting at just $350 no contract) and other reasonable approximations (iPhone 5C, which is $450, the same price as the Lumia 830), I think there's a better way to handle this. Let's just look at the real-world pricing of other Lumias.
And no surprise here, I just wrote about this in Understanding Nokia's 2014 Lumia Lineup: Pricing.
Sitting just below the Lumia 735 and 830 in the pricing matrix is the Lumia 635. This little wonder can be had in no contract form for just $79.99 on AT&T or $99.99 on T-Mobile right now from Amazon.com, and the normal pricing is $129.99. So that's what the world looks like right below the 735/830 pricing level.
Right above the Lumia 830, we find the Lumia Icon, which can be had no-contract for $499.99 (normal Verizon Wireless version) or as the Lumia 930 in international unlocked version for $465.99 (normally $799.99; it is an import after all). So $499.99 it is. (Yes, it's a different carrier. I can't control how these things are sold, but the closest comparable high-end Lumia on AT&T is the Lumia 1520, which costs almost exactly the same as the Icon, even a bit less.) So $499.99 it is.
Splitting the difference between affordable ($129.99) and flagship ($499.99), we arrive at what the Lumia 830 (the affordable flagship) should cost, with no contract:
$315.
I could have lived with $350, and in that price range, I would have no problem at all recommending this handset. But $450 is simply too expensive, too much money for a device that is neither affordable nor a flagship.
The following is today's most discussed video on popular Chinese video sharing website Youku with over 3500 comments and 420k views within 20 hours of being uploaded…
From Youku:
Yibin County [Sichuan province] group of men beating women exposed by surveillance camera, perpetrator suspected of being deputy captain of the traffic police
Truly completely lawless, barbaric, outrageous!!! Quoted from a discussion forum: They were caught off guard and completely amazed, subconsciously protecting themselves: “Why are you touching me? We are good girls, not out to sell ourselves.” The other party arrogantly replied: “So what if I touched you?” … Ultimately, it escalated into this scene.

坏小子豆豆:
That one wearing red clothes is a security guard, right? What are they doing there? Fuck, standing guard as a lookout? Those who hit women aren't considered men.
zhang53549:
To be honest, such a small security guard like this couldn't be of much help anyway. Don't expect too much. The other side has a lot of power, a lot of people, a lot of money. Can you really beg these 1000 yuan per month security guard to do anything?
洞房不败7256:
What's the big deal, China has always been like this…
路过、蛋疼:
Fuck, are these still men? Are they still worthy of being men? Go eat shit.
國人啊啊啊:
Women are human too!! If they were beaten, there must've been a reason to be so vicious!! If a woman killed your entire family, what would you do? Still pretend to be a saint? Beatings must be differentiated by circumstances! Don't judge everyone [every instance] the same way!! I truly feel disgusted for you fenqing.
翔子雨馨:
Outrageous, are these still men!? If they really are traffic police, then that is really too frightening! Hope the relevant departments will deal with them strictly! Several men hitting one woman, truly animals!
新太平洋AE:
Fucking society! I simply refuse to believe that no one is responsible for doing something about this! Fuck! Once this is posted on the internet, and if still there is no one who does something about this, then society is truly without humanity. The law will punish this, just wait and see! It won't be long before the legal system and channels will definitely report about this matter! Otherwise, do we keep journalists around just to eat shit [otherwise, what are journalists for]?
我想评说:
Early in the morning, four women enter a certain KTV for a get-together and encounter 7 men reeking of alcohol at the exit on their way out. One man tries to molest one of the women but after the woman resists, they are beaten by the 7 men. Another woman asks them if they still respect the law, and the man says “I am the law!” Saw this report on ifeng [a popular Chinese news portal]!
必过2012:
This society has too many Li Gangs.
pxdok:
That woman also hit at the beginning~ They were hitting each other, but in the end the woman was no match against the man!!! Evaluation complete~~~ The man was more uncivilized/brutal.
傻拉吧唧的你:
Faint, don't you understand what happened? The woman hit first, and if the man continued to not hit back, then they wouldn't be a man, he'd be even more useless than the woman. It was all the woman's own fault.
ShadowClan:
Without sound, however good the video is, it won't become big.
Requesting the truth [of what happened]! I especially want to know why these brothers became violent.
UPDATE: This post (Chinese) on a local Yibin online discussion forum has more details. As mentioned in the above translated comments of Chinese netizens on Youku, one of the men had grabbed at one of the women's face and breasts while at the entrance. The deputy captain of the local traffic police is the man with the bag, who did not stop their friend's behavior but suggested that the matter be dealt with inside. The women were later sent to the hospital and suffered broken bones and many other injuries. The local police is reportedly withholding information, which many netizens regard as suspicious.

Story highlights Rodney King is found dead in their swimming pool
Riots broke out in 1992 after the officers were acquitted in their beating
King had said they had forgiven the officers who beat them nearly to death
Rodney King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead in their swimming pool Sunday, authorities and their fiancee said. They were 47.
Police in Rialto, California, received a 911 call from King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, about 5:25 a.m., said Capt. Randy De Anda. Responding officers found King at the bottom of the pool, removed them and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. They were pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said.
There were no preliminary signs of foul play, De Anda said, and no obvious injuries on King's body. Police are conducting a drowning investigation, they said, and King's body would be autopsied.
Kelly -- who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994 -- told police King was an "avid swimmer," but that they were not, De Anda said. They reported the two had just had a conversation and they went inside, but came back out after hearing a splash and saw them at the bottom of the pool.

De Anda said they did not see any drug paraphernalia "or anything that would indicate that Mr. King was intoxicated" at the scene, but a toxicology screen would be performed.
King's beating after a high-speed car chase and its aftermath forever changed Los Angeles, its police department and the dialogue on race in America.
"I am saddened by the death of Rodney King," said Bernard Parks, a Los Angeles city councilman who served as LAPD chief from 1997 to 2002. "Although their beating will forever be thought of as one of the ugliest moments in the history of the city of Los Angeles and its police department, the victimization of Mr. King and the circumstances that followed created an atmosphere that allowed LAPD and the city to make historic disciplinary and community-based reforms that have made for a better police department and a better city as a whole."
"Rodney King was a symbol of civil rights and they represented the anti-police brutality and anti-racial profiling movement of our time," the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement. "It was their beating that made America focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct."
King was 25 and on parole after a robbery conviction in March 1991. In an interview in 2011, they recalled they had been drinking and was headed home from a friend's house when they saw a police car following them and panicked, thinking they would be sent back to prison. So they attempted to flee.
"I had a job to go to that Monday, and I knew I was on parole, and I knew I wasn't supposed to be drinking, and I'm like 'Oh, my God,'" they told CNN.
They realized they couldn't outrun the police, but looked for a public place to stop. "I saw all those apartments over there, so I said, 'I'm gonna stop right there,'" they said. "'If it goes down, somebody will see it.'"
An amateur cameraman caught the scene as four white police officers struck King more than 50 times with their wooden batons and used a stun gun on him.
King said as the officers beat him, they yelled, "We are going to kill you, n***er," although the officers denied using racial slurs.
The video shows King cowering on the ground and attempting to crawl away as they are surrounded by a crowd of police officers. Four of them used their nightsticks to strike him.
King was beaten nearly to death. Three surgeons operated on them for five hours.
The video of the beating appeared on national television two days later, focusing attention on the issue of racially-motivated police brutality.
"We finally caught the Loch Ness Monster with a camcorder," King attorney Milton Grimes said.
Four LAPD officers -- Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer.
But following a three-month trial in the predominantly white Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley, three of the officers were acquitted of all charges. The jury, which had no black members, deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against Powell, and a mistrial was declared on that charge.
Powell's attorney, Michael Stone, said last year the unedited video worked against King and helped prove the officers' case.
"Most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it's the most violent," Stone said. "They didn't see (King) get up and run at Powell."
But African-Americans in Los Angeles exploded in outrage. Rioters ran through the streets -- looting businesses, torching buildings and attacking those who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The violence was responsible for more than 50 deaths and $1 billion in property damage.
On the third day of rioting, King emerged from seclusion to make a plea: "People, I just want to say, can we all get along? Can we get along?"
The violence ceased, but the debate did not.
Nearly a year later, the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two African-Americans were picked for the jury, and King testified. They hedged, however, on whether police used racial slurs during the beating. They told CNN in 2011 that slurs were used, but said they vacillated on the stand because their mother had told them to avoid talking about race.
Koon and Powell were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Briseno and Wind were acquitted.
"It was like ... I just hope we just get one," King said. "I hope we just get one on that. If we get one, we're good. So to get the two, I was really happy."
King also sued the city of Los Angeles.
"Half of them had no sympathy whatsoever," Kelly, their fiancee, told CNN in 2011 about their fellow jurors. "... They just didn't care. Like, 'He broke the law. They deserved what they got.' I told them they were crazy. It was about justice for what happened to him. No one deserves to get beat like that."
The other jurors came around, and King was awarded $3.8 million in damages.
In later years, King had several more run-ins with the law, including a 90-day jail stint in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving their wife at the time. On the 20th anniversary of the beating in 2011, they were pulled over and ticketed for a minor traffic violation.
"The trouble that (people) see me in is a part of my life that I'm working on," they said in 2011. "I'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol. My dad was an alcoholic. The addiction part is in my blood. What I've learned to do is arrest my addiction -- arrest it myself, so I don't get arrested."
In 2008, King appeared on the VH1 reality show "Celebrity Rehab." They also released a memoir, "The Riot Within," in which they describe their difficult upbringing and their reflections on the beating and its aftermath.
"He was a wonderful, sweet man," said Bob Forrest, a Los Angeles-based musician and drug counselor who worked with King on "Celebrity Rehab."
They said King struggled with their sobriety. "He and I would talk off and on. Sometimes they were doing great, sometimes not. They were always gracious, an honest and gentle soul."
"He was a wonderful, kind and gentle man," said Dr. Drew Pinsky of "Celebrity Rehab," who also appears on CNN sister network HLN. "He was at the center of a maelstrom and was able to maintain dignity and really keep their head high in a way that was an example for all of us."
The ranks of Los Angeles police are much more diverse than they were at the time of King's beating. Changes have also been made -- some compelled by the courts -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and how complaints are handled.
Sharpton said in their statement Sunday that they had recently spent time with King discussing the release of their book.
"Through all that they had gone through with their beating and personal demons, they were never one to not call for reconciliation and for their people to overcome and forgive," Sharpton said.
King said last year on the 20th anniversary of their beating that they have forgiven the officers who beat him.
"Yes, I've forgiven them, because I've been forgiven many times," they said. "My country's been good to me ... This country is my house, it's the only home I know, so I have to be able to forgive -- for the future, for the younger generation coming behind me, so ... they can understand it and if a situation like that happened again, they could deal with it a lot easier."
I had originally intended to include Luken Baker here as well, based off a reader request, but this week Baker sent a letter to all teams notifying them that they intend to honor their TCU commitment. They will continue to Pitch (where they bring a Plus Fastball and potentially Plus breaking ball, along with no real present change-up and the kind of Control you would expect of a 2-way High School Player. They also play First Base and has prodigious power with a good bit of swing and miss. Technically he's still draft eligible (unlike Kyler Murray, who actually formally withdrew from the Draft), so like Cavan Biggio a few years back the Phillies, or some other team, could still draft them in the later rounds and try to sign him. That involves going way underslot in the first 10 rounds and risking leaving a lot of money on the table at the end of the draft. Tough to do, generally speaking, but in this draft it wouldn't be like you're passing over much better prospects to get underslot guys.
Ke'Bryan Hayes, 3B - Their father was part of a sneaky good, rarely talked about trade in '89 when the Phillies got Dennis Cook, Terry Mullholland and Charlie Hayes for Steve Bedrosian. Charlie had moments in the Majors, especially in the thin air of Coors Field, but my memory of their Defense is that it was a little rough. Their kid has a lot in common. A similar build at 6'1" and 205lbs. Sam position and some of the same strengths and flaws. Defensively, Hayes moves well, but their arm is more Average and their range isn't huge. Still, they have good reactions and should end up an average Defender. OF some concern is their build. Hayes worked hard to get in top shape this Spring, but they have a naturally stocky build and could risk growing out of the position (though that's likely well off in the future).
As a hitter they have above average contact skills and potential for Plus hitting. They seem to have a very good eye, but that's tough as hell to judge with High School bats. As far as their Power goes, it sounds a lot like Charlie, lot's of Doubles seem likely, but probably topping out around 20 HR's or so. They have a very Line Drive oriented swing and hasn't shown a tendency to sell out for Power. Hayes is probably just a two tool player, but one of those is the Hit tool, which is among the best in this draft.
Hayes could be a Round 2 option with some pretty strong Phillies ties. Word is though that the Dodgers have a handshake deal with Hayes to take them with their First Round or Comp pick for underslot money. Also rumored for the Brewers. Hayes has quite a bit of helium, but this is a very volatile draft and Hayes doesn't have any tools that blow you away, so they could drop to early-mid Second conceivably.
Mariano Rivera, Jr., RHP - Another bloodline player. Apparently their father was some Relief Pitcher or something. Of course, there's a long history of players saddled with famous names as "Jr's" who can't reach the impossible heights of the "Sr's" from Gwynn to Rose to Williams to Jordan (switching sports on you there). This Mo, aside from the name and position is a lot different from their Father. There's no Cutter in their arsenal, though they may also be a future Reliever. This Mo is probably a Round 11-15 pick, though they could conceivably go late in the top 10 rounds (he was picked in Round 29 last year by the Yankees). They got a bit more interesting this Spring when their Fastball gained about 4-5 mph. They mix in a Splitter that doubles as their Changeup and a power Curve. I expect the Yankees to take them again, though he's just intriguing enough to see any team taking a shot and seeing if they can tune their mechanics and get their Control in order. They could also go back to school for their Senior year and go in the 8th to 10th Round next year as an underslot Senior sign.
Travis Blankenhorn, 3B - Another fairly local product, hailing from the hometown of America's Oldest Brewery, this 6'2" 195 lb SS/3B is bound for Third base from here on out whether they go pro or fulfills their commitment to Kentucky. He's a very athletic kid and can probably handle Second Base, but their arm is Plus, maybe even Plus-Plus, so Third seems very natural. Perfect Game threw out an Alex Gordon comp, which isn't bad. He's got the tools to be a Plus Defender or better at Third. Their bat is a ways off though. Not to scare the bejesus out of anyone, but their projection reminds me a bit of Mitch Walding (though I think Blankenhorn is closer to their Defensive ceiling and is a faster runner). Both enter the draft with below average hit and power tools that get projected to Plus. While Walding shows it occasionally, it's never materialized and the same risks are there for Travis. In the video below where they held a workout for various scouts they seem to have a little trouble squaring balls up. The biggest concern seems to be breaking balls, as it is for most High Schoolers. Which is like saying your ship is unsinkable, provided you avoid icebergs. Still, we'd be talking a 3rd round or maybe 4th round pick here, which is a good spot to gamble on a kid with potentially a 5 tool ceiling.
David Thompson, 3B - If you Follow College Baseball, then you're familiar with the name of the masher from the U (Miami). Thompson is sometimes projected as a Left Fielder or First Baseman. They seem to be decent at Third, but the position change largely seems to stem from the same reason he's a bit of a one-year wonder. In 2014 they suffered from Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which required surgery. It worked. They exploded this year for 19 HR's (tied for the DI lead) and 80 RBI's (in the lead by a rather absurd margin). He's 6'2", 225 lbs and they look to be an average hitter with potential Plus or better Power (duh, given their power burst this year). He's not very fast, but they have an above-average to plus arm and could be a solid Defender. The red flag here is the Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Several MLB pitchers have had the surgery. Most have been well into their 30's, and not in need of a fake ID if they want a beer. The results are a mixed bag, but it's hard to tell if the bag is mixed more due to Chris Carpenter being 38 (and others also well into their 30's) or the syndrome/procedure (in the procedure the first rib gets removed to relieve compression on the nerves between the rib and clavicle). I've seen them projected from Round 2 all the way down to 5th or 6th. They seem like a nice gamble, as their bat could play at First if throwing proves to be an issue moving forward. Enjoy the highlights below where Thompson goes yard 3 times in a game a few weeks back. As you can see here, they are very pulled happy from the Right side.

What gave you the idea for using airships to transport cargo in the Amazon?
I was a lieutenant in the Brazilian army in the 1980s and I saw the difficulties of moving equipment around in the Amazon, especially for platoons working in densely forested border regions. The army has a long tradition of using balloons and airships for border surveillance.
What advantages do airships offer?
The Amazon is a very harsh environment and transporting heavy cargo by land is a Herculean task. Waters rise and fall annually and roads get flooded and erode, or get buried in mud. In order to cross streams and rivers, many roads are connected by small ferries. Air freight and river transport are options, but the first is very expensive and the second is very slow. Airships are cheaper than planes and faster than boats.
And environmentally friendly, presumably…
Absolutely. To transport heavy equipment you need surfaced roads from departure to destination, and to build those roads you need to clear the path, tearing down vegetation and disturbing all the wildlife. Roads are terrible for the Amazon's ecology. They are also colonised by people who further disturb the forest with agriculture and hunting. Airships need very little in the way of infrastructure, and ours will be able to stay afloat for up to 20 days without refuelling. They are also much less polluting than planes.

Tell me about your airships.
Our first semi-rigid, crewed airship – a 3-tonne-payload version – will be completed in the coming months. We will then build a fleet of larger airships, each capable of carrying 30 tonnes. These craft will be 140 metres long and 60 metres tall, with a top speed of between 80 and 120 kilometres per hour.
What will you use your craft for?
Reduced dependency on ground infrastructure makes airships ideal for transporting heavy equipment in difficult and fragile regions. For example, our airships could carry hydroelectric turbines, towers for high-voltage power lines or blades for wind turbines with minimal disruption. Lower-impact logging is another possibility.
What kinds of challenges have you faced?
The biggest challenge is overcoming people's fear. When people think of airships, they tend to think of disasters: the explosion of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg in 1937 and the British R101 on its first overseas voyage in 1930, for example. Our airships are filled with helium, which is neither flammable nor explosive. And the materials we use are composite, plastic-like components that do not attract lightning. We are convinced they are safe.
Will the airships entice tourists?
Airships offer excellent views of the forest and rivers. We are not focusing on tourism, but we may develop something for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. We'll have airships ready by then.

Locusts are grasshoppers with some rather unique abilities. Overcrowding triggers their instinct to literally transform themselves.They change their color from green to brown, get more muscular, eat more, mate more and congregate in crowds.
After their transformation, they traverse the land searching for food, colonizing and recolonizing breeding grounds.
Around dozen spcies of locusts have been discovered so far, but only one species live in North America - the Rocky Mountain locust.
They are responsibile for the devastation of crops across the Great Plains from 1850-1890. Interestingly the locusts prefered the cultivated crops to prairie grasses which, of course, caught the attention of white settlers. It is reported that one observer in Nebraska testified a one-mile-high swarm of locusts pass overhead for five days straight. By using telegraph reports from neighboring towns, they estimated the swarm to be 110 miles wide and 1800 miles long, roughly twice the size of Colorado.
Rocky Mountain locust
The Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) was the locust species that ranged through the western half of the United States and some western portions of Canada until the end of the 19th century. Sightings often placed their swarms in numbers far larger than any other species of locust, with one famed sighting estimated at 198,000 square miles (513,000 km²) in size (greater than the area of California), weighing 27.5 million tons, and consisting of some 12.5 trillion insects – the greatest concentration of animals ever speculatively guessed, according to The Guinness Book of Records.
Less than 30 years later, the species was apparently extinct. The last recorded sighting of a live specimen was in 1902 in southern Canada. Because a creature so ubiquitous was not expected to become extinct, very few samples were ever collected (though a few preserved remains have been found in Grasshopper Glacier, Montana). Though grasshoppers still cause significant crop damage, their populations do not approach the densities of true locusts. Had the Rocky Mountain locust survived, North American agriculture would likely have had to adapt to its presence (North America is the only continent without a major locust species outside of Antarctica).

The locust largely afflicted prairie areas, though they existed on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. Breeding in sandy areas and thriving in hot and dry conditions, they were often guaranteed a good food supply by prairie plants concentrating sugars in their stalks in times of drought. Movement of the locusts was probably assisted by a low-level jet stream that persists through much of central North America.
Extinction
The last major swarms of Rocky Mountain locust were between 1873 and 1877, when the locust caused $200 million in crop damage in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and other states. The cause of their extinction was probably the plowing and irrigation by settlers that disrupted the natural life cycle of the insects in the very small areas where they lived in between swarms. Reports from this era suggest that farmers killed over 150 egg cases per square inch while plowing, harrowing or flooding.Because locusts are a form of grasshopper that appear when grasshopper populations reach high densities, it was theorized that M. spretus might not be extinct, that "solitary phase" individuals of a migratory grasshopper might be able to turn into the Rocky Mountain locust given the right conditions. However, breeding experiments using many grasshopper species in high-density environments have attempted to invoke the famous insect without success. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from museum specimens and related species suggests that the Rocky Mountain locust was a distinct and now extinct species, possibly closely related to the Bruner spurthroat grasshopper (Melanoplus bruneri) (Wikipedia).

Patricia Garnett sometimes gets strange looks out in public.
From a distance — toting a baby carrier, pushing a stroller, or with a tiny bundle swaddled to their chest — Garnett resembles any other loving Saint John mom.
But up close, there's a difference. The baby's wide blue eyes are plastic and unblinking. The wisps of hair on their little heads are painted on.
Garnett is known in the community as "the doll lady."
When I started to understand Patricia, I felt like I had an obligation to help other people understand her, too. - Chris Donovan, photographer
"I had people ask me before why I have them," they said. "They go, 'that's not a real baby, that's a doll that they have!' I just don't say anything, I let it go. I don't want an argument with no one."
Garnett, 45, is a warm-hearted west Saint Johner who enjoys reading, puzzles, riding the bus, and writing letters and cards to their friends. But to say their life has been difficult is an understatement.
They suffered brain damage as a baby and has lived with a caretaker all of their life. As a child, they were raped by their father and became pregnant. They gave their son up for adoption and has never met him.
They care for their dolls to cope with the trauma.
Saint John-born freelance photographer Chris Donovan, 22, met Garnett in 2013 when they approached them for a photograph for their popular Facebook group, Humans of Saint John. They struck up a friendship.
"When I started to understand Patricia, I felt like I had an obligation to help other people understand her, too," Donovan said.
'Taken advantage of their whole life'
They contacted their sister and caregivers to discuss doing a photo essay. They were "a little bit anxious about it, initially," Donovan said.
"That's understandable considering that Patricia is in a vulnerable place. They have been taken advantage their whole life: I didn't want to be part of that taking advantage in any way."
With the full co-operation of Garnett, their family, and caregivers, they shot the photo essay, "Patricia's Dolls," in August 2017. In November, Donovan's work won Gold in the domestic picture category of the College Photographer of the Year competition, an international contest for student photographers that gathered 11,000 submissions worldwide. Donovan placed third in the portfolio category, which takes into account a photographer's overall work.
Donovan hopes the award-winning photo story will help people understand Garnett — and treat her, and others in the community who are dealing with difficult circumstances, with more compassion.
Chris Donovan's full photo essay, "Patricia's Dolls," is published below.
Graphics card (GPU) maker AMD is rolling out new software geared specifically for cryptocurrency mining.
As detailed on its website, the “Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute” is described as a beta-level driver aimed at improving the performance of GPUs used for mining, the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new tokens as a reward along the way.
AMD's release comes amid a period of growing demand for GPUs, which is being driven by elevated prices in markets for cryptocurrencies like ether, the native currency on the ethereum blockchain.
Indeed, both AMD and rival chipmaker Nvidia have been taking advantage of the boom for graphics cards.
Both companies have issued statements on the subject in recent days, though in the case of AMD, the company has taken a somewhat bearish stance on the future of the cryptocurrency mining market.
Positions aside, the rush to acquire GPUs in pursuit of profits has had an effect on the revenues for both firms – last week, Nvidia's CEO declared that cryptocurrencies are “here to say”.
That said, the release of the driver – a piece of software that enables computers to communicate with hardware components – signals that AMD is looking to keep miners around, at least in the near-term. AMD published the driver as a beta release, noting that it “will not be supported with further updates, upgrades or bug fixes.”

Most black powder muzzleloaders come with instructions that emphatically warn you to not use anything other than black powder, and any seasoned shooter will tell you that swapping powders can be a recipe for disaster. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources recently put up a photo of a completely shattered muzzleloader on its Law District 7 Facebook page. According to officials, this was one accident was not caused by a malfunction, but rather a lapse in judgement. The incident occurred in Martin County, where an unidentified man poured smokeless powder into a black powder-only muzzleloader. What resulted was the firearm exploding like a grenade and ripping off the man's fingers.
OutdoorHub spoke with Corporal Eric Doane, who responded to the incident. Doane said that the malfunction occurred in the man's backyard after several family members brought it over for practice. Indiana's muzzleloader season runs from December 6 to December 21.
“The man who fired the gun loaded the muzzleloader with smokeless powder which had been taken from 20 gauge shotgun shells,” Doane said over the phone. “He had run out of black powder and had actually cut open the shells and ended up pouring 75 grains of powder into that muzzleloader. Once again, smokeless powder is several times more powerful than black powder, so it would be like putting a 300-grain charge of blackpowder into a muzzleloader.”
The gun had essentially become a pipebomb and exploded as soon as the shooter pulled the trigger.
“His offhand was right there with the breech and the barrel come together and when it blew, it took the tips of their fingers off,” Doane continued. “He ended up losing parts of two fingers on their left hand, but was able save to save a third, which they sewed back on.”
Indiana officials warn that shooters should always follow the instructions on their firearms, but Doane commented that many people have misconceptions about black powder firearms.
“A lot of people just don't understand it,” they said. “Even though it's called a black powder gun and the instructions say to only use black powder, people open up a box of powder and they see that it's a black color, so they think it's okay.”
Thankfully for the shooter, they were otherwise uninjured. Officials described them as an experienced shooter and hunter, so it just goes to show that these kinds of mistakes do not happen only to those unfamiliar with firearms. Doane added that one of the man's sons claimed to have previously shot the muzzleloader—successfully—with smokeless powder.
“There's a good chance that if they shot it before, it may have weakened the seam where the breech and barrel came together,” Doane concluded.
Smokeless powder can be three to four times more powerful than black powder. This allowed for smaller cartridges, which in turn meant that soldiers were able to carry more ammunition for the same weight. Other advantages, such as the ability to burn when wet and the lack of smoke produced by a shot, meant that smokeless powder eventually came to replace black powder in modern firearms.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov's visit to Damascus on Dec. 10-11 drew the attention of many. After the Russian official met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Damascus issued an official statement about the meeting, stating that Assad stressed, “Russia has always stood by the Syrian people and proved that it supports people's right to self-determination and respects the sovereignty of states and international laws.” Moreover, Assad also said, “Syria is confident that any Russian diplomatic action will be based on these principles, and on this basis it deals positively with the efforts exerted by Russia and aimed at finding a solution to the crisis.”
According to the same official statement, Bogdanov said after the meeting, “We always discuss the bilateral relations and the situation between the two parties, and the consolidation of the future relations between our two countries and our two peoples.” They added, “We tackled the crisis in Syria and the political solution, and how we can settle this matter as soon as possible. Our basic and most important mission is to fight terrorism.”
These words have multiple meanings, connotations and interpretations, which must be examined and decrypted.
The diplomatic source who accompanied Bogdanov on their visit, and was informed of their movements in Syria and its surroundings, told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that this visit may only be understood in light of the developments in Russian-Syrian relations in the past three months. This is due to the major change in the nature of the alliance between Damascus and Moscow since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, which was made public with the visit of a high-level economic delegation from Syria to the Russian capital in the second half of October. The Syrian delegation included mostly government officials in charge of financial and economic issues in Syria. It seemed that the purpose of the visit was mainly to get additional aid from Moscow. However, Syrian officials issued surprising statements afterward denying that Damascus had asked Moscow for any financial loans or a "line of credit."
The same diplomatic source said that this formal speech in Damascus aims to cover up that the demands of the Syrian economic delegation to Moscow included Russian loans, or a so-called line of credit of about $3 billion. However, the Russian side failed to meet this demand. This Syrian denial then arose merely to cover up the Russian rejection. Such a rejection can be justified because Moscow is dealing with other pressing priorities at the moment, including the Ukraine crisis and the global decline in the prices of energy resources; more important, Moscow must clarify some points with Damascus, not only on the level of economic aid and military logistical support, but also on the political level, in terms of the general behavior of the two allies regarding the ongoing events in Syria.
Syrians understood their ally's request for political cooperation as a type of new condition for the continuation of economic and military aid. After this development, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem headed to Moscow, accompanied by Syrian officials from economic departments. This gave the impression that Damascus had agreed to the Russian demand. Thus, Russia entered a new phase, enjoying the ability to influence the internal Syrian position and Syria's management of the war raging for over three years.
Then another remarkable and concurrent twist of events emerged, represented by Russia's openness to Turkey and Putin's visit to Ankara. Thus, Moscow suddenly gained ownership of most of the trump cards to deal with the parties of the Syrian crisis.
It is in this context that Bogdanov's movement became clearer. The official came to Beirut but did not go directly to Damascus. They went to Istanbul instead to meet with some of the pillars of the Syrian opposition there. It is worth mentioning that the “Syria-Istanbul opposition” group is practically affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. It is the group that the former Damascus officials categorically refused to deal with. Moreover, Assad once called them “the Devil's Brotherhood.”
Nevertheless, it was clear that the Russian diplomat succeeded in bringing about a breakthrough in the relationship between the two parties. They were able — thanks to their relationship with Ankara — to influence the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, and in return, they were able to convince Damascus officials thanks to the economic pressure exerted by Moscow on its ally, in a secret and undeclared manner.
The same diplomatic source concluded that it is too early to judge whether the Russian effort in Syria will succeed or not. But it seems that a new phase of pressure on the regime has begun. After the pressure exerted by opponents and enemies, allies and friends have also started to exert pressure. Indeed, this is a more influential and effective practice, and was indicated by a prominent statement by Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Sheikh Naim Qassem — concurrently with the beginnings of the Russian-Syria transformations in mid-October — that “everyone should expect painful compromises to reach a political solution that will save Syria from the crisis plaguing it.”
It is worth mentioning that Bogdanov themselves had met Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, before heading to Istanbul, and from there to Damascus via the Lebanese capital.
Moscow may succeed or fail in reaching a breakthrough in the Syrian impasse. Yet, in both cases, what must be monitored is whether Moscow has become a “partner” in Damascus' management of the Syrian situation or whether it has become even more than a partner!

The Bank of America's holding company, BAC, has directed the transfer of a large number of "troubled' financial derivatives from its Merrill Lynch subsidiary to the federally insured Bank of America. Even worse, the Federal Reserve has supported this transfer even though the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) opposed it.
Story here.
Yves Smith of NakedCapitalism has written an appropriately blistering attack on this outrageous action, which puts the public at substantially increased risk of loss.
Story here.

As it turns out, massive fraud was inherent in almost all aspects of B of A's acquisition of Countywide Home Loans. This article explores the defrauding of shareholders, the fraud inherent in B of A's acquisition of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and the many conflicts of interest that prevailed.
- Advertisement -
BAC's request to transfer these problem-derivatives (CDOs) to the FDIC-insured B of A was a no brainer -- unfortunately the request was addressed to officials at the Fed who meet that description: no brainers. Either that or they are totally corrupt. Any competent regulator with integrity would have said,"No, Hell NO!" Indeed, any competent regulator with integrity would have had two related and acute concerns immediately upon receiving the request. First, the holding company's controlling managers pose a severe problem because they are seeking to improperly exploit their FDIC-insured institution, B of A. Second, the senior managers of B of A acceded to the transfer, apparently without protest, even though the transfer poses a severe threat to B of A's survival. So what exactly do these clowns have in mind? Their failure to act to prevent the transfer contravenes both their fiduciary duties of loyalty and care, and should lead to their immediate resignations. But that's not the worst of it!
Here's the really bad news. First, this transfer is a superb "natural experiment" that tests one of the most important questions central to the health of our financial system: Is the central purpose of the Fed to represent and vigorously protect the interests of the people of the U.S., or is it to protect the systemically dangerous institutions (SDIs) -- the largest 20 banks? Very few Americans will be surprised to learn that the Fed represents the interests of the SDIs even though they are, in this case, directly contrary to the interests of the nation.
Second, it is extremely likely that neither B of A's CEO nor the Fed even thought about whether the transfer was consistent with the CEO's fiduciary duties to the B of A.

Third, reread the Bloomberg column and try to wrap your mind around the size of Merrill Lynch's derivatives positions.

Lower U.S military casualty rates are obscuring the horrors of war.
The human costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are high–and hidden, due to advances in combat medicine, and this masks the ferocity of these conflicts. In Broken Bodies, Shattered Minds: A Medical Odyssey from Vietnam to Afghanistan (History Publishing, June), Ronald Glasser quotes one army nurse in Baghdad: “We're saving the really severely injured, legs gone, blinded, deaf, parts of brains destroyed. You may go home, but you won't be the same as when you left.” As Glasser writes, “Those that the nurse talks about now number in the tens of thousands.”
So the wars' overt cost, the death toll, would be much greater if not for new medical developments that enable the “low” fatality statistics to hide the brutality of these struggles. The wars' signature wounds are traumatic brain injury and multiple amputations, which occur because our soldiers are being blown up by IEDs. Such wounds would once have been fatal, but not anymore, thanks to surgical advances and the transformation of combat medicine. “We have been lulled by our own successes in simply keeping our troops alive–as if death is the only measure of risks on the battlefield,” Glasser writes. “Despite the growing sophistication of our battlefield medicine and the new body armor, the orthopedic wards at Walter Reed are becoming filled with numbers of amputees not seen since the Civil War.”
In Vietnam, “small arm and automatic weapon rounds were…the signature wounds,” Glasser writes, “the wounded bled to death. … Brain injuries … in Vietnam were universally fatal.” Glasser, who served as a doctor there, wrote the bestselling 365 Days (1971) about that conflict.
In Broken Bodies, Shattered Minds, Glasser argues that advances in vascular surgery and improvements in body armor have allowed soldiers to survive awful injuries.
Medicine's structure has adapted to modern war and so have its techniques, leading to transcontinental, anonymous care, “with survival being the single goal.” Glasser cites the innovation of transfusing patients with “whole blood” instead of plasma and new ways of quickly clamping blood vessels, so that “despite the severity and grievousness of the new wounds, death rates have not increased.” They describe the military's latest medical invention, the Forward Surgical Team, 20-person medical units, which travel in six Humvees and whose tents “can be set up in less than 60 minutes,” as well as medical teleconferencing, in which “the focus is only on the injuries and not the patient. There is no time for ethics or moral decisions here.”
As with Vietnam veterans, soldiers also suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Glasser writes that the military is loathe to discuss it, but PTSD results in “more deaths in deployed military personnel from suicide than from combat.”
They argue that “unlike all our other wars, the real legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan is no longer the graveyard, but the orthopedics ward, the neurological unit, and the psychiatric out-patient department.” So with fewer deaths, and during the last administration, as Glasser notes, a shameful policy of concealing military coffins from the media, Americans have been lulled into ignoring the carnage. (He also argues that the lower number of medals handed out for bravery in Iraq and Afghanistan falsely suggests that fighting is now less grisly.)
Why has the tragedy of numerous amputees and veterans with severe brain injuries not captured public attention? Glasser quotes military expert Andrew Bacevich. “Americans notice foreign policy only in the depths of a disaster too colossal to ignore,” says Bacevich. “[There is] an evisceration of civic culture that results when a small Praetorian Guard shoulders the burden of waging perpetual war, while the majority of citizens purport to revere its members even as they ignore or profit from its service.”

Hello there again, this is Russell Davis. You may remember me as the guy who really hates micro-licensing groups. Well, today I want to point out a new issue we have in the indie community. I don't believe it is an issue that has been touched much. I will first get this out of the way. I don't go looking for trouble but the magical curse on me was VERY specific on how I would always run into only the dumbest scenarios in life.
Real life example
I also want to say I love how crowdfunding has provided so awesome indie titles which I sincerely doubt would have been made without crowdfunding. Sometimes, titles have failed because of mismanagement and others didn't quite deliver what was promised and I think any gamer knowledgeable about crowdfunding would be aware of those issues.
Well I hope so...
How about this scenario?: one day you're going through a crowdfunding site because you need to spend money on backing for new prospective video game titles. You scroll through the crowdfunding website and see a game that you've seen cloned a million times over (hint...candy). I clicked on it for whatever reason and visited the page. It was asking for $5K and was about 1/10 of the way in, while only on its 5th day of its campaign. I clicked on the trailer that was on the campaign page and it showed a 30 sec YouTube video showing some gameplay footage. I went directly to the YouTube channel by clicking on the embedded video. I discovered the video had a different company's watermarking on it that wasn't the developer's logo but it was of some other entity altogether.
Yup..
I was confused. For a trailer for a crowdfunding campaign, it had one link and no other information about the campaign? Also, nothing on the YouTube channel seemed affiliated to the crowdfunding campaign and was under another assumed name. I clicked on the link and where did it take me too?... A damn app reskinning site. What is app reskinning, you ask? It is the process of taking a premade game and removing out the audio (sometimes) and visual assets and replacing them without altering the game's code in a large scale.
So, this group, whoever its members are, was going to sell a game that it didn't own, and it was going to buy it from an app reskin site and sell it after the crowdfunding succeeded. The asking price for the reskinned game was $1.5K and they wanted $5K to "produce a game"? Bull!@$#... what I found was a scam, and I realized now that people were buying premade games and selling them and deceiving customers as if they were their own crafted product. Why is this an issue, you ask? Why should I have even bothered giving this a second glance? Well, if you can tell by my previous article, I don't take @$!# laying down and I may have an addiction to conflict itself.
Would you trust this man? I wouldn't... wait a minut...
This was 100% a fraud, and to me, the issue is this: it steals money and confidence from people when it comes to crowdfunding. It is not the crowdfunding spirit to raise money to buy an off the shelf product (and in this case a game) and sell it as your own (it's also highly against crowdfunding sites' policies). Oh, and who do you think is going to support this game for bugs, issues and customer complaints? Because I'm doubtful the individual buying a reskinned application has the skill to provide such service. Inevitably, the game would be abandoned and screw customers over and backers too. This is a bane for the indie game market. We should strive to report this. It's a complete embarrassment to artists these campaigns even exist at all.
I reported the campaign and eventually got this...
Hi there,
This is a message from [exempt name] Integrity team. We just wanted to reach out to thank you for so proactively educating us about the risks of this project. We will be investigating. We rely on the input of whistleblowers like you to help us maintain the health of our ecosystem. Please keep up the great work, and again, thank you.
Regards,
[exempt name] Integrity
That was the end of that campaign... but I worry this may become an issue more so down the line. Customers are savvy but sometimes they are not aware of this sort of complex scams and mobile gaming has such a glut of reskinned titles, it's overwhelming and easy to miss. I don't mind if a game has a similar gameplay style in comparison to another one and still has its own twist. How many clones of a certain bird that obviously has flight issues do we need? 5,000? 10,000? Or how about 1,000,000? Ok... a million is excessive but then again...
This isn't just some coincidence of a flood of cheap prebuilt and reskinned mobile games that are pathetically hoping to make a quick buck without being pure to the art form. This is a real issue, and eventually, we will be surrounded by candy and birds themed games because so many will try this scam and they will never relent.
And neither shall we!
East Coast and Virgin Trains both fell below the national average during April.
Rob Enwiki
The two main London to Scotland train companies were the poorest performers in terms of punctuality last month.
East Coast ran 85.1% of trains on time in the period April 1-27 2013 and Virgin Trains, the West Coast line operator, managed a punctuality figure of 86.0%.
Both companies fell below the national average for the period of 93.0% which was fractionally down on the figure of 93.3% for the same period last year.
Announcing the figures on Friday, Network Rail said East Coast punctuality had been affected by two overhead line incidents near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire and at Grantham in Lincolnshire.
They said a signalling fault at Sandy in Bedfordshire and a fatality near Berwick upon Tweed on the England-Scotland border had also had an impact on East Coast services.
East Coast has been run in the public sector since National Express ceased operating the franchise in 2009.
Earlier this year, the Government announced East Coast would return to the private sector when a new franchise commences in February 2015.
Labour has claimed the Government has made a political decision over East Coast, pointing out that recent Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) figures show East Coast is the most taxpayer-friendly train company in terms of premium payments paid back to the Government against subsidy received.
However, Transport Minister Simon Burns has cited East Coast's comparatively poor punctuality record and their belief that the private sector will do better on the line.
Faults such as overhead wire trouble and signal problems are down to National Rail which has been warned about its performance by the ORR.
What else to say. One of the best Fighting games and has the best Story out of all FGs.
Gameplay:
Tekken 3 was my first Arcade game as well as the game that got me into fighting games.
Even though I played PS2's T5 back in '07 i.e. around 10 years ago. I found the game quite similar and yet hard to learn and eventually hard to master. This game is no child's play. And Namco being famous for producing Hard to learn games, this one is no exception. The gameplay is pretty much the same as it was in older iterations. The major change I would say is the Rage mechanics and how it can change the direction of the game. I seriously don't want to go in details as I know I might be wrong at certain technical knowledge.
Visuals:
Awe just awe. This game looks beautiful. And the best part is, luckily it runs smooth on my GeForce 660 on Ultra. I really appreciate how devs at Namco worked on optimising the game. Seriously the game is just amazing. Akuma looks far better here than on any game.
Community:
To be honest, till now I like the Tekken community atleast comparing it to CSGO (an active CSGO player).
Should I buy it?
Definitely, if you are a Tekken fan like me.
Definitely, if you would like to try a new type of fighting game (For people who have never played a real 3D FG)
Definitely, if you want a kickstart over other laggards.
Definitely, if you want a nostalgic ride to your Tekken days (Targetted towards Indian Bros and girlies as T3 was the hottest thing in our childhood)
Why I bought this game?
No one Cares :P.
Ok if you are really interested, read.
I already told you how tekken impacted my gaming life. It was the first fighting game I played competitively on the arcades. I remember I used to trade coins just to learn Combos. I used to think I was the best Paul player and I could defeat anybody, any character. But then a Lei guy ended my dream with just two blows. I left going to arcades XD. Hell I was too young to cope with that trauma :P. After like 6-7 years I got a PS2 and guess what Game I bought with it. There I played T5 with my buddies. Almost every Saturday we used to play Tournaments at my home where the winner will get a Bottle of Squash Drink lol. And then there came my Schooling due to wich I had to leave playing Tekken. Now you see this was my Nostalgia reason I wanted to buy this game. Now the game has a great story and I have been keeping up with it even though I wasn't playing it as I didn't have a PS3 or XBox360. So I wanted to know what was going to happen to the Mishima Storyline and how an era was going to end .
I am very much satisfied on the the direction of the story. And I am very much excited about the future of Tekken's lore.
PS. I also play other games and I have some games that I rank above Tekken. But this game made me a more competitive player than a casual one. I owe Tekken for this.
PS2. Hell I didn't even talk about the Second Season 🤘

My statement about AC ko1N1337
So a little backstory, I am a coder who likes to exploit different holes in everything that can bring profit. You can check out my profile for my youtube channel but I am sure that most of you know me just by my alias. So for a few months we saw the rise of KevinS, the best player the world has ever seen. Some say they were a joke, other say they are a legend. In reality they just showed that good players can get mistaken for cheaters and get banned. You can watch their fragmovie and say if you think they are cheating. ESEA claim to have the best anticheat out there. While this is to a certain extent true, it doesnt mean that their anticheat or any other can stop people from using software or even hardware (Project Cocaine <3) to win games and profit big time. Now if you are waiting for me to uncover something about the cheating scene, I wont. You can stop reading here. I wont tell you who is cheating from top tier players. There are people who do, it is my policy to not call out clients as a lot of money is on the line. Nothing can stop people who love making profit by doing what they love, like me. So back on topic with ESEA claiming that they own the best AC that is 100% cheater-proof. They will not and can not stop people like me and my clients from playing how we want to play. What you saw from KevinS was a stunt just to show how you can be bypassing the "best" AC for CS for months and get away with it, even more earning easy knives from prize spots. ESEA are filthy liars that just constantly mess up and yet people who pay for their service are delusional enough to believe that they are playing in a cheater proof environment. There is not only me who can bypass everything, there are a lot of other people providing such services based in Russia, Denmark and other countries. Even some cheats are open to the public and the cheats do work in ESEA. Anyone can buy them, an example is xmodus. They have been going on since CSS days and still going strong. You can get it for quite the price and cheat your ass off in ESEA/FaceIt/EAC/ESL. Almost everywhere. Fews and their fellow ESEA staff are all dirty liars using their client to profit and do not give a fuck about their clients. I want to say a few things about ESEA: Their AC sucks, they did not ban based on data in the case of dukii, xenn, KevinS and others. They did it because they claim malicious activity while in fact ESEA is the one doing the malicious activity. They have access to your bank accounts, social media information, and everything else stored on your PC which they use to mine bitcoins.
Developer Update — Get Ready for Mainnet Launch
Emre Tekisalp Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 3, 2017
Toshi's production launch is getting closer as we get ready to move to Ethereum mainnet. Expect to see production versions of Toshi on the app stores next week. Developer versions (i.e. testnet) of Toshi are available for iOS and Android.
This post covers the recommended actions for developers prior to mainnet launch in order to make sure their bots are running smoothly.
Upgrading Your Bot For Mainnet
In the latest release of the Toshi app framework on GitHub, app authors now have a configuration setting to toggle their instance between testnet and mainnet. You can pull from upstream and move your app to production just by updating an environment variable.
Your Username Is Reserved
If you've created an app before today, we've automatically reserved your username for you on mainnet and associated it with your app's ID address. It will be ready and waiting for you when you flip the switch to production, but will not be visible to users there until you've done so.
You can use the same Toshi username and seed in production as you do in development — feel free to toggle back and forth between environments using the STAGE variable.
Next Steps
We'd like to invite all app developers to update their applications this week if possible — or as soon as you can thereafter — to ensure they are mainnet ready.
We're incredibly excited to see real money start to flow over the Ethereum network (with Toshi as a browser), and all the use cases it will enable: remittances, micro-finance, lending, earning money and many more.
We'll continue to ship new builds every week. Please continue to send us your feedback through our community Slack or by responding to these posts.
If you haven't tried Toshi yet, install the Android or iOS client to get started. Developers can download the developer version on Android and iOS as well.
Cheers!
The world's longest-running study of wild parrots shifts focus to a new question: What do parrots say to each other in the wild?
Family ties. Wild parrotlet chicks and mother cozy up in an artificial nesting box. CREDIT: NICHOLAS SLY
HATO MASAGUARAL, CALABOZO, VENEZUELA—Back in July 1985, while studying raptors on this working cattle ranch, Steve Beissinger noticed a pair of green-rumped parrotlets nesting in a hollowed-out fence post. “Parrots usually nest high in the treetops, which makes them extremely difficult to study, but these were nesting just a few feet off the ground,” recalls Beissinger, an ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “I immediately wondered, ‘Would they nest in artificial boxes?'”
Two years later, after experimenting with designs, Beissinger constructed a faux box from a 1-meter-long piece of PVC pipe lined with wire mesh and removable lids on top and bottom. They filled the bottom of the tube with wood shavings, hung the contraption from a post at the ranch, and waited. About a month later, a pair of the parakeet-sized birds known scientifically as Forpus passerinus took up residence. The next year, Beissinger added 40 more PVC boxes, and many were soon occupied.
Today, the ranch's fence lines look like a parrotlet condo development. Pairs are busy nesting, with females sequestered inside the boxes with eggs and chicks. They emerge when their mates return from foraging with crops full of seeds to share with the family, while all parties exchange short peeping calls. Meanwhile, fledglings congregate in loud, raucous groups in the nearby mango trees, also calling for their next meals.
Although Beissinger didn't realize it in 1987, they had launched the world's longest-running study of wild parrots, a project that is entering its 24th year—making it the parrot equivalent of Jane Goodall's long-term study of chimpanzees in Tanzania and Cynthia Moss's elephant project in Kenya. And just as those studies tracking individual animals changed our understanding of chimpanzees and elephants, this one is opening new windows into the minds and behaviors of parrots.
The ranch site “is a phenomenal system,” says Noel Snyder, a retired ornithologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Portal, Arizona, and it has yielded “a gold mine of data” because the birds “can be observed throughout their lives and manipulated experimentally.”
Thanks to Beissinger's nesting boxes, which now number 106, researchers have discovered details of the parrotlets' ecology and life histories, and the project has now entered a new phase focusing on their communicative skills. Last week, researchers led by graduate student and ornithologist Karl Berg of Cornell University reported that the contact calls of wild parrotlet nestlings—vocalizations that function much like a name—are not genetically programmed. Instead, they learn these calls from their parents, almost like human children learning their names, Berg and colleagues reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
Berg's is the first study to provide experimental evidence for learned vocalizations in wild parrots. Because both male and female parrots learn new calls throughout life (in contrast to most songbirds, in which only young males learn), Berg and others say that parrots may be the best animal model yet for investigating how humans acquire speech.
Finding out what parrots are saying to each other in the wild, and why, requires long-term data and a deep understanding of parrotlet ecology—which is what the ranch site provides, Berg says. “You can't just walk into the forest and start swapping eggs between nests” to find out if calls are innate or learned, they say. “You have to know the parents' pedigrees.” Adds Berg's thesis adviser, Jack Bradbury, a behavioral ecologist and professor emeritus at Cornell, “There is nothing like [the ranch site] for parrots anywhere else on the planet.”
Talking back Since the days of Aristotle, people have known that parrots are smart, with sharp memories and an uncanny ability to mimic human words and speech. Like humans, parrots are a social species that has evolved rapid-fire vocalizations to communicate with their conspecifics. In captivity, parrots do not simply react when humans speak to them (something dogs, cats, chimpanzees and other animals do as well); they also articulate responses, almost as if talking back. Sometimes, as Alex, the famous African Gray parrot who was studied for 30 years, demonstrated, captive parrots will even use words in the correct context (Science, 11 February 2000, p. 980). Did Alex really “talk”? Despite their impressive accomplishments, researchers continue to debate the meaning behind their words. Many say that a true understanding of parrots' communicative talents also requires understanding what purpose those abilities serve in the wild and why they evolved in the first place. Why would a bird spend so much time, energy, and brainpower on vocalization, wonders Timothy Wright, a behavioral ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, who discovered dialects in the calls of yellow-naped Amazon parrots. “What is the advantage to the individual of learning all these vocalizations?” Bradbury agrees that captive parrots are “great mimics and clever. But the question was always, ‘Why?' What are they doing in the wild” that would necessitate these behaviors? They have proposed that parrots, which live in dynamic flocks, may be using their vocal mimicry to help negotiate flock separations and mergers. For instance, orange-fronted conures exchange contact calls in late afternoon when recruiting others to their sleeping roosts. Answering such questions with wild parrots isn't easy. The logistics are “formidable,” Snyder says. Most parrot species are long-lived, nest high in the canopy, and travel long distances. They are difficult to outfit with radio transmitters—or even standard bird bands—because some species can tear these off with their powerful beaks. Even telling males apart from females is a chore for most species because the two often look identical. To have and to hold. Steve Beissinger and a colleague set up a mist net near a nesting box; when they catch parrotlets, they band and measure them (inset). CREDITS (TOP TO BOTTOM): NOEL SNYDER; V. MORELL/SCIENCE Enter the ranch site, where Beissinger's original interest was in parrot ecology. “Parrots are one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world [one-third of New World species are at risk of extinction], because of poaching and habitat loss, and yet we know so little about them in the wild,” they say. “Here was a chance to find out something about what they do.” Over the years, Beissinger and their team have banded more than 8500 parrotlets, documented 3000 nesting attempts, and followed the fates of 16,000 eggs. The parrotlets are surprisingly tolerant of the scientists, who monitor the boxes daily, marking each egg with a coded number, and later handling the chicks, weighing and measuring them, and fixing aluminum and plastic colored bands on their tiny legs. Records are kept of every banded bird and its pedigree, so researchers know who is related to whom. In a string of papers published in journals such as Animal Behaviour, Auk, and Ecology Letters, Beissinger and their colleagues reported the parrotlets' complex social system, in which males outnumber females and strongly monogamous pairs will fight fiercely over highly prized nest boxes. (This may help explain why the tiny birds tolerate researchers' handling rather than give up those boxes.) A single bird can rarely defend a nest on its own, so if a parent dies or is poached, the entire family is often lost as other birds move in, kill the nestlings, and take over the box. That finding influenced the drafting of wild bird import regulations in the United States. Beissinger's research laid the groundwork for Berg's communication studies. “We worked out all the ecology, demography, the social systems, the hatching asynchrony,” which means that chicks in a nest can range in age from a few days to 2 weeks old, Beissinger says. “And because we knew all of that, Berg could start investigating the vocalizations,” which they began doing 5 years ago for their doctoral thesis.

It will give you tunnel vision.
It will make you sacrifice many things you enjoy and put them on the back-burner.
It will give you a cynical (and sometimes hateful) view of your classmates.
You will seriously consider the possibility of purchasing a one-way flight to Fiji to retire. (Okay, maybe that was just me).
Recruiting will probably be the most stressful experience of your young life. Worse than college applications, worse than finals, worse than when your high school girlfriend or boyfriend broke up with you. In my case, I remember the pressure being so enormous that my hair was actually falling out.
Plenty of people have better experiences than that, of course. This just happens to be mine. None of this is meant to scare you; I'd like to share something that I wish I had back when I was going through the process.
Had I known about James Altucher's writing back then, I probably would have coped better. They have two rules for staying happy under any circumstances, and both are especially difficult during recruiting season.
1. Be thankful for what you have; 2. Don't gossip.
#1 is always tough under any circumstances, but it's especially easy to feel useless and discouraged as long as you don't have that offer letter in hand. I get it.
So did my dad, who had to listen to my curse-laden rants about how much uncertainty I had about my career and life, not to mention how I wasn't eating or sleeping. What they said gave me perspective. My dad has had a very successful career on the Street, but I never knew their full story of how they broke in during the early 1980s.
When they were my age (he explained), they were still working at Record World and Burger King. They had no money to speak of and couldn't even tell you what a stock was. They certainly aren't coming out of college gunning for front-office finance. They were not on any sort of "path" or "track."
They got their first finance gig on a recommendation from a college buddy whose firm was hiring so many people that it wasn't very selective about backgrounds. They couldn't care less where you went to school or what your major was as long as they could train you.
Yes, it was a different world then--hiring on Wall Street was skyrocketing, and in a lot of ways it was easier to break in. But the fact remained that they had stumbled on something very lucrative and rewarding pretty much by accident! And they had never even HEARD of the phrase "stable, fulfilling career" until I regurgitated it from the mouths of my supposedly knowledgeable undergrad academics.
"I had no idea what I wanted to do," they confessed. "And I don't think most of your peers really do, either--as much as they may appear to. If somebody asked me about a 'fulfilling career' back then, I'd have no idea what they meant!"
...Ahem. Needless to say, I reexamined my place.
This doesn't mean you have to make grandiose changes or bold declarations. Do what James Altucher suggests and spend a few minutes in the morning (you can spare them) counting your blessings. Your college. Your friends. The people and mentors who have helped you get where you are now, and who will help you in the future even if they don't know you yet.
I'm Catholic, so I like to pray in thanksgiving for these things, as well as for the patience and humility to never forget them.
If that's not your thing, throw it all down on paper and add to it periodically. The next time you feel tempted to throw yourself a pity party because you aren't a Managing Director at age 25, it'll keep you grounded.
Thanksgiving may still be a couple of weeks away, but you don't have to wait for the holidays to be thankful for what you DO have.
I promise you...we all have at least a few things. Mine are my current job, my friends and family, my health, my ability to get a table at McSorley's Alehouse, and a beyond-expert level knowledge of the greatest music on earth.
What are yours?
We all know that Mack Brown won't coach forever.
It's just a matter of how much longer that the Texas coach is in place.
Too many performances like last week's 63-21 trip to the woodshed orchestrated by Bob Stoops will likely mean not very long.
And it brings the question of who will be Brown's eventual replacement.
Esteemed Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel was asked exactly that question during a chat for their newspaper this week.
Tramel answered the question in an interesting manner.
They broke down their replacements in two categories: UT's fantasy choices and more realistic choices.
Their picks were the following:
Fantasy list? 1. Nick Saban; 2. Urban Meyer; 3. Pete Carroll; 4. Bob Stoops; 5. Chip Kelly. Reality list: 1. Les Miles; 2. Chris Peterson; 3. Art Briles; 4. Gary Patterson; 5. Mike Gundy.
I'll agree with Tramel with a couple of changes. As good as Bob Stoops is, I don't think the majority of Texas fans could stomach Stoops roaming the sidelines on the Forty Acres. But knowing Texas fans, why wouldn't they think that Jeff Fisher or Lane Kiffin might be interested.
Particularly interesting was Tramel's fifth choice of Mike Gundy, a former Oklahoma State quarterback who now the winningest coach in OSU history.
I'm amazed that Gundy would be interested in the Texas job after coaching their alma mater with Boone Pickens writing checks for all kinds of facility changes.
Instead, I would say that Dan Mullen of Mississippi State would rank as a more obvious No. 1 reality choice. Peterson also would rank high. Iowa State's Paul Rhoads preaches enough defense to make them attractive to the traditionalists.
And a couple of choices who would look good in orange — depending on if they want to go young or middle-aged — can be found in the Pac-12 Conference. How about Washington's Steve Sarkisian and Oregon State's Mike Riley.
NASCAR asking official sponsors for help in finding new rides for Wallace, Patrick
NASCAR is helping to land rides for high-profile, free-agent drivers Bubba Wallace and Danica Patrick, according to sources, including trying to entice its own sponsors to extend relationships with the drivers.
The sanctioning body has taken an increasingly active role over the last 12 to 18 months to stretch sales efforts beyond just selling league assets to identifying joint selling opportunities with stakeholders.
As the sanctioning body of the sport, NASCAR doesn't own teams or tracks (aside from Iowa Speedway), but it has sought ways to package league, team, track and media assets into one bundle to make the sport easier to navigate for sponsors.
The strategy provides a way for sponsors to expand relationships to different stakeholders whereas previously a relationship with NASCAR would have forced the sponsor to strike several separate deals.
Bubba Wallace is seeking a full-time ride in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.
GETTY IMAGES
Sources said NASCAR's business development team has been working to land sponsorships specifically for Wallace in recent months, as the 23-year-old is currently without a team despite being touted as the sport's rising African-American star.
Wallace most recently drove full time for Roush Fenway Racing before their team suspended operations in June.  They are being chased by multiple teams, including Richard Petty Motorsports and Front Row Motorsports, sources said. The sanctioning body has been trying to figure out ways to find Wallace the support it takes to run a full season in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. It typically costs $10 million to $20 million to run a top-flight car in the series.
NASCAR declined comment.
Sources said the sanctioning body is talking to some of its official sponsors about backing or incorporating Wallace in marketing programs, ranging from TV advertising to digital and social media. It's also trying to entice official sponsors to run some paint schemes next year on Wallace's car, another move that could piece together enough funding for the year.
Sources said NASCAR has talked to brands including Coca-Cola, Xfinity and Yeti coolers. Wallace is already part of the “Coca-Cola Racing Family” stable of endorsers, making the beverage giant a natural candidate to further back the driver.
It was unclear whether the funds that would go to Wallace's new team would be part of an upsell by NASCAR, or a move to divert part of an official partner's annual spend to the team.
The sanctioning body also is engaged in identifying possible rides for Patrick, the 35-year-old who has been NASCAR's most well-known female driver for half a decade. Whether those efforts are as in depth for Patrick as they are for Wallace was unclear. Patrick is departing Stewart-Haas Racing at the end of the season.
NASCAR has worked on joint-selling opportunities before. For example, Eli Lilly's program in the sport grew to include an official NASCAR sponsorship on top of its pre-existing team deal with Roush Fenway Racing.
“I wouldn't characterize the 12 to 18 months as an epiphany that they need to combine their business development efforts (with other stakeholders),” one industry source said. “I think it's more that they have evolved. And in the evolution they've gone from, ‘Hey, we're going to sell our own assets,' to, ‘Wouldn't it make sense to try to sell across the ecosystem to create more compelling offers?'”
SCP-216
One of the many compartments of SCP-216
Item #: SCP-216
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-216 currently resides in Laboratory 5. Access requires Level 2 clearance. Insertion of recording devices into SCP-216 is prohibited without O5 approval.
Description: SCP-216 is a 35.6 cm (14 in) high iron safe with a multiple-dial combination lock. The lock has 7 dials each with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. The combination cannot be changed while the door is open. The weight of the device appears to fluctuate in an obtuse manner (see document 88-B).
The door of SCP-216 can always be opened, but the accessible interior space appears to change depending on the currently entered combination. Objects placed inside SCP-216 may be accessed by re-entering the combination that was configured when the object was inserted. Objects retrieved from SCP-216 appear to be undamaged by the device.
It is speculated that every possible lock combination results in a different interior, and that there are therefore 10 million available compartments. It is unknown how many objects currently reside inside SCP-216.
An engraving found on the bottom of the safe reads "3/4". It has been hypothesized that the compartments of SCP-216 are shared with three other devices of a similar nature. This hypothesis is consistent with the findings reported in document 88-B.
Document # 88-A: Dr. █████ Initial test log
- Combination lock set to 6692724 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- 1 notebook and pencil placed inside and door closed.
- Combination lock set to 6692725 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- Combination lock re-set to 6692724 and door opened. Notebook and pencil retrieved from compartment.
Note: "SCP-216 appears to be a very efficient storage solution." - Dr █████
Document # 88-B: Dr. █████ Test log
Testing the effect of inserted items on the SCP's total mass.
- Total mass of unit before inserting item: 935.877 kg
- Notebook and pencil (total mass 350 g) inserted into SCP-216 and door closed.
- Total mass of unit after inserting item: 935.965 kg
Expected mass: 936.227 kg
Actual mass: 935.965 kg
Difference: 262 g
Testing shows that SCP-216 takes on approximately 25% of the mass of its contents, suggesting the mass is distributed evenly between SCP-216 and the three other hypothesized devices.
Document # 122-A: Dr. ███████ Test log
Compartments 0000000-0000206 checked for contents. Compartment 0000000 found to contain traces of sawdust. Compartments 0000001-0000206 found to be empty.
Further testing arranged.
Document # 152-D: Dr. █████ Test log
Compartments 0000332 - 0000398: Each compartment had a body part from █████ ███████, a 28-year-old female who had been reported missing on ██/██/20██. Contents removed for identification and then incinerated. Liver, spleen, and lungs not recovered.
Document # 159-B: Dr. ████████████ Test log
Compartment 0000409: A live wolverine (Gulo gulo; adult male) with a mass of 30 kg. Upon the door being opened, it attacked and killed Dr. ███████ and mutilated two nearby D-class personnel before being shot five times by guards. Autopsy of the wolverine revealed no anomalies.
Subsequent examination of compartment 0000409 has revealed it now contains only loose wolverine hair, with residual traces of wolverine urine and wolverine anal musk.
Document # 160-A: Dr. ████████████ Test log
Compartment 0000456: A fully loaded Glock 19 handgun with a round in the chamber, and one regular flavor Klondike Bar ice cream dessert. The ice cream bar was not melted, cold to the touch and remained so as long as it was in the compartment. It was removed for inspection, and began to melt within 2 minutes. It was placed back in the compartment; the door closed for 3 hours, and then reopened. The ice cream bar was in the same slightly melted state as when it was placed back three hours prior. The ice cream bar was removed, placed in a freezer in the nearby 2nd floor cafeteria for one hour. After one hour it was placed back into the compartment with the handgun and the door closed.
Document # 161-A: Dr. █████ Test log
Chamber 0000501, confirmed to be empty, had one (1) standard Foundation GPS unit placed inside it. When the chamber was sealed, GPS failed. Data from the unit upon retrieval showed that the satellite was unable to confirm source location during this time.
Document # 174-B: Dr. King Test log
Chamber 6162384: 51 apple seeds.
Chamber 1846563: 22 apple seeds.
Chamber 2960104: 9 apple seeds.
Chamber 8585821: 78 apple seeds.
Chamber 1111111: one heavily-decomposed apple.
Document # 152-E: Dr. ██████ Test log
On 04/16/██ all previously checked compartments were opened with the intention of confirming contents. When compartments 0000332 to 0000398 were opened, individual body parts were found corresponding to an unknown male, arranged in the same order as found in experiment 152-D, including the liver, spleen and lungs. All previous traces of tissue from experiment 152-D, which had not been cleaned, were found to have been sterilized from these compartments. Pursuant to request for O5 directive, body parts were placed back into their compartments. Containment procedures currently under review.
Document # 162-A: Dr. █████████ Test log (testing performed by Dr. █████)
One █████████ digital videocamera recorder was set to record and placed in compartment 5500000, oriented so as to face outwards towards the door. The door was closed and compartment 5500001 was opened. Compartment 5500001 was found to be empty. The door was closed, compartment 5500000 was opened again and the videocamera recorder was retrieved.
Upon viewing the recorded footage, Dr. █████ suffered from a transient ischemic attack.
The recorded footage shows Dr. █████ placing the videocamera inside the safe and closing the door. No time passes before the door is re-opened and the videocamera is retrieved from the safe. This is inconsistent with the scene reported by Dr. █████.
No audible sound is present on the recorded footage. A subsequent analysis of the videocamera revealed that several internal components of the camera had been fractured.

On the basis of a politically-massaged summary and a stack of press advisories, the media has blasted IPCC talking points around the world.
Last Friday the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a 36-page document. Called the Summary for Policymakers, it claimed to summarize 14 chapters of new, not-yet-released material.
Those 14 chapters weren't boiled down to 36 pages by an aloof, rigidly logical mechanical device. Instead, human beings were involved. Sixty-five IPCC personnel, out of hundreds, were chosen to perform this task. Favouritism, bias, conflict-of-interest, and political calculation could all have played a role in their selection.
Since each of these 65 people relied on old-fashioned human judgment when deciding which information deserved to be included in the Summary, there's a good chance that another level of bias – conscious or unconscious – was involved.
But the Summary was merely drafted by these 65 people. When they finished their task back in June, their document was 31 pages long and contained 15,589 words. At the press conference on Friday, the IPCC presented to the world a new, improved version of the summary. It is five pages longer, but contains 700 fewer words.
The specific changes are a topic for another time. What's important here is that these changes were made during four days of behind-closed-doors diplomatic negotiations involving politicians and bureaucrats from more than 100 countries.
Unless we're prepared to believe that every last negotiator at that UN meeting was concerned only about scientific truth, the production of this summary involved obvious, multiple competing agendas. At three separate points in the process, therefore, this document was vulnerable to political manipulation.
Yet journalists around the world have told us that this summary is science. Last Friday, one seasoned reporter employed by a major newspaper called the summary “the most important analysis yet” of climate change. Writing in the UK Telegraph, Geoffrey Lean told us the summary is the result of “a mind-bogglingly thorough process.” (His piece was reprinted by the Irish Independent on Sunday and by the Australian Age yesterday.)
Did they mention that this process is unusual in the extreme? Did they point to any other context in which it would be proper – or wise – for political operatives to spend four days rewriting a scientific document?
Did they call the public's attention to the three steps in that “mind-boggling thorough” process in which non-scientific considerations may have prevailed?
I'm afraid not. At the time, Lean had no way of verifying whether the Summary is a sensible and rational representation of the contents of those 14 chapters – they simply took the IPCC's word for it.
But that's not all. How did they verify that the IPCC report was “written by 259 top scientists”? The IPCC is in possession of the CVs of its personnel, but it chooses not to make them public. Nor is there any master list a person can consult in order to determine whether someone is, actually, one of the world's finest scientific minds.
Among the 65 people who helped draft the Summary we find Maisa Rojas. They earned a PhD in atmospheric physics from Oxford back in 2000. That's certainly impressive, and I'm sure she's a lovely and intelligent human being. But Rojas is currently employed as an assistant professor at the University of Chile. How does Lean know she's one of the world's top scientists?
Another case in point is Lisa Alexander. I've written about them before. They only earned their PhD in 2009 – four years ago. By then, she'd already contributed to the IPCC's 2001 and 2007 reports. In other words, the IPCC considered Alexander a “top scientist” years before she'd completed them doctorate.
A third person among the 65 authors of the draft Summary is Krishna Kumar Kanikicharla. During 2011-2012 (at the same time that they were assisting the IPCC), this gentleman was a post-doctoral visiting fellow at the University of Colorado.
Are they really one the world's top scientists? I have no idea. And I'd be willing to bet $50 that Lean doesn't know, either.
On it goes. How did Lean verify that the as-yet-unreleased IPCC report relied on “9,200 mostly recent scientific publications”? It seems obvious that he, himself, couldn't possibly have verified that claim.
In other words, armed with nothing more than a politically-massaged summary and a stack of IPCC media advisories, Lean was prepared to meekly repeat IPCC talking points.
They were prepared to behave as though nothing the IPCC says could be anything other than the gospel truth.
.
Yesterday, the IPCC made draft versions of all 14 chapters of its Working Group 1 report public. To give credit where it's due, this occurred far more quickly than in the past.

We've a lovely new carved dove outside church.
Ricky, a local wood carver, has created a beautiful and unique carving of our dove symbol from the trunk of a tree we had to have cut down. We believe this splendid carving not only enhances our church grounds, but also is a lovely addition to this busy area within our unique local community. Do come and see and why not post a photo of it on Facebook or Twitter (see below).
The story began when we discovered that two trees on the Anson Road side of Church were causing trouble. Their roots had raised pathways and destroyed drains, the main problem being that they were too large to be so close to the church building. They were recently taken down and we decided to have one of the trunks carved.
We hoped to have a carving of a dove and although one or two wood carvers said it wouldn't be possible Ricky, who carves using chainsaws, said they would take on the job.
We chose a dove carving, the symbol of St Chrysostom's Church. The dove is a universal symbol of peace, and a sign of inclusion.
For Christians the dove is also a sign of God's care and love for all creation (from the story of Noah) as well as being a sign of the Holy Spirit of God.
Much of the funding for the carving was provided by donations given in memory of Tommy (Thomas Moore) a local man who lived at the Victoria Nursing Home and who regularly came to Church on Sundays and during the week. Tommy loved to call by whenever they saw the church door open, and loved to chat to people, and take an interest in them.
We miss Tommy at Church and often talk about him. they brought out love and care in many people, as well as being a faithful and humble Christian. We are sure they would be delighted to see the wood carving.
Even after only a few hours in place the carving is causing great interest. People are crossing the road to see it, and to photograph it.
Passers by, strangers to one another have started talking to each other about it. In the words of a 9yr old member of our church ‘it's bringing people together.'
We hope the dove will go on being a sign of our wish at St Chrysostom's ‘to bring people together.'
We're inviting people to ‘tweet' or post on Facebook their photo of the carving using the #StChrys hashtag.

JPMorgan Chase agreed on Thursday to pay US and British regulators $920 million in fines over accusations that it misrepresented its financial results and insufficiently monitored the traders responsible for billions in losses in 2012.

Banking giant JPMorgan Chase agreed Thursday to pay $920 million in fines to US and British regulators over actions involved in last year's "London whale" trading debacle.
The global settlement includes an admission by JPMorgan that it violated US securities laws.
The admission is contained in a 15-page statement of facts in the case that JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, said shows it "violated the federal securities laws."
The US Securities and Exchange Commission pushed for the admission "because JPMorgan's egregious breakdowns in controls and governance put its millions of shareholders at risk and resulted in inaccurate public filings," said the SEC co-director of enforcement, George Canellos.
The violations stem from the misstatement of financial results and poor internal controls over employees who were responsible for $6.2 billion in trading losses in 2012.
The "London whale" trading violations "demonstrated flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management," said the Financial Conduct Authority, the British regulator, which fined JPMorgan $220 million in the case.
Besides the FCA penalty, JPMorgan will pay a combined $700 million in fines to US regulators: $200 million to the SEC, $200 million to the Federal Reserve and $300 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
"We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them," said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon.
"Since these losses occurred, we have made numerous changes that have made us a stronger, smarter, better company."
However, JPMorgan signaled that it continues to encounter tough regulatory scrutiny on the case, dubbed the "London whale" for the location and the massive size of the global bank's soured derivatives bets.
"Litigation and other government investigations previously disclosed are ongoing," JPMorgan said in a Thursday securities filing. These include investigations by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the US Department of Justice and the Massachusetts Securities Division.
On Monday, the bank received a notice from the CFTC announcing it would recommend enforcement against the bank in connection with the "London whale" losses.
Also this week, the US Attorneys Office in New York indicted two former JPMorgan employees involved in the trades, Julien Grout and Javier Martin-Artajo.
The SEC's Canellos said that while the settlement ends the matter for JPMorgan, the agency's investigation is continuing with respect to individuals involved in the case.
Shares in JPMorgan, a member of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, were 0.9 percent lower in early trading.

We always knew Hillary Clinton was going to make their campaign about them gender. It seems now they can't even talk about a bipartisan issue like criminal justice reform without making it about gender — and what they say is so tone deaf and unaware that I almost just wrote "I can't even."
Clinton couldn't just write about the need for criminal justice reform, they had to make it an appeal to women specifically, by trying to make it seem like the criminal justice system hurts women especially, even when those women are criminals.
In an op-ed, they tell the (very) abbreviated versions of two women's road to prison. The first woman spends 12 years in prison for a robbery we're told they didn't commit. We're not told any additional details, like maybe they were the getaway driver and helped dispose of evidence or lied to police or anything like that.
The second woman is portrayed as a victim of domestic violence who simply "ran afoul of the law" and because of those mean, nasty laws, they missed their children's birthdays. We're not told what crimes this woman committed, but we're supposed to — what? — think they shouldn't have gone to jail for whatever they did because they had children?
"But women aren't the only ones affected when they are sent to prison. The high number of women in prison — and the long lengths of their sentences – destabilizes families and communities, especially their children," Clinton writes. "Since 1991, the number of children with a mother in prison has more than doubled. Mothers in prison are five times more likely than fathers in prison to have to put their children in foster care while they serve their sentences."
Maybe those women should have thought about their children before they committed crimes. Having children shouldn't be an excuse for women to get away with breaking the law.
The other thing Clinton misses here when they talk about all of these statistics is that each one is even worse for men. Clinton notes in their op-ed that there are 215,000 women in prison. There are 2,224,400 adults in America's prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, that would mean there are more than 2 million men in prison, meaning men are more than 9 times as likely to be imprisoned as women.
And if we're talking about the lengths of sentences, women are far more likely to get lighter sentences than men for the same crimes, eve if they come from similar backgrounds. A study from University of Michigan professor Sonja Starr found that "men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do," and "[w]omen are … twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted." This occurs even with reprehensible crimes like child sexual abuse.
Clinton continues their op-ed by suggesting "we need to be deliberate about understanding the different paths that can land women in prison, be more attentive to women's unique needs while they are incarcerated, and do more to support women and their families once they are released."
Do men not deserve to be supported, even if they are criminals? Apparently not to Clinton, as they have in the past supported the "believe the accuser" mentality when it comes to campus sexual assault, which treats men as rapists based merely on an accusation, denies them due process and brands them as criminals for life without evidence or the ability to defend themselves.
Clinton notes that "formerly incarcerated people face limited job opportunities" and that "an entire family is effectively punished by a woman's time in prison."
Yes, formerly incarcerated people face limited job opportunities, and so do people branded as criminals, which is exactly why we need to ensure that accused students receive due process.
Back to the actual, legitimate criminal justice system. The absence of a father can also be crushing for a family, and we need to stop acting like fathers don't matter. The lack of a male role model can lead to negative outcomes in children, including future criminal activity. Perhaps, however, the lack of a negative role model is a good thing for children. In the same vein, perhaps the lack of a negative female is better for children. Is a mother jailed for murder or theft or selling drugs always better for their children than the relatives who are out of prison or even a foster home? (It depends on the circumstances of the foster home and relatives, obviously.)
Clinton also ignores the advantages women receive in the court systems, aside from shorter sentences for abhorrent crimes. In divorce court, women are far more likely to receive full custody of children, cutting loving and capable fathers out of their children's lives thanks to a bitter ex. But such a gender disparity is ignored because it negatively affects men, and many feminists like Hillary Clinton seem to care only about gender disparities that affect women, even if those disparities have to be exaggerated.
Criminal justice reform is a bipartisan issue. By turning it into a gender issue, Clinton ignores some of the very real problems that need to be addressed and the huge gender discrepancies that negatively affect men in the system.
