'Mermaids' And 'Mermen' Of Brazil Refuse To Be Tamed

Members of the small but growing shoal of mermaids and mermen in Brazil are getting a little worried and irate.
Until now, they've been able to slip happily into their brightly colored tails and glide away through the water without much attention from the outside world, beyond the odd chuckle or ripple of applause.
Now "mermaiding" — or "sereismo" as it's known in Brazil — is growing more popular, thanks partly to a smash-hit TV soap opera and the theme song that accompanied it.
The spread of the hobby is attracting warnings from safety agencies who believe that swimming around dressed as a glamorous sea creature from ancient mythology can involve the real and present danger of drowning.
These alarm bells have upset one person, in particular. Mirella Ferraz, 34, says she is Brazil's first professional mermaid, and a pioneer of the pastime in her country. For her, mermaiding was a "childhood dream" and a "passion" that she conceived at a time when nobody wore a tail.
Ferraz accuses a recently launched campaign that highlights the risks of "mermaiding" of spreading falsehoods and of "demonizing" the mermaid's skin. "They also say that with the tail, you can't float. It's a lie. It is buoyant," she says.
The dispute's attracting considerable interest in Brazil. The widely respected daily newspaper Folha de São Paulo this week illustrated the story with a front-page photograph of a long-haired, bearded man, sitting by a pool in a big golden mermaid tail, looking vaguely disgruntled.
He is not, in fact, a mermaid but the male variant: Triton, the half-human, half-fish son of the ancient sea god Poseidon, a notoriously bad-tempered Greek deity.
For years, tiny numbers of people have been mermaiding around the world. Interest in Brazil swelled recently, thanks to a telenovela, A Força de Querer that was broadcast nationwide last year and topped the ratings. (The show has been broadcast in English as Edge of Desire.)
The soap's theme song "Sereia" ("Mermaid") is by Roberto Carlos, a gravel-voiced 76-year-old Brazilian superstar known by his multitude of fans as "The King."
YouTube
The video of Carlos' song features one of the telenovela's actresses, Ísis Valverde, swimming joyously around the ocean depths in a giant orange mermaid tail, with her locks flowing, amid shoals of tropical fish and shafts of sunlight. It's attracted more than 7 million views on YouTube.
Valverde was trained by Ferraz, the professional mermaid. Ferraz believes, thanks in part to the telenovela, more than 1,000 Brazilians are mermaiding these days.

She bases this estimate on the rising sale of tails. Statistics do not reflect the number of Brazilians who might be keen to do a little mermaiding but are deterred by the price. A decent mermaid tail can cost upwards of $1,200.
The safety campaign that's angered Ferraz was launched by Inmetro, a Brazilian government institute that monitors products for quality and safety. It issued an alert, saying research into mermaid skins found them very appealing to children, but with a "grave risk" of drowning. It points out that mermaid tails confine your legs, which makes it difficult to stand up in a pool — something Ferraz also disputes.

Inmetro's concerns are shared by others, including Dr. Renata Waksman, of the Brazilian Pediatrics Society. She says she has seen videos of girls trying to stand in mermaid tails in a swimming pool, and slipping. "Then they get frightened," she says. "That's where the danger lies, especially if there isn't an adult nearby who is really attentively monitoring what this child is doing."
Authorities in Australia have also warned of the risks of swimming with mermaid tails.
"You need to know what you are doing," says Thaís Picchi, a "mermaiding" instructor in Brazil's capital Brasilia. "Never swim with a mermaid tail alone. And you need to know how to swim."
You have to be extra careful in the sea, says Picchi: "We cannot mermaid with waves. It's not safe."

Picchi adds: "There are a lot of safety issues to be aware of. On the other hand, we don't know of any situation where someone drowned because of a mermaid tail. So why are people talking so much about it?"
There are other questions. Why not just stay on land, and save your mermaid costume for this month's carnival? Why go mermaiding at all? What's the appeal?
Picchi cites an "ancestral appeal" of mermaids, and also the Disney movie The Little Mermaid: "Everyone watched The Little Mermaid when we were kids."
She adds: "A lot of people love mermaiding because it is a fantasy, like a child's dream. They feel different. There are powerful things about mermaids. They are free, autonomous, and they take care of the ocean."
Let's hope they can also take care of themselves.
WINNIPEG – A local woman was visiting Istanbul during the deadly attack at a nightclub.
Tara Davis arrived in Turkey on New Year's Eve and took in the festivities at Taksim Square – under five kilometers away from the site of the shooting that killed 39 people at Reina Nightclub, including a Canadian.
The attack also wounded 70 other people.

Davis isn't letting the attack stop her from exploring the city.
“Of course it's an awful, terrible thing but the people here refuse to live in fear,” she said.
“When we finally did go out, the people were just carrying on with their lives. I talked to some of the women at the hotel and they said they refuse to let the terrorist govern the way they run their lives so I felt the same way.”
And Davis isn't scared.
“I've certainly felt more afraid in parts of Winnipeg or other North American cities I've visited than I do in Istanbul,” she said.
On Twitter the Government of Canada urged people to avoid the area near Reina Nightclub and get in touch with family and friends.
LONDON-Britain's much-loved Big Ben will fall silent for four years from next week as conservation work is carried out on the famous 19th century bell in a clock tower next to the Houses of Parliament.
“Big Ben falling silent is a significant milestone in this crucial conservation project,” Steve Jaggs, whose official title is “Keeper of the Great Clock”, said in a parliament statement on Monday.
“This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home - the Elizabeth Tower,” he said. It will be the longest period that Big Ben, whose bongs are familiar to many people around the world because of their use in BBC radio and television broadcasts, has been silent in its 157-year history.
The Great Bell, popularly called Big Ben, weighs 13.7 tonnes and strikes every hour to the note of E. Four smaller bells also chime every 15 minutes.
The last bong before the refurbishment will be at 12 pm (1100 GMT) on August 21, the statement said.
The clock will still tell the time silently until 2021 and the chimes will continue to be rung on important occasions such as New Year's Eve. The Elizabeth Tower, which is 96 metres (315 feet) high, is the most photographed building in Britain.
The tower itself is commonly referred to as Big Ben even though the name applies only to the bell.
The clock's cogs and hands as well as the four dials will be removed, cleaned up and repaired as part of the work. The project's cost was estimated last year at £29 million (31.9 million euros, $37.7 million).
Because the clock mechanism will be temporarily out of action, a modern electric motor will drive the clock hands until the clock is reinstated.
Parliament also said that the clock's faces would have to be covered up while they are being repaired.
“However, to ensure that the public are still able to set their watches by this most important of time pieces, one working clock face will remain visible at all times throughout the works,” it said.

When Gretchen Carlson makes her way through the streets of Manhattan, she notices flickers of recognition. But many New Yorkers don't want a selfie or an autograph — they simply want to express their gratitude. “Even if I'm on the phone, they'll just say ‘Thank you,'” Carlson says, on a recent afternoon, mouthing those two words. “A lot of people who have come up to me at restaurants — men — and have said, ‘I want to shake your hand, because I have daughters.'”
Carlson, a former anchor at Fox News, became the center of a media firestorm in July when she filed a bombshell sexual-harassment lawsuit against her boss, Roger Ailes, after he fired her. “I jumped off a cliff by myself,” Carlson says, describing the moment when everything changed. “And I had no expectations or idea what would happen.”
In the chaotic days that followed, Fox News talent quickly banded together to discredit Carlson, including Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Martha MacCallum, and Geraldo Rivera. But after a slew of other women came forward, Ailes was forced to step down as CEO of the network he had built into a cable-news juggernaut. (Carlson, who later settled for $20 million and a public apology, isn't allowed to speak on specifics about her former employer.) “I could have filed my lawsuit and gone home,” says Carlson, 50. “But I'm not choosing to do that. I'm choosing to help other women who have reached out to me since this happened, to make a difference for them.”
She's heard from thousands through her website. “It's so heartwarming and unbelievably sad, because it's so pervasive,” Carlson says. “It's so unbelievable that in 2017, almost every single woman has a story about sexual harassment.”
Ryan Pfluger for Variety
Indeed, it's the best of times and the worst of times for women in the workplace. “I think two opposing things are happening at once,” says Nancy Erika Smith, the New Jersey employment lawyer who represented Carlson. “Sexists and misogynists are looking at who's in the White House and feeling empowered. At the same time, four million women took to the streets. I kind of think the women are going to win. These men have to go home to women.”
Carlson's decision to come forward, accusing Ailes of propositioning her for sex, is still creating ripples at Fox News and beyond. (Ailes has maintained his innocence.) “What Gretchen did was she slayed a dragon that no one thought could be slayed,” says Lisa Bloom, the civil-rights attorney representing Wendy Walsh, a Fox News contributor who alleged this month that she was sexually harassed by host Bill O'Reilly. “She not only got a very large settlement, she got an apology,” says Bloom. “And that's part of her story that people forget. She set a precedent: You don't have to take the money and go away. You can actually get some respect and dignity in the process.”
Fox News is reeling from sexual harassment accusations that O'Reilly used his clout at the network to seek sexual favors from several women, resulting in at least $13 million in settlements.
A New Mission
On “Fox and Friends,” Carlson was a bubbly morning TV presence. But away from the studio, she showed backbone as an advocate for an issue normally associated with anonymous victims. In October, Time put her on its cover. “I never expected to be the face of sexual harassment,” says Carlson. “But I never give up on anything. So when placed in a new, challenging situation, it's like, ‘I'm going to give this 110% because that's what I've done my entire life.' ”
That mantra can be traced to her upbringing as a prodigy violinist who took a leave from Stanford University to nab the crown for Miss America in 1989. From there she took local news jobs, covering the Anita Hill case from Richmond, Va., and thinking, “Holy crap, nobody believes her.”
Carlson isn't ruling out returning to television full time. “That's what I've done for 25 years, so I have ambition to go back,” she says. For now, she's made fighting sexual harassment her primary duty. “It's like five separate full-time jobs,” she says. She stays up at night (“I'm not a good sleeper”) to personally answer the messages she's received. “It's everywhere,” she says, recalling tales from police officers, the military, teachers, doctors, accountants and Hollywood. “I've heard from all walks of life.”
She's turning some of these stories into a book, which will include advice about what women can do if they find themselves in a similar situation. “Maybe Human Resources isn't the place to go,” she says, adding that it's important to collect evidence first.
Carlson also revealed to Variety that she's making a documentary, where she'll serve as a reporter investigating sexual harassment. “No one has done a serious film on this issue,” she says. “This is a movement now. I plan to carry that forward.” And she's met with senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), ahead of her plans to testify on Capitol Hill against binding arbitration agreements that allow companies to keep these complaints private. “Gretchen is using her voice to make a difference through advocacy and legislation that will undoubtedly help others,” Gillibrand says.
Adds Carlson, “We've done a huge disservice to our society, because we're not hearing about these cases. The biggest advantage is that it's a secret; the people in a situation like mine can stay in power.”
Carlson, who lives in Connecticut with her husband and two kids, ages 12 and 13, has been open with her family about what she went through. “They are very aware,” she says. “My daughter had some issues where she needed to stand up for herself. She told me, ‘Mommy, I saw you do it. Now I know I can do it.'”
She'll launch a campus speaking tour later this year, where she'll try to educate other young women about what she's learned. It's important, she adds, to know that many victims suffer from PTSD as they try to move beyond what's happened to them.
“You find a way to survive, which is actually one of my favorite songs.” She stops to clarify the two titles that fit the bill: Gloria Gaynor's “I Will Survive” and Destiny's Child's “Survivor.” “I listen to them both when I work out,” Carlson says, as she sits higher in her chair. “Good lyrics.”
With ever-advancing technologies and artificial intelligence creeping into the workforce, job security for current and future generations has never been more worrying. CKNW's Future of Work series focuses on how British Columbia's job market is going to evolve and how to help workers get the best possible employment opportunities in the future.
In the kitchens, behind the bars and on the floors of restaurants across B.C., there is a brewing labour shortage.
In fact, the B.C. Restaurant and Food Services Association (BCRFA) estimates by 2021, it could be short by 20,000 employees.

Special Advisor for Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Farooq Mir here on Wednesday said that role of opposition was very important in a democratic system and their cooperation was imperative for smooth running of the government. Talking to media men here, he said the government has given many benefits to the people of GB through various socio-economic welfare programmes including Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Wasela-e-Haq, Waseela e Taleem and many other projects. He said the government was utilizing all available resources for assistance of flood affectees in all the districts of GB. He deplored statements of some opposition leaders regarding non-helping of flood affectees and termed it pack of lies. “Every person can visit flood affected sites and meet the affectees to check the assistance provided by the government,” he said. He said taking opposition on board on all important issues was the policy of the GB government. Mir said cooperation of opposition was imperative for smooth running of an elected government besides resolution of the people's problems. He said criticism for the personal gains should be avoided rather criticism for reformation and addressing of people's problems should be made.—APP
ISLAMABAD - Pakistan People's Party Wednesday urged the leaders to unite the nation rather than dividing it.
Speaking at an iftar-dinner hosted by PPP Leader Senator Sherry Rehman here, Bilawal said with the fires of conflict, both sectarian and mercenary, threatening to engulf many Muslim countries, it was important for leaders to unite, not divide.
“Pakistan today should be speaking of tolerance, faith and unity. In this age of long wars, illiberal voices and borderless challenges, we should be worrying much more about connecting our region, about disengaged neighbours, and of internal challenges to stability. Although I want to use this brief time to talk about the future, the past casts a long shadow over our histories, both remembered and unlearnt,” he said.
Despite this being a summer of public discontent, I want to take a moment to remind ourselves that Ramzan is about reflection, prayer and the power of peace in a troubled world. I believe that real prayer is as much about deeds as it is about ritual, and it is at times of crisis, both national and international, that the actions and words we use reflect our core values, he added.
He said Pakistan today should be speaking of tolerance, faith and unity. In this age of long wars, illiberal voices and borderless challenges, “we should be worrying much more about connecting our region, about disengaged neighbours, and of internal challenges to stability. Although I want to use this brief time to talk about the future, the past casts a long shadow over our histories, both remembered and unlearnt.”
The PPP chief said many do not know that it was not always this way and did not have to be this way. “Pakistan was held in high esteem both globally and within the Muslim community, where my grandfather, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, would call the Ummah (nation) together at a conference in Lahore, to bury our differences and jointly pledge for common goals as responsible actors in the international community, he recalled.
He added: “Even as close as 2012, Pakistan did not have strained relations with Kabul. Under (former) President (Asif Ali) Zardari's stewardship we were diligent to build friendships across the length and breadth of Afghanistan, careful not to privilege one group over another.”
He said despite the Mumbai attack in 2008, “we were able to iterate that Islamabad wants to move past old frames of strategic reference. We could still deal with terrorism as a joint regional problem, with ongoing bilateral dialogue, not just summitry or quiet cups of tea.”
On the broader end of the spectrum, he said: “I know China was always Pakistan's friend, through thick and thin, yet the grand plan of Gawadar port and economic interdependence too came from us, as did navigate the relationship of the NATO and American alliances through turbulent waters.”
Bilawal said Pakistan has always supported the Kashmiri people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination and urged the international community to speak to the human rights atrocities committed in Indian held Kashmir.
He said it would be a good time to remind ourselves of the urgency and salience of public priorities. “Many imperatives have gotten lost in the unresolved story of Panama and other leaks that sprang from the international journalists' dragnet. We need a clear head and strong hand at the wheel,” he said.
Bilawal said many had forgotten that a state of national inaction gripped Pakistan's drive against the one thing we should unite against, “which is violent extremism.”
He added: “We should be worrying about the rising graph of intolerance that fuels lynching and mob violence. Our universities, colleges' schools need to be beacons of learning and critical thinking, not redoubts defined by the darkness of scorching hatreds and exclusion.”
He said people need to see leadership on this account, not just condemnations and statements of resolve. “We need to move beyond that. We need to regroup as a country, as a nation against the enemies of an inclusive, peaceful Pakistan. I would like to pay respect to icons of bravery, victims and heroes of our time, like Mashal Khan and Malala Yousufzai. One died painfully as a price for being young, gifted and an activist, while the other lives bravely, against all odds, telling her tale,” he said.
Bilawal said the nation should be thinking of “why we need such costly valor from our students. We should be altering the curriculum that in some provinces still promises endless war, not the Quaid-e-Azam's strong message of plural inclusion from his August 11, 1947 speech to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. I know we are doing it in Sindh. But surely others must follow, and answer for what is being taught in our public schools.”
He said more than anything “we should be thinking of our own future, my generation, which is going to need jobs and opportunities. Our demographic map is no secret. Without a path to equitable growth, and incomes that invest in the old and new economy, we cannot break out of the cycle of disrepair that our system has become hostage to.”
The PPP leader said there was no silver bullet for transforming Pakistan's trajectory, but change must, change will come. “It will come only if people sense that there is hope. My mother, Benazir Bhutto, was known for being bullish on hope, but she also had a plan, like we do. What do I hope for? Mundane entitlements, some may think, but important to changing lives,” he maintained.
Bilawal said he meets all sorts of people every day, “but most of all, I meet the dispossessed who come to us, the PPP, with hope in their eyes, sometimes even a desperate hope. They don't ask for much. They want clean water in their taps, security against terror, schools that get their children jobs and hospitals that manage their health needs. These are basic entitlements, promised with food, shelter and freedom from poverty that my party has long fought for.”
Bilawal said he will measure success for a next government, after “we re-framed the relationship of the federation to the provinces in the 18th Constitutional Amendment, by its commitment to making Pakistan sovereign and equitable. I measure sovereignty not just by taking responsibility for what goes on within my borders, who we fight inside and who without, but also for self-reliance.”
He said Pakistan has just come out of a stormy budget session in parliament, and “it struck me as extremely worrying that along with our exports, our tax base has shrunk. Both have shrunk disastrously since our government, while all levels of debt have gone up, and it takes no calculus lessons to say that this is not how national sovereignty or social justice is achieved. We have to start somewhere by matching revenue with expenditure. This will not be achieved by borrowing from capital markets and more indirect taxes. This is the path away from true sovereignty, not towards it.”
Bilawal said he was glad that the Benazir Income Support Program was growing, which is Pakistan's largest social transfer program. “It came from our government and our manifesto, with its strong emphasis on flattening social pyramids,” he added. Earlier, Senator Sherry Rehman welcomed the guests. The event was attended by PPP leaders, members of other parties and diplomats.

Goffin and Kyrgios embrace after their Miami Open round of 16 clashes this year (Photo: Julian Finney/Getty Images North America)
David Goffin's return from injury this summer has hardly been plain sailing and he faces a stiff test in his first round encounter at the Western and Southern Open when he meets the world number 23 Nick Kyrgios.
The mercurial Australian has been troubled with injury himself since the French Open earlier this year, retiring at three straight tournaments before he bowed out of the Rogers Cup last week in meek fashion to eventual winner Alexander Zverev.
Goffin suffered a freak injury at Roland Garros in his third round match-up with Horacio Zeballos – damaging his ankle on the court covers at the back of the playing surface – and only made his return to action at the Croatia Open on 19 July.
A mixed return
The Belgian was enjoying a stellar year on the tour before he suffered the unfortunate injury in Paris, reaching the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, the final in Rotterdam and scoring a momentous victory over Novak Djokovic in Monte Carlo en route to a semifinal showing.
But since announcing his withdrawal from Wimbledon to rehabilitate his ankle his results have been mixed, opting to return at the tail-end of the European clay court swing.
He was beaten convincingly by world number 412 Ivan Dodig in the quarterfinals in Umag as the top seed and fared no better in Switzerland the following week.
He was fortunate to come through a pair of tie-breaks in a three-set victory over Radu Albot but he was routed by Robin Haase in the last eight and he entered the Rogers Cup in Montreal with question marks surrounding his fitness.
The 26-year-old recovered from a set down against Japan's Yuichi Sugita in the first round but he was outmaneuvered by the talented youngster Hyeon Chung in the following round.
Goffin's play style is predicated on an ability to outlast opponents from the baseline and it is evident that the Belgian is still working to rekindle his rhythm.

An injury troubled Australian
Kyrgios' injury woes have been similarly well-documented and they began in his second round exit at the French Open.
The Australian complained of a hip problem in his defeat to Kevin Anderson and three months on was lamenting a “sharp pain” in his side during his loss to Zverev in Canada last week.
That has been bracketed with early retirements at Queen's, Wimbledon and the Citi Open and his withdrawal from Atlanta as the defending champion.
The 22-year-old was beginning to show signs of maturity during the Golden Swing earlier this year and was a couple of points away from sending Roger Federer packing at the semifinal stage in Miami.
Previous meetings
The pair have met twice previously and Kyrgios currently owns the bragging rights with a 2-0 head-to-head record.
They first clashed in the final of the ATP 500 event in Tokyo last fall and it was a defeat that ought to have stung Goffin given he could have forced a deciding set tie-break. Instead, he wilted under scoreboard pressure and Kyrgios reigned supreme, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.
The Miami Open hosted their most recent rendezvous and it was a more straightforward victory for Kyrgios that time around, prevailing 7-6(5), 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals.
Prediction: Goffin in straight sets
Michigan quarterback Shane Morris has decided to leave the Wolverines and will be immediately eligible next season as a graduate transfer.
Morris, who announced his decision Monday on Twitter, appeared in six games as a backup this season and completed 4 of 5 passes. He did not play in 2015 but started one game each in 2013 and 2014.
His most memorable moment involved a controversy in 2014.
Morris started that year's game against Minnesota and was left in the contest after displaying concussion-like symptoms. Michigan coach Brady Hoke and athletic director Dave Brandon came under fire for their handling of the situation, and protests erupted on campus calling for Brandon's removal. Brandon resigned a little more than a month later, and Hoke was fired at the end of the season.
In the wake of the Morris controversy, the Big Ten announced new concussion protocols that went into effect before the 2015 season, which included placing a certified athletic trainer in the replay booth who could spot players dealing with possible concussions and alert officials.

Morris didn't play much after that controversy but continued to compete for the starting quarterback job.
"This decision was not easy due to my love of the University of Michigan and all that it is," Morris wrote in his announcement. "I could not have asked of anything more from the people of the University of Michigan and I will forever be a Michigan man."
The Warren, Michigan, native was an ESPN 300 recruit out of high school.
Rawalpindi
The Food Branch of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) has issued 15 notices to food outlets for unhygienic and poor cleanliness conditions while 26 food samples were collected here on Monday from different restaurants, hotels and other fast food points in Naseerabad and Allahabad areas. According to RCB spokesman, Qaiser Mahmood, the food samples collected from different points have been sent to lab for quality test while fines amounting to over Rs 72 were also imposed on rules violators.
The cases of substandard food items were sent to the court of the cantonment magistrate which imposed fines on the rules violators. He said, on the directive of the Cantonment Executive Officer Arslan Haider, the team conducted surprise visits of different markets and inspected cleanliness condition with quality of food items.
Raids on the food outlets would continue, he said adding that the teams were directed to also check the health of the workers serving at the food outlets.
To a question he said, RCB team under anti-encroachment operation also confiscated two truckload goods from Naseerabad and Allahabad. Posters and banners were also removed from different cantt areas, he added.—APP

No Salary Arrears for Lukwago – KCCA
Kampala capital city authority technical wing has insisted that the Lord Mayor of Kampala Erias Lukwago will not be paid his emoluments until the high court clears him.
This followed the authority council writing to the executive director Jenifer Musisi last month instructing her to pay Lukwago's emolument since November 2013 to May 2016 when he was impeached from office.
While presenting the report from the technical wing today, the deputy ED, Andrew Kitata said Lukwago will only be paid his money after the court has cleared him.
Kitata explained that as the technical wing, they cannot release money until court orders them to do so.
He however added advised Lukwago to remain patient as they await the final decision from court.
It Should be remembered that Lukwago was controversially impeached from the office of the lord mayor in November 2013 on allegations that he was incompetent. His salary and other benefits were there halted.
Its from this point therefore that after resuming his office for the second term, Lukwago wants all the money that was supposed to be paid to him by then get paid to him now since the high court didn't find him guilty of the alleged cases.
LAKE BUENA VISTA, FLA—The Blue Jays feel the need to add another major-league middle infielder, despite general manager Ross Atkins's optimism regarding the possibility of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman Devon Travis being ready for opening day.
The Jays have already added former all-star shortstop Aldemys Diaz, acquired from St. Louis last month, and minor-leaguer Gift Ngoepe, picked up from Pittsburgh. And they appear to be deep internally, with Richard Urena and Lourdes Gurriel the most advanced in the system. So does want more mean that they are cautious and uncertain about their starters, Tulowitzki and Travis?
“We will most likely add an infielder,” Atkins said. “Adding to our depth and versatility there is attractive to us and makes sense. That could mean one of those pieces or two of those pieces might be getting some play in the outfield. It still could mean that one or two of them could be in Triple-A, or three or four of them.”
A nugget of news that will make some fans happy is that Atkins had discussions with Ryan Goins around the time that they non-tendered his 2018 contract. Goins understands the Jays still have interest in the left-handed hitting, slick-fielding infielder, but at a lesser price than arbitration would deliver.
“It would be alternatives and costs,” Atkins said, regarding both sides perhaps having other opportunities. “It depends on the acquisition costs. Obviously we chose to non-tender him. We have interest in him returning on some level, with some level of guarantee. He'll factor in what his alternatives are.”

The daughter, Hailey Barker, is wanted for second degree murder. Homicide investigators have issued a Canada-wide warrant for her arrest.
She is described as 5'6″, 135 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.
Anyone with information about Barker's location is asked to call 911.
Anyone with additional information is asked to contact the homicide unit at 204-986-6508, or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).
Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, has urged state legislators to make concerted efforts to ensure level-playing field existed for all to participate in 2019 general elections.
Dogara, who said this when he received Speakers of the 36 States' Houses of Assembly on Tuesday in Abuja, charged them to defend the electoral process in order to surpass the standard set in 2015.
He said, “I want to charge you on the added responsibility of defending our democracy at the grassroots.
“You have to stand firm, especially now that the elections are approaching, to ensure that we create an enabling environment where there will be free, fair and credible elections.
“When we talk about free and fair elections, we mean that the elections will be conducted, there will be no grounds for violence and there will be no grounds for intimidation.
“Some of us will attest to the fact that, maybe, when we contested for elections, we weren't that strong, but others struggled to ensure that the elections were free and fair and on account of that, we won our elections.
“So, we owe that moral duty to replicate that same environment to others who are contesting and even to our opponents, so that at the end of the day, let there be credible elections in this country.
“We have the standard in 2015 elections and we shouldn't go back. We should improve, not only sustain, we should improve.”
Dogara also spoke on the autonomy granted to state legislatures in the last constitution amendment which President Muhammadu Buhari had signed into law.
He explained to the visiting state legislators that “the essence of the law is for good governance and not to better the lives of the legislators”.
He, therefore, urged the legislators to use it as a tool of vigilance for upholding democracy in the states.
“Now that you have financial autonomy, hopefully, some of the critical areas that we felt will better deepen democratic process will be dealt with,” he said.
Responding to a request by the delegation, Dogara disclosed that the National Institute of Democratic Studies would train the lawmakers when needed, on the application of the new law.
Earlier, Chairman of Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures, Mr Abdulmumin Kamba, had commended Dogara for his visionary leadership.
He also commended the House of Representatives and entire National Assembly for conceiving and granting autonomy to state assemblies, saying it would make them more efficient in the discharge of their duties.
Kamba, who is Speaker of Kebbi House of Assembly, urged Dogara to assist in the training of state legislators to improve their capacities.
A Kelowna mother and her son were splattered in falling feces as it covered their car and came through the sunroof
A Kelowna woman has conjunctivitis in both eyes, a hefty car detailing bill to pay and a lot of anger after being splattered with feces that fell from the sky.
Susan Allan was in the car with her son in the early afternoon of May 9. She was stopped at the street lights on Spall Road and Bernard Avenue when an unwelcome deluge covered her car and came through the open sunroof.
“We were parked at the lights when the ‘sky poop' starting falling,” said Allan. “It got all over my car, it got all over (me) and got on my son, inside my vehicle. It was definitely falling from the sky.”
When they looked up they saw the bottom of an airplane as it flew overhead.
“It was just very wet and smelled terrible. I can't really describe the feeling … it was almost like chunks of mud falling from the sky hitting you in the face,” said Allan.
“My son said that the sensation he got was a cold feeling as it hit his face, then the smell was overwhelming for him and he almost got sick as it was hitting his face.”
They got out of their car and a woman nearby pointed the plane out to them.
“I mean we were covered in it, our vehicle and their vehicle was also hit with the same poop,” said Allan.
That “sky poop” sent Allan to her doctor's office out of fear of infection or catching something worse. Her doctor's note shows that she was diagnosed with conjunctivitis in both eyes as a result of “…being inundated with sewerage from an overhead plane, while driving her car.”

Transport Canada states that it takes all reports of possible debris coming from aircraft very seriously.
“Transport Canada is aware of the incident you describe and we are looking into it,” said spokesperson Daniel Savoie
“Each air operator is responsible for ensuring that their aircraft operate safely and in compliance with the Canadian Aviation Regulations. Section 602.23, ‘Dropping of Objects', states “No person shall create a hazard to persons or property on the surface by dropping an object from an aircraft in flight.” Any operator found to be in contravention of the Canadian Aviation Regulations will be subject to enforcement action under Transport Canada's mandate.”
As for Allan, she said she waited until this week to alert the media as she has hoped the airport would make it right, but after weeks of no reply she reached out to the media.
“I reported it to them hoping the airport would deal with me without having to go through the news to stop the embarrassment for both of us, but it didn't turn out that way so I had to go to the news.”
She claims she has been getting mixed messaging from authorities
“I was told that there were three planes that flew over that area at that time, then I was told that there was one plane that flew over that area at that time and now all of a sudden no plane flew over the area at that time,” said Allan. “I believe that the airport should take responsibility for what happened to me and my son, maybe clean out my car and compensate for the infection that I got in my eyes.
“I believe that they owe me an apology for both making me feel like I did something wrong by reporting it, and for it happening in the first place.”
The Kelowna International Airport could not speak on the incident as it is being investigated by Transport Canada..
“Similar to any aviation incident, this would fall under the jurisdiction of Transport Canada. We are supporting Transport Canada's investigation and any outcomes,” said Phillip Elchitz, Senior Airport Operations Manager.

There was an impressive increase in the number of visitors and entrants at this year's Stannington Make, Bake, Grow and Show.
Despite a couple of rain showers on Saturday afternoon, everyone who came along had a great time.

As well as the wacky wheelbarrow races and traditional categories in the village hall, the children had an impressive roundabout and fairground attractions to play on and win prizes.
Morpeth Riding for the Disabled had one of their horses on show and the dog show proved popular once again.
The Stannington Parish Centenary Festival of Remembrance's display of First World War information gave residents a first sight of what will be happening in the week before November 11, 2018, to mark 100 years since the end of the Great War.
Burgers, ice-cream and ferret racing were other well-attended stalls.
Action from the wacky wheelbarrow races. Picture by Isobel Legard.
The organising committee said: “The men-only competition this year was a quick makeover on the outside stage. Five teams of two chaps were equipped with capes and turbans, so as not to damage their clothes or hair.
“Sitting on the stage, the brave caped chap put his faith in his partner and the fun began. Suspiciously adept, the foundation, eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick were applied.
“A final flourish of bronzer and the crowd cheered the winner, his blushes only spared by the amount of gunk on his face. Naming no names, but our most recent Freeman of the Parish looked stunning.
“The ladies competition saw them sawing. Bedecked in every item of personal protective equipment we could find, ten participants were handed a bow saw and set off at a pace to make inroads into the carefully placed log.

“The winner was our local police community support officer, Holly Went, who had earlier with fellow PCSO Simon Beavers been entertaining everyone with the police quad bike. Again naming no names, but someone who can be seen about the village wearing an ecclesiastical collar looked good as a lumberjack.
“Sadly, this year we lost one of our respected parishioners. Norman Yeaman was one of the show's founders and known to all as a great ‘dog man'.
“In his honour, the Norman Yeaman Shield for best dog in show was presented by his son Alistair to Milly, a beautiful Labrador owned by Mr Robertson.”
New to the show was the welly throwing competition. The over 16 winners was M Fennell and the under 16 winners was George Nicholson.

Other winners of note were as follows. Wacky wheelbarrow race: Men's race – Rory Morrison; Women's race – Amy Philipson. Silver Salver for best cookery exhibit: Philip Holmes for his chocolate cake. Rosette for Best in Show (Make): Mark Legard for his turned wood bowl. Rosette for Best in Show (Grow): Margaret Allen for her sunflower arrangement. Children's Mini Make: Jack Pickford. Children's Mini Grow: Chloe Sanderson. Children's Mini Bake: Poppy Blewitt. Bellway Shield for most points in Children's section: Chloe Sanderson. J.O. Straughan Shield for most points in agricultural section: Roger Dickinson. Banks Group Shield for most points in show: Sandra Dickinson.
Crowds were already estimated well into the tens of thousands by noon on Saturday as the Formula Powerboat Super League Formula 2 boat racing kicked into high gear late Saturday morning.
The Green Bridge was lined end to end by the time the boats started qualifying at 10 a.m.
“It's just awesome,” said Bradenton Mayor Wayne Poston.
Within an hour of race time, crowds were three-to-five deep on the bridge and Riverwalk in Bradenton had few open spaces remaining along the waterfront. Land activities were in full swing, including helicopter tours around the skies over Bradenton and Palmetto. Kelly Mohanaendelamien climbed out with her 9-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son, who since as a young boy has wanted to be a pilot.

“It was his first time up, so it was great for him to see what it's actually like,” she said. “My daughter has some sensory issues, so I was a little nervous about the noise and wind and it did bother her at first. But she settled down and had a wonderful time. The pilot smiled at her and said, ‘I bet she's going to want to go right back up.' And not five minutes later she said, ‘I want to go again.'”
Though the crowds were surging early, law enforcement officials reported no issues and the event was going smoothly, though traffic into downtown was heavy. In Palmetto, crowds packed into Riverside Park West for the newest Ferris wheel attraction, and vendors lined the way with food and games.
“Our goal was to grow this each year and make it bigger and better,” said Mike Fetchko, ISM USA president and event organizer. “The bigger it gets each year, the better it's only going to get. I can't thank the two cities and Manatee County for all they do to make this happen, as well as our sponsors. We had a vision when this idea first came up four years ago, and there's nothing quite like seeing that vision come true. Seeing all the smiles on the faces of all these families is why I do what I do.”

The fourth annual Bradenton Area River Regatta officially kicked off at 8 a.m. Saturday morning with a horn blast that sent hundreds of runners from downtown Bradenton toward the Green Bridge as part of the Saint Stephen's 5K race and 1K Fun Run.
Exuberant Falcons from the Saint Stephen's Episcopal School stood atop the Green Bridge, along with the school's mascot, Freddy the Falcon, cheering on the runners. On the other side, as many as 50 people were already setting up chairs for the Formula 2 Powerboat Super League Series, still hours away from getting underway.

Among the first arrivals was Carol Kleutsen, who secured her favorite viewing spot for the fourth straight year.
“We always get here shortly after 8 a.m.,” Kleutsen said. “We find our spot, head out for breakfast and come right back. The people that come to these races are always really nice and we certainly don't mind being out in the fresh air and this event just gets better every year. It's just a good day to have some family fun and there is so much to do for everyone.”
Reeling them in
Right about the time the middle group of runners was reaching Palmetto, about 50 youngsters were tossing fishing lines into the water off the Palmetto fishing pier as part of the annual Hernando DeSoto Historical Society's Little Anglers Fishing Tourney.
“In our first 10 minutes, the kids have already caught about 10 fish,” said Scott Toedman, a historical society member and organizer of the fishing tournament.
Discount Tackle provides all the fishing gear each year, which the kids get to take home with them. Tropicana supplies all of the trophies.
Six-year-old Kylie received a participation medal last year after coming up empty. The medal hangs on her wall now. “But I want to hang it on a trophy this year,” she said.
Debbie Miller-Phillips said Kylie has been talking about the fishing tournament for a solid month.
“We kept checking the papers and finally saw all the information last month and said, ‘Yes!' She's been talking about it every since,” said Miller-Phillips. Kylie was on her way to grabbing one of those trophies with at least one fish caught. Not far down from Kylie was another 6-year-old, Logan Cole, who was pulling up his first fish of the day just 15 minutes into the two-hour tournament.

“It's probably the biggest fish I ever caught,” Cole said with a smile.
Dad had to remind him that the 10-inch catfish he caught a few months back was a little bigger, but that didn't stop Cole from smiling or getting his line quickly back in the water.
“I like it,” he said.

By 10 a.m., there was a steady influx of regatta-goers and spectators were already securing their favorite spots on the bridge and along Riverwalk. Law enforcement reported no traffic issues for the early arrivals.

Tails were waggin'
The All-Star Stunt Dog Show was a hit with Regatta guests. More than 200 puppy lovers turned out to one of the numerous afternoon shows and watched as Chris Perondi and Abby Cline demonstrated just what a trained dog could do with some “doggone fun.”
Perondi, who has been training dogs since 1996 using positive reinforcement as toys, brought out a handful of pups who wowed the crowd. Spitfire Spinelli is a 9-year-old dog who has become the show's No. 1 star, Perondi said.
Her tricks included jumping rope, circling Perondi's legs backwards and moonwalking to her favorite song, Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean.”
The final act of the stunt show was Little Cricket, a tiny pug and Boston terrier mix who proved that she could hang with the big dogs. She jumped through Cline's hoops, balanced on Cline's back and balanced a handstand on her front paws in Cline's outstretched palm.

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 14 (APP): More than 500,000 people in Yemen are
suspected of having cholera, the United Nations health agency said Monday, warning that the disease is spreading quickly due to a lack of clean water or health access.
“Yemen's cholera epidemic, currently the largest in the world, has
spread rapidly due to deteriorating hygiene and sanitation conditions and disruptions to the water supply across the country,” the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.
Nearly 2,000 people have died since the outbreak began at the end of
April, the UN agency added.
It blames a collapsing health system, a lack of clean water, and a
build-up of human waste, which is not being collected in major cities.
Shortages in medicines and supplies is “persistent and widespread,” WHO said, adding that health workers have not been paid in nearly a year.
“Yemen's health workers are operating in impossible conditions,”
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said. “These doctors and nurses are the backbone of the health response, without them we can do nothing in Yemen. They must be paid their wages so that they can continue to save lives.”
The UN said it is supporting partners to set up cholera treatment
clinics, rehabilitate health facilities, deliver medical supplies, and support national health response efforts.
In his statement, Mr. Tedros called for a political solution to the
conflict in Yemen.
Carlos Santana has angered the Beyhive.
The legendary guitarist seemingly dissed Beyonce in an interview with Australian media following the Grammys Sunday night when he said Beyonce was "very beautiful to look at" but "not a singer, singer."
Santana says he was only trying to congratulate Adele on her big win for Album of the Year when he made the statement.
In the interview, Santana told the Australian Associated Press, "I think that Adele won because she can sing sing...With all respect to our sister Beyonce, Beyonce is very beautiful to look at and it's more like modelling kind of music – music to model a dress – she's not a singer, singer, with all respect to her."
He added: Adele “doesn't bring all the dancers and props, she can just stand there and she just stood there and sang the song and that's it, and this is why she wins.”
That statement did not go over well with the Beyhive.
"The fact that Carlos Santana said those comments after he's performed on stage with Beyonce at halftime and witnessed her talent is baffling," said one Twitter user.
"Carlos Santana is TRASH about those @Beyonce comments! Especially since he's one (won) all his Grammys for someone else's vocals!" said another.
Carlos Santana is TRASH about those @Beyonce comments! Especially since he's won all his Grammys for someone else's vocals!🚮 — Dominick Deveraux (@Sir_Deveraux) February 15, 2017
Santana clarified his stance on Facebook Tuesday , writing that his “intent was to congratulate Adele” and that his comment about Beyonce “was regretfully taken out of context.” He adds that he has “the utmost respect” for Beyonce.
"She deserves all the accolades that come her way."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has issued new guidelines to enforce academic integrity in science that include plans to “record and assess” the conduct of scientists and institutions and punish anyone guilty of misconduct, state news agency Xinhua reported.
The guidelines, released on Wednesday by the ruling Communist Party and the State Council, or cabinet, prohibit plagiarism, fabrication of data and research conclusions, ghost-writing and peer review manipulation, according to Xinhua.
Scandals in recent years involving things like faked research, plagiarism and problematic peer review standards have dented China's reputation as a growing force in the world of scientific research.
Xinhua said China would build a “scientific integrity mechanism” to drive innovation while maintaining zero tolerance for severe academic dishonesty.
“Anyone who violates the integrity rules will be held accountable by law,” it said, citing a document issued by the party and government.
“Those who are found to have committed academic misconduct will be banned from teaching or doing any kind of research work in government-run schools and scientific institutions. Their research grants will be cancelled and honours revoked, according to the guidelines,” it said.
The Ministry of Science and Technology would take responsibility for coordinating and managing the effort in scientific fields, while the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences would do so in social sciences.
Xinhua said the science ministry planned to build “a journal warning mechanism to put any domestic or international academic journals that ignores academic quality while seeking high payments onto a blacklist”.
Papers published in such journals would not be recognised in any kind of assessment, it said.
The guidelines also aimed to change the standards by which scientists are evaluated so that integrity becomes a key factor, rather than just the production of papers, patents, titles, projects and the collection of honours, it said.
Cigna says it is rejecting Anthem's proposed $48 billion acquisition bid and suing the Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer.
The announcement comes hours after another major insurer, Aetna, said it was abandoning its planned $34 billion purchase of Medicare Advantage provider Humana.
The Department of Justice sued last summer to stop the deals due to concerns about how they would affect prices and consumer choices. Federal judges rejected both deals in separate rulings earlier this year.
Anthem Inc. had filed paperwork Monday to appeal its case.

Cigna Corp. says it is seeking a $1.85 billion termination fee from Anthem and more than $13 billion in damages caused by what it says were Anthem's breaches of the merger agreement.
An Anthem spokeswoman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
SARGODHA/BAHAWALNAGAR -Three labourers were killed and 14 other got injured when a mini-truck overturned here on Sargodha-Jhang Road while two persons died in collision between two cars in Bahawalnagar on Tuesday.
According to Rescue 1122 sources, about three dozen labourers were on the way to village Abbaspur on a mini-truck. As the vehicle reached near 92 Morr, the truck suddenly swerved and overturned due to speeding. Resultantly, three labourers died instantly while 14 others including the driver got injuries and were shifted to hospital. Hospital sources informed that condition of three of the injured is critical. Rescue 1122 team rushed to the scene and evacuated the injured and dead bodies to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital.
In Bahawalnagar, two persons were killed and four others of the same family sustained injuries in collision between two cars here on Tuesday.
The police said the accident occurred in the limits of Bakhshan Khan Police due to speeding.
The injured and dead bodies were shifted to the DHQ hospital by Rescue 1122.
EMBATTLED Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru, has accused a group of party elders she expelled last week of seeking to turn her into a sex slave, after proposing that she be the opposition party's “queen bee”.
BY BLESSED MHLANGA/OBEY MANAYITI
In an audio recording of her address to provincial structures in Masvingo at the weekend, Mujuru accused her former close allies, notably Didymus Mutasa and Rugare Gumbo, of wanting her to sleep with male colleagues in the party, taking advantage of the fact that she was a widow.
“I want you to Google then advise each other. They said Mai Mujuru, we want you to be our queen bee. I was supposed to mate with all the men in the party. I was supposed to be their wife,” she said.
“I was supposed to work for them because they had seen that while I was still in Egypt (Zanu PF) I used to work hard.
“So they wanted to borrow that hard-working spirit to work for them and I told them that I can't be your queen bee.
I am a woman of substance even though I am a widow, I have an image to protect and since the death of my husband (Solomon Mujuru), I have no appetite for men. I told them that I am here to work for Zimbabwe and this did not make them happy.”
But, Gumbo yesterday hit back at Mujuru, accusing her of having a shallow understanding of political dichotomy and processes.
“She does not have an understanding of a beehive,” he shot back.
“We indeed said she was supposed to be the queen bee. Not that we wanted to sleep with her, but we were supposed to do all the dirty work, fight for her, protect her and not expose her because we understood her limitations.
“We knew if she was exposed, she would make mistakes like she has been making after being exposed. Now, how can you have a leader, who does not understand such simple things?”
A queen bee is the fertile egg-laying matriarch in a beehive.
Mujuru went further, accusing Gumbo and Mutasa of wanting to use ZimPF as a money-spinning venture for their personal gain.
“The people were planning to oust me for a very long time. I have not refused to vacate my post, but why do they want me to vacate the seat?” she queried.
“When I was asked to lead People First (PF), I said PF was not started so that people can treat it as a business.
“That is when I started (clashing)with the two gentlemen, namely Rugare Gumbo and Didymus Mutasa. They wanted the party to be a money-spinning machine for their personal needs. That's why you heard people saying there was a fund bringing money from Britain to the party.”
Mujuru said there was no single meeting that the party held that Gumbo and Mutasa would not demand vehicles, money and fuel.
“I told them that we once were all ministers and, I think, we have some savings from that, let's build the party first. We can't start wanting money because we will be cheating ourselves,” she said.
Mujuru claimed that there was a clandestine plan to unseat her from power after using her to build ZimPF.
“Our constitution says we are not going to hero-worship anyone and on our apparels we are not going to put anyone's face,” she said.
“I was begged to put my face because people said we can't sell the party if people don't know who is the leader, you are the brand that people are coming for at PF, so are your picture and the party name.
“Their plan was to say after I have worked and there is no clear leader in the party, they would then step in and take over the reins as they were now trying to do.”
The former Vice-President added: “They are now saying they don't want to be led by a woman. Male chauvinism is bad. Let's work together because we have been fighting for equal opportunities wherever they are. We were fighting for equal opportunities.
“Each time, they would say the party is ours, we started the party. We know they started it and they are supposed to be respected, but if you are demanding, every day, to be respected, I start to question and think maybe you are barren.”
Gumbo dismissed the allegations as lies, saying Mujuru should come clean on the source of funding for her livelihood, saying she was heavily funded by President Robert Mugabe's government.
“She is the one who has cars and she receives fuel from Mugabe, her cars are serviced by government and she gets money from there, she is the one who wants money. I have never been one for that, I drive a Honda Fit and I like it simple,” he said.
Mutasa was not reached for comment.
Meanwhile, Gumbo and his group yesterday said they would today announce their new political plans following their nasty fallout with Mujuru last week.
He dismissed Mujuru's move to visit various provinces to consolidate her power base, saying it would come to nothing, as she was meeting people who were not in ZimPF structures.
“We don't believe in going around the provinces meeting vendors and so on, as if that is what can change the Zimbabwean situation,” he said.
“Those people she is meeting are not bona fide members. These are just ordinary people, who are keen to see what Mujuru looks like.
“This is what we were critical of. Instead of spending time building structures of the party speaking about your ideology and what can be done to win people's confidence, she chooses to spend time wondering about doing useless rallies. We don't believe in that.”
Already, Mujuru has visited Masvingo, Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and South and Mashonaland Central provinces.
Tomorrow, she will be in Manicaland. – NewsDay
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is more commonly known simply as "ISO 27001". It is, as the ISO website puts it, "the best-known standard in the family providing requirements for an information security management system".
On the other hand, many businesses think it is a highly complex, unattainable standard – and a pain in the backside – as customers demand compliance ever more frequently.
But much of what I hear about ISO 27001 is conjecture and misinformation. The standard is quite short and very easy to understand: it is 34 pages long and the meat of it doesn't start until page nine and ends on page 30. Although it is not trivial to implement, the difficulty with ISO 27001 is not attaining certification. It is in remaining accredited by demonstrating that you act properly in your day-to-day, business-as-usual operations.
Compliant vs certified
I'll be honest – I have a hard time with companies that claim to be "ISO 27001 compliant" that haven't gone out and become formally certified. The difference is simple. If you are certified, you've had an independent auditor spend time examining how you operate and confirm that you do so within the requirements of the standard.
But if you claim to be compliant you are basically self-certifying – you're saying: "We believe that our business operates such that an ISO 27001 assessor would certify that we do so." My response is: "OK, so why haven't you spent a few thousand quid being audited, then?" After all, the time and effort you'll have expended internally will be far greater than the cost of an independent audit.
The basics of ISO 27001 Security is an inherent consideration in the way you work, not something you look at every few months when an audit is due. ISO 27001 provides a framework for implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that encompasses the policies, procedures and standards that sets out how you run your company.
To embark on the road to becoming ISO 27001 accredited, the first thing you need to do is decide which elements of your business you want to include in the accreditation. Yes, that's right: you don't have to do the whole lot at once.
Sounds a bit bonkers, but if your business is multifaceted and has several divisions that address many vertical markets it is not unusual to, say, go for accreditation of your ecommerce department first and follow later with your marketing department.
ISO 27001 is handy like that: you can split the task into bite-size chunks and do them one at a time. In this respect it is similar to Agile development in that you can take several small steps instead of one socking big one.
The scope
Once you've decided which bit(s) of the business you want to certify, you need to decide the criteria under which you want to certify them. Step one is to acknowledge that clauses four to 10 of the standard are mandatory, so you must comply with them. The key components are:
Leadership: you need complete buy-in from senior management – preferably at a company level but at least at the highest point of management for the bit you're certifying. If you don't have this commitment, don't even bother trying – because you will fail.
Risk (clause 6 is called "Planning" but it really means "risk"): the absolute core of ISO 27001 is security risk assessment, analysis and treatment.
Engagement: clause 7 is called "Resources" but it's all about engaging with everyone responsible for implementing security, promoting awareness, training them where appropriate, communicating about security issues and documenting processes, procedures and standards.
Operation: the ongoing activity of assessing and reassessing risks regularly and dealing with them.
Evaluation: frequent checks of where you are, internal audits and management reviews (remember the leadership element above).
Improvement: not just dealing with issues that you find when assessing risks and doing internal audits, but proactive improvement even where you haven't found anything particularly lacking.
The key sub-clause
The other essential element is, oddly enough, buried in a sub-clause of a sub-clause (specifically clause 6.1.3): the Statement of Applicability (SoA). This is where you list the criteria on which you'll be measured, so what you need to do is come up with a list of things that are relevant to your organisation.
Helpfully, the standard gives you a starting point in the form of Annex A, which begins on page 18 of the document and is a long list of controls that you should consider for inclusion in your SoA.
Some are classed as "mandatory" – but realistically this is because one cannot imagine an organisation where they would not be relevant: examples are A.7.1.2 (terms and conditions of employment of staff) and A.16.1.5 (security incident response). Although Annex A is 13 pages long you don't necessarily have to include everything – particularly if much of what your business does relates to physical rather than IT security. What matters is that you consider each item and decide if it is in or out of scope.
Thinking of what's not there
Bear in mind, though, that Annex A is a starting point, not an all-encompassing nirvana. It is essential that you consider stuff that could relate to security but isn't covered by the list in Annex A. The obvious place to look is in any other regulatory requirements that cover your business: for example, if you're a finance business an ISO 27001 auditor would expect you to include controls that relate to the requirements of your financial services regulator. An auditor will question your thoroughness if all you've done is list the Annex A clauses and not added anything else.
Engaging third parties
Unless you have internal staff qualified in ISO 27001 practices, it makes sense to engage a third-party specialist to help you out. First of all they'll help you put together your SoA and the required documentation you will need to implement controls (many will provide templates for your documents: one size definitely doesn't fit all, but starting from a general template instead of a blank page is a great help). You can arrange to taper off the third-party support as your internal expertise grows, but having access to people who have done it loads of times before is a great way to get going.
You may be surprised to hear that you should also engage with an auditor early on in your ISO 27001 implementation. There are many organisations out there that will provide this service, and you'll usually find that a specific auditor is assigned to deal with you on an ongoing basis.
The reason is simple: if a different person rocked up for every six or 12-monthly audit he or she will spend half the time learning about your organisation, whereas someone with continuity of relationship will hit the ground running each time. It's a slightly odd arrangement given that the auditor is supposedly independent. But you are paying their company to audit you, and the auditors are in turn audited by their peers and the accrediting body to keep things above board.
Get some internal expertise
Clause 9.2 in the standard is one of the most important, and it's all about internal audit. Between your independent audits you are expected to do your own internal audits and act on the findings – and that means you need some knowledge of how to do this.
I wholeheartedly recommend simply sending a couple of people – preferably from independent divisions so they don't have axes to grind against the auditees – on an ISO 27001 Implementer or Auditor course. It's a few days and a couple of thousand pounds well spent, and it equips you with the knowledge of everything the external auditor will be doing when he or she visits. I did precisely this a few months ago and the clarity it brought to how to do ISO 27001 was staggering.
Keep the wheels turning: I said right at the beginning that the hardest part of ISO 27001 accreditation is maintaining the standards of operation required. You need to demonstrate that you have a constant focus and are reviewing your entire regime regularly and in a controlled fashion: if you just have a two-week push in the fortnight before the independent audit you're kidding yourself and the auditor won't fall for it.
Most importantly – be honest
The final thing to remember is that you need to be honest – with yourself and with your auditor. There's no point trying to sweep failings under the carpet and pretend they didn't happen, because they'll come back to bite you. In fact the most prominent odour of rodent occurs when your incident log shows you had nothing of interest happen in the last few months: unless you're unbelievably perfect there will have been something that didn't quite go right. Pretend to be perfect and the auditor will see right through you.
And the point is this: your ISO 27001 ISMS is there as a framework to help you manage your information security in a risk-based way. There's no such thing as a company that has no risks: what the auditor is looking for is evidence that you frequently look for risks, you evaluate the ones you find, and you take appropriate action (which for minor risks may be to change nothing and accept them as-is).
Excellent is good enough
The final note is that since (as I've already mentioned) perfection seldom exists in business, it's not a requirement for ISO 27001 either. When your auditor gives you your report, it would be very unusual for it not to contain negative findings – nonconformities, as they're termed.
But nonconformities come in two flavours, and only "major" ones make you fail: generally speaking, you're slapped with these when there are clear, systematic, fundamental failures in your regime that show the auditor that your ISMS and/or the way you run it just isn't up to the job.
"Minor" nonconformities are part of life, and tend to relate to isolated failings or small gaps in what you do, and they don't destroy your accreditation – so long as you respond to them and take the necessary action to put them right.
ISO 27001 doesn't, then, certify perfection. But it does certify excellence, and I think that's the best most of us can strive for. ®

From Top Gear and Fifth Gear, to driving the world's fastest Tesla.
Timothy “Tiff” Needell is a British racing driver and television presenter most known for his work as a co-presenter of two of the most popular car shows of the last decade; Top Gear and of Fifth Gear.
For this video, Tiff goes green, giving an Electric GT Tesla P100D a proper bashing on the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
The vehicle in question is a race-prepped Tesla Model S. Just 20 of these high-performance machines will debut this year in the Electric Production Car Series (EPCS) – the first all-electric, zero-emissions race series. In its inaugural season, drivers will compete in identical race-prepared Tesla Model S P100D, possibly giving us one of the most thrilling eco-friendly, bumper to bumper racing on some of the world's most renowned circuits.
The performance figures behind this race-prepped Tesla Model S are just mind-numbing. The racecar is able to sprint from 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in just 2.1 seconds, three-tenths quicker than the production version. Pirelli actually had to re-engineer their P ZERO slicks to handle the overwhelming power, exerted by the 778 bhp (585 kW) and 995 Nm torque produced by the race car. Additionally, the Electric GT Tesla P100D features a monstrous 100 kWh Lithium-ion battery, currently the largest one in motorsport, allowing it to cover approximately 90 km on a single charge, all at racing speed.
“The standard drivetrain is in a 25% lighter car, so the stresses are actually less than it has been designed for in the production vehicle,” Gemmell said. “This also makes the championship more valuable for Tesla road customers, as our racing cars are closer to what they drive, so you're essentially seeing a production vehicle on circiuit.” – Electric GT CEO Mark Gemmell
The vehicle utilizes CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) parts to achieve a weight 1102 (500kg) less than the production car, all the while improving the car's downforce and its aerodynamic profile. The race car utilizes a front splitter and a rear wing, giving the Electric GT Holding's EPCS race car has improved grip through the corners. Furthermore, the vehicle is equipped with double steel wishbone pushrod operated suspension, joined by a dual circuit, single pedal hydraulic race brakes that further improve cornering speeds.
The video below will give you a taste of speed these cars achieve. Press play below and see Tiff Needel get behind the wheel for a short drive around the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.

Grizzly Bear's new video for “Mourning Sound” is, according to a press release, “a playful, pastel-drenched commentary on women's liberation.” Directed by Beatrice Pegard and starring Clemence Poesy (Harry Potter, In Bruges), the clip features a group of sternly defiant women dancing their way through a luxurious mansion. There's the take-no-shit bride, the race car driver-slash-mother, and the literally bright scientist. You even get some drumming on man butts and rainbow nipple beams, so perhaps the video should be labeled slightly NSFW. Take a look up above.
“Mourning Sound” is the lead single off Painted Ruins, Grizzly Bear's first new album since 2012's Shields. Due out August 18th, the band will support the release with a full fall tour. Find the updated itinerary below.

YANGON (Reuters) - Hundreds of Buddhists took to the streets in western Myanmar on Sunday to protest against aid organisations they accuse of giving support to Muslim Rohingya militants, police and a protest leader said.
Buddhist monks and members of the Rakhine ethnic group held demonstrations in 15 towns, including the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, demanding that aid agencies leave the western state immediately, Htay Aung, a self-described leader of the protests, told Reuters by phone.
“We will protest again and again until we get our demands. If the government fails to act, that is their responsibility,” he said.
Tensions have risen once again in Rakhine since seven Buddhists were found hacked to death in the mountains in the north of the state in July.
The government said it had discovered forest encampments that proved Muslim "extremists" were responsible for the killings, and the military sent additional forces to the area this week.
At one suspected militant camp last month, biscuits originating from the United Nations' World Food Programme were discovered. Ethnic Rakhine Buddhists have long accused U.N. and other aid organisations of favouring the Rohingya with aid.
CRACKDOWN
The state was plunged into violence in October, when Rohingya insurgents killed nine border police, sparking a crackdown in which government security forces were accused of raping, killing and torturing Rohingya civilians.
About 1.1 million Rohingya Muslims live in Rakhine, but are denied citizenship and face restrictions on their movements and access to basic services. About 120,000 remain in camps set up after deadly violence swept the state in 2012, where they rely on aid agencies for basic provisions.
Pictures shared online of Sunday's protests showed saffron-robed monks holdings signs reading, “We don't need terrorist supporter group,” and calling for the U.N. and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to “get out”.
Htay Aung said the protesters demanded that the government rid the state of Muslim militants, quickly verify the citizenship credentials of Muslims and allow Rakhine Buddhists to form armed militias.
Police Major Cho Lwin estimated that about 600 people protested in Sittwe.
“The protest went ahead today peacefully,” he said, adding that police had stepped up security and blocked roads leading to aid offices.
Reuters obtained the text of note sent by the U.N. on Wednesday to the 300 or so U.N. staff in Rakhine, as well as INGOs, warning of rising hostility to international agencies in the state.
SAN DIEGO — Following one of its worst defensive performances since the turn of the century in a loss to UNLV on Jan. 27, San Diego State threw a defensive curveball at the Air Force Academy on Saturday night.
"We played zone for the first time in a long time," San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said.
Jalen McDaniels had 16 points, on 7-of-10 shooting, and 13 rebounds to help San Diego State beat Air Force 81-50 on Saturday night.
Air Force shot just 20 of 61 (32.8 per cent) from the field. In SDSU's last game, the Aztecs allowed the UNLV to shoot 58.6 per cent — the highest mark against a San Diego State team in 11 seasons.
"I remember when I first started looking at State you would see the man and the full-court press," said San Diego State's Jeremy Hemsley. "Air Force forces you to play zone because you have to guard their offence for the entire 25 seconds. They do so many back cuts and stuff that guys can get tired real easy. I just think this was one of those games where we played zone. But I never imagined we would play it that much."
Hemsley finished with 14 points, while Max Montana and Devin Watson scored 13 apiece, for the Aztecs.
"We made a concerted effort that we were going to play some zone and we worked on it in practice," Dutcher said. "I like the zone and it was a step forward defensively and that is what we needed to do. Defence and rebounding wins championships; that is written on every locker room in the country. But it has to mean something."
San Diego State (13-8, 5-5 Mountain West) had lost four of its past five games before defeating the Falcons for the 13th straight time at Viejas Arena
Air Force (8-13, 2-7) dropped its third consecutive game and its seventh in the last nine. Lavelle Scottie, the only Falcons player to score in double figures, had 16 points.
SDSU, which was never threatened in the second half, was up 35-21 at halftime after making 8 of 16 from 3-point range. Air Force hit just 2 of 13 (15 per cent) 3-pointers and made just 9 of 32 (28.1 per cent) from the field in the first half. Scottie was 5-of-8 shooting and scored 10 of Air Force's 21 points.
LAHORE - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa have pledged to launch an extensive military operation against the terrorists without any discrimination.
Both chaired high level security meetings at Lahore in the wake of Monday's Lahore blast which claimed at least 13 lives also including two senior police officers.
Addressing the meeting, the Prime Minister said a strong and immediate operation will be launched against the terrorists and the battle against them will be brought to its logical end.
While the official statement attributed to the prime minister did not mention any specific area where the operation will be launched, ARY News, however, reported that military leadership had decided to initiate a Rangers-led operation in south Punjab after taking the Punjab government into confidence.
Nonetheless, an ISPR press release quoted the army chief as having said that “terrorists of all hue and color, their masters, financiers, planners and abettors including from outside will be hunted across the country, held accountable and responded to”.
According to an official handout, Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said that an effective and forceful reply to the terror activity was the only option that would be pursued to completely root out this cancerous problem.
The meeting chaired by the prime minister was attended by Interior Minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan, Minister for Defence Khwaja Muhammad Asif, Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, PM adviser on national security, Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan, and high level security and administrative officials.
The meeting reviewed threadbare law and order situation all over the country in addition to offering fateha for the martyrs of Faisal Chowk blast.
Additional Inspector General Counterterrorism Department (CTD) briefed the Prime Minster about the action so far taken against the terrorists in Punjab and said that as many as 231 terrorists were killed and 769 taken into custody last year. He informed the meeting that the newly installed CCTV system in the city have greatly helped the department in investigation into the Monday suicide attack. The Ad IG said CTD with the cooperation of government and the police will give befitting response to the Faisal Chowk suicide blast and soon apprehend the handlers and those involved in perpetration of the act.
Nawaz Sharif termed terrorism a cancer and said that it was our national responsibility to curb this menace.
The Prime Minister highly praised the sacrifices rendered by the Army jawans, officers, police, security persons and the people and said they laid down their lives for the nation which shall remain highly indebted to them. The premier said the dastardly acts of the evil doers could not weaken country's resolve against terrorism. “We all are determined to defeat the enemy of our peace and security”, the prime minister maintained.
The meeting also decided to adopt every measure to curb terrorism and ensure protection to the lives of the citizens. The prime minister asked for making security at public places in the city totally foolproof besides plugging the loopholes.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Federal Interior Minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan and Federal Minister for Defence Kh Asif went to the residence of Shaheed Capt (r) Ahmed Mobeen at RA Bazaar and expressed sympathies and condolences with the bereaved family. They also offered Fateha for the departed soul. Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid homage to the services of Shaheed and said that Capt (r) Ahmed Mobeen has embraced martyrdom and the nation will never forget the sacrifice of a dutiful and brave officer. They said that Capt (r) Ahmed Mobeen had sacrificed his life during the performance of his duty for a great cause and his blood will not go waste. Shehbaz Sharif said that the martyrdom of Capt. (Retd.) Ahmed Mubeen was an irreparable loss for the country and the nation. He said that Capt. (Retd.) Ahmed Mubeen was a brave son of the nation and the entire nation was proud of his sacrifice.
Also, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) visited Lahore and chaired security meeting at Corps Headquarters. Lieutenant General Sadiq Ali, Commander Lahore Corps and intelligence agencies briefed him on Monday's blast. The COAS said that such incidents could neither lower the national resolve nor could affect the ongoing efforts against terrorism. He said that terrorists of all hue and color, their masters, financiers, planners and abettors including from outside will be hunted across the country, held accountable and responded to. “Our gains over the years cannot be reversed.”, he added.
General Bajwa appreciated efforts of intelligence agencies in tracing the culprits of yesterday's blast which led to important clues about the masterminds including a few Afghans. Talking about its possible linkage to sabotage the forthcoming PSL Final match at Lahore, the COAS said that Army will extend full support to all concerned for holding the event as scheduled.
Later, COAS visited bereaved family of shaheed DIG Mubeen and offered Fatiha. Talking to mother of the Shaheed, the COAS said that sacrifice of his brave son and those by the nation shall not go waste. “We have to defeat this inhuman brutal mindset and as a nation we shall”. He also expressed his grief and condolences with other bereaved families of the last night blast. The army chief also visited the injured at Services Hospital.
Agencies add:
Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Tuesday chaired a crucial corps commander meeting at General Headquarters Rawalpindi.
During the meeting, the army chief was briefed about the suicide blast at Mall Road, Lahore. The army chief also approved the combing operation inside South Punjab during the meeting. He also directed that Punjab Government should be taken into confidence over the combing operation in South Punjab.
It was also decided in the corps commander's meeting that strict action would be taken against all those outfits that have become operational after changing their names.
The COAS also instructed local army commander and intelligence agencies to provide all necessary assistance to civil administration and also to apprehend those responsible for this heinous act.
Terror elimination pledged
Mon, Apr 17: It's the end of the ski season at Cypress Mountain and Mount Seymour despite record amounts of snow on the hills. Catherine Urquhart reports.
Last semester, the University formally recognized IX Society (IX), which was previously an “underground” local organization established eight years ago. As a recognized student group, it will receive resources like liability insurance and training on hazing prevention and drug abuse.
Former members of the Hopkins sorority Kappa Alpha Theta (Theta) founded IX as an unofficial group in 2009 after the University revoked Theta's charter following a series of disciplinary infractions. According to a spring 2017 grade report for Greek life, IX now has 84 members.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Tiffany Sanchez said that the University has been reaching out to unrecognized groups in order to ensure they are taking responsibility for the health and safety of their members.
“I'm sure there are very responsible and moral people in all groups across campus, but if you're in an unrecognized group, we don't have a formal method of being able to provide you with the resources that are available,” she said. “Now we have a formal mechanism to be able to provide training, education and leadership opportunities.”
According to the Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL) website, the University's liability insurance policies do not cover underground organizations, because these organizations “do not adhere to any policies or procedures of the University and/or inter/national office.”
Sanchez said that the administration and IX agreed to bring the organization under the University's authority.
“It was not an easy process,” she said. “Any time you're trying to loop folks in, there's going to be negotiation and hard conversations.”
FSL Director Calvin Smith explained that the process has been ongoing.
“Under the leadership of our former Associate Vice Provost and Dean of Students Terry Martinez and our Interim Dean of Students Tiffany Sanchez, we set out to work with students who may be engaging with organizations not formally recognized by the University,” he wrote in an email to The News-Letter.
Sanchez added that although administrators may have initiated contact, the process of recognizing IX was mutually agreed upon. She did not elaborate on the nature of the conversations.
“I think that's really important that [information] stays between the FSL Office and the group,” she said. “I don't know how much of that information has been shared beyond those conversations with other fraternities and sororities, and so I don't want to jeopardize the relationships that were built by sharing information out of turn.”
Sanchez and Smith both stated that they do not know why Theta was suspended in 2009, as the disciplinary action occurred prior to their tenure as Hopkins administrators. Theta returned in 2013.
According to sophomore Dean Chien, Student Government Association (SGA) senator and the chair of SGA's Student Organizations Committee, SGA was not involved in the decision to recognize IX, although it is currently listed on the Hopkins organizations directory.
Typically, the Student Organizations Committee approves applications for groups supported by FSL and other administrative offices such as Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI). However, Chien clarified that SGA does not look at any applications for Greek life organizations.
“While it may be that IX Society submits an application form to SGA, we will not review them,” he wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “We instead will refer such an application to [FSL]. [FSL] has the final say on whether IX society will be recognized.”
The IX Society and the Pan-Hellenic Council declined to comment for this article
Correction: In the print edition of this article, the IX society was characterized as a sorority when in fact the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life recognizes them as a “local organization.”

LYNCHBURG, Va. - There are countless storylines that emerge in connection with the Super Bowl and one has a local tie.
Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Nick Foles started taking graduate classes through Liberty's online program last offseason, studying in the Rawlings School of Divinity.
The 29-year-old spent last offseason at his home in Southern California, taking courses online, according to Liberty.
He plans to pick up his course load once again this coming offseason.
Foles is in the sixth season of his NFL career, but he has been open about his alternate career plans, telling the Philadelphia Inquirer that he might like to be a high school pastor.
“When you're playing in the NFL, you can only do this for a short amount of time,” he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “Guys retire before they're 30. If you play forever, you play into your 40s — and you're still a young man with a lot of life left to live. … That's what I've enjoyed in the offseason, being able to take classes, do that. It makes it easy to go play.”
Foles has not shied away from professing his faith. His Twitter bio reads, “Believer in Jesus Christ, husband, father, son, brother.”
Foles also talked about the relationship with his offensive coordinator Frank Reich, who had been in a similar role as a backup quarterback headed to his first Super Bowl and who had also been to seminary and become a pastor.
Liberty has another connection to the Super Bowl as alumna Sam Ponder ('09), the host of "Sunday NFL Countdown," will be covering the game for ESPN.

Even though they were born minutes apart, some San Diego twins are considered born a year apart.
BUSINESS
South Korean energy companies are resisting a recent government decision to impose a huge tariff on steel giant POSCO for its imports of low-priced liquefied natural gas, industry sources said Tuesday.
The backlash comes after the Korea Customs Service informed the country's leading steelmaker on Nov. 30 that it should pay 170 billion won ($156 million) in back tariffs for underreporting the price of LNG imported from Indonesia from 2012-16.
The KCS has reportedly decided to impose the tariff, believing POSCO deliberately lowered the import price by taking advantage of option contracts in order to reduce import duties.
POSCO's reported LNG import price is said to be nearly half the average cost of LNG imported by the state-run Korea Gas Corp., which serves as the benchmark for the KCS.
(Yonhap)
Last year, the customs office conducted a similar probe into city gas provider SK E&S Co., which imported LNG from Indonesia under similar terms. The office decided to slap a tariff of 150 billion won on the company."Reported import prices are far lower than the benchmark price, so they appear to have signed dual contracts to deceive the tax authorities," a KCS official said.Local energy companies, however, are opposed to the decision, claiming the tax authorities have unfairly judged their report prices are fake without clear evidence.The companies alleged that they have not intentionally underreported the price but imported LNG cheaper than KOGAS thanks to their superior negotiating power.Companies are entitled to file an appeal with the KCS against its decisions. If their appeals are rejected, they can file petitions with the Tax Tribunal. (Yonhap)

When a favorite actor gets cast in a questionable show, you have to weigh your options. Is it worth it to suffer through early episodes based just on an appreciation of this person, or is it better to not even start? With Fox's new comedy The Mick, the answer is not altogether clear. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Kaitlin Olson is the glue that holds the show together, working as hard as she can to make something out of an otherwise tired sitcom setup.
The Mick is a kind of gender-swapped Uncle Buck story, where reckless grifter Mackenzie (Olson) visits her much wealthier sister in Greenwich, Connecticut in order to ask for money. Instead, she ends up being left with the kids, as her sister and brother-in-law flee the country to avoid fraud charges by the FBI. The kids balk at Mick being put in charge, but throughout the first four episodes available for review, the show softens Mick's street-rat persona and dangerous behavior into something a little more Greenwich-friendly: eccentricity
Ultimately, the show — which comes from Sunny alums Dave and John Chernin — is about terrible people going to elaborate lengths to humiliate and one-up each other, which usually ends with a lot of shouting. For Sunny fans that will feel like home, though for more general TV watchers, The Mick is a too-familiar tale about a wayward relative and some bratty kids who end up existing as part of an uneasy alliance of convenience. Mick and “her guy” Jimmy (Scott MacArthur) need money and enjoy the benefits of the mansion, while the kids — sharp-tongued Sabrina (Sofia Black D'Elia), wealth-obsessed Chip (Thomas Barbusca), and chipper wild card Ben (Jack Stanton) — need a guardian. Rounding out the motley crew is the housekeeper Alba (Carla Jimenez), who starts out as a central casting character though slowly becomes something more.
The Mick is similarly boilerplate, but never quite becomes something more as it skirts the edges of actual child endangerment while having to ultimately play by broadcast rules. It leads to a mishmash of tone between humor and just vulgarity, and while Olson's manic energy is fantastic to watch, terrible people doing terrible things is a niche perhaps better served on cable. (It's worked for It's Always Sunny for this long, anyway). The kid actors are all good, particularly Stanton as the weird one who gets the most amount of accidental torture (burning off his taste buds at a hibachi grill, having an allergic reaction to ice cream, nearly being run over by a pony), but their characters are all one-note, a weakness in the writing that only Olson is able to overcome.
In the second episode, the show feels the need to show why Mick is the only choice to care for the children, and makes a distinction between her unconventional choices that come from a place of love rather than the reign of terror bestowed upon the kids by their grandmother. And yet, it's almost satisfying to see someone wrangle these thoughtless and spoiled kids, even if the methods are Draconian. In highlighting this, the show wants us to see Mick as someone whose heart is in the right place, ultimately, and that there is some method to her madness. The Mick stops short of having the family hug at the end of each half hour, but as the series progresses the formula for each episode is clear.
For some, Olson's immense comedic talents and the show's rude humor may be enough of a diversion to stick with The Mick, but if you want to see Olson give a similarly great performance on a much better written show, go back to It's Always Sunny. She deserved a starring vehicle, but this one let her down.
Rating: ★★ Fair — Only for the dedicated
The Mick premieres Sunday, January 1st before moving to its regular Tuesday night timeslot January 3rd on Fox.
MIRPURKHAS - A sense of insecurity has gripped the doctors and paramedics of Civil Hospital after hundreds of armed youth forced their entry into the hospital in support of some miscreants who had a verbal clash with district health officer (DHO) over the parking of bikes in Peds Ward.
DHO Dr Anwer Ali Palari, who has an additional charge of civil surgeon, was on a round of the hospital along with his colleagues late Tuesday night when some miscreants exchanged hot words with him and Cardiologist/Additional Medical Superintendent Dr Akram Sultan when they objected to the parking of bikes in Peds Ward.
After sometime, hundreds of unknown armed youth stormed into the hospital. They surrounded the hospital, and created law and order problem by manhandling both of them. They also threw stones at the doors and windows of wards and used abusive language.
Panicked by the situation, several doctors and paramedical staff came out of their wards. After learning about the incident, heavy contingents of police arrived at the hospital to cool down the situation.
Later, police forced the miscreants to settle the dispute with the officers after which the miscreants dispersed.
Later, talking to this correspondent Dr Anwer Ali Palari and Dr Akram Sultan said that they would register a case against these persons for creating hurdles in official duty and damaging the government property.
They alleged that the attackers belonged to a land mafia, which had hurled threats at them in the past too.
In 1999 the eponymous owner of the popular proto-blog Stile Project wrote a post called “The Mercury Effect.”
In it Stile described receiving a video from some fans who had, if I remember correctly, tortured a stray cat to death in his honor; they appeared to have been inspired by the other shocking material he'd posted and solicited. Stile briefly discussed the despondency into which this event had plunged him and his failing hopes for the human race. The title referred to the madness visited upon haberdashers by an invisible force, something to which he perhaps sensed a modern analog.
He concluded: “Something wonderful is going to happen at midnight.” That night, he turned on his webcam's live broadcast function, stepped onto a chair, and hung himself.
Or appeared to. A few days and a great deal of speculation later, it was revealed that the whole thing was a hoax, something Stile was fond of perpetrating — though this one was especially cruel. All this material has passed from the internet's memory (even Archive.org's), but I've never been able to forget it.
This horrible little episode seems a to me a spiritual precursor to this weekend's all-too-real socially promoted murder, and the issues that have resurfaced in its wake. But for all the talk about content moderation, machine learning, flag-monitoring algorithms, the problem isn't the platform, and it isn't one that can be solved by the platform. That's because the problem is people.
I wrote a while back in Hate that not only is it naive to think the tools we create won't be used for evil, but it's irresponsible to pretend so. This is just another example of that. Connect depressed people with a support network here, and you connect white supremacists with gun dealers there. You make a forum for supporting recent immigrants here, and you make one for choosing women to harass there. Let a zoo share a baby giraffe with millions, let someone else stream the murder of a stranger.
This is a direct, unavoidable consequence of the tools; they're not being “abused” or “misappropriated.” Routers and switches don't care if they relay coding tutorials or child porn, just like a car doesn't care whether you drive it into a garage or a crowd.
By empowering people to broadcast themselves, you empower the meek and the oppressed equally much as the dangerous and the hateful.
What did you expect? Those people are out there in their millions. They want you to experience the extent of their hate just as much as a lonely kid wants to get support from her peers. As with the Morlocks in The Time Machine, every once in a while those of us living in blissful ignorance are reminded of their presence by some horrific act. That sort of thing was always happening, but now you're aware of it. Thanks, internet.
Pick your fail state
You won't like the solutions.
The first one is: disconnect. Don't use the tools of the information age to connect with the world at large. I think we can all agree that it's a little late to try putting that particular genie back in the bottle. Even if millions of people submitted themselves to a modern asceticism and denied themselves access to social media and other communication tools, it accomplishes nothing. If anything, it merely moves the needle of the remaining online population towards the side of extreme sharing. So we can forget about disconnecting.
The second one is: submit to extremely invasive content monitoring. Live TV has faced a problem that is at least superficially similar and networks' solution — delayed live broadcasting and someone with their finger on the “cut to commercial” button — works, after a fashion. But the volume of material put on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on is such that this approach is quickly rendered absurd. Even hundreds of thousands of moderators assisted by the latest tools struggle to keep up with the fraud, gore, and porn that would otherwise engulf the web.
Could machine learning algorithms eventually learn the difference between a sleeping person and a dead one? A scene from an action move and a real murder? There is great promise here but the flip side of that is the idea that everything you create will be analyzed frame by frame, every action categorized and recorded with a granularity that may creep out even the most permissive and laissez-faire of us. And even if the machines had their way with our content, it would still require an army of humans to verify each decision. Platforms have already learned that lesson.
The only feasible way to vet content quickly and accurately is through the community, but it is in order that it may be provided to that community that the content must be vetted. It's a Gordian Knot, and us without a sword.
The third “solution” is to admit there isn't one. Admit the problem as it stands can't be resolved, that solutions at best merely hide or delay it, that the fundamental nature of the tools and platforms we've created enables both miracles and enormities. We can appreciate the former while doing our best to combat the causes of the latter. If people didn't go around killing each other all the time, we wouldn't be forced into uncomfortable acknowledgement of the fact that all is not well in the world. Wouldn't that be nice?
So, the elevation of humanity's ethical acumen. More of a long-term goal, I'd say.
The best policy
The thing is, the kind of philosophically-inclined defeatism I just endorsed isn't really a crowd pleaser. When you've got a billion angry users and a board breathing down your neck, you've got to take action — even when there's no action to take. But in this case can you, or more specifically Mark Zuckerberg, even say “we're working on it”?
We know as well as he does that Facebook can't prevent this stuff. The risk is baked into the platform. Real-time sharing is fundamental to the company's vision of the future of communication. It's too late to go back on that. The best they can hope to do is react faster.
Can he lie, or prevaricate, about their hopes to solve this, and get away with it? Because there isn't really a way forward; in a few weeks or months, when something like this happens again, he'll be called to account. The reality of the problem's insolubility will catch up to any promises he makes. So why make them? People aren't going to leave Facebook because it has no way of censoring the real world.
In this case, Zuckerberg's position is stable enough that he may well tell the (relatively) unvarnished truth, albeit with the frame of reference changed a little. The risk of unwillingly hosting atrocities is inherent to Facebook's mission (he will say) to connect all the people of the globe. There is no way to prevent it except by infringing on the privileges, perhaps even the rights, of those people — and Facebook will always decline to do that. What's more, he may add, sunlight is after all the best disinfectant. We have to know of these people, these problems, before we can address them.
Shall we remain inside our safe little bubble, hearing only that which pleases us and seeing not that which frightens or confuses us? Shall we be forever free of cognitive dissonance, isolated from disharmony long enough that we forget that we are surrounded with it, a few of us merely lucky enough to have the choice of ignoring it? Well, maybe Zuck won't say that exactly, but the sentiment, I suspect, may come through.
We're only human, and the internet reflects that. What's to fix?

LILONGWE-(MaraviPost)-The main opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) President, Lazarus Chakwera, has asked for peaceful protests this coming Friday and appealed for calm from all willing demonstrators.
The demonstrations have been planned by rights activists to protest against the K4 billion payouts and other social issues affecting Malawians.
Chakwera, who said he fully subscribes to the 10-point demand that the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have formulated for the demonstrations, said the right to demonstrate is an expression of people's views towards those in power.
He said the issues that the CSOs are demanding are the same issues that legislators have been raising in Parliament.
“My appeal would be, let them be done peacefully. Let them be done in a way that truly expresses the grievances that Malawians feel at this particular time,” he said.
“But you can also see that it has been a build up because these issues have not just come out of the blues. It is a combination of impunity, insensitivity and the kind of carefree attitude the present administration has demonstrated over the last four years,” Chakwera said.
On the accusations that the opposition is equally compromised and does not have moral grounds to speak on the K4 billion payout issue, the Leader of Opposition said looking at the role of Parliament in the mess, such people could be right.
He, however, said the government narrative before and after Parliament's approval is vindicating the suspicions that parliamentarians were duped into thinking that the payout was good for Malawians, when in actual sense, it was not done in good faith and Parliament needs to cleanse itself.
“I said Parliament needs to do something in its own right. Because what has happened is almost legitimisation of something that is not right and yet going through the right process and that is not correct,” he said.
Chakwera said he is backing the demonstrations and Malawians have reached the point of saying enough is enough.
However, the Vice-President Saulos Chilima on Monday followed the footsteps of President Peter Mutharika in rebuffing a request from civil society organisations (CSOs) during the planned April 27 demonstrations to personally receive a petition.
Considering that television star and activist Cynthia Nixon announced on Monday that she would be running for governor's seat in New York, you might be wondering who Christine Marinoni is. Nixon's wife works in the LGBTQ community as an activist and recently served in the capacity of an adviser for New York City's Deputy Mayor Richard Buery while helping Buery with the city's community partnerships program. Marinoni stepped down from her position in March this year.
In a 2017 interview with City and State New York, Marinoni said that her journey as an activist began in 1995 after she came out as a lesbian. She said that it happened after she set up a lesbian-friendly bar in Brooklyn's bustling Park Slope neighborhood. One of her colleagues, a bartender, was targeted in a hate crime, according to Marinoni.
Ever since then, Marinoni began organizing to highlight the issue of homophobia in the city. "We organized some events to bring attention to it, and call for more police attention and protection for the community. Then the Matthew Shepard killing happened and we were also the same folks who had organized the marches in Park Slope, and were kind of the key organizers for some of the work that happened then," Marinoni said.
Marinoni said that during that time, she had been dating her now-wife Nixon. The couple began working together to bring awareness to anti-LGBTQ crimes while Marinoni told City and State New York, "We went up a few times to Albany and met with legislators and talked to them about passage of gay marriage in New York City."

As an LGBTQ advocate, Marinoni told City and State New York that she believed that her activism needed to be intersectional in order to have any effect on improving living conditions for LGBTQ New Yorkers. In the interview, she spoke of working in New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration and bringing a more intersectional approach to LGBTQ outreach programs.
"I think it's important for the LGBT community to be joining hands with other groups and issues like income inequality and education. Within this administration, I don't work on LGBTQ issues, but I also like working for an administration which has really been so on the forefront of addressing issues in the LGBTQ community," she said.

Nixon and Marinoni's relationship has been private, for the most part, as the couple seems to avoid publicity. While speaking with Radio Times in 2017, Nixon talked about Marinoni and how both women realized they were in love with each other after they began dating in 2004. Nixon said,
I had never dated a woman before or even kissed a woman or anything. So when we started seeing each other, Christine kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for me to panic about what this would mean – to my career or to myself – as if somehow I just hadn't noticed that she was a woman. And then she met my mother and that was when she stopped worrying about it.
It isn't just the Marinoni's activism that warmed Nixon to her but it also seems like her style is something Nixon admires and loves. The Sex and The City actress told The Advocate in 2010, "A lot of what I love about her is her butchness. I'm not saying I fell in love with her in a sexually neutral way. I love her sexuality—it's a big part of what I love about her—but I feel like it was her."
Now that Nixon has announced that she is running for New York's governor's position, you can expect to see Marinoni right by her wife's side.

LONDON (AP) — Roger Federer and Serena Williams are both back on Centre Court at Wimbledon on Wednesday as they look to advance to the third round.
Federer will play Lukas Lacko of Slovakia as he continues his quest for a record-extending ninth title at the England Club. Williams then faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova as she goes for a 16th straight match win at the tournament — having missed last year while pregnant.
Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and last year's men's runner-up, Marin Cilic, are also back in action as they try to avoid more upsets at the tournament. Three of the top-10 seeded men lost in the first round, while former champions Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova also went out on Tuesday.
The forecast calls for more sunny skies, although there is a 30 percent chance of rain showers in the afternoon.

Nate Moore has been a producer on Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, but his biggest project to date is also the biggest milestone for the MCU: Black Panther. His excitement was palpable during our visit to the set with a group of journalists last year, and fans' anticipation for the Marvel movie has risen to match it. And with good reason.
Moore was happy to answer all sorts of questions about Black Panther, from its origins in the pages of Marvel comics and which writers and artists inspired the film's look, to the incredible cast and the bigger-than-life characters they'll play on the screen, to the timely social context of the film and how it will both honor the character's legacy and feel like a contemporary story, without being too on-the-nose about anything politically. The story of Black Panther, as Moore described it, was one part James Bond and one part The Godfather, with the expected amount of Marvel action in the mix thanks to writer/director Ryan Coogler‘s dynamic adaptation and understanding of the material. There's a lot to dig into here, so let's get to it!
Where does this story begin? Can you tell us that?
Nate Moore: It begins where Civil War left off, right? So obviously that movie had a big impact on T'Challa because of T'Chaka's death. So now we answer the question, What happens when he goes home? Who rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T'Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?
Branching off that, the thing that's really interesting about Black Panther is the fact he, obviously, being royalty, he has a certain dedication to Wakanda, but being a world leader, he also has a responsibility to the rest of the world. How is that being balanced within this film?
Moore: I think that's the big question, Can you be a leader for a country and still be a hero? And still look out for the interests of the world when really you have a constituency that has a very specific agenda. In our world, Wakanda is a place where the rest of the world doesn't know how advanced they are. So he's trying to keep this veil of secrecy in this nation to keep them protected but morally, he understands that he could be doing more for the world and that's the tension we play with.
Obviously the mantle of King and the mantle of Black Panther are things that are passed down in Wakanda. How much is that going to be explored in the film as far as the Panthers that have come before him?
Moore: It's definitely a big piece of the movie and we wanted to explore how succession works in Wakanda. Again, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what was clear in Civil War and what we actually think was clear was that you could be king without being Panther and vice versa. So we always imagined T'Chaka was King but T'Challa already was Black Panther.
So what happens now when the Black Panther is next in line to be King? And are people going to be okay with him taking the mantle? Or is there going to be any resistance to that? It's a big plot point in the movie. All of Wakanda is not monolithic. Everybody doesn't agree about everything. Everybody doesn't like the same people. So while some people may love the idea of T'Challa taking the mantle of king, other people may object to it and what happens then? How do you keep this country unified?
Can you talk about Killmonger's role? Is there a power play for him trying to take the mantle or that sort of thing?
Moore: Yeah, I think for Killmonger it's… Again, the interesting comparison we've been making, and this is going to sound crazy, but we've always thought of Black Panther as a James Bond kind of movie, right? Sort of this big globe-trotting epic.
But in talking with Ryan Coogler, the director, one of the ideas he also liked was this sort of Godfather-kind of story. When I say Godfather, it's the idea that it's very much a story about family and a story about an organization where new leadership is taking place. And much like the Godfather, you have to fight for things, right? And they're all vying for power and in this case, it's power over Wakanda. I think Killmonger sees Wakanda as something that could be used differently than it currently is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that puts him directly at odds with T'Challa.

Police foil bid to smuggle arms
ISRAR AHMED
RAWALPINDI – Police have arrested a man trying to smuggle a cache of arms and ammunition from Gujranwala to Dara on Friday, informed RPO Office sources.
The smuggler, who has been identified as Syed Hussain, hails from Dara. A case has been registered against the accused while further investigation is underway.
According to sources, the officials of police station Sohawa headed by Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Ilyas set up a picket on GT Road on a tip-off that some smugglers would try to smuggle weapons from tribal areas to various parts of Punjab. On the checkpoint, police stopped a suspicious-looking car and recovered 6 pistols, a rifle with 12 magazines and 700 bullets from the vehicle. The driver was arrested on the spot and shifted to the police station.
The car was also impounded by police.
DSP Sohawa Shahid Nazir, while talking to media men, said that they are carrying out an investigation to determine whether the weapons being smuggled to Gujranwala from Dara, were to be used in a terrorist activity or to be handed over to arms dealers.
As VR breaks new territory, matures as a medium, and the market for VR storytelling grows, it edges ever closer from specialty item to consumer product. Moviemakers are paying attention.
But how do moviemakers move from traditional forms of moviemaking to working in VR? What do you take with you, and what do you leave behind? The reality of virtual reality is that no one has definitive answers. VR experts Jessica Brillhart, principal moviemaker for virtual reality at Google and Gabo Arora, VR moviemaker of ZIKR, The Last Goodbye, and In Clouds Over Sidra offer some principles to guide your VR journey.
Brillhart created a nine-minute, VR experience called Beethoven's Fifth, in partnership with Google and NASA, that leads users on an immersive journey through interstellar space and a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The 306-degree, interactive work combines shots of the orchestra with abstract art and takes inspiration from the Voyager's “Golden Record” in which Beethoven's Fifth Symphony was one of the recordings sent into space forty years ago. It premiered at SXSW in March 2018.
Arora directed ZIKR: A Sufi Revival, which premiered in the New Frontier section of Sundance 2018, and holds the distinction of being the first ever VR documentary acquired at the festival. The 17-minute work takes participants on a VR journey into the nature of faith and the mystical Islamic tradition of Sufism, using song and dance to shed light on Islamic practices of inclusion, acceptance, art, joy and understanding. Dogwoof, a documentary distributor, sales agent, and producer acquired it in the milestone deal. Arora's prior VR work include The Last Goodbye, a room-scale experience where a Holocaust survivor recalls his experiences, and Clouds Over Sidra, produced with the UN which follows a 12-year-old Syrian refugee.
Brillhart and Arora spoke last fall at the launch of a new VR program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The graduate-level program, Immersive Storytelling and Emerging Technologies (ISET), began this January as a concentration within Master of Arts in Film and Media program, of which Arora serves as the Assistant Director. He also leads the ISET concentration. Steal their five tips below as you venture on your own VR journey.
LAHORE - It was difficult to understand why he was doing it but one could gauge the pain that he was still going through while standing at the Charing Cross signal the site of tragic blast incident.
The man was Naveed Khan, who runs a shwarma shop on The Mall. He was taking photos and making videos with his cell phone of the site, which was washed sometime in the late afternoon. It was amazing the way he was taking the photos. “It was a tragic incident. It is now part of history and I want to keep record of this tragic chapter of our history. Last night I had seen this place filled with the blood and body parts of the victims of bomb blast.
“It's heart wrenching as I saw it all personally just few yards from Al-Falah building,” Naveed said. He is no doubt a very brave man who instead of running away from the scene fully participated in relief efforts to shift the injured and dead bodies to hospitals.
“The site has been washed. Nothing reminds you of what happened yesterday. It is black metal surface of the road and a shattered-pole,” he said with a sigh.
The Charing Cross was opened to traffic and public at around five in the evening. Every passerby stood for a moment. Men or women on foot or in their cars slowed down to have a look at the same place where the incident had taken place. There was sadness on everyone's face and the people hardly talked about what had happened there yesterday. Their solemn faces showed their grief. Their eyes were telling the whole truth.
“It's unbelievable that how a man with so many explosives came here to conduct the blast. Today, all my fellow traders are very sad for the innocent lives that we have lost,” Naveed said.
A couple on a motorbike stood there for some minutes and started cursing perpetrators of the blast. They also condemned the government for its failure to protect people. “Hell to the attacker and hell to those who gave him birth,” said the lady, with anguish visible on her face. “Baira gharq howay zalma da” (may they rot in hell), the lady said loudly and then they both left for their destination.
Some people who were sitting beside the wall of Al-Habib Bank near Regal Chowk, just in front of Hall Road at the Mall, and were sharing their views about the incident.
Rafiq Ahmed, a man with white beard and wrapped in green shalwar kameez said to another man sitting next to him whom he called Tahir at the tea shop. “Police were targeted because the attacker blew himself up at the moment when all the senior officials had reached there.
“Some days ago, a religious group staged rally but it was all peaceful. There was no terror threat then. But these peaceful pharmacists became target of terrorists,” he said. This scribe also intervened and asked them that “if the IPL was the focus of the perpetrators as some people were saying that India doesn't want it to be successful” they replied “No, this doesn't look like, it were police.
Another at the place sipping tea said very quietly that this is a new series of attacks which has begun when the new team of army leadership is in charge now and they want to put pressure on it. They, then started criticizing police saying that how a common man expect peace and safety if police themselves are not secure.
“Yes, you're right! No security for anyone. May God bless us all. We are at the mercy of God,” Tahir Wadood said.
Though, the traffic was allowed in the evening, no rush was observed. Sadness had descended everywhere. During the visit of old Mozzang Bazaar the shops were open but mostly the people who were sitting at different places were expressing their anger and despair.
“The terrorists have become so strong that they can hit anywhere, anytime,” said Shabbir Maanik who is owner of an eatery at Mozang Bazaar.
“We're insecure because the attack did not even spare senior police officials. Nothing is safe including schools, hospitals, buses and trains, because our rulers do nothing for the public rather than make hollow slogans. Why they are not ever attacked?” lamented Shabbir while dealing with a consumer who had come there to buy some ‘Naan Channay'.
“We lack the system and we don't want to improve it. So such incidents can't stop. The attackers belong to us; we brought them up and now we are reaping what we had sown. The sense of fear and killing will prevail unless serious radical steps are taken to combat this menace,” Zahid Azeem said. Zahid is a teacher who teaches at a private school on Empress Road and lives in Mozang area.
A man was sent to hospital in serious but stable condition after a vehicle collided with a building in Moncton on Tuesday evening.
At approximately 9:10 p.m., emergency services responded to reports of a collision at the intersection of High and St. George streets.
When they arrived, members of the New Brunswick RCMP found that a vehicle had struck the side of the Jean Coutu Pharmacy.

Members of the Moncton Fire Department were able to stabilize the vehicle and assisted paramedics as the man was removed from the vehicle.
The driver of the vehicle was the only person involved in the crash.
Police continue to investigate the incident.

Charlotte, N.C. — Justin Thomas is a major champion. When he became one is more meaningful than where.
If he had to pick a major to win first, the PGA Championship would have been the most appropriate because of his family heritage. The first person he hugged was his father. The first person he called was his grandfather. Both are longtime club professionals. Mike Thomas, his father, served on the PGA of America board.
“For this to be my first one and have my dad here, and I know Grandpa was watching at home. I was able to talk to him, and that was pretty cool,” Thomas said after his two-shot victory at Quail Hollow.
The message from Paul Thomas: “This is the first of many.”
The first one can be the hardest.
Jordan Spieth brought that up last month before he won his third at the British Open. He won his first one at the 2015 Masters when he was 21 without breaking too much of a sweat, at least on the outside. He never let anyone closer than three shots after the opening round, a feat accomplished only one other time in Masters history.
But he was keenly aware of the significance.
“I can win this major here and it would be a huge monkey off the back,” Spieth recalled thinking. “Because the longer you go without one, it's making each one harder.”
Players in their 20s won three of the majors this year.
Brooks Koepka won the U.S. Open in his 15th major as a pro. Thomas, 24, was playing in his 10th major as a pro when he won the PGA Championship. The 2015 Masters was Spieth's seventh start in the majors.
The other major champion was Sergio Garcia.
Garcia was a 19-year-old rookie when he nearly chased down Tiger Woods at Medinah in the 1999 PGA Championship with a spirit so relentless that Woods had to make an 8-foot par putt on the 17th hole to stay in the lead and win by one. The question that day was not when Garcia would win a major, but how many.
Two years later, he started the final round two shots behind at the British Open. He played in the final group in the U.S. Open a year after that, the British Open in 2006 (both times with Woods), and he had a three-shot lead at Carnoustie in 2007.
The Spaniard had speckles of gray in his stubble when he slipped on the Green Jacket in April, finally, at age 37.
“I did think about, ‘Am I ever going to win one?' ” he said when he won the Masters. “I've had so many good chances and either I lost them or someone has done something extraordinary to beat me.”
Over the last 20 years, winning a major weighed most heavily on Phil Mickelson. He finally won the 2004 Masters when he was 34, and he now has five majors. In his eighth start in a major, he squandered one of his best chances in the 1995 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills. Mickelson played the par-5 16th hole in 6 over for the week and wound up four shots behind. It would have been hard to believe then that it would take Lefty nine more years.
It's harder than ever to win on the PGA Tour, and the majors are no different. The talent pool is getting deeper and younger. Three times over the last four years, players in their 20s have won three out of four majors.
Hideki Matsuyama, the 25-year-old Japanese star, was runner-up at the U.S. Open (but never in serious contention at Erin Hills), and he had a one-shot lead walking off the 10th green Sunday at Quail Hollow. Is his time coming? He could be like Spieth (who was runner-up in the Masters before he won). He could be like Garcia.
“All I can do is try harder next time,” Matsuyama said.
And then there's Rickie Fowler, who at 28 would ordinarily be considered too young for the label of “best without a major.”
Then again, the phrase “too young” is getting old.
Fowler had his seventh top-5 finish in a major at Quail Hollow and now has played 30 majors since turning pro. The high finishes would figure to serve him well. Fowler waited behind to celebrate with Thomas, as he has graciously done for others, and he posed with Thomas and the Wanamaker Trophy.
Thomas spoke honestly of the jealousy he felt when Spieth quickly compiled three legs of the career Grand Slam (Spieth is three months younger than Thomas). But he thinks that's true for just about anyone toward the winner of any major, and he's probably right. If they're not, they should be.
“It's just nice to have one,” Thomas said.
In a strange way, Thomas felt calm realizing there were so many good players who have only one major, and it took them awhile to do it. He wouldn't be the first player to wait on that first major. It's a nice feeling knowing that he's not the next.
“To win a major at 24,” he said, “is pretty cool saying it.”
Students from Grades 7 to 12 participate in discussions and art-based activities to learn about safe space, consent and healthy relationships. ( Fatima Syed )
There are only 48 children in the Dorion Public School. Situated off the Trans Canada Highway in eastern Ontario, the primary school is surrounded by trees and bushes: no stores, no traffic, and no people. In this small rural school, sexual violence seems to be of little concern. Still, Liam Stenlund, one of six people in Grade 7, believes that the school should talk about it. In Nov. 2016, Stenlund became a participant in Campaign Messengers: Taking a Stand! — a pilot project created by the youth-focused not-for-profit organization Ophea that was formed to support the Ontario government's Sexual Violence and Harassment Action Plan. “We thought that starting at an elementary school age will help prevent it very fast,” said Stenlund. “We thought we'd eliminate the gender stereotypes before they become a big issue in our school,” said his classmate Allison Landry also in Grade 7. Funded jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Status of Women, Ophea partnered with Egale Canada, the Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres and White Ribbon to address the root causes of sexual violence and harassment through the promotion of healthy relationships, consent and social norms within the education sector.

“We strongly believe in student voice and student leadership,” said Sarah Christie, projects leader at Ophea, “and saw this as an opportunity to switch it around a bit and, as opposed to a top-down curriculum approach, really build the capacity of students to be messengers of this issue in their school communities.” According to 2013 statistics, female youth ages 12-17 years old are eight times more likely as male youth to be the victim of sexual assault or other sexual offences, and twice as likely to be victims of violence as adult women. And, 39 per cent of women has reported having experienced at least one incidence of sexual assault since the age of 16. In November, Ophea hosted a one-and-a half day training session for 100 educators and students from 26 schools from all over Ontario: Dryden, Red Rock, Wawa, and Windsor.
Students were taught the ideas of respect, listen, understand and communicate — what Ophea and the students now recognize as “the four pillars” — which they then took back to share with their schools in the form of activities and discussions. “Every school took a really sensitive and thoughtful approach to where their school was at,” said Christie, “and what activities would work best in their school community.” The most tackled topics in the campaign action plans the students created were consent, safe space/the four pillars and gender norms. For Coral Joy, a Grade 11 student from North Bay, Ont., the biggest challenge was to accommodate the maturity levels of all students involved. “Something like this can be a joke to one student but it can ruin another student's life,” she said, “and I think that's the hardest part.” When Stenlund and Landry went back to Dorion, they initiated the “Everybody Matters” week to educate their school about safe spaces. They started with a “compliment creator” to give students a chance to write positive things about one another, so that “they can feel good,” according to Landry. Other activities, included an Easter Egg hunt, where each egg held an unknown fact about a classmate to encourage better understanding; a colouring exercise with instructions, which required them to listen closely. “So often when it's solely curricular, students think this is what we have to learn and then we'll be evaluated on it,” said Liana Williams, a high school teacher who participated in the campaign. That's why some students created an unlean list or a “Dear Teacher, I wish I had learned” video. “I think students would rather follow an example of a peer than listen to someone older than them preach about something,” said Joy. In the process, kids like Maggie Shi, a Grade 11 student from Markham, Ont., learned to become more open. “I realized you don't have to be afraid of talking about these topics.”
Last fall, one of the co-founders of Duke University eNable published an article describing our club's beginnings and visions for the future. In the spring of 2016, we started out as six engineering students with a passion for innovation and design, supported by a small stipend from the Innovation Co-Lab and a grant from OSPRI (Open Source Pedagogy, Research and Innovation), a project supported by Red Hat.
Since then we have established ourselves as a presence on campus, grown into a large interdisciplinary team, and connected with multiple recipients—including a young boy in Milot, Haiti. The resources offered through Duke and the sponsorship we've received allow us to continuously transform our ideas into things we can share with open source enthusiasts, makers, and dreamers alike.
Local recipients
Over the past year, our club has been working hard with three local recipients. Kaylyn, our first connection, was introduced in the article last year. She is a cake decorator from Wake Forest for whom we are building a custom modular device with multiple attachments that each serve a specific function in her bakery. This fall, we are working on the finishing touches on Kaylyn's device and hope to deliver it within the next couple months.
Later in the year we connected with Brooke, a recent pharmacy school graduate who requested a hand that could pinch skin while she delivered subcutaneous injections. For Brooke, we started off with an open source design called the K-1 Hand; we then made modifications to adapt the shape of the thumb, create a more secure fastening system, and optimize the grip between the thumb and pointer finger. Brooke's hand is now completed and ready to be delivered upon her return to North Carolina.
For our third recipient, an 11-year-old boy named Nathan, we are using another open source file called the Unlimbited Arm. Our goal is to help Nathan transition to a medical grade prosthesis; we are also adding some fun attachments such as a slingshot and a bike handle grip.
Working with recipients around Duke helped us improve our design process and better understand the benefits of leveraging open source with original ideas. These experiences helped drive our success with our fourth recipient, a boy named Chris.
Prosthetics in process
I met Chris in the summer of 2016, while volunteering in Milot with members of my home church. Chris, who was ten years old when I met him, has a congenital upper limb amputation—he was born with half an arm on his left side. With the goals of eNable fresh in my mind, I immediately wanted to connect with him and see if there was a way for our club to help. I asked our host to translate as I explained to Chris and his parents that I am in a group that endeavors to build devices for amputees, and they expressed interest in the idea and gratitude for the desire to help.
Working with recipients around Duke helped us improve our design process and better understand the benefits of leveraging open source with original ideas.
Back on campus in the fall, I pitched the idea to our club and began forming a small team to see it through. Meanwhile, we needed to acquire funding and gain support from the university. By networking with alumni from the Pratt School of Engineering, we connected with the Given Limb Foundation , which agreed to support the project. Later, we obtained additional funding through a combined grant from the Lord Foundation and the Engineering Alumni Council.
We began the design process at the start of the summer. Using pictures of Chris next to a tape measure, we extracted measurements to get a rough estimate of dimensions—these were used to design a socket for Chris's upper arm and a forearm piece. For the hand itself, we turned to an open source design called the Gripper Thumb Hand. This design could grant Chris a basic gripping capability without requiring mechanical activation through his shoulder.
At the end of June, two of us traveled to Haiti with three different-sized prototypes, extra parts and materials, and equipment to perform a 3D structure scan and produce a plaster cast. We used this trip to test the fit and function of the prototype, and acquired a variety of measurements and models to help make appropriate modifications back at Duke.
Five weeks later, another pair of us returned with a finalized device, with updates that addressed the limitations of the prototypes. After performing a few last-minute changes on site, we were able to successfully deliver the arm to Chris and provide him with spare parts and materials to use if he outgrows this one. Over the next year, we hope to come up with a plan for the next steps of our relationship with Chris—whether that entails a return trip, connecting him with other members of the open source community, or referring to a professional prosthetics company.
What's next
As we launch into the new academic year, we are excited to work on new projects and continue pushing the boundaries of 3D printing and open source solutions. Among these are the incorporation of advanced printing techniques and more robust materials, and the development of a myoelectric arm that uses muscle signals to power motors to achieve its function. Another vital goal is to continue building relationships with prosthetists and healthcare professionals to establish the niche role of 3D printing and open source designs in this field. We want to balance the excitement of the work we do with an awareness of its technical limitations—we believe this understanding is the key to successfully delivering open source solutions.
We are grateful for the widespread and constant support we have received since eNable's inception. The Innovation Co-Lab and OSPRI program at Duke have provided us with valuable resources, mentorship, and a great workspace. The Pratt School of Engineering also helped lift us to where we are today, through connections with alumni and sponsors and opportunities to engage with more students. Most importantly, we are thankful for the students in our club for their dedication and enthusiasm towards our work.
We are always happy to engage with new people to brainstorm potential collaborations and mentorships, or talk about what we do and how we can grow. If you would like to get in touch, we would love to hear from you—email us at enabledukeuniversity@gmail.com.
Did you know that calcium accounts for around 1.5 to 2 percent of your body weight? This vital mineral is perhaps best known to strengthen bones, teeth, the heart, and slash your risk of developing a number of diseases. On the contrary, a calcium deficiency can lead to common conditions like hypertension, seizures, and much more.
Perhaps one of the most fascinating realizations is that the history and science behind calcium is often little discussed despite the highly interesting and useful nature of the information. From the many uses of calcium for enhancing your total body health to the scientific characteristics of the mineral that pave the way for its benefits, here are 10 facts about calcium you may have never heard:
1. Adequate Calcium Actually Fights, Not Promotes, Kidney Stones
You are probably thinking that this simply cannot be true, but even the mainstream medial establishment now admits that new science has shed light on the entire relationship between kidney stones and calcium intake. Previously thought to be the villain behind the extremely painful stones that can permanently damage the lining of the body, it turns out that the latest studies on the subject support a high calcium intake for protection against kidney stones.
2. Calcium Can Balance Your pH Level Towards Alkaline
Those suffering from debilitating diseases are often in shock when they discover that they have a highly acidic body, which can be a serious breeding ground for disease. Through the consumption of processed sugars, sodas, and other junk foods, the body can become very acidic on the pH scale.
It should come as no surprise that such an acid environment is actually linked to the development of hypertension and kidney stones. Calcium can help to balance out this problem, returning the body to a less acidic, alkaline-based environment.
3. Calcium and vitamin D
Calcium and vitamin D are highly important in their own respective ways as the intake of one should be gauged towards the intake of the other. Vitamin D is absolutely essential for the proper absorption of calcium by the human body, as vitamin D is converted to a hormone that causes the very intestinal proteins that are needed for the proper absorption of calcium. Vitamin D, like calcium, affects numerous vital processes within the human body that are absolutely necessary for life.
4. Healthy Smile
The foundation of a healthy smile is rooted in the health of the teeth and the jaw bone. Calcium can help you maintain a healthy jaw bone throughout life, protecting against the breakdown of the bone through bone degeneration disease. When your teeth are healthy, bacteria and tartar will not as easily be able to thrive and become more prevalent.
5. Our Bodies Contain More Calcium than Any Other Mineral
Calcium is so fundamental to the processes of life that the human body contains more calcium than any other mineral. According to Everyday Health, 99% of the calcium in our bodies is also stored in the teeth and bones. The rest of the integral mineral is stored in other areas where it is needed such as in the fluid between body cells, blood, and muscle.
6. Abundance in Nature
In addition to being abundant within the body, calcium is also the 5th most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. Present at a level of around 3% in the oceans and soil, calcium is a major part of the life cycle of plants as well as humans.
7. Calcium May Slash Chronic Disease Risk
Research from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston has found that, based on a review of 17 peer reviewed studies, calcium can play a very serious role in the fight against chronic disease. This information was backed up by a Swedish study that also examined the information with similar conclusions.
With Swedish researchers examining more than 23,000 men over a nine-year period who were taking extra calcium, the scientists concluded that the increased calcium intake led to a lower risk of certain chronic disease.
8. Calcium Helps Transport Other Nutrients
While also important itself, calcium also helps to maximize your health through the transportation of nutrients through cell membranes and where your body needs it most. This gives calcium an entirely new and powerful function as an assistant to the body in ensuring that you are meeting your daily nutrient needs across the board.
9. Calcium Throughout History
Calcium has been known as far back as the 1st century, when the ancient Romans actually used calcium oxide to make lime. It should come as no surprise, then, to learn that the name ‘calcium' comes from the Latin word that literally means ‘lime'.
10. Calcium Intake Can Be Simple, But Quality Matters
As always, I recommend only the highest quality form of calcium when it comes to increasing your intake through supplementation. Specifically, calcium orotate is the highest quality and natural form you can find when it comes to calcium supplementation. I also recommend looking for a product that adds magensium orotate as well in order to reap the benefits of this healthful combination. Calcium is absolutely crucial to your health so make sure you are getting enough each day.

Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen Solo: A Star Wars Story yet, but what are you waiting for?
Folks who ventured out to experience Solo: A Star Wars Story got to meet the new names and faces behind familiar franchise characters Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian, but they also got to reunite with an unexpected villain from Star Wars lore. This is your final spoiler warning!
We're speaking, of course, about the reveal that Darth Maul was the boss behind the scenes of Crimson Dawn and made even Paul Bettany‘s Dryden Vos blanch in terror at the mere suggestion of pissing him off or disappointing him. Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), however, is made of sterner stuff, as it was revealed that her ambitions have led her into an unholy alliance with the former Sith lord. We've already offered up an explanation of Maul's appearance in Solo, along with what he's been up to since being cut in half in The Phantom Menace, but new quotes from director Ron Howard and screenwriter Jonathan Kasdan clarify the decision behind the cameo and how it came about a bit more.
As /Film reports, the original reveal of the Crimson Dawn crime lord wasn't specifically going to be Darth Maul. In fact, it wasn't going to specifically be anyone at all:
Ron Howard: I will say that was scripted and there was a lot of uncertainty as to who that character would be. So it was sort of initially written in a rather generic way. It just sort of said “Boss”. And I thought when I came in, I assumed they knew who it was and they were just keeping it under wraps. And they didn't. But Maul was listed as one of the candidates. And I lobbied hard for that. I thought that made a lot of sense to me. I found that character to be really effective. And I knew for a fact, without asking directly and giving anything away, my son Reed who just turned 31, who's a dedicated Star Wars fan, he's a golfer. He's not in the business. Dedicated Star Wars fan. I just whispered that possibility and he just thought that would be incredibly cool. And so for that generation, I thought, well that was gonna be a pretty interesting idea. And doing a little more research and understanding sort of how the character had worked elsewhere, I thought it was good. And the Kasdan's were on board with that. And then we actually shot it twice. Because we did it once. And then we realized we, it wasn't quite Maul enough yet.
So, despite the cybernetic legs, hooded visage, and combo of Ray Park and Sam Witwer, what else did the scene need?
Howard: Added the lightsaber. And intensified it. And definitely took a big jump.
More than just a connection to the Star Wars prequels and the animated series, Maul's appearance served to explain Qi'ra's unique and formidable fighting style, as explained by Jonathan Kasdan:
Jonathan Kasdan: Which is something that you've got to, you're writing these movies and somebody's saying, well she's gotta be able to have some skills. And you say like okay, well she's gotta have some skills. What are they gonna be and how can they be different than Rey or this Felicity character? And you start to dig into Wookieepedia and you start to say, well what are different kinds of martial arts within the games? And then we say, well we did wanna land this nugget about Darth Maul and maybe if the fighting style is connected to Maul in some way, that'd be really cool. And so you start to sort of fill in the gaps with the canon. I was always sort of, I was trying to design it in such a way that everyone who read it would feel that they had thought to put him in there. And no one would realize that it was always what I wanted. And even Larry was sort of ambivalent about it at the beginning and then came to fully embrace the Maul of it all. But yeah, no, there are subtle clues and even in the name Crimson Dawn I think it's sort of setup to be this guy's organization and where he goes after the many adventures he has in Clone Wars and the like.
And one final nugget about the scene between Qi'ra and Maul comes courtesy of Solo editor Pietro Scalia:
The thing is, I think it had to do with the surprise element, the dialogue between Maul and Qi'ra, and really, what is his presence? How does it effect what Qi'ra is doing? I think the original scene was a little… I don't know. It was fine, but there were certain things that they wanted to change dialogue-wise, saying less, and creating a little more fear in Qi'ra. It was [originally] too simplistic; she easily goes with this villain. I think Ron wanted to get a little more depth and layers in the performance, because it's a devil's pact taking this on.
Did the Darth Maul cameo work for you, or did it feel too much like fan service? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

* UNIT SIGNS COOPERATION CONTRACT WITH HUMANWELL HEALTHCARE GROUP FOR SALES IN CHINA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Gdynia Newsroom)
South Korea's PC cafe owners have accused Blizzard Entertainment of breaching the local antitrust law by introducing a new fee system for “Starcraft: Remastered,” a high-definition remake of the firm's smash-hit PC strategy game “Starcraft.”The Internet PC Culture Association, which represents local internet PC cafes where people play online games, also known as “PC bangs” here, said Monday that it had petitioned the Korea Fair Trade Commission to investigate Blizzard for unfairly charging them for the new game.“Starcraft: Remastered” is an upgraded version of the former “Starcraft” game fitted with upgraded graphics and an improved soundtrack. The game was prelaunched at selected PC bangs in Korea on July 30, weeks ahead of its official worldwide release slated for Tuesday.The Korean PC bang association has taken issue with Blizzard's new policy to charge PC cafes between 203 and 233 won (20 cents) per hour for offering the new Starcraft game to visiting players.In the case of the original “Starcraft,” Korean PC bangs purchased the game package one-off and were not required to pay any additional fees.Blizzard has decided to collect time-based fees for the new version of “Starcraft,” on the grounds that it offers an array of in-game perks and benefits to those who choose to play the game at local PC bangs, according to the company.The Internet PC Culture Association claims that “Starcraft: Remastered” is no different from the game's original version, except that its graphics are upgraded, and that it is unjustified for Blizzard to start charging new fees for a game that is essentially the same.The association also asserted that PC bangs are left with no choice but to install the upgraded version of the game due to system stability issues with the old version.“Blizzard Entertainment is misappropriating its superior market status to push unfair measures to PC bangs owners, most of which are small-sized business owners,” the association said.A Blizzard Korea official said that the company views “Starcraft: Remastered” as a new game with different elements from the old version. The new game offers attractive perks such as extra experience points to PC bang players, unlike the old version.“With its exclusive offerings, ‘Starcraft: Remastered' helps attract more players to PC bangs, therefore benefiting PC bang owners as well as legitimizing the fees that Blizzard can collect from them,” a Blizzard Korea official told The Korea Herald.The petition was filed with the FTC on Sunday. The antitrust watchdog had begun reviewing the case as of Monday and has yet to publicize additional information.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)
#MemoReleased: Why Have There Been No Arrests? by Tim Brown – Freedom Outpost
TDC Note – Excellent question.
####
FISA is a way in which people in DC can, in essence, spy on American citizens by fraudulently obtaining a warrant claiming “national security” under the guise of spying on a foreign person or entity. That is easily demonstrated in the FISA report we reported on a couple of weeks ago.
While many political junkies and talking heads pontificate on the new release FISA memo, I want to know just one thing, why has no one been arrested for crimes against the American people in violation of the Constitution?
With the release of the 4 page FISA memo, it's clear that the FBI, DOJ and NSA, along with the Obama administration abused their power and acted on a debunked, Soros and Hillary Clinton funded dossier to surveil then-candidate Donald Trump, with no probable cause.
Below is the long-awaited memo.
Nunes Memo by Brett LoGiurato on Scribd
﻿
President Donald Trump said that the memo revealed that “a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.”
“I think it's terrible,” Trump said. “You want to know the truth. I think it's a disgrace. What's going on in this country, I think it's a disgrace.”
OK, great, it's a disgrace, but more importantly, it reveals criminal activity, Mr. President! And this not only concerns Donald Trump and those who were in his campaign and transition team, but it concerns the American people, as evidenced by a previous FISA report in which 85% of the National Security Agency's searches were illegal against American citizens in violation of the Constitution.
The FISA memo stated that the now debunked dossier, which was authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by Fusion GPS, and that was paid by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was used to initiate unconstitutional spying on the Trump campaign.
According to the House Intelligence Committee, the information begins to “raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions” with the FISA court.
Additionally, it represents “a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process.”
The memo shows the in December 2017, FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe testified that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”
Steele was terminated from the FBI in 2016 “for what the FBI defines as the most serious of violations—an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the FBI.”
Fox News adds:
But even after his termination, Steele remained in close contact with Justice Department official—then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr. At the time, Ohr “worked closely” with Yates and later Rosenstein. Ohr's wife Nellie began working for Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier, as early as May 2016. The memo said that while the FISA application “relied” on Steele's “past record of credible reporting” on other “unrelated matters,” the FISA application process “ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. According to the memo, Steele told Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” “This clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files –but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications,” the memo reads.
The Trump administration also had comment on the contents of the memo.

The memo claims, among other things, that several top officials at the Justice Department and the FBI acted improperly when they signed off on applications seeking extended surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. “The brave and assiduous oversight by Congressional leaders in discovering this unprecedented abuse of process represents a giant, historic leap in the repair of America's democracy,” Page said in a statement to Business Insider. “Now that a few of the misdeeds against the Trump Movement have been partially revealed, I look forward to updating my pending legal action in opposition to DOJ this weekend in preparation for Monday's next small step on the long, potholed road toward helping to restore law and order in our great country.”
The memo also exposes the fact that the FISA application “extensively” cited an Sept. 23, 2016 news article, which was basically planted by Fusion GPS.
“That is significant because the article, written by veteran reporter Michael Isikoff, is itself based on the unverified dossier,” writes Benny Johnson and Chuck Ross at The Daily Caller. “Isikoff was among a small group of reporters who in September 2016 was briefed on the dossier by Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.”
“The FISA application made no mention of the link between the Isikoff article and the dossier,” wrote Johnson and Ross. “Instead, the article was treated as corroborating evidence for the dossier. The memo says that the FISA application ‘incorrectly assesse[d]' that the Isikoff article was based on information separate from the dossier.”
Here's the real rub. FISA is a way in which people in DC can, in essence, spy on American citizens by fraudulently obtaining a warrant claiming “national security” under the guise of spying on a foreign person or entity. That is easily demonstrated in the FISA report we reported on a couple of weeks ago.
The judge that issued the warrant and all those who push for the surveillance should be held accountable according to the law and punished justly as they are criminals, not servants of the public. Why are these people still in our government? Why are they given voice in the media? Why are they not perp walked on national television?
It's because there is no longer equal protection under the law nor is there justice in our land despite the claims of some that a new sheriff is in town.
I ask you, President Trump, when are you going to do your duty and enforce the Constitution against these domestic terrorists, some of which you called “good people”? When? Don't tell me it's a disgrace. It's clearly a crime! Do your duty, Sir! bring the people involved to justice! Otherwise, I can only assume you are using this for political points.
Sharing is caring!
OTTAWA – The Trudeau government will get a chance to test its popularity today with four federal byelections.
The most heated race is the British Columbia riding of South Surrey-White Rock where the Liberals are making a concerted effort to steal the seat from the Conservatives.
Both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer have campaigned in the riding, which was held by Tory MP Dianne Watts who jumped to provincial politics.

The Conservatives have tried to stir up voter anger in the riding over the Liberal government's tax reforms that include closing loopholes for small business owners.
The Conservatives are considered in the driver's seat in the western Saskatchewan riding of Battlefords-Lloydminister, which has voted for right-wing parties since the 1990s.
The other two ridings, in Newfoundland and Labrador and Toronto, are considered safe Liberal seats.

The riding of Bonavista-Burin-Trinity became vacant last summer when the province's representative in the federal cabinet, Judy Foote, resigned for personal reasons.
Foote had represented the area as a Liberal MP for the past decade.
The Toronto riding of Scarborough-Agincourt became vacant due to the death of Liberal backbencher Arnold Chan.
It has been in Liberal hands since the '80s.
The Saskatchewan seat became vacant this year when former Conservative cabinet minister Gerry Ritz left politics.
In the last election the New Democrats were a distant second in Ritz's riding and a distant third in the other three ridings.

Singh declined to speculate on his party's chances, saying only that he'd “called and spoken” to all his candidates and was happy with their campaigns.
“They're running great campaigns and I'm confident they're going to put up a good representation of our values and what we believe in,” Singh said Sunday.
The Liberals hold a comfortable majority in the House of Commons so the outcome of the races will have little effect on the balance of power.
(Reuters) - Indian shares edged down on Tuesday on investor caution higher global crude oil prices would stoke inflation and impact future interest rate decisions by the country's central bank, with oil marketers and bank stocks weighing on the broader NSE index.

Brent crude oil, the international benchmark for oil prices, jumped above $65 per barrel for the first time since 2015 after the shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline knocked out significant supply from a market that was already tightening due to OPEC-led production cuts.
India's central bank last week kept its policy rate steady at 6.00 percent as widely expected, but slightly softened its language on inflation by saying risks were “evenly balanced.”
Bond markets took solace that the statement was not as hawkish as some had feared after a recent spike in inflation.
“A sustained rise in crude oil from these levels would pose a risk in terms of imported inflation and its attendant impact on bond yields,” said Sunil Sharma, Chief Invetsment Officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.
“However, that's offset by expectations of December-quarter corporate earnings growth in the double-digits and the pattern of earnings growth will be sustained in 2018.”
The NSE Nifty was down 0.55 percent at 10,265.65 as of 0542 GMT, after rising about 2.8 percent over the last three sessions. The benchmark BSE Sensex was 0.42 percent lower at 33,316.09.
The Nifty Bank index fell as much as 1 percent after gaining 2.2 percent in the last three sessions. ICICI Bank Ltd and State Bank of India, among the biggest losers, were down as much as 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.
Oil marketers Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Indian Oil Corp lost as much as 2-3 percent.
However, oil explorers such as Reliance Industries Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd climbed between 1.4 percent and 2.3 percent.
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd rose as much as 6.1 percent after the U.S. FDA issued an audit closure report for one of its manufacturing units.
An alleged officer at the office of National Security, Theodore Kwasi Alorwu, popularly known as Semis, has been accused of allegedly defrauding a Ghanaian businessman, Fred Nii Tetteh of his car.
According to the businessman, Semis approached him and decided to buy his American Ford Pick-Up. Semis, the businessman narrated, claimed his bosses at the Office of the President needed a car for operation.
The vehicle, he said, was being sold for GHS120,000 but the National Security officer paid GHS40,000 and assured the businessman of paying the balance within an agreed period but has allegedly refused to do so.
Nii Tetteh, who narrated his ordeal to ClassFMonline.com on Tuesday, 24 April, said, on 13 April 2018, he returned the GHS40,000 to Semis so he could repossess the car after several attempts to retrieve the GHS80,000 balance was unsuccessful.
Semis, he said, received the GHS40,000 but then refused to hand over the car with the excuse that he has his properties in the car.
“I reported the matter to the police at the Police Headquarters but he refused to honour the invitation by the Police. Later, the Headquarters referred the matter to the Accra Regional Police and over there he refused to come,” Nii Tetteh said.
The businessman further indicated that he, in the company of his wife and brother, went to a popular chop bar in Asylum Down owned by Semis and met him there to take the car back, but, once again, the National Security official would not budge.
“We were there at his chop bar for the car but he refused to give it to us. He called some of his boys whom we suspect are land guards to come and intimidate us but one of the boys, after listening to our story, told him that he should return the car to us because he was not being fair to you, but this plea also fell on deaf ears.”
The businessman has, thus, appealed to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo “to intervene because he [Semis] claimed he is also working at the office of the president.”
When called on Tuesday, 24 April by Accra100.5FM for his side of the story, Semis admitted buying the car and making part payment for it. He also assured the station that he intended returning the vehicle to its owner.
DUBAI (Reuters) - Foreign investors turned net buyers of Saudi Arabian shares in the last week, suggesting concern about the impact of a sweeping crackdown on corruption has faded, exchange data showed on Sunday.

Foreigners were net sellers of Saudi stocks for four straight weeks after authorities launched the purge in early November, detaining dozens of top officials and businessmen and freezing over 2,000 bank accounts.
In the last couple of weeks, however, the risk of damage to the economy has appeared to ease, with the number of frozen accounts falling and some suspects reaching settlements with the government. A purchasing managers' survey showed most of the private sector operating as normal in November.
Foreign investors bought 718 million riyals ($191 million) worth of stocks in the week through Dec. 7 and sold 674 million riyals worth, resulting in 44 million riyals of net buying.
In the week to Nov. 9, immediately after the crackdown was announced, there was net selling of 1.08 billion riyals worth of shares, and net selling decreased in every week after that.
The latest data also showed Saudi individual investors bought stocks worth 17.53 billion riyals last week and sold 19.21 billion riyals, resulting in net selling of 1.68 billion riyals, down from net sales of 2.19 billion riyals in the previous week.
Saudi institutional investors bought 2.83 billion riyals of stocks in the latest week and sold 1.31 billion riyals, for net buying of 1.52 billion riyals.
Two men are accused of holding a gun to a man's head as he was forced into his own car and driven to another location in Toronto before being robbed.
Toronto police said a 34-year-old man reported to police on May 26 that he was robbed and abducted at the rear-end of a building at Spadina Avenue and Baldwin Street, north of Dundas Street West.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): ANP leader Haji Ghulam Ahmed
Bilour called on Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif here on
Wednesday.
Matters pertaining to national politics were discussed
during the meeting, a brief statement issued by the PM's Media
Office here said.
Popular voice chat platform Discord has shut down several servers and accounts associated with the alt-right for violations of the terms of service. The company announced the enforcement action on Twitter, emphasizing that it is “about positivity and inclusivity. Not hate. Not violence.”
Predictably, this was quickly followed by accusations of censorship and political bias, and the near-universal assumption that the accounts in question had been banned for ideological reasons. One could, of course, just as easily claim (as some do with Twitter and Reddit) that by tolerating the accounts for as long as it did, Discord supports the ideologies in question.
The company cleared things up in a statement: “We unequivocally condemn white supremacy, neonazism, or any other group, term, ideology that is based on these beliefs. They are not welcome on Discord.”
“While we don't read people's private servers our Terms of Service explicitly forbid harassment, threatening messages, or calls to violence…The public server linked to AltRight.com that violated [the ToS] was shut down along with several other public groups and accounts fostering bad actors on Discord.”
In response to calls for counter-protestors' Discord servers to be shut down as well, the company invited people to report them (email abuse at discordapp.com with details) and they would be investigated just as altright.com's was.
Hate speech like that proudly employed by those organizing, participating in and discussing the horrifying events in Charlottesville is unwelcome on many platforms. In fact, discouraging hate speech is an ideological stance common to nearly all internet services, with the marked exception of services created specifically to circumvent that stance.
Different companies' efforts and success in combating it vary widely, but just today GoDaddy revoked neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer's hosting and Google kicked it off the domain registry — both for pretty clear ToS violations. Airbnb has been pretty clear about what's allowed on its platform, as well.
We can certainly expect more actions like this, and for similar reactions as neo-Nazis and their like are removed from services to which they have forfeited their privilege to use. It seems likely this will lead to a pitiful, parallel Internet of Hate as the excommunicated communities coalesce and organize. Sad!
Here's the full statement, for the curious:

LILONGWE-(MaraviPost)-Malawians have been urged to maintain peace and order plus to respect police rules and regulations whilst in the forthcoming festive season.
The plea comes as police reports show that there is always an increase in road accidents and crime rate during festive season.
Traffic Officer for Kanengo Police Station in Lilongwe, Willard Mbwera explained that police usually experience a rise in crime rate as people get over-excited and neglect their responsibilities .
“In such times, people are involved in various malpractices like drinking and driving so they ignore police instructions and take the laws into their own hands leading to fatal accidents.”
“A good number of people go to enjoy in various recreation centres leaving their homes unattended, hence paving a way to robbers.” said Mbwera.
Recent police reports indicate that the country has already registered over ten fatal road accidents this month only.
As part of sensitization campaign on the matter, Kanengo Police Station on Friday , organised a stakeholders meeting which comprised of representatives from over 20 companies.
The law enforcers are asking companies and organisation to join hands in maximising security to the country by providing police with adequate resources they need.
The station's Community Co-ordinator Pery Mpangeni said that the law enforcers are currently implementing a number of activities purposed at strengthening security in the country.
“We are deploying officers in both civilian and uniform into different locations to boost up security,” assures Mpangeni.
The companies present at the meeting include; Auction Holdings Limited (AHL), Alliance One, Premium TAMA, and SeedCo, just to mention a few.
It was bad enough that an ACLU talk on free speech at The College of William and Mary (my school, class of 1971) was just shouted down by members of Black Lives Matter, and the College President made pious mutterings about free speech but does nothing. (He hasn't yet answered my letter.) But that injury is compounded by this conference, which, as the site says, is “supported by generous funding from William and Mary's philosophy department, Theresa Thompson ‘67, William and Mary Arts and Sciences, and the Carswell Fund of the Wake Forest University Philosophy Department.” Supported by the philosophy department? That's where I began learning philosophy!
And seriously, the conference is to “help inspire more good work in this area”? More good work? Where's the past good work?
Look at the topics. Here we truly have, as Dan Barker says about theology, “A subject without an object.” Now I have no doubt that at least one reader will endeavor to defend this as a worthwhile subject, but that reader would be wrong.
Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Regional Director for the Americas of the World Health Organization (WHO), today (February 2, 2018) formally began her second term as head of the 115-year-old regional public health agency.
“In this Region, most of our countries have reached the stage where many of the easy public health gains have already been achieved,” said Etienne in her inaugural address, “which means that each incremental improvement in the health of our peoples requires a redoubling of our efforts, in order to reach those most vulnerable and marginalized individuals that still lack health care.”
She said that increasing overall investment in health will not be enough to meet this challenge. “Targeted interventions that make a tangible difference in the lives of underserved populations will be the key to our success,” said Etienne.
Over the next five years, Etienne will work with PAHO member countries to advance toward “health for all.” A high-level commission formed by PAHO will analyze progress toward this goal since the 1978 Alma-Ata declaration on primary health care and will examine the persisting gaps and challenges to further progress in the Region toward universal coverage and universal access to health.
Etienne begins her second term on a path already set by the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the WHO General Program of Work, the PAHO Strategic Plan, and the Sustainable Agenda for the Americas, which provide an intersectoral framework for social and economic development in all countries.
Attending Etienne's inauguration today were Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Irwin LaRocque, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan.
Etienne said she would be advocating for increased funding to be allocated for health and for that funding to be well spent and focused on primary care, with the goal of reaching the most vulnerable. She will also prioritize strengthening of health information systems, to ensure that we have quality data that will help us to better identify inequities and vulnerabilities and to inform the development of health policies and plans. Towards this end, Etienne recently created a new PAHO department on Evidence and Intelligence for Action in Health.
Etienne is the first Caribbean woman to lead the hemispheric health organization and will also focus on preparing health services in the Region to withstand the effects of climate change.
“A key part to ensuring that the health sector responds adequately to natural disasters lies in the development of resilient health systems,” she said. Her native country, Dominica, was among those countries most affected by hurricanes in the past year.
Etienne first five-year term began in February 2013. She was re-elected by PAHO Member States during the Pan American Sanitary Conference last September 2017. She was also named Regional Director for the Americas for WHO by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva in late January 2018.
Over the past five years, PAHO has helped countries in the Americas expand access to health services, strengthen regulatory systems for medicines and health technologies, strengthen the health workforce, and improve access to safe and efficient health services, among other priorities.
Under Etienne's leadership, PAHO has also supported member countries during a series of epidemics, including Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Region of the Americas became the first WHO region to eliminate endemic transmission of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome as well as neonatal tetanus. Four of the region's six countries that are endemic for onchocerciasis have eliminated that disease, and one country has eliminated trachoma. Meanwhile several countries are close to certifying their elimination of malaria. Seven countries and territories have received validation of their elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and congenital syphilis, following Cuba's becoming the world's first country to be so validated.
Efforts to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases have also been a priority for PAHO in recent years. A number of countries have made particular progress in the areas of food labelling legislation and taxation of sugary beverages.
Etienne joined PAHO in 2003 as Assistant Director in charge of technical areas at PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C. From 2008 to 2012, she was a Assistant Director for Health Systems and Services at WHO in Geneva, where she focused special attention on renewing the primary health care approach and strengthening health systems based on primary care.
Before joining PAHO/WHO, Etienne held positions in her own country, Dominica, including coordinator of the National AIDS Program, coordinator for national disasters in the Ministry of Health, president of the National Committee on HIV/AIDS, and director of Primary Health Care Services. She began her career as a medical officer in Princess Margaret Hospital, where she rose to the post of Medical Director.
Etienne received her degree in medicine and surgery from the University of the West Indies in Jamaica and a master's degree in community health in developing countries from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

A topping out ceremony was held Friday for the new Roper St. Francis hospital in Berkeley County. (source: WCSC)
A topping out ceremony was held Friday for the new Roper St. Francis hospital in Berkeley County.
The hospital will be located on State Road in the Carnes Crossroads area of Summerville.
The 140,000 square foot facility will have 50 inpatient beds and an emergency department.
The hospital will serve the growing Summerville and Goose Creek areas of Berkeley County.
“They're gonna have easier access, healthcare closer to where they live and work and play,” Roper St. Francis CEO Steve Porter said. “They're gonna have access to women's services, they'll be able to deliver in the county without driving long distance.”
Porter says the hospital will employ about 400 people when it opens in the summer of 2019.
A nearby medical office building is scheduled to open this summer.
Roper St. Francis had to withstand a legal challenge from Trident Health to build the hospital.
Trident also wanted to build a hospital in Berkeley County.
The South Carolina Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Conneaut Lake News
The budget process has begun in the Conneaut School District as the school board's budget and fiance committee held their first session last week and figures began to trickle down from the state as to what kind of support the district might receive in the year beginning July 1.
Governor Tom Wolf gave his budget address that proclaimed increases in state support for basic education and special education - many state representatives and senators jumping on the band wagon of increased support - but as always the details are in the figures.
Wolf proposed a basic education funding increase of $100 million statewide and a special education funding increase of $25 million.
Lost in that flag waving - while every increase is appreciated as school districts battle increased costs - is the fact that the proposal is to take away some support for transportation costs and flat fund career and technical centers [vo-techs].
Early State Department of Education figures show Conneaut would receive an increase of $103, 094 in basic education and an increase of $30,017 in special education, a overall increase of $133,111.
No figures were available as to what will be taken away in transportation noting the flat funding for career and technical monies.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices jumped above $65 per barrel for the first time since 2015 after the shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline knocked out significant supplies from a market that was already tightening due to OPEC-led production cuts.
A maze of crude oil pipes and valves is pictured during a tour by the Department of Energy at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Freeport, Texas, U.S. June 9, 2016. REUTERS/Richard Carson
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $65.07 a barrel at 0211 GMT, up 37 cents, or 0.6 percent from their last close.
It was the first time Brent rose above $65 since June 2015.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $58.21 a barrel, up 22 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last settlement.
“Brent crude raced higher...as news broke that the North Sea's Forties Pipeline system would have to be shut down for a ‘number of weeks' after a hairline crack was found in it,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “The pipeline...is a significant component underpinning the Brent benchmark.”
Britain's Forties oil pipeline, the country's largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were revealed.
“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.
GOING WIDE
The jump in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices to $6.74 a barrel, up from around $5 last week, making U.S. oil exports more attractive.
The cheaper WTI is also a result of rising U.S. oil production, which has jumped by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.71 million bpd, levels not seen since the early 1970s.
U.S. production is now also not far off that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The rising U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, to support prices by withholding supplies.
OPEC and its allies started withholding supplies last January and currently plan to continue doing so throughout 2018.
Canadian Pacific Railway and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference said they have reached a four-year tentative agreement to end a strike hours after it began.

The parties also reached a five-year deal for the Kootenay Valley Railway.
The union said full operations at both railways will resume the morning of May 31 across Canada.
Union president Doug Finnson called the deal a fair contract that its members can feel good about.
With the strike now over, Todd Lewis, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan is now calling for rain.

“I think we're going to be okay now, this isn't going to be a prolonged stoppage. The damage has already been done in a lot of cases, so we just have to start trying to fix those issues. I guess if we can just make it rain now, everything will be much better,” said Lewis.
Even with the rain, Lewis thinks that it's time for the railroads to step up and start doing a better job of running their businesses.
“The railroads have to do a better job of running their businesses better. We're frustrated that service doesn't seem to be a priority, and good labour relations are a part of good service, that just doesn't exist right now in a lot of cases.”
“It's always on the railroads' schedule. It's not the customer's schedule, it's not the shipper's schedule, it's not the farmer's schedule. It's always on CP's or CN's schedule and that's got to change.”
READ MORE: West Coast Express service not affected by CP Rail strike
Lewis said that the strike was both frustrating and disappointing for producers, and although producers have been very patient over the last number of years in regards to reduced and poor service, this is still a “pretty immediate impact to CP Rail.”
Shipping will resume Thursday morning, and Lewis expects that farmers will likely only experience delays this grain week; a welcome relief as producers need money to pay for the bills that they've accumulated over the past number of weeks.
“Farmers spend a lot of money in the spring. When you're putting in a crop like Canola, you're spending $3,000 – $4,000 an hour,” he said.
CP Rail chief executive Keith Creel said the agreements are positive for 12,000 railway employees, customers and the entire Canadian economy.
Creel added that the agreement will provide long-term stability.
The tentative agreements must be ratified by Teamsters members over the coming months.
Details of the agreement are being withheld pending ratification.
Nowon Police Station (Yonhap)
A police officer nabbed two sex offenders in their 60s in a row over a period of three days, Nowon Police Office in Seoul said on Monday.The policeman surnamed Kim arrested a 67-year-old man on Aug. 9 for allegedly molesting an underage girl at a playground in Nowon-gu a day earlier.

According to Rightmove, Bristol has an overall average house price of £301,064.
Bristol is a great city full of culture and history, but with property prices rapidly rising it is tempting to look at what you could get for your hard-earned cash elsewhere.
This three-bedroom semi-detached home in Filton is a pleasant example of the average Bristol home. It is currently on the market for £300,000 in a desirable cul-de-sac location.
It has two good-sized double bedrooms, both with built-in wardrobes, and a single. The kitchen and bathroom are well-finished and modern.
The property benefits from off-street parking, a garage and a decent strip of garden. And the large 31ft lounge/diner offers more living space than usual.
For Bristol this seems like a good buy – but what could this sum get you elsewhere in the world?
Here are some dream exotic homes for around £301,064 – some of them considerably less.

GUJRANWALA - There is no decrease in prices of daily-use items despite the lapse of one third of holy month of Ramazan.
The profiteers and hoarders have launched their Ramazan profit drive without any hesitation and fear. Besides fruits and vegetables, the prices of essential commodities like sugar, flour, ghee and pulses have also shot up with the beginning of Ramazan. On the other hand, sale of substandard food items continues unchecked in different Ramazan Bazaars set up under the supervision of government departments. In open markets, the prices of pulses have been increased by Rs5-10 per kg. Similarly, the prices of other kitchen items are on the rise. The rates of spices are also on the run. Mutton is available in the market at Rs900 per kg against the official rate of Rs650 per kg. Similarly, beef is being sold at Rs500 per kg against the official price of Rs350 per kg. Milk is available at Rs100 per litre against Rs70. Other items such as sugar, wheat flour and lentils are being sold at high rates. Officials of district administration, Municipal Corporation and Food Department are doing nothing to provide relief to the citizens in the holy month of Ramazan.
Though all the government departments have their own staff to take action against shopkeepers involved in hoarding and profiteering, they have turned a blind eye to the issue. Citizens of Gujranwala demanded the high-ups take notice of the situation and deal the hoarders and profiteers with sternly.
MAN THRASHED: A youth was caught and thrashed by citizens for allegedly trying to kidnap a minor girl at Dhulley here the other day.
According to police, Mlaika, 9, stood in the street outside her house when accused Khalil tried to lure her to a nearby mosque. The girl started hurling shouts which alerted the passersby. They gathered there and held the accused. They also thrashed him and handed him over to Dhulley police. Investigation was underway.
Woman pours hot water on husband: A woman threw hot water at her husband for preventing her from going out from house without his permission here the other day.
Qari Ramzan had allegedly asked his wife not to go out from house without his permission. The couple argued over the issue. The woman threw hot water on husband. Resultantly, he sustained burns and was rushed to DHQ Hospital, Gujranwala.
INJURED: Three persons including a minor girl were injured in different incidents on Tuesday. According to police and rescue sources, Amara, 3, was playing in the house when she accidentally fell in a hot water tub. She sustained critical burns and was rushed to DHQ Hospital from where she was referred to Lahore due to her critical condition.
The second incident occurred in a factory at Maraliwala where a labourer, Hassan, 25, received critical burns after hot oil fell on his body. He was rushed to hospital where staff referred him to a Lahore hospital. In Miansansi, four-year-old Samar sustained injuries after falling from a roof. He was shifted to DHQ Hospital.
Thousands of Iowans celebrated the New Year in Pasadena, California last year as the Iowa Hawkeyes played in the Rose Bowl.
There will be at least six Iowans there today for the annual Rose Parade as part of the Choose Life float honoring organ donations. Iowa Organ Donor Network spokesman Tony Hakes says they want everyone to start the year out by thinking about being an organ donor.
“There's an absolute shortage of organs nationwide and we really feel it's a solvable problem,” Hakes says. “We encourage everyone to mark ‘yes' on their driver's license or register online, or just make their wishes know to their family, because 120-thousand people at any given time are on the wait list.”
Hake says the organ donation float in the Rose Parade is a great way to bring attention to the issue.
Hake says some 800 million people watch the parade on TV and one million are there in person, and he says it is a good way to let people know that organ donation “saves lives, it heals lives.” The float in the parade will include a florograph with a likeness of Iowa organ donor Dyllan Lawson. Lawson had just completed his first year at the University of Iowa in pre-medicine when he was involved in a car accident on June 30th, 2011 that left him with severe head injuries. His organs were donated to four people.
Cindy Newton will walk alongside the float which her daughter Carlie will ride on. Cindy donated part of her liver to Carlie, who was born with a disease that kept her liver from functioning.
The Iowa Donor Network has participated in the parade and float for many years. Hakes got to go last year and says all the Iowans there made it special. He says they knew they were going to the parade in the summer and having so many Iowa fans there made it a lot of fun.
For more information on signing up to be an organ donor, go to the Iowa Donor Network website.

Anticipation is high for Quentin Tarantino's next film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The film has a Pulp Fiction like tapestry “set in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood, around the time of the murder of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and several others in a killing spree ordered by Charles Manson. The two other lead characters are Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), former star of a western TV series, and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don't recognize anymore.”
Last night at CinemaCon during Sony's presentation, Tarantino took the stage with DiCaprio to talk a bit about the film. According to THR, he told the crowd that Once Upon is “probably the closest to ‘Pulp Fiction' that I have done,” so that probably means jumping chronology, expansive cast, and multiple points of view.
He also said that they'll be transforming L.A. a bit to make the film evoke its 1969 time period.
“Sony and myself will be coming to the theaters with the most exciting star dynamic since Paul Newman and Robert Redford. It's very hush-hush and top secret. But I can tell you that ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture hippie revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we'll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.”
DiCaprio added, “It's hard to speak about a film that we haven't done yet, but I'm incredibly excited…to work with Brad Pitt, and I think he's going to transport us. I'm a huge fan of ‘Singin' in the Rain' — movies about Hollywood. As an L.A. native, having read the script, it's one of the most amazing screenplays. We are going to do our best job to make it fantastic.”
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood opens August 9, 2019.
No one was seriously injured in a nine-vehicle collision which closed the A19 southbound last night, police have confirmed.
The incident took place at around 7:50pm on Sunday and closed the road from the A689 junction to the Portrack Interchange until around midnight whilst the vehicles were recovered.
Cleveland Police dealt with the incident and confirmed that no one was seriously injured.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will look to use Nimble Storage to boost its position in the hybrid IT market
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has completed its acquisition of Nimble Storage for $1 billion (£794m), allowing it to boost it hybrid IT services with flash storage.
The acquisition should help HPE continue to drive deeper into the hybrid IT word, where cloud computing mixes with more traditional on-premise hardware.
“This deal, in combination with our recent acquisitions, helps deliver on our vision of making hybrid IT simple for our customers,” said Antonio Neri, general manager of the Enterprise Group, at HPE. “Through these strategic investments, we are continuing to strengthen and deepen our portfolio of next generation, software-defined, differentiated solutions that meet the new challenges our customers are facing.”
Despite HPE's latest financial results failing to paint a picture of success following the official split of HP in November 2015, it seems determined to push a mix of cloud, server and storage technology, even though the latter division saw its revenues slump by 13 percent.
HPE buys Nimble Storage
HPE will use Nimble's mid-range flash products to boost HPE's services to all manner of customers across difference industries who are adopting the idea of hybrid IT.
Hybrid IT sees firms adopt an IT infrastructure strategy where traditional core systems are kept on premise or in private data centres and less critical systems are pushed into the cloud.
“Looking forward, we have a clear product roadmap for our hybrid IT offerings, and our acquisition of Nimble fits squarely in it,” said Antonio Neri, general manager at HPE's Enterprise Group.
“We are listening to our customers' needs and continuing to help them shift from the traditional data centre to a software-defined data centre, with all-flash at the heart.
“A key element of that roadmap is Nimble's predictive analytics platform. InfoSight's ability to monitor customer deployed infrastructure from the cloud, apply machine learning and predictive analytics to radically simplify operations and deliver a transformed support experience is a key differentiator in the storage market.”
Bringing Nimble Storage into its fold should enable HPE to offer a broader range of storage services, with it claiming that is can bring benefits, such as allowing data to be moves seamlessly and replicated across hybrid flash and all-flash storage environments in reactions to IT demands
Both companies are promising their combined offerings are being aimed at making hybrid IT simple and comparatively priced.
Time will tell if the addition of Nimble Storage's portfolio to that of HPE's storage suite can turn the company's fortunes around; the results of the purchase will likely be seen a year or so down the line.

Police have two young men in custody after a series of carjackings were reported around Hamilton.
The suspects are 16 and 18 and face at least four counts of robbery. Police also say a handgun was seized.
READ MORE: Hamilton police release photo of alleged Ancaster carjacker
Two of the incidents happened in Ancaster, while another two happened on the Hamilton Mountain.
Monday at around 1:30 p.m., a woman in her 70s was getting into her car at the PetSmart store in the Meadowlands. Police say a young man was in the back seat. She immediately jumped out of her car and screamed for help. Bystanders came to her aid and the suspect ran off.
That was similar to an incident last Thursday, just outside the Best Buy store in the Meadowlands, where a woman in her 80s says she was robbed at gunpoint after a teen was hiding in her back seat. Police say the man rummaged through the victim's purse and made her withdraw cash from an ATM.
At one point, police say he forced the woman into the passenger seat and drove her around the city before eventually getting out at Rebecca Street and Mary Street.
The woman was not injured.
Police say another elderly woman was targeted in the Limeridge Mall parking lot Monday, while a younger woman reported a similar incident at West 5th and Mohawk.

Police say the four incidents may be connected, and they're investigating a fifth.
The suspects are awaiting a bail hearing.
The man accused of ramming his car into a crowd of demonstrators during clashes in Charlottesville, Va., is due to appear in court Monday.
Twenty-year old James Alex Fields Jr., of Ohio, faces second-degree murder and other charges for allegedly driving the Dodge Charger that killed Heather Heyer on Saturday.
Fields joined a rally for neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan, who clashed with counter-protesters.

Those who know him say his views on race and politics were clear.
“He would often say how, you know, how Hitler's views were right. what if Hitler had won,” Darek Weimer, Field's former high school teacher said. “What if we had this large, white supremacist empire going into the modern world.”
“A lot of us, who, either had him or knew colleagues who had him, we understood his views. We knew, oh this kid, young kid at the time, has very, kind of white supremacist, Nazi views, he really adores Hitler, things like that.”

Fields enlisted in the U.S. Army after high school but failed out of basic training after less than four months, according to military records.
He's a registered Republican and voted in the 2016 presidential primary.
He travelled to Virginia to take part in a march organized by white nationalist groups, many of whom claim to be supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, to defend a statue of a Confederate civil-war hero set for removal.

On Saturday, after clashes broke out, Fields allegedly drove his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.
Police said he then tried to flee the scene.
In addition to the charges from the crash, the U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation.
It's not clear if Fields has retained a lawyer, or how he intends to plead.

President Donald Trump will announce new U.S. responses to Iran's missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy, the White House said on Friday.
“The president isn't looking at one piece of this. He's looking at all of the bad behavior of Iran,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters.
“Not just the nuclear deal as bad behavior, but the ballistic missile testing, destabilizing of the region, Number One state sponsor of terrorism, cyberattacks, illicit nuclear program,” Sanders continued.
Trump “wants to look for a broad strategy that addresses all of those problems, not just one-offing those,” she said. “That's what his team is focused on and that's what he'll be rolling out to address that as a whole in the coming days.”
A senior administration official told Reuters on Thursday that Trump was expected to announce he will decertify the landmark international deal curbing Iran's nuclear program, in a step that could cause the accord to unravel.
Trump on Friday declined to explain what he meant when he described a gathering of military leaders the evening before as “the calm before the storm,” but the White House said his remarks were not meant to be mischievous.
The administration was considering Oct. 12 for Trump to give a speech on Iran, but no final decision had been made, an official said previously.
It was not clear to what illicit nuclear program Sanders was referring as the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal reached with the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union.
The Trump administration also has acknowledged that Iran has not breached the accord's Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. The administration, however, contends that Tehran has violated the “spirit” of the deal.
The issue came up during a telephone call on Friday between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. The pair discussed “ways to continue working together to deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon,” according to a White House statement.
Macron has been a fierce defender of the JCPOA, denounced by Trump as “the worst deal ever negotiated.” But the French leader also has suggested that restraints on Iran's nuclear program that expire in 2025 could be bolstered, a senior French official said last month.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that steps Trump is reviewing as part of a broader strategy also include imposing targeted sanctions in response to Iran's ballistic missile tests, cyber espionage and backing of Lebanese Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations.
The administration earlier this year considered, but then put on hold, adding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's most powerful internal and external security force, to the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations.
The Quds Force, the IRGC's foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the list, but the organization as a whole is not.
Last month, current and former U.S. officials told Reuters the broader strategy Trump is weighing is expected to allow more aggressive U.S. actions to counter what the administration views as Iran's efforts to boost its military muscle and expand its regional influence through proxy forces.
Under a 2015 U.S. law, Trump has until Oct. 15 to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the JCPOA. If he decides to decertify, lawmakers would have 60 days in which to consider reimposing U.S. sanctions on Iran lifted under the deal, an action that many experts warn could unhinge the accord.
Knowledgeable sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the administration is looking for ways to fix what it views as serious flaws without necessarily killing the deal.
Critics say the flaws include the so-called sunset clauses, under which some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program expire over time.
Trump's national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, met with Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday in an effort to win their support for the strategy.
Flea, Anderson .Paak, Mac DeMarco in Buenos Aires
This past March, Flea, Anderson .Paak and The Free Nationals, and Mac DeMarco all descended upon Buenos Aires for Lollapalooza Argentina. The three were spotted hanging out around the festival, and as it turns out, they even got together for a jam session as part of a local event series aptly called Jam Club.
Footage capturing eight minutes of this meeting of musical talents has recently surfaced online. There's no order to their jamming, which makes for countless moments of wicked psychedelic/prog rock improvisation. Flea can be seen working his bass, while Paak lets loose, flexing his percussive prowess (just in case you forgot he can sing, produce, rap, write, and drum). DeMarco didn't actually take part in the session, but the Canadian jizz jazzer was definitely part of the contingent watching on stage, as one Redditor has pointed out. (You can peep him smiling that gap-toothed grin behind Paak.)
Watch it all go down below.
As other redditors have mentioned, the musicians' admiration for one another didn't end with the jam session. DeMarco's Lollapalooza Brasil set a week later featured a cover of Red Hot Chili Peppers' “Can't Stop”. RHCP also supposedly played a riff from .Paak's Malibu track “Come Down” during their set at Lollapalooza Chile. There are plenty of unnecessary supergroups that exist out there, but one comprised of these guys would certainly be considered something of a gem.
RHCP's last album came with 2016's The Getaway, while DeMarco's This Old Dog dropped in 2017. Paak is expected to release two full-lengths before year's end — a new solo record called Oxnard Ventura and one with his band The Free Nationals.
A mural inspired by artwork from Theodor Geisel's "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street" will be removed from The Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum in Springfield after complaints that it included a "jarring racial stereotype."
The character in question was described by Geisel in the 1937 book as "a Chinese boy who eats with sticks." However, three children's authors complained that the image was "deeply hurtful."
As a result, Dr. Seuss Enterprises and the Springfield Museums announced they will remove the Mulberry Street artwork from the museum.

Three people, including two police officers, were killed Tuesday morning in a shooting in the Belgian city of Liege, media reports say.
The attack was carried out by a gunman whose motive has not yet been revealed, but local authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist act, according to the BBC.
The shooting began at a cafe near a school. The attacker assaulted police officers with a knife, then used one of their guns to open fire, killing two of them and injuring two others. The assailant went on to shoot a man who was sitting in the passenger seat of a car driving by. The gunman then took a woman hostage at a nearby school before being killed by police.
The attacker had been on temporary release from prison since Monday and is suspected of having been radicalized while in prison, according to Belgian broadcaster RTBF.
Like France, Belgium has been on high alert since the Paris attacks of November 2015, which killed 130 people and involved a Brussels-based cell of Islamic State, and since the 2016 attacks on the Brussels airport and a local subway station, which claimed the lives of 32 people.
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani leftist youth organization said on Tuesday that nine of its members went missing in Karachi after demonstrating in support of an ethnic rights movement that has worried the country's security establishment.
An organizer for the Progressive Youth Alliance said seven members were abducted after staging a pro-Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) rally in Karachi on Sunday, and another four were picked up on Tuesday after another demonstration, also in Karachi.
Two of the men picked up on Tuesday have now been released, Anam Khan, organiser of the women's wing of the socialist group, told Reuters.
The PTM emerged after the killing by police of Pashtun youth Naqibullah Mehsud in Karachi in January triggered nationwide condemnation and demonstrations attracting thousands.
The PTM has since staged a number of protests criticizing the powerful military and its actions in majority ethnic Pashtun areas bordering Afghanistan, often attracting swarms of supporters in Pakistan's larger cities.
The PTM's most recent rally on Sunday in the central city of Lahore attracted over 8,000 people despite pressure by security officials to call it off and the mysterious appearance of sewage water onto the protest grounds.
Khan said four of the seven men taken on Sunday had boarded a train leaving Karachi when security officials belonging to the paramilitary Rangers arrived and identified them using videos from the protest.
Rangers officials did not respond to a request for comment and Karachi police said they were not aware of the incident.
On Tuesday the Youth Alliance staged a protest asking for their missing members to be released.
“During our protest some men in plainclothes showed up and told us to shut it down,” Khan said. “When we were walking away, four of our comrades ... were put in a car.”
Another activist from the organisation also said the abductions had taken place. A witness from a rights advocacy group who was present at Tuesday's protest confirmed seeing the four men being abducted.
While not naming PTM, Pakistan's army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa said at an April 12 meeting with dignitaries that “no anti-state agenda in the garb of engineered protests” will be allowed to succeed.
A number of prominent Pakistani columnists have complained on Twitter that their articles on PTM were rejected by local newspapers without explanation.

By now we've pretty much given up on Mitsubishi introducing anything genuinely sporty. But for anyone in the market for a sporty-looking SUV, the brand may still be of some interest.
Mitsubishi will use next month's 2017 Geneva auto show to introduce a new SUV labeled an Eclipse Cross. The vehicle, previewed by the series of XR-PHEV concept cars, will sit in the lineup between the mid-size Outlander and compact Outlander Sport and will feature an almost coupe-like profile.
The automaker confirmed to Motor Authority that Mitsubishi will use the Eclipse name in Europe and in the States.
Readers will recall that the Eclipse name was originally used for four generations of a sports car offered by Mitsubishi from 1990 until 2012. The second-gen model was immortalized in 2001's “The Fast and the Furious” as the car driven in the initial drag race by Paul Walker's character Brian O'Conner. We're sure the few remaining Eclipse fans will be saddened to see the car's name attached to a grocery-getter.
The Geneva auto show starts March 7. For more coverage, head to our dedicated hub.

YERUSHALAYIM - El Al Airlines is fighting a European Union directive to pay compensation to passengers whose departures were delayed three hours or more, claiming that the European law does not apply to it, Globes reported Monday.
Citing Israeli regulations granting compensation only for delays of at least eight hours, El Al has so far refused to pay Israeli passengers delayed in European departures, even though European passengers were compensated according to EU law.
A German court ordered El Al to pay the passengers for the inconvenience two months ago, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Belgium-based website Claimit, which sues on behalf of passengers. The court ruled that the Israeli carrier discriminated against Israeli passengers by not paying compensation to them as they did to non-Israelis.
Compensation varies according to the length of the flight: €250 ($262) for flights of less than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) to €400 ($419) for flights of 1,500–3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) and up to €600 ($629) in compensation for flights of more than 3,500 kilometers. All airlines departing from a European airport must grant compensation in such cases. The law does not apply to flights by non-European airlines landing at destinations in Europe, if they took off from airports outside Europe, for example a flight from Tel Aviv landing in Paris.
Claimit founder and CEO Ralph Pais contends that the amount of money at stake is substantial, the obvious reason for El Al's recalcitrance.
“According to our calculation, if El Al passengers sue the company for delays in flights that took off from Europe during the past two years, it will have to pay 300 million shekels,” Pais said.
El Al said in response, “El Al operates according to the law. The law applying in Israel, in particular the Aviation Services Law (Compensation and Assistance for Flight Cancellation or Change of Conditions) – 2012, restricts the right to monetary compensation to delays of over eight hours.”

Although the Los Angeles Dodgers had a losing record this year against both of their potential division series opponents, given their past struggles against left-handed pitching, you figured they had to be rooting for the Colorado Rockies in the wild-card game. By advancing to the division series, the Arizona Diamondbacks can throw southpaws Robbie Ray and Patrick Corbin against the Dodgers, along with their ace Zack Greinke, who defected from Los Angeles in free agency. That's a much more formidable rotation than the Rockies could have ever presented.
Still, Arizona is handing the ball to right-hander Taijuan Walker in Game 1, which makes sense given Ray's two-plus innings of work in the wild-card game 48 hours earlier. Also, to be fair, the Dodgers' struggles with left-handed pitching peaked last year, when they had an astounding .149 OPS deficit (.623 versus .772) when comparing their production against left-handers versus right-handers.

How MLB teams fared against Vegas win totals From the Dodgers to the Tigers, a look at how every team in the MLB fared in 2017 compared to its Vegas win totals. 1 Related
To be honest, the Dodgers have no need to fear any matchup. They won an MLB-high 104 games this season, the most since the storied franchise moved west from Brooklyn. In a year when teams collectively scored more runs than in any year since 2008, the Dodgers gave up the fewest runs as a franchise since 2003. As has been the case every year for the past nine seasons, the run suppression was led by Clayton Kershaw. Kershaw has had some fine moments in the postseason, which conveniently gets ignored when commentators drag out the "Kershaw chokes in the postseason" narrative. But it's still striking that in his 89 innings of postseason work, Kershaw has a 4.55 ERA, which is sky-high when compared to his truly astounding 2.36 career ERA.
This will be Walker's first postseason appearance, but his fifth against the Dodgers overall, against whom he has an unsightly 4.79 ERA. We're parsing a small sample to begin with, but dig a bit deeper, and you'll find that in his three starts this year as a member of the Diamondbacks, he went 2-0 with a 3.24 ERA and 17 strikeouts in 16 2/3 innings.
I'm off to a good start in the playoffs thus far, having backed the winning team in Game 1 of both American League contests. After having split the wild-card games, I'm 3-1 (+2.00 units) as the National League Divisional Series play begins. For the other three series, I've backed the favorites, and this series has the biggest favorite of all four division series matchups. The question for baseball bettors is whether the price is rich enough to entice a play on the underdog.
MI had started their campaign with three losses on the trot before a victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore arrested the streak, but the three-wicket defeat against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on Sunday, their fourth last-over setback, has put them under tremendous pressure.
With nine games left before the play-off stage, MI find themselves in a difficult situation to win at least seven of them to improve their chances. As such, a win over SRH on Tuesday is imperative to keep them in the hunt.
Sunrisers too have slipped from their earlier top perch after suffering back-to-back defeats, following three straight wins, and would be as keen to bounce back to winning ways.
Education is the only way to awaken the human mind to knowledge, self-respect, self-esteem, integrity, empathy and compassion.
There has been a huge lack of all these qualities in Pakistani education system.
Recently, a tragic incident happened on May 23, 2017 in Shahdara Lahore where two government teachers pushed a class-IX girl from the third floor of the school building causing life-threatening injuries.
Earlier, in the month of November 2016, a student of eight grade at a private cadet college in Larkana reportedly lost his consciousness and was paralysed after he was allegedly beaten up by his teacher.
Similarly, in the month of August 2016, the district administration Chitral sealed the private school in Drosh town after its principal was found involved in subjecting students to physical torture and was sent to jail on judicial remand after a video of the alleged torture went viral on the internet.
The murder of reliability, truth and honesty in our education system can be observed in fresh incidents where the school administration and some other officials kept it secret from the education department.
A teacher is a person who helps others to acquire knowledge, competences or values.
The current incident has badly ridiculed the Punjab government's slogan “Mar nahi Piyar” just written in front of every government school in Punjab.
How can a human being do such a thing to a child as teachers did with student? The Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif should take this incident seriously and after thorough investigation should have to take concrete steps for proper counselling and training of teachers in government schools.
I also urge the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to focus for more spending on most neglected sector of education in his current period of government.

A parliamentary report is urging Ottawa to establish uniform guidelines and standards for the collection and handling of hate crime data to standardize the definition and interpretation of hate crimes by enforcement agencies.
The standing committee on Canadian heritage study also recommends the federal government create a directorate to oversee a national action plan against racism, plus increased funding for law enforcement and security agencies to probe hate speech on the internet and to enforce existing laws.
“Systemic racism and religious discrimination affect Canadians in different ways. For a country as diverse as Canada, it became apparent that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution to these issues,” said the 130-page report, titled “Taking Action Against Systemic Racism and Religious Discrimination Including Islamophobia.”
“Delivering credibly on combating racism and religious discrimination requires not only leadership, but meaningful co-operation and comprehensive action.”
The bipartisan committee initiated the study last April in response to the “increasing public climate of hate and fear” after the Quebec City mosque shooting that killed six while injuring 19 others.
MOSCOW : Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered the Energy Ministry to negotiate a three-year deal with Pakistan on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, said a statement Friday. The order, published on the cabinet's website, authorises talks "with Pakistan with participation of Russian Foreign Ministry and the signing of an agreement upon reaching consensus." An appendix stipulates that the arrangement will be valid for three years and extends automatically for another three years after the initial period expires.
Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the trade turnover between Russia and Pakistan has slightly increased and that the two countries have great potential for economic cooperation.–Monitoring Desk

BMW unveiled the racing version of its yet-to-be-revealed 8-Series coupe during September's 2017 Frankfurt auto show.
The version shown was the M8 GTE, BMW's entry for the World Endurance Championship which includes the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. That's right, folks. BMW is returning to Le Mans.
An M8 GT Le Mans (GTLM) race car is also in the works, in this case for the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship, where it will replace the previous M6-based race car. Here we see it during the past weekend's public test at Daytona International Speedway in preparation for the competition debut next month in the 2018 24 Hours of Daytona. A private test had already taken place at Homestead Miami Speedway last week.
On both occasions, the car was supervised by BMW Team RLL, which will be fielding it throughout the 2018 season. John Edwards and Connor De Phillippi took to the wheel at Daytona while Martin Tomczyk drove it at Homestead.

Power in both the M8 GTLM and M8 GTE race cars comes from a new 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8. BMW says the engine has been derived from the 4.4-liter mill found in road cars like the latest M5. It develops a nominal base output of more than 500 horsepower, depending on the classification, and drive is to the rear wheels via 6-speed sequential transmission.
The weight of the cars, meanwhile, is down to just 2,690 pounds thanks to the extensive use of carbon fiber in the construction.
Even for non-motorsport fans, the M8 race car gives us our best look yet at the road-going 8-Series, specifically the M8 model, launching in 2018. This is especially true for the grille shape, lights and profile.
As mentioned, the competition debut for the M8 GTLM is the 24 Hours of Daytona, which runs the weekend start January 27. The M8 GTE's first race will be the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps next May. The race is the season opener for the new 2018/2019 “super season” of the WEC.

Military's shadow darkens media coverage of Pakistan elections The Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, a think tank, said the electoral process appeared "unfair". Journalists believe they are "facing restraints at the hands of a silent coup in place by the military and its intelligence affiliate, the ISI," it reported recently.
What Imran Khan 'dreads' if he becomes Pakistan's Prime Minister If cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan wins elections this year to become Pakistan's Prime Minister, the one thing he "dreads" is having to meet US President Donald Trump, he told the Voice of America, a US government-funded media outlet.
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani opposition party led by former cricket star Imran Khan appears to be gaining ground ahead of a, with one new poll showing it pulling ahead of the outgoing ruling party and another showing it only slightly behind.A survey by Pulse Consultant showed Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI, or Pakistan Justice Movement) ahead with 30 percent of the respondents nationwide, compared to 27 percent for its main rival, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was at 17 percent.A separate nationwide poll by Gallup Pakistan had PML-N on top with 26 percent, PTI with 25 percent and the PPP at 16 percent.Both polls were commissioned by Pakistan's Jang Media Group and were published on Wednesday in its affiliated newspaper, The News. They each surveyed about 3,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6 percent for the Pulse survey and 2-3 percent for Gallup.The new polls indicate a swing towards Khan's party compared to similar nationwide polls in 2017, which put the PML-N 8-9 percentage points ahead of PTI.The Gallup poll showed most of the PML-N's losses were to voters who responded "undecided" in the most recent poll, conducted between May 1 and June 6, while the Pulse poll indicated that most of PML-N's losses went directly to PTI.Khan's political fortunes have improved since PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif was removed as prime minister by the Supreme Court last year over undeclared assets.Sharif, who was disqualified from politics for life, now faces a verdict in an anti-corruption court on Friday along with his daughter Maryam, who is running for parliament. The case, which involves the purchase of luxury apartments in London, could see Sharif jailed and Maryam disqualified.Sharif's has accused the military and courts conspiring to oust him and using legal cases and intimidation to help Khan's PTI party, accusations denied by Khan, the army and the judiciary.Khan, a former cricket captain of Pakistan, has portrayed the legal cases as a long-overdue corruption crackdown on the PML-N, which he has labeled a graft-ridden "mafia".
LAHORE - Electrical and mechanical work on all the 11 elevated stations along package-I of Lahore Orange Line Metro Train's track has been started by the Chinese firm after the local contractor completed grey structure.
This was informed at a meeting chaired by Steering committee on OLMT's Chairman Kh. Ahmad Hassan to review progress on OLMT project on Wednesday.
The meeting was informed that construction on bridge on railway yard near Parachute Colony was also underway.
The meeting was told that launching of U-tub girders for construction of elevated track from Chauburji to Ali Town, Raiwind Road, will start from today. Construction of a new stormwater drain from Haji Camp at Nichlson Road to river Ravi, at a cost of Rs2.4 billion, has also kicked off which would be completed within six months.
The drain will be constructed underground and digging for this purpose has been started at Punjab University ground at Lake Road. The meeting was informed that more than 70 per cent of the civil work on OLMT project has so far been completed. Progress on package-I from Dera Gujran, GT Road to Chuberji was 83.20 per cent, on Package-II from Chauburji to Ali Town was 51.5 per cent, on Depot near Dera Gujran was 75 per cent while on Stabling Yard near Ali Town it was 71 per cent. Hassaan directed the authorities concerned to immediately start horticulture work along the track of metro train besides finalising construction work of four schools that had been affected by the construction activity of this project, during the current summer vacations.
YORKSHIRE first-team coach Andrew Gale praised his team's character after they required just 42 balls on the final morning to complete an innings and 88 run victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
The home side, trailing by 203 on first innings, resumed on 85-9 and last pair Jeetan Patel and Olly Hannon-Dalby took the score to 115 before the latter missed a forward push at Adil Rashid and was bowled.
Patel, who had just lifted Rashid straight for six, was left unbeaten on 49, having hit five fours and one six, while the continually-impressive young seamer Ben Coad ended with 5-50 to earn himself match figures of 10-102.
Yorkshire's resounding victory was an emphatic response to their surprise defeat to Hampshire in their opening game last week.
“It was a big week for us having played so well last week when we didn't get anything out of the game,” said Gale.
“I thought we showed a lot of character.
“After last week's game we spoke a lot about winning key passages of play. In the third innings we let Hampshire back in the game, but in this game we got an opportunity to get ourselves in front and get away from them and we took it.
“If I was being ultra-critical I would have liked one of our top six to go on and get a hundred after they all got starts.
“But, on the whole, winning those key sessions was the difference.”
Yorkshire's next Championship match is against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl on Friday when they will have prized England duo Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root available.
Liam Plunketis expected to return to action for Yorkshire's Royal London Cup campaign later this month.
While there is good news there, captain Gary Ballance will continue to have to make do without three key bowlers, with seamers Jack Brooks, Liam Plunkett and Ryan Sidebottom still injured on the sidelines.
There had been hope that Plunkett and Sidebottom might be available for the trip to the south coast, but the rematch with Hampshire has come just too soon.
Brooks, on the other hand, was always going to be out injured for a longer period of time.
“Ryan and Liam are another week away,” said Gale.
I don't think we can afford to rush a guy who is nearly 40-years-old. If he breaks down, it could be the end of his career. We have to do what's right by him. Andrew Gale, on the fitness of Yorkshire bowler, Ryan Sidebottom
“Ryan was going to play in the second team this week, but it's come about that he's still not quite right.
“Liam is still feeling it a bit, so we can't risk him.
“Fingers crossed, he will be available for the 50-over stuff. I'm pretty sure he will be available for the first game of that (away to Nottinghamshire on April 29).”
After travelling to Hampshire, Yorkshire will then turn their attention to their final Championship game before the Royal London One-day Cup starts in earnest at Trent Bridge.
They then resume their four-day campaign against Lancashire at Emirates Old Trafford on May 19.
“The break will give Ryan a good block of training, so when he does come back he'll be ready to go,” added Gale.
“I don't think we can afford to rush a guy who is nearly 40 years old. If he breaks down, it could be the end of his career. We have to do what's right by him.”
Warwickshire, meanwhile, must dust themselves down from successive innings defeats from which they have taken just three points.
It has been a bracing start to the regime of sport director Ashley Giles and first-team coach Jim Troughton and one that has hurt a set of experienced players, which was viewed in some quarters as potential title-challengers.
The first two games have supplied a serious reality check, ahead of another tough fixture, at home to Surrey starting on Friday.
“The first two games have been really disappointing after such high hopes during the winter,” said Giles. “We've done a lot of good preparation, but just not put it into practice. It's certainly hit the dressing room hard, but all we can do is try to turn it around.”
Elsewhere, defending champions Middlesex started the defence of their Division One title with a hard-fought draw against Hampshire.
Both sides took 10 points from the Ageas Bowl, but the 2016 champions were staring down the barrel of a nail-biting conclusion when a three-wicket new-ball strike left them 215-7.
Had Hampshire rolled over the tail an achievable run chase would have been left, but tail-enders Toby Roland-Jones (25), Ollie Rayner (17no) and Tim Murtagh (19no) dug deep.
In the end the sides shook hands at 278-9 declared, Kyle Abbott's good form continuing as he claimed 5-59.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani left open on Saturday the possibility for talks with militants who accept peace but said the door was closed to those who cause tragedies like recent attacks in the capital, Kabul.
An attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul on Jan. 20 and a suicide bombing on a crowded city street a week later have stoked public anger and stepped up pressure on Ghani's Western-backed government to improve security.
The attacks, which killed more than 130 people and were claimed by the Taliban, have also raised fresh doubt about long-running efforts to initiate talks with the insurgents.
The president's office said on Tuesday the militants had crossed a “red line” and peace would have to be won on the battle field.
But Ghani raised the possibility of reconciliation with some militants in a speech to Islamic clerics in Kabul.
“Those who are responsible for this tragedy and do not want peace, the door of peace is closed to them,” Ghani said.
“Those who accept peace, they will witness that the nation will embrace them. But there is a clear difference, our commitment to bringing peace does not mean we will sit quietly and won't retaliate.”
“We will dig them out from any hiding holes.”
Afghanistan's government has made such vows for years but the insurgency appears ever more resilient. Peace efforts have been made in fits and starts but without progress.

U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to dash any hope for peace efforts on Monday when he condemned the Taliban for the Kabul violence and rejected the idea of talks.
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces, to force the Taliban to negotiate.
But his comments on Monday suggested he saw a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials said could not be achieved with the resources and manpower he had authorized.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said in Kabul on Tuesday the U.S. strategy had not changed and the aim was still to press the Taliban militarily to convince them that they had to negotiate.
The Taliban are fighting to drive out foreign troops and re-establish their form of strict Islamic law.
Afghanistan has long accused neighbouring Pakistan of failing to act against Taliban plotting violence from safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border.
On Friday, Ghani accused Pakistan of being the “Taliban centre” and said he was waiting for Pakistani action.
Pakistan denies helping the Taliban and a Pakistani delegation led by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua visited Kabul on Saturday with the aim of fostering cooperation. Janjua called for both sides to stop the “blame game”, Pakistani media reported.
The United States said last month it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining it was not doing enough to fight militants sheltering there.
Rafa Benitez admits he's happy with the partnership struck between striker Joselu and chief support Ayoze Perez.
And the Newcastle United boss believes Perez has a key role to play in United's immediate future, even though he is looking for competition in the No 10 role.
“Because Perez can play as a striker, he can play as a second striker. He is an important player for us in this situation,” said Benitez.
“When I came here he was playing a lot of games in the wide areas because he was what they had.
“Now he is more in the middle and I think the understanding with Joselu is quite good.
“The way that we want to play and his movements are quite good. I can see little things he must improve, but, in terms of his understanding when we have the ball and we don't have the ball with the other players around, he is what we need.
“Are we looking for competition for him? Yes, we are looking for competition for every player in every position. But if you don't find anyone you have to use the players you have and I am quite happy with him.”
You only have to look at social media to see Perez is not a player who inspires all factions of the United fanbase.
It has led some fans to wonder, particularly at home, why Benitez does not play two strikers, rather than persist with Perez.
This is not lost on Benitez, who addressed this issue by saying: “We had Gayle who was injured before and Mitrovic was suspended but the question was: Why don't you play with two strikers?
“Sometimes this (number ten) job - playing between the lines in an area that is difficult to mark and also where the holding midfielder of the other team plays – is important.
“Nobody can guarantee you will score more goals with two strikers. Maybe you lose control in the middle of the pitch.”
Meanwhile, Jamaal Lascelles has been named on the shortlist for September's Premier League player of the month.

Donald Trump Jr., President Donald Trump's oldest son, re-tweeted a quote that links the Virginia shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise to the controversy over the Public Theater's Free Shakespeare in the Park production of “Julius Caesar,” which depicts the assassination of a Trump-like Caesar.
“This,” Trump Jr. tweeted, linking to a tweet by political commentator Harlan Z. Hill which read, “Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.”
Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President — Harlan Z. Hill (@Harlan) June 14, 2017
Hill's tweet apparently refers to the Public's “Julius Caesar,” which has stirred up controversy with an outdoor staging of the Shakespeare play that makes overt references to Trump and the current administration. Caesar sports blond hair and wears long ties, and his model-thin wife speaks with a Slovenian accent.
The onstage sequence that raised right-wing ire was the assassination, bloodily depicted as written in the original play. The outcry was loud enough to spur two Public Theater sponsors, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines, to pull their support for the production.
Reps for the organization said the Public Theater didn't have a specific response to the tweet, but instead referred to a Monday statement that defended the show against accusations that it would incite violence.
“Our production of ‘Julius Caesar' in no way advocates violence towards anyone,” the statement read. “Shakespeare's play, and our production, make the opposite point: those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save.” On Monday night the show opened with a curtain speech by Public Theater artistic director (and the director of “Julius Caesar”) Oskar Eustis, that also stood by the production.
“Julius Caesar” runs, as scheduled, only through Sunday, when it closes to make way for the next summer Shakespeare production in the park, “A Midsummer Night's Dream.”
Back in 2011, Feist and Mastodon appeared as music guests on an episode of Jools Holland. Since then, the acts have grown to become unlikely bedfellows in the studio, with the two releasing a Record Store Day 2012 split single in which they both covered one another.
The Canadian songstress and Georgia metal outfit's strangely cool collaborative bond continues this year on Feist's upcoming album, Pleasure. As Stereogum points out, the end of one of the LP's tracks, “A Man is Not His Song”, features a sample of Mastodon's Once More ‘Round the Sun selection “High Road”.
“I wanted a sonic representation of the feminine/masculine binary, and Mastodon is like a flamethrower of guy-sound and feeling,” Feist explained of the song in a recent interview with Pitchfork. She elaborated:
“It felt right at the end of this observation that a man is not his song, and nothing is really what it purports to be. I know a lot of men, and a lot of them write songs, and I know the difference between what they are and what they sing. And it's same for me — there is your pedestrian voice and your maker's voice, and it just felt notable to observe that some people can be subsumed by the voice they've made, and others keep it in check.”
Perhaps this latest colliding of worlds will finally lead to a full-fledged collaborative album? This writer has her fingers crossed.
Feist's Pleasure arrives on April 28th. She's shared two singles thus far: the title track and the Jarvis Cocker-assisted “Century”. Mastodon, meanwhile, recently put out an LP of their own, Emperor of Sand.

Since releasing Ivy Tripp in 2015, Waxahatchee's Katie Crutchfield has spent some time looking back, releasing an album of early recordings and revisiting her original outfit P.S. Elliot with her twin sister, Allison. This summer, she'll return the focus to her solo project with a new album entitled Out in the Storm.
Crutchfield broke the news in an interview with Lenny (via Stereogum), in which she described the record as coming out of the end of a toxic relationship. “I don't want to call it a break-up record, but it was a romantic and professional relationship that fell apart,” she explained. “I had to end it, and it rippled throughout every little corner of my life. Getting on the other side of that and reflecting on the whole spectrum of sadness and anger and resentment, I came out of it and I was a lot closer to myself, which I think is common too.”
She went on to say the album will touch on the concepts of shame and embarrassment, and how examining those emotions can make you a better person in the end. “It reminds me of how sometimes when you're younger and a confident or outspoken woman and men — or boys — would make you the butt of a joke… It's embarrassing, but you know that you're right…,” she said. “I'm describing interactions with a specific person [who] had a tendency to make me feel this way.” By acknowledging that feeling and realizing the relationship needed to be reconsidered, the end result is “almost hopeful.”
Though a tracklist hasn't been revealed (or a firm release date, for that matter), Crutchfield did mention that a song called “Sparks Fly” will be on Out in the Storm. “That song, it's one of my favorites that I've written ever, I think, lyrically — because it's just really about me. Most of my songs are about relationships or about another person or how this other person is making me feel. And that song is just about how I feel about myself in a specific moment.” Apparently, the inspiration for the track was one blissful night she spent with her sister in Berlin. After going through some rough times, Crutchfield said, “I just remember that night sort of feeling like I was seeing myself through Allison's eyes, and she was seeing me as a person who is happy and fun and can laugh and enjoy myself.”
Waxahatchee has already unveiled “Sparks Fly” live, and perhaps more new music will come when she hits the road with The New Pornographers beginning tomorrow, April 18th. Find that complete itinerary here.

Gabriel (Ride Control, LLC), has announced its new educational interactive Point of Purchase displays, which invite consumers to learn about ride control. The display simulates realistic traveling characteristics encountered by shocks in everyday use. It is designed to provide customers with understandable and useful information on shock absorbers and struts and their important role in automotive comfort and safety.
Featuring technically accurate but easy to understand information on how shocks and struts affect a vehicle's stopping capabilities, the company says the interactive displays also include additional signs that indicate worn or failed ride control. The Point of Purchase displays are due to be tested in partnership with a major retail store – 300 outlets across the U.S. will be participating in the test.
The innovative display becomes animated when the handle is turned, spinning a “road” on which the wheels are resting. Whenever the wheels hit a pothole in the road, the bad shock wheel falls into the hole, while the good shock glides across the pothole. This illustrates the damping characteristic of a functioning shock. The company says the Gabriel display takes great care to simulate realistic, authentic road conditions and traveling characteristics so true comparisons can be seen between between worn and new shocks.
The new Point of Purchase displays also provide details on how stopping distance is affected by bad shocks.
“Our overall intent is to show people how ride control works, so they can understand what failing shocks and struts are actually doing to their vehicle,” said Jonathon Gore, marketing director at Gabriel. “The display will really immerse people in the sound, feelings and sights of ride control.”

New York – Queens of the Stone Age frontman Joshua Homme has apologized for second time after a photographer said he kicked her camera while she photographed the band's concert.
Homme says in a video posted to his band's Facebook page early Monday that he doesn't have any excuse or reason to justify what I did.”
Photographer Chelsea Lauren said on Instagram that she sought medical treatment after the camera smashed into her face from the kick Saturday night at a radio station's annual Christmas event. Video posted to social media shows Homme swinging his leg and connecting with the camera while playing guitar at the Forum near Los Angeles.
Homme first apologized Sunday, saying he was “in a state of being lost in performance” and thought he was kicking lighting equipment.
He says in the new video that he's “truly sorry and I hope you're OK.” He adds, “I've made a lot of mistakes in my life … I want to be a good man but I think last night I definitely failed at that.”

Egypt forward Mohamed Salah's shoulder injury will keep him out of action for three to four weeks, Liverpool's club physio has said, meaning he could miss the World Cup group stage.
The 25-year-old is desperate to play for Egypt in only their third World Cup and their first for 28 years but faces a race against time to be fit for next month's Group A games.
“He is sad about what happened but is totally focused on recovery, seeing when he can be ready,” physio Ruben Pons told Spanish sports newspaper Marca of the injury to Salah during Liverpool's Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid.
“In principle it will be between three and four weeks but we will try to reduce those dates, that's the big goal,” he added.
Egypt begin their World Cup campaign against Uruguay on June 15, before facing hosts Russia on June 19 and Saudi Arabia on June 25, meaning if Salah takes four weeks to recover he could be fit in time for the knockout phase.
Thanks to the combination of an ELAN Entertainment & Control System, Core Brands and Amazon Alexa voice recognition technology, the Gary Sinise Foundation's Restoring Independence, Supporting Empowerment (Restoring Independence, Supporting Empowerment) program was able to provide a hands-free smart home to a wounded U.S. Airman who lost three limbs in Iraq in 2004. The technology incorporated into the new home in Miramar Beach, Fla. empowers Senior Airman Brian Kolfage with a simple means of controlling the residence's lights, security system, HVAC equipment, and audio and video components through voice commands.
Amazon Alexa Fosters Self Sufficiency
This voice control through Amazon Alexa greatly increases Kolfage's independence at home and is helping him enjoy daily life with his family, according to integration expert Jason Stanley at Tampa-based AAMI. “It's truly awe-inspiring to witness the strength and perseverance of our nation's bravest citizens,” Stanley continues. “The team at AAMI is grateful to have donated our time and expertise to this project, and to help provide Senior Airman Kolfage with as much self-sufficiency as possible in his home. One of the greatest feats of modern technology is to raise the standard of living for people with decreased mobility and injuries, and there's no one more deserving of that technology than wounded veterans.”
The R.I.S.E. program brings together dozens of manufacturers and contractors to build and donate modern, accessible smart homes for wounded veterans across the U.S. When the foundation learned of Kolfage's miraculous recovery from a devastating September 11, 2004 rocket attack in Balad, Iraq, they knew he was an ideal candidate to receive a new high-tech, ADA home with advanced features like voice control.
The top priority for the Kolfage family's new home was that it was fully accessible and conducive to SrA Kolfage's daily life and family needs. The home was designed to ADA specifications for wheelchair mobility, which means hallways, doorways, and the shower are wider than what is standard. The ELAN system and Amazon Alexa gives him voice or iPad/iPhone control of the home's lights, HVAC, security system and cameras, televisions, and multi-room audio.
Elan App Adds a Simple Mode of Control
The pros at AAMI created a super-simple system for the Kolfages, so they can be watching Apple TV in one room, pause it, then go to another room and pick up where they paused. Similarly, the family can easily play music through a multi-room audio system that delivers tunes to in-ceiling speakers in the family room, living room, dining room, master bedroom, and bathroom, and eventually in the landscape and pool area after the pool construction is completed.
Having control over his house is important for Kolfage, who is raising two young children with his wife. The ELAN system enables Kolfage to check on his children without getting out of bed through video feeds on the ELAN app, in addition to having full-home surveillance that stays recorded for several weeks. There is even a 4-inch touchpanel mounted to the wall in each child's bedroom, so when they are older, they can use the system's Intercom feature to communicate through the house and to any family member's mobile device through the ELAN App. With a video doorbell, the parents can see who is at the door and speak through the intercom from anywhere in the house, or anywhere in the world, again through the ELAN App.
Technology Stays in Sync Through Voice Commands
One of the greatest strengths of the smart home system is the scheduling and automation it offers, so Kolfage asked AAMI to program specific events to happen together, such as making the phrase “Alexa, turn on the living room TV” automatically also turn on the lights and stereo as it turns on the living room TV. Other specialized functions can include an ‘Away' button or phrase that will turn off all lights and TVs, set the HVAC to a standard setting and arm the security system when they leave the house, configure the closet lights to turn on at 30% if it's dark outside, and turn on specific lights guiding the family from the front door to their bedrooms when arriving home late.
Elan Touchpanels and Remotes Another Mode of Control
AAMI ensured the family would have easy access and control of the system by installing ELAN touchpanels in the kitchen and master bedroom, three ELAN HR200 wand-style remotes for simple TV control in the family room, living room and master bedroom, and multiple mobile devices with the ELAN app installed.
“The ELAN control system was the best choice for this project because it is by far the simplest for users to learn and use from device to device,” Stanley said. “That's thanks to ELAN's user interface, which is identical no matter what device a homeowner uses, from iPhones and Android smartphones to PCs, tablets and wall-mounted touchpanels. The app looks the same and the buttons are identical, so there's no guessing or learning required when buying a new device or moving from room to room. We couldn't be happier to give the family full control of their home and provide greater freedom for Senior Airman Kolfage.”
Unemployment rates fell in all 120 Kentucky counties between April 2017 and April 2018, according to the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCEWS), an agency of the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet.
Whitley County's unemployment rate decreased from 5.6 percent in April 2017 to 4.5 percent in April 2018. Whitley County's April unemployment rate was 0.6 percent lower than March's unemployment rate.
Laurel County's unemployment rate decreased from 5.7 percent in April 2017 to 4.5 percent in April 2018. Laurel County's April unemployment rate was 0.7 percent lower than March's unemployment rate.
Knox County's unemployment rate decreased from 7.1 percent in April 2017 to 5.8 percent in April 2018. Knox County's April unemployment rate was 0.6 percent lower than March's unemployment rate.
Bell County's unemployment rate decreased from 7.8 percent in April 2017 to 5.9 percent in April 2018. Bell County's April unemployment rate was 0.5 percent lower than March's unemployment rate.
McCreary County's unemployment rate decreased from 6.2 percent in April 2017 to 5.6 percent in April 2018. McCreary County's April unemployment rate was 0.6 percent lower than March's rate.
Woodford County recorded the lowest jobless rate in the Commonwealth at 2.7 percent. It was followed by Campbell, Oldham and Shelby counties, 2.9 percent each; Fayette, Scott and Spencer counties, 3 percent each; and Boone, Kenton, Marion, Warren and Washington counties, 3.1 percent each.
Magoffin County recorded the state's highest unemployment rate at 11.9 percent. It was followed by Lewis County, 8.1 percent; Elliott County, 7.8 percent; Carter County, 7.6 percent; Menifee County, 7.5 percent; Livingston and Wayne counties, 6.9 percent each; Ballard County, 6.8 percent; and Harlan and Owsley counties, 6.7 percent each.
Kentucky's county unemployment rates and employment levels are not seasonally adjusted because of small sample sizes. Employment statistics undergo sharp fluctuations due to seasonal events such as weather changes, harvests, holidays and school openings and closings. Seasonal adjustments eliminate these influences and make it easier to observe statistical trends.
The comparable, unadjusted unemployment rate for the state was 3.9 percent for April 2018, and 3.7 percent for the nation.
Unemployment statistics are based on estimates and are compiled to measure trends rather than actually to count people working. Civilian labor force statistics include non-military workers and unemployed Kentuckians who are actively seeking work. They do not include unemployed Kentuckians who have not looked for employment within the past four weeks.
Whitley County has a civilian labor force of 13,850 people with 13,228 employed and 622 unemployed. Statewide, Kentucky has a civilian labor force of 2,071,630 people with 1,991,301 employed and 80,329 unemployed.

'This is Our Nation, Now Get the F**k Out': Not the First Time America's Witnessed Hate, Not the Last
Gambling studies released by the Iowa Racing and Gaming commission Thursday show a new casino in Cedar Rapids would have big impact on existing casinoes.
The study by White Sand Gaming says the best time to consider casino in Cedar Rapids was in 2003. Linn County voters turned down a gambling referendum back then. It says the Riverside and Isle casino in Waterloo now service the area and a Cedar Rapids casino would take money away from those two existing facilities. It says the three current proposals for Cedar Rapids casinos overstate the revenue potential of the facilities.
The other market study by Marquette Advisors came to a similar conclusion. It showed any of the three proposed Cedar Rapids casinos would cannibalize between 45 and 56 percent f their annual revenue from Riverside and Waterloo.
Cedar Rapids was denied a gambling license back in 2014 with commissioners citing the impact on current casinos as the main reason. The commission will hear formal presentations on the two market studies at their meeting next week in Emmettsburg.
You can see both studies on the Iowa Racing and Gaming website.
Team Suzuki Pilipinas scored a victory again for the country in Round 2 of the Suzuki Asian Challenge of the Asia Road Racing Championship. The second round was held at the Chang International Circuit in Thailand from April 13-15.
After a superb performance in Round 1 wherein Filipino riders bagged the victories in both Race 1 and 2, the team continued its winning streak as April King Mascardo emerged triumphant in Race 1 of the second round. Mascardo who won Race 2 in the opening round in Johor, Malaysia last April 1-2 was 5th at the starting grid this time and gave out another impressive performance as he battled with other Asian riders up until the checkered flag of the 7-lap race. It was a thrilling race up to the finish line wherein the lead pack was composed of six riders and Mascardo managed to clinch the win with a 0.387s margin of victory over second placer Nur Al Fath Sam Ahmad of Indonesia. Thailand's Punchana Kulrojchalalai finished third. Eane Jaye Sobretodo was 10th to cross the finish line. Winner of Race 1 in the first round, Mario Borbon Jr., ended up at 11th place.
The exhilarating battle was once again witnessed in Race 2 where the fray was tight up until the last lap. 10 riders were in the lead pack. Indian rider KY Ahamed crashed and caused 3 riders to fall down including Mario Borbon Jr. who still managed to remount and finish the race. Tetsuya Fujita of Japan won the race followed by Aaron Gunawardena of Sri Lanka and Indonesian rider Ahmad Saugi Muchtar. Mascardo crossed the finish line fifth while Borbon Jr. salvaged a 12th place finish. Sobretodo unfortunately was not able to finish the race as he crashed with two laps to go after being hit by an Indian rider. Sobretodo also crashed in the first round but the young rider is determined to have better results in the next rounds.
Heading into the third round of the rider developmental series, Mascardo is on top of the overall standings with 68 points. Borbon Jr. is at 7th place so far with 42 points while Sobretodo has 18 points and is at 11th place.
It was another great effort for Team Suzuki Pilipinas and as the competition in the Suzuki Asian Challenge gets tougher, our riders Mascardo, Borbon Jr. and Sobretodo continue to show the motorcycle racing talent and passion of Filipino riders. Team Suzuki Pilipinas is managed by Mr. Noel Villapando of Suzuki Philippines. Mechanics of the team are Malvin dela Cruz, Rico Cagnaan and Insik Flores.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) announced on Saturday that those mid-career Singaporeans who are keen to pursue nursing as a career can now apply for a new degree level programme at the National University of Singapore's Alice Centre for Nursing Studies (NUS Nursing).
In a joint press release, MOH and WSG said that the new degree level Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses is targeted at mid-career Singaporeans with a prior degree qualification in any discipline other than nursing.
The new degree will be offered as a two-year Bachelor of Science (Nursing) programme at NUS Nursing. The course fee is S$74,500 and it will be fully sponsored. Apart from this, the trainees will receive training allowances of S$2,170 to $2,520 per month throughout the two years of training. However, this would depend on their years of prior work experience.
The press release added that the trainees will also receive a one-time career transition bonus of S$2,000 upon graduation. An on-the-job training incentive of S$18,000 per mid-career degree trained registered nurse will also be provided to employers to enable them to better support these nurses in their transition to a new career.
"There has been a growing interest in nursing. In recent years, we have seen an increase of about 33 per cent in our total nursing intake from 1,500 in 2012 to around 2,000 in 2017," Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor said at the career preview for the degree.
"The introduction of the new two-year degree level Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses makes it more attractive for mid-career Singaporeans who have a prior degree in other disciplines to join the nursing profession."
He added, "This is aligned with the Ministry of Health's effort to build a strong local core of nurses in the healthcare workforce as we face an ageing population and rising incidence of chronic diseases."
Shefaly Shorey, Assistant professor at the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies who had previously attained her nursing diploma from the PCP at Nanyang Polytechnic, will now lecture degree-level PCP nursing students at NUS.
"This degree will be preparing for future leaders in nursing. Our curriculum is more at a deeper level – better critical thinkers, better communicators, better clinical decision-makers – those who can lead nurses in the future," Dr. Shorey said.
The press release stated that the degree will be in addition to the existing two-year accelerated Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses at the diploma level conducted by Nanyang Polytechnic. It is targeted at mid-career Singaporeans with A-Level and diploma qualifications.
According to the press release, more than 1,000 mid-career professionals have participated in professional conversion programmes for the healthcare sector since 2003. Out of these nearly 800 professionals joined on nursing, while 200 on allied health professions.
The applications for the Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses at NUS Nursing will remain open until March 2.
Meanwhile, MOH will continue to work closely with WSG and healthcare industry partners to explore and develop new PCPs for other professions in the healthcare industry.
In his own goofy way, Bill Nye is all about making science seem cool for kids. It's what made his original series, Bill Nye the Science Guy, so fondly remembered by an entire generation. His new series on Netflix, Bill Nye Saves the World, is hoping to connect with a whole new era of science-illiterate people, and it's gunning for the cool factor right from its theme song by having none other than Tyler, the Creator write and perform it.
Asked in a promotional video why he went to Tyler for the song, Nye said, “He's the man. He's got the beat. He understood the beat. Which goes back to the original song from twenty-five years ago.”
Tyler's version pays homage to the original by pretty much just chanting “Bill! Bill! Bill!” and the show's title over and over again. “Yeah the first one is really sick,” Tyler said. “I love the fast pacedness of it. You take out that snare, it could be a house song.”
Check out the theme via the opening credits below, followed by the interview clip with Nye and Tyler.

Apple has confirmed the acquisition of London-based music discovery app Shazam in a sale reported to be in the ballpark of $400 million. In a statement provided to Billboard, Apple declined to go into specifics about financial aspects of the deal, but said it was “thrilled” to bring the Shazam team over to the Apple Music team in Cupertino.
“Since the launch of the App Store, Shazam has consistently ranked as one of the most popular apps for iOS,” the company said. “Today, it's used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms. Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users.”
The company teased, “We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement.”
The Shazam acquisition had been in the works for several months following talks with other tech firms, including Spotify and Snapchat, according to TechCrunch, which broke news of the pairing late last week.
Shazam was founded in 1999 and launched in the U.K. in 2002 as a call-in service. Two years later it arrived in the U.S. for AT&T customers and in 2008 the app debuted on Apple and Android platforms, eventually being downloaded over 1 billion times. Following a business model shift to advertising, the company announced in 2016 that it had finally turned a profit. A year earlier, the company was valued at over $1 billion.

Stephon Gilmore was given a mark in Week 5. The New England Patriots cornerback had to lock down Mike Evans.
While that's not exactly an enviable assignment, Gilmore seemed pleased to get the job. After four straight weeks of challenges in terms of communication, Gilmore didn't have to worry about passing off players and communicating before and after the snap. He could cover Evans for pretty much all of the game. That suited him, he explained.
Gilmore: “That is what gets the best out of me, when I am following a guy and studying a certain guy.” — Ryan Hannable (@RyanHannable) October 6, 2017
Gilmore finished the game with five tackles while Evans managed five receptions for 49 yards. Evans, a major red zone target for Jameis Winston, was a non-factor in terms of scoring. Winston twice targeted Evans on third down and twice was unable to connect.
After a tough sequence of weeks for Gilmore, who signed a $65 million deal with the Patriots this offseason, the cornerback appeared to make strides of improvement. He didn't seem to mind the criticism directed at him over the course of the previous week.
“People are going to talk,” he said with a smile, WBZ's Joe Giza. “I know what kind of player I am and I know what kind of player I can be. I just kept working. My teammates helped me along. I got better and played good tonight.”
The next stage of ambitious future plans for Morpeth takes place next week.
In November, more than 300 people came to the Town Hall to share their ideas on the future re-development of key town sites and a range of other important issues – while 200 more took part via an online survey.
Northumberland County Council is working with a range of stakeholders, including the Morpeth Forum, to develop a masterplan on how the town develops over the next few years and how services can best be delivered to local people.
The main issues raised by those who took part in November's event were parking, schools and education, leisure and sports facilities and the future of community buildings.
Now an update session is being held in Morpeth Town Hall from 2pm to 8pm on Friday, February 9 to let people know what progress has been made on these issues and advise on the next steps.
Coun Richard Wearmouth, Morpeth resident and cabinet member for economic development, said: “It's fantastic that so many people got involved with this project and shared their ideas for the future re-development of Morpeth.
“We were delighted with the engagement and feedback from the masterplanning session. There were some great ideas put forward.
“It's now time to take these ideas forward, look at the main issues raised and continue to plan for the future.”
ISLAMABAD-The four-member Pakistan snooker team will feature in the ACBS 5th Asian team event and 6th 6Red Snooker Championships to be held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan from June 28 to July 5.

We have selected top players on the basis of their recent performances and they are more than capable of doing wonders for the country just like they did in the past. We have a very formidable squad and we are quite hopeful about their chances in the said events.”
He said training camp of the snooker team started here at the PSB snooker hall on Wednesday and the players had already started training.
“They will train under the watchful eyes of the national Iranian coach. They all are experienced and have played in international events. We are thankful to IPC minister Riaz Pirzada and the PSB for providing facilities and taking good care of snooker players,” Munawwar concluded.
MANCHESTER - Runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City moved 11 points clear at the top after a 2-1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in their derby clash on Sunday.

The victory means City are the first team to win 14 consecutive English top-flight games in the same season. The result ended United's run of 40 home games unbeaten in all competitions.
City's lead over second-placed United means the title is now theirs to lose and, while Pep Guardiola's side did not provide a classic display of their manager's attractive passing football, they showed they have the grit as well as the class to come through the toughest challenges.
Jose Mourinho's team selection suggested United's manager was intent on playing expansively, with Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford chosen as wide support to central striker Romelu Lukaku.
But United struggled to get any of their forward players involved as City dominated possession. Mourinho's team were let down by poor passing and struggled to keep the ball.
Gabriel Jesus, playing as the lone central striker with Sergio Aguero on the bench, had an early opening but shot tamely straight at United keeper David De Gea, as did Raheem Sterling when he wriggled some space.
City's dominance was rewarded in the 43rd minute although the breakthrough was not a product of clever passing but sloppy defending from United at a set-piece.
Romelu Lukaku failed to clear Kevin De Bruyne's inswinging corner and the ball fell to David Silva, who was played onside by Ashley Young. The Spaniard gratefully hooked the ball home.

Poor defending at the other end allowed United to get level before the break.
Marcos Rojo hit a hopeful diagonal cross into the City box but Nicolas Otamendi misjudged a header, Fabian Delph hesitated and Marcus Rashford pounced on the loose ball and drove low past Ederson.

At the break, City were forced to replace skipper Vincent Kompany with midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, a switch that meant Brazilian Fernandinho moved back into the defence.
United were also forced into a change with Marcus Rojo, who had suffered a head injury, replaced by Swedish centre half Victor Lindelof.
City restored their lead nine minutes into the second half after another piece of poor defending.
Silva whipped a free-kick into the box and Lukaku, who had a derby to forget, drove an attempted clearance into the back of teammate Chris Smalling. The ball looped to Otamendi who, making amends for his earlier mistake, showed great athleticism to volley home on the half-turn.
Guardiola shored up his back line by bringing on defender Eliaquim Mangala for Jesus and allowing Fernandinho to go back into his usual role in the holding midfield position.
City had keeper Ederson to thank for the three points after he produced a superb double save at close range six minutes from the end to keep out efforts from Lukaku and Juan Mata.
For the first time, electricity has been sent between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia through the new Maritime Link.
The 500-megawatt transmission line was tested Friday, but won't go into commercial operation until early in the New Year.

The family of Avicii has released a statement on the death of the popular Swedish DJ, who passed away at age 28 on Friday.
Addressing the death of Avicii, whose real name was Tim Bergling, the family is asking for privacy while expressing gratitude for all the heartfelt tributes that were shared in the wake of his passing.
“We would like to thank you for the support and the loving words about our son and brother. We are so grateful for everyone who loved Tim's music and have precious memories of his songs,” reads the statement (via Variety), which is credited to “the Tim Bergling Family.”

“Thank you for all the initiatives taken to honour Tim, with public gatherings, church bells ringing out his music, tributes at Coachella and moments of silence around the world,” the family's statement continues. “We are grateful for the privacy during this difficult time. Our wish is that it continues that way.”
Bergling was found dead in his hotel room in the Middle Eastern nation of Oman, with the cause of death still unknown.
Sources in the Oman police have stated there is “no criminal suspicion” behind the death, adds Variety, while the results of two post-mortem examinations have led authorities to rule out foul play.
Jaguar Land Rover has brought two new startups into its Portland Tech Incubator: LISNR and PILOT Automotive Labs. Previous cohorts at the incubator have ranged from parking apps to drones; these two continue to build on JLR's creative approach to the automotive future.
LISNR uses ultrasonic audio to transmit data. That's right — it transmits and receives sounds we can't hear. LISNR calls them Smart Tones. Any two devices — two vehicles' black boxes, say, or a car and a pedestrian with an enabled smartphone in their pocket — can send and receive messages once they're in range of each other. All the devices need is a microphone or a speaker, depending on whether they're sending or receiving, which keeps their power requirements low.
LISNR is already being used in non-automotive applications, like the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. The company was also part of the inaugural AutoMobili-D startup expo at the 2017 North America International Auto Show in Detroit.
PILOT promises to make any car autonomous. A sensor plugin is installed on your car's roof to take in data. (The sensor is mounted on a roof rack in the image above.) You can use that data to help you improve your driving, like many OBD-II port plug-in devices do, or you can connect it to your steering and braking systems and let it take over some simple driving tasks. It also connects to the cloud to learn of traffic situations and share its data.
PILOT brings some of the current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to any car, like road sign recognition, lane keep assist, and blind spot monitoring. So using the term “autonomous,” as the startup does on its website, might be a bit premature. This is SAE Level 2 at best. But it is a step toward bringing life-saving collision mitigation technology to cars already on the road.

NEW DELHI:- China has issued a travel advisory to its nationals visiting India, the first such warning after the Doklam standoff, warning them about denial of visas to visit “restricted areas” like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Chinese Embassy in India issued the advisory, the third in four months, for Chinese tourists in India. The warning was posted on the embassy's website and detailed several situations the embassy handled recently in which Chinese tourists were denied entry or investigated while travelling in India, state-run Global Times reported.–INP
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- Five weeks into the season, rookies still are adjusting to life in the NFL, complete with a new schedule, new rehab regimen, new playbook and new ways of preparation.
The Chicago Bears' Mitchell Trubisky is faced with a more difficult transition than most. The first-year quarterback, who started only 13 games as a senior at North Carolina, will replace Mike Glennon as the starter when the Bears host the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night. Without having played a single snap in the regular season, Trubisky will go up against one of the best defenses in the league.
How's that for a warm welcome?

But the challenge isn't solely on Trubisky. Other than the preseason, Minnesota doesn't have much film of the rookie in action, which makes constructing a game plan an experiment.
“Each quarterback that you play is different,” Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. “[Trubisky] is probably more inexperienced. But you try to fool the experienced guys too. I don't know if it's one more than the other. It's not how much you can figure out on the blackboard, it's how much can your players execute.”
Trubisky will be the third rookie quarterback to make his first career start against a Mike Zimmer-led defense, dating back to 2008, according to ESPN Stats & Information. When Zimmer was the defensive coordinator in Cincinnati, he drew up a game plan for the debuts of Joe Flacco (2008) and Jimmy Clausen (2010).
The results were split. Flacco and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Bengals as he completed 15 of 29 passes for 129 yards. Clausen walked away with a loss after throwing for 188 yards on 16-of-33 passing and an interception. No quarterback who has started his first NFL game against Zimmer's defense in the last 10 seasons has thrown for a touchdown.
In total, rookie quarterbacks won six games and lost seven with a completion percentage of 58 percent and average pass of 6.8 yards against Zimmer and the Bengals. Those rookie QBs threw 12 touchdowns to eight interceptions.
Last season, Minnesota faced two rookie quarterbacks, each of whom walked away with wins.
After going 5-0 to start the 2016 season, the Vikings' first loss came at Philadelphia. Carson Wentz, the Eagles' rookie quarterback, was held to a season-low 138 yards passing and passer rating of 52.4 after throwing a touchdown and two picks. Six games later, the Cowboys barely escaped Minneapolis with a 17-15 victory behind Dak Prescott, who had 139 yards passing and a touchdown with a 108.3 passer rating.
In the preseason, Trubisky made the most of his opportunity to garner reps in four games, completing 67.9 percent of his attempts for 364 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions.
But that was the preseason. Monday is prime time.
Minnesota's defensive line put together its best performance of the season when it sacked Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford six times for a loss of 55 yards in Week 4.
Pressuring an inexperienced rookie into tough situations is obvious. But how does the defense get there? By making last-second adjustments before the ball is snapped to force Trubisky out of rhythm? By disguising coverages? Utilizing more blitz packages?
Maybe. For now, the Vikings are sticking to the same mindset of what's worked for them to become the third overall rushing defense and ninth in points allowed.
“You just rush,” defensive end Everson Griffen said. “They've got a good running game. [Jordan] Howard, he's a strong back. He likes to hit the hole downhill -- north and south runner. They've got some good wideouts they can get the ball to, but at the end of the day, we have to stop the run. They're going to run the ball against us and they're going to let him throw play-action passes. I don't think they will give us dropback passes at all, but who knows.”
ISLAMABAD (PR): Spokesperson for Directorate of Immigration and Passport has clarified a news item carried by The Nation titled “Passport Express Service gets lethargic response” on June 12, 2017.
The spokesperson made it clear that Passport Express Service was purely an optional service for the applicants who did not wish to visit passport offices for collection of their passports and preferred their delivery at home. He said this service was introduced in Pakistan in November 2015, initially from Rawalpindi and Islamabad and, later expanded throughout the country in phases. He said on an average almost 2,600 passports were being delivered to applicants at home every month and to date 52,946 passports had been delivered throughout Pakistan through this service.
Giving details of the cost of the service, the spokesperson said TCS was awarded the contract for this service after open tendering, under which they charge Rs 200 for delivery in Islamabad and Rs 250 for delivery anywhere else in Pakistan. He said applicants could pay TCS home delivery service charges and get a receipt at TCS kiosks established in passport offices or at National Bank branches where passport fee is being collected.
The Iowa Department of Transportation employee who designed the new license plates posted on social media about the criticism she's received since they were unveiled last week.
Graphic designer Christina Andersen says in a post on Facebook that some 5,000 people have made negative comments on-line in the 48 hours since the three designs were unveiled last Thursday and she says they indirectly told her that her work sucks, she has the talent of a third grader and should be fired.
Andersen says she was restricted from designing a full color plate that Iowans wanted because the numbers on the plate have to be easily read by police. And cost constraints do not allow for embossed letters to be used on the plates.
Andersen says the criticism “ranges from stinging to an absolute gut punch that leaves me short of breath and tears flowing uncontrollably.” She says artists know their work will be criticized, but asks that people be more thoughtful.
You can see the plates and vote on your favorite plate design at the Iowa State Fair or online.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the spectre of a new global financial crisis as she warned of the potential fallout from a trade war with the U.S., saying tariffs on European cars would be "much more serious" than levies on steel and aluminum.
In an address to Germany's lower house of parliament Wednesday, Merkel cited President Donald Trump's threat of targeting U.S. imports of cars from Europe, which risk hitting Germany the hardest. She backed efforts by the European Union and U.S. negotiators to reach a deal this month.
"The international financial crisis, which ensured that we now act in the framework of the (Group of 20), would never have been resolved so quickly, despite the pain, if we hadn't cooperated in a multilateral fashion in the spirit of comradeship," Merkel said. "This has to happen."
As the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Merkel underscored her resolve to fight for the survival of post-World War II global institutions under attack by the Trump administration. At the same time, she renewed her counterattack against U.S. criticism of German exports by saying that the U.S. has a trade surplus with the EU if services are included.
WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) – The head of the U.S. House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee said on Friday he had not read the underlying materials referenced in a memo he and other Republicans on the panel assembled alleging bias against President Donald Trump in the FBI and Justice Department's Russia probes.
Representative Devin Nunes told Fox News Channel the committee had arranged with the Justice Department to allow a limited number of people to read the relevant documents as part of the panel's own investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. READ MORE: Nunes memo: Read the controversial note released despite warnings from U.S. officials “I thought the best person on our committee was the chairman of the Oversight Committee, Trey Gowdy, who has a long career as a federal prosecutor, to go and do this. And then they, over a series of meetings, would come back and brief us, the committee members,” Nunes said.
WATCH: Trump declassifies memo alleging FBI misconduct, calls it ‘terrible'
The previously classified document, written by Republicans on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, alleges that the federal probe of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department.
Ignoring a plea from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump approved the release of the memo without redactions, deepening an extraordinary breach between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him during his first year in office.
Democrats said the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into the Russia matter launched in May 2017 that grew out of an earlier FBI investigation. They warned Trump against using it as a pretext to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or Mueller himself.
There's nothing quite like one particular piece of land tucked away in northwest Calgary. What has become known as the “Hawkwood Farm” is a 43-acre parcel of rolling farmland located in the community of Arbour lake, surrounded by Arbour Lake Drive.
Over the years the city has grown around the old farmhouse and property, but now there are plans to build nearly 900 homes on it, which isn't sitting well with some people who live in the area.
“This is unique because it's raw land,” said Ray Sargent, who lives in the area. “It's never been tilled, never been touched. I suppose they had cattle roaming on it and the old fences are still there.
“It would be a shame to see that heritage go away. Let's use it for the people rather than for yet more housing.”
The land, which is named for the original owners John and Joseph Hawkwood, has sat undisturbed for years. Hopewell Residential now owns it and held an open house on April 10 to get public input on the project. The new development would be a mix of condos and houses and would be home to 2,200 people.
“We are in the very early stages,” said Scott Hamilton, marketing director with Hopewell Residential. “We have a concept plan that has been circulated and we've had some great initial feedback in terms of an open house with the residents in the area. We are now in the phase of information gathering. We want to gain insight from the community on the plan.”
Hopewell plans to include a four-acre green space at the centre of the new neighbourhood.
“Ultimately, the plan proposes that those wetlands be moved and that the new storm water facility would be the central sort of wetland area,” Hamilton said. “So we're working with the City of Calgary and Alberta Parks as well to determine the best way to move forward with being sensitive to environmental concerns in the area.”
From her Arbour Lake condo, Margo Fraser watches red tailed hawks, deer and coyotes all living on the old farm.
“I feel pretty fortunate to have been able to just be here and watch. I think we've lost a lot of that. Just sitting and watching nature and being with it, and how important that is to our psychological effects,” Fraser said.
She would like special care taken with the wetlands that are on the property.
“I'd rather see that kept as pristine. I know it's difficult when it's private land to make those decisions, but I also think that we have to raise our consciousness a bit. We're not just owners of the land we are guardians of the land,” Fraser said.
Some area residents say the city should step in to preserve the land, hoping it would be similar to Nose Hill Park.
“It is something that we as a city want to hang onto as a heritage for the next generations because there's no more land like that in this kind of proximity,” said Sargent.
The proposed neighbourhood would include condos up to six storeys in height. The land still needs to be rezoned. The developer plans to start construction by September 2018.
LONDON (Reuters) - An explosion in central New York pushed the dollar lower on Monday, but stock markets recovered after an early dip, once it became clear the situation had been contained.

New York police said the explosion rocked the Port Authority Bus Terminal about 7 a.m. local time (12 noon GMT), as the Monday morning rush hour was getting under way. Three injuries were reported and a suspect was in custody.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes rose 0.1 to 0.3 percent when the main U.S. stock markets opened two and a half hours later.
The dollar slipped as far as 113.245 yen against the Japanese currency. The Swiss franc, a refuge at times of heightened risk, reached a high of 1.16755 francs per euro..
“We did see equities futures moving lower and it is not a surprise that we saw a move in crosses like dollar-yen,” said CIBC's head of currency strategy Jeremy Stretch. “There is a susceptibility, whenever there is a degree of uncertainty, for the usual suspects to react.”
Before the news from New York, European markets were quiet, with the spotlight instead on new bitcoin futures, which were feeding traders' cryptocurrency obsession.
A positive Asian stocks session had helped Europe initially. The rally dissipated, but a fall in sterling and a rebound by mining shares kept London's FTSE 0.5 percent higher. Germany's cyclicals-heavy DAX also held its ground.
But the spotlight was on the debut of Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency in one, two or three months.
The one-month contract, the most-traded on the Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets exchange, opened at $15,850 on Sunday night - a gain of 21 percent.
It was last quoted at $17,850, having earlier traded as high as $18,850. Bitcoin itself hovered at just under $16,000.
Bitcoin has rocketed up 1,600 percent since the start of the year, attracting institutional interest -- and concern that it is a bubble in the making.
“The one-month contract is trading at around an 11 percent premium to the underlying bitcoin, and for me that's a clear indication that there's no connection between the two markets,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco.
Several online brokerages have not yet allowed trading of the new futures.
“I can understand you don't see that many people who are willing to offer this contract, because you can't hedge your underlying risk if you can't short it,” Daalder said. “This only adds to the bitcoin phenomenon. It's interesting to watch, but not a market that I would like to touch.”
While frantic trading kept bitcoin volatility dizzying, a gauge of S&P 500 volatility hovered below 10, nearing the record low hit in November, though it was edging up slightly after four days of falls.
Despite the dip in U.S. futures, MSCI's world stocks index was still higher at 505.31 points and close to last week's latest all-time peak of 507.09 points.
“Momentum behind stock markets has been pretty solid, supported in part by good numbers on the economic front and not bad earnings. I don't see anything happening right now that could break the momentum,” Daalder said.
BIG WEEK FOR MONETARY POLICY MOVES
Currency and bond markets were cautious ahead of a big week of policy meetings, although the Federal Reserve is the only major central bank expected to raise interest rates.
The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are widely seen holding rates steady.
Sterling stabilised, edging lower after a volatile week, last at $1.3383.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, eased 0.2 percent to 93.75, still hovering near a three-week high after five straight sessions of gains.
Sluggish U.S. wage growth and inflation have sparked some concern overrate rises, and traders will zoom in on the Fed's future rate projections on Wednesday.
“It's a tall order for the median Fed dots to shift lower, but we may see a slight downshift in the distribution,” said ING forex strategists in a note, adding that the dollar index could fall below 93 as a 25-basis-point rate rise from the Fed is priced in.
Most high-grade euro zone bond yields were a tad lower, with 10-year Bund yields, the benchmark for the region, dropping below 0.30 percent.
“Bunds have drifted lower in recent weeks,” said Robeco's Daalder. “I would say there's some complacency for sure, but I don't see any major moves until the new year.”
In commodities, signs of increased drilling activity after the latest rise in the U.S. rig count dampened oil prices.
U.S. crude fell to $56.91 a barrel before recovering to trade flat at $57.26, and Brent crude inched up to $63.47, holding near a recent 2-1/2 year peak of $64.65.
Spot gold was firmer at $1,250.81 an ounce. Copper prices gained for a fourth straight session having fallen sharply early last week.
GoFundMe accounts have been created for two people killed in a collision on the QEII Highway just after Christmas.

According to the GoFundMe page set up by Anderson's sister-in-law, the term “Good Samaritan” is not a strong enough term to describe the Calgary mother.
“She was an absolute angel,” the page reads. “She would have done anything for anybody.”
“This is never something that most people have as their rainy day fund. This has been an unfathomable accident. We are starting this memorial fund to assist with funeral expenses.”
A GoFundMe page has also been created to cover the cost of returning Balasundaram's body to India as well as his funeral.
According to the page, Balasundaram was working as Chef at Original Joe's as he completed his Bachelor's Degree in Hotel Management.
“This was a sudden and heartbreaking loss for his friends and family and anyone that's ever come in contact with Elayaraja,” the page reads.”He was a passionate, hard-working and an inspirational single man who lived every day to the fullest.”

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made a tiebreaking three-point play with 3.8 seconds left and finished with 17 points as No. 24 Michigan held on to beat Minnesota 76-73 in overtime on Saturday.
The Wolverines (19-6, 8-4 Big Ten) needed the extra time to win because they struggled to shoot from the field and the line. And they failed to slow down a pair of guards.
The Golden Gophers (14-11, 3-9) were in a position to end their longest losing streak of the year because freshman Isaiah Washington had a season-high 26 points and Nate Mason scored 22 points, including a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds left that tied the game.
Mason was just short on a shot from about 30 feet that would have forced a second overtime.
Michigan's Zavier Simpson made a layup and a 3-pointer — after missing his first seven attempts beyond the arc — to give his offensively challenged team a four-point lead with 2:50 left in the extra period.
The Gophers tied the game with 11 seconds left, but couldn't keep Abdur-Rahkman from making what the game-winning play on a hard-charging drive for a layup on which he was fouled by Jamir Harris.
Moe Wagner had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Simpson scored 15 and Charles Matthews had 13 points for the Wolverines, who have won four straight at home. Michigan made just 44 per cent of its shots from the field and was 8 of 32 from the 3-point line.
Minnesota's Jordan Murphy fouled out in overtime with 12 points and six rebounds.
BIG PICTURE
Minnesota: The short-handed Gophers, who played just seven players, extended their season-long losing streak to five games. Minnesota was without Reggie Lynch because of an investigation into sexual assault allegations along with Amir Coffey (right shoulder) and Gaston Diedhiou (ankle) due to injuries.
Simone Levesque still can't believe her friend is gone.
“Tristan was an amazing person. He had a vibrant personality. Any time you walked into the room, you'd see his smile and he'd make you smile. He made your day every time he came into work. He was always laughing at my crappy jokes.”
On Tuesday, Tristan Tice-Kidston, a 17-year-old student at Ardrossan Junior Senior High School, was killed in a crash on Highway 16 at Range Road 224, east of Edmonton. The other driver also died. Three other people were injured.

Levesque worked with Tice-Kidston at a local Tim Hortons.
“I was the one who trained him and over time, we became good friends and we hung out outside of work as well.”
Her manager called her on Tuesday to give her the sad news.
“I just couldn't believe it because I talked to him the night before last,” Levesque said.
“I came into work today… It's still like the first time I'm hearing it. I'm still in shock. I don't believe it.”
She said Tice-Kidston made work a happy place, helping out others where he could. She said he even asked some of his co-workers to teach him how to say “I love you” in Filipino.
“There was never a dull moment with Tristan,” Levesque said.
Watch below: Two people were killed in a highway crash near Ardrossan Tuesday, including a high school student. Three other people were injured. Kim Smith has the details.
One of the best things about him was his generosity, she said.
“He went out of his way for other people, to make sure they were doing OK. He was always there for them. That was really good to have as a friend, because you know what? I've had my troubles too and we were always there for each other.”
Levesque said the Tim Hortons team is like family.
“One of the girls that works here… she's an older lady and he would go out of his way so he could help her as much as he could so that she didn't have to do so much. He was a hard worker… He always worked so hard.”
“He was such a charmer,” Levesque said with a smile, “such an awesome person to have around. He was a really sweet guy and it's really unfortunate that he's gone.”
When asked what she'll miss about her friend most, Levesque became quiet.
“Just him. Him… he shone bright. I miss talking to him. I'm going to miss just having that friend who's always there, who's never given up on anyone,” she said, her voice breaking. “I'm just going to miss my friend. He was a good friend.
“I do want him to be remembered as vibrant, always had a smile on his face, always going out of his way for others,” she added.
“He was a beautiful person. I want people to remember him as he was, the good memories he created. I want everyone to know that Tristan wasn't just another guy; he was one of the good people.”

KHAIRPUR - An awareness seminar on general elections was held on Monday in Sukkur. The session was organised by non-governmental organisation Marvi Rural Development Organization (MRDO) in the collaboration with DAI-Tabeer in Sukkur, which was attended by minority people on Monday.
The event was aimed at educating the targeted citizens about importance of vote and exercising their right to vote in elections. The participants were briefed about the political and electoral system as well as the electoral process.
The minority people complained that they are not being given the full political and civil rights in Pakistan, saying that upcoming elections are just another festival for Muslims to which minorities have only been invited as they cannot take the centre-stage. They added that a non-Muslim can't become the president, prime minister, a senator or governor despite being capable of it. They stressed that the government to realize the fact that loyalties of the minorities cannot be won by depriving them of civil and political rights. The minority people demanded joint electorate, where they are allowed to vote for Member National Assembly (MNA) and Member Provincial Assembly (MPA) that will represent their physical constituency. They also urged the government to end discriminatory laws in order to encourage the minorities in mainstream politics. “The organisers of the session said that the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees fundamental rights including; equality of opportunity, social, economic and political justice, and freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship and association, subject to the law and public morality” they said.
MRDO Programme Manager Salman Ali said that voters can bring change through ballot which remains low in the history of the country.
He added that democratic process can be strengthened by casting the vote of every individual, as people should come out of their homes to exercise their right to vote on the Election Day.
Sukkur Social Welfare Deputy Director Din Mohammad Sheikh underlined the need of exercising right to vote as its will strengthen the democratic process in the country as well protect the rights of citizens.
Tremendous Thomas claims US PGA win
American Justin Thomas secured his maiden major title, winning the US PGA Championship by two strokes on Sunday.
by Omnisport News 14 Aug 2017, 04:52 IST
American Justin Thomas
Justin Thomas stunningly claimed the US PGA Championship by two strokes after a thrilling final round at Quail Hollow on Sunday.
The American carded an impressive three-under 68 to earn the Wanamaker Trophy and his first major title, an eight-under total putting him clear of the nearest rivals Francesco Molinari, Patrick Reed and Louis Oosthuizen.
Thomas, the world number 14, produced some magic either side of the turn on the final day in Charlotte.
The 24-year-old made four birdies in seven holes – picking up shots at seven, nine, 10 and 13 in a fine final-round display in hot and humid conditions.
Thomas made a bogey-birdie-bogey start to his round, but took advantage of the par-five seventh before holing a 36-footer at nine.
He made another birdie at 10 – waiting 12 seconds before his eight-footer dropped after his tee shot found the fairway via the trees – and chipped in from just off the green at 13 as those around him who looked most likely to challenge faltered.
A player with a round of 59 on the PGA Tour and a record-breaking 63 at the U.S. Open this year, Thomas finally put together four strong rounds at a major.

Watch the finish: https://t.co/mT5mpu9yEU pic.twitter.com/qdTlxXTyeG — PGA of America (@PGA) August 13, 2017
While he opened with a 73, scores of 66 and 69 followed before his closing 68.
Molinari (67) and Reed (67) made moves but fell short at six under alongside Oosthuizen (70), while overnight leader Kevin Kisner (74) dropped to four under.
Rickie Fowler also made a brief run with a 67 that saw him tie for fifth with Hideki Matsuyama (72) at five under, while Chris Stroud (76) ended up seven off the pace.
Kisner had been two shots clear early in the day, but he bogeyed the seventh – one of the easiest holes on the course.
That allowed Matsuyama some control, but the Japanese star – playing alongside Thomas and with the pressure of trying to become his country's first major champion – bogeyed three straight holes starting at 11.
At one stage, there was a five-way tie at the top as Molinari joined Thomas, Matsuyama, Kisner and Stroud.
But as Thomas managed par at 12, the rest dropped shots, and the eventual champion then chipped in at 13.
Thomas failed to make the most of 14 and 15, the latter birdied by Matsuyama from 12 feet to get him back within a shot, while Kisner gained shots at both holes to get back to seven under.
The 'Green Mile' was expected to bring drama, and Matsuyama cracked at 16 – his four-footer for par lipping out.
The par-three 17th had made players nervous all week – the pin even nearer to water on the left on Sunday – but not Thomas, who hit a seven-iron to within 14 feet for another birdie and a two-shot lead.
It surely made the walk up to 18 significantly less nerve-wracking and, if he dared look, Kisner's bogey at 16 meant Thomas held a three-shot lead.
Thomas' tee shot at the last went into a bunker, but - watched on by close friends Jordan Spieth and Fowler – he steadied to close with a bogey, the 'Green Mile' and the tough Quail Hollow course having been conquered.
Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.
American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time that they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election.

SADIQABAD-PML-N stalwart and former provincial minister for special education Ch Muhammad Shafiq said that his sole aim to do politics was to serve people.
During door-to-door election campaign at Rail Bazaar here, he said that development during the five-year tenure of the PML-N stood testimony to the fact that former N-led government in the centre had renovated infrastructure of Sadiqabad. He said that people had rejected turncoat politicians, adding that the PML-N would win polls on July 25 with thumping majority. "After being elected, we will complete all the development projects left incomplete," he promised.
Local PML-N office-bearers and workers including Abdur Razzaq, Waqas Shafiq Pappa, Shafqat Hussain, Haji Malik Afsar Nawaz, and Haji Saith Charagh Ahmed Bhatti accompanied him. On the occasion, traders' leader Malik Irfan Akbar announced his support to Ch Shafiq.
On the other hand, PML-N district leader Khalid Mehmood Saeedi termed former provincial minister for special education Ch Shafiq a valuable asset to people. "Completion of development projects worth billions of rupees is his biggest accomplishment," he said, adding "On July, there will be a contest between public servants and those who have looted public money." He said that people would reject those doing politics of violence and would vote for the PML-N adhering to the agenda of national development. He flayed that all the turncoats and dishonest politicians had gathered at the platform of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI], raising a question, "How will these people serve the masses?" He urged people to throng polling stations on July 25 and vote for the Lion.
Meanwhile, PML-N candidate for NA-180 Sardar Arshad Khan Leghari said that he was and would remain loyal to the PML-N till death. During a media talk at Sarafa Bazaar, he claimed that the PML-N would win the July 25 election owing to its brilliant performance. He added that Sadiqabad was a stronghold of PML-N. "Every individual here is a Muslim Leaguer and loves PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif," he maintained. He sought support from people his constituency for success in the election so that a new period of public welfare could be started.
The PML-N candidate was accompanied by local party workers and office-bearers including Mian Nasir Ali, Ashfaq Khaliq, Amin, Rana Kamran Mushtaq, Haji Shafqat, and Ch Zubair Afzal.

The idyllic Byron Bay hinterland towns of Bangalow and Newrybar in the far north of NSW have long attracted Sydneysiders seeking an escape from the big smoke.
But now locals are in a flutter about apparently unrelated big-money investments and business operations in the area.
Names on the lips of locals include former king of the Cross, John Ibrahim, and his property developer friend, Bart Elias, as well as Gold Coast party boy and tobacco shop heir Travers Beynon, aka, the Candyman.
As a stoush over a major $20 million-plus industrial development in Bangalow comes to a head before the NSW Government's joint regional planning panel on Thursday, intrigue and suspicion have taken over.
Amid reports about the Ibrahim family being the subject of drug and tobacco importation raids last week, word spread about interests linked to John Ibrahim having invested in the area.
The Herald has confirmed Pacific Blue Property Holdings, controlled by Mr Ibrahim's financial controller Margaret Staltaro, paid $1.45 million for a macadamia nut farm on Hinterland Way, Newrybar last year.
Ms Staltaro, also known as the female Tongan Sam, a reference to the family's feared enforcer, Semi "Tongan Sam" Ngata, purchased the 8 hectare parcel of land that has been run as a commercial macadamia plantation.
Located at the end of the Newrybar main strip, the purchase came after a strong run-up in macadamia farm prices.
The agent's pitch on the property made Newrybar sound more lively than a night out in Kings Cross since the lockout laws were introduced, describing it as "the most happening place in the heart of the Byron Hinterland".
"The picturesque main street, is becoming 'hipster' heaven," the blurb enthused, noting the iconic Harvest Cafe, a deli and bakery, boutiques, antique shops and galleries.
Perhaps of more interest to Mr Ibrahim's growing interest in property development, the agent also suggests opportunity including an "as of right" use for rural tourism allowing for accommodation to be combined with the macadamias as an extra source of income.
"Also permitted under the current zoning 'Rural Industry' a recreational facility, value-adding of rural products, retail outlet, marketplace, and much more."

Just up the road in Bangalow, the state government's joint regional planning panel is due to front a meeting on Thursday to update the community on a controversial industrial food processing precinct that has divided locals.
The project is linked to an intriguing list of names, including Ibrahim's friend, Mr Elias, a prominent north coast developer.
Mr Elias, whose mother is the sister of Judy Obeid, wife of jailed corrupt politician Eddie, was front and centre when Chase Lismore Road Pty Ltd submitted plans for an industrial manufacturing centre in 2015, attending meetings and featuring in the development application.

The proposal has been referred to as a "food hub" and a "food collective" but would be one of the largest industrial sites in Byron Shire, dwarfing the nearby Bangalow industrial estate. Two local businesses, Salumi Australia and Brookfarm, have expressed interest in being tenants and it has been argued the site could stop producers having to leave the area, and it could create jobs.
The hefty price tag, originally estimated at $20 million, means the DA will not be decided by Byron Shire Council but by the state government. Local opposition is strong citing the development's size, traffic and impact on local amenity.
While Mr Elias features strongly in the DA and is a central figure in a host of companies in the Chase group, the company behind the Bangalow development is owned and controlled by Allan Abraham, Mr Elias' brother's brother-in-law, and a Byron Bay tobacco store franchisee.
Chase Lismore Road paid $1.9 million for the site in 2015 with works now estimated by some critics at closer to $30 million when development options are included.
Mr Abraham's FreeChoice store comes under the umbrella of the FreeChoice chain, controlled by the family of Mr Beynon, a prominent Gold Coast playboy known as the Candyman because of his lavish lifestyle. Mr Beynon is heir to a company of more than 200 stores founded by his parents, Trevor and Sandra.
Mr Beynon, known for his extravagant parties at his Gold Coast home dubbed the Candy Mansion, recently made headlines when an annual party saw seven ambulances called out to treat drunk and drugged revellers.
While Mr Abraham is making the running on the Bangalow building project, the source of financing for the complex is unclear. It's understood one option includes securing the DA and then selling the property, having improved its development value, rather than pushing through with the project.
While Mr Elias will take a back seat at the planning committee meeting on Thursday, the next day he will front Ballina court over driving offences and an apprehended violence order linked to his divorce. He has pleaded not guilty. It's understood he sought an AVO against his ex-wife as well.
Mr Elias is no stranger to controversy in Bangalow, after his plans for a shop development were knocked back by the council in 2014, a position that was later upheld by the Land and Environment Court. He was also involved in a land-clearing dispute near Old Bar on the north coast that resulted in a hefty fine.
He declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media. Mr Abraham could not be contacted.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Pallet Delivery Process
Small businesses are increasingly relying on pallet shipping to ensure they deliver goods fast and efficiently. Pallets are stable and sturdy platforms on which you can ship a wide range of items from mechanical parts to fresh produce. While this delivery option has been around for some time, many new small businesses have no idea of how the delivery process works.
Pallet delivery has become the most common form of distribution across the world due to its simplicity. Below, we'll provide a step-by-step guide on how the pallet shipping process works.
Contact a Pallet Transport Courier
As a small business owner, the first step is to find a delivery service that can meet your needs. You have to contact different pallet transport companies and find one that can handle your orders. If they can comfortably meet your pallet shipping requirements, let them know what orders need to be picked up and delivered to your customers.
You can always contact them via phone, email or an online portal. Choose a company that has invested in a real-time portal that manages the entire pickup and delivery process to make your work easier. The volume of goods that your customers order will often determine how many scheduled collections you will have.
Order Collection
Once you've contacted a pallet shipping company, they will then plan how to collect your orders at a specific time, place and date of your choosing. Note that some companies will charge you more for order collections during the weekends or on holidays.
It's important always to check the rates they charge for collection before placing your orders as well as other key considerations, to ensure the service is affordable and reliable.
Order Distribution
After your orders are collected, the pallets often go to a distribution warehouse where they are consolidated into designated routes for the delivery drivers. Reliable shipping companies have in place strict loading and safety protocols that ensure your pallets are loaded onto trucks carefully.
The pallets are also secured safely inside the delivery trucks to avoid damage to goods in transit. Just like other shipping options, the distribution trucks will leave the warehouse on schedule to ensure that your pallets arrive at their destination on time.
Order Tracking
To streamline the pallet delivery process, many delivery companies offer a tracking service to their clients. Again, that is usually offered on an online platform or a mobile app where you can click to check on the progress of your order. Some companies will contact you directly and let you know when your order is delivered while some provide a GPS map to track your order.
Order Delivery Timelines
The time it takes to deliver pallets depends on your requirements, the service level you pay for or the distance to the delivery destination. Most pallet shipping companies will strive to deliver orders with 24 or 48 hours. However, if you're shipping pallets abroad, especially where air, ocean and rail transport becomes part of the delivery process, it can take longer.
Pallet Distribution Networks
As you can imagine, it's hard for a shipping company with only one base to efficiently make 24-hour pallet deliveries all over the country. This is why it's important to work with a company that has an established pallet distribution network comprising of hundreds of trucks and drivers in different locations.
Such networks mostly comprise of a number of distribution companies working together to try and provide the most comprehensive, efficient and cost-effective order delivery solutions to their customers. Bigger pallet transport companies also open transport hubs in strategic points around the country to make things easier and more convenient for customers to get their orders.
The Bottom Line
Understanding how pallet shipping works is just one part of what you need to do when it comes to delivering goods to customers. Small businesses need to invest in a portfolio of order management and fulfillment applications to deal with supply and delivery challenges.
In a corner of the North York Moors, Jeannie Swales meets the family on a mission to save Yorkshire's heritage apples.
Yorkshire Beauty, Flower of the Town, Dog's Snout, Green Balsam – the names may not be as familiar to most of us as the ubiquitous Golden Delicious, Gala and Pink Lady, but these are Yorkshire heritage apples, full of flavour and packing a punch of flavour.
Along with other traditional Yorkshire varieties such as Yorkshire Cockpit, Acklam Russett and Ribston Pippin, they're at the heart of a young business on the edge of the North York Moors National Park just above Scarborough.
Tree Top Press at Suffield is steadily making quite a name for itself amongst connoisseurs of that oft-maligned drink, cider. Owners Adam and Ruby Tildsley currently produce five ciders, each as far removed from the sugary commercial drinks you might buy in a pub as fine champagne is from cheap plonk.
Adam grew up in the house where his parents, Michael and Janet, still live and he and his young family now live next door in what used to be a holiday cottage.
He explains: “There used to be a line of roses in the garden, and my dad decided to replace them with apple trees. He went to RV Roger in Pickering and bought about 15 oblique cordons. This was about 2005, and I was away at university at the time. When I graduated and came home, I got really interested in what you could do with apples – I'd also worked for the National Trust at Nunnington Hall, where they have a lot of apple trees.
“At the time I was making country wines – blackberry, birch sap. Tea wine was one of my specialities – you make it using leftover tea, and it tastes a bit like sherry. I also had a part-time job coaching at the local tennis club, and in my spare time, made cordials, which we started selling from a little stall outside.”
The cordials sold well, but were never going to make Adam a living. Then he met Ruby, brought up in Garforth in Leeds, but at that time working for social services in Scarborough. The couple married and Ruby suggested turning the double garage which they were using as a storage area into a ‘pop-up shop'.
“The National Park then suggested that we get planning permission for a proper shop,” she says. “They were so supportive and encouraging – we opened our shop properly in April last year. Adam's mum, Janet, had always foraged and made lovely things since she was a kid. She had some really old recipes for things like elderberry syrup and elderflower cordial, so she was a real inspiration for a lot of the products we now make.”
The couple still make cordials, mostly from their own home-grown fruit, but also using rhubarb from the Yorkshire triangle for flavours such as rhubarb, orange and ginger. But it's their exquisite ciders which are really catching the eyes of gourmets looking for something that little bit different. They currently make five, all with names inspired by their surroundings.
Tabular Hills, named for the series of table-topped hills which mark the southern boundary of the national park, is dry and still, while Goodlands is fruitier, with less tannin. Sugar Loaf is a medium still cider, and Hackness Rock is a medium-dry, sparkling cider, conditioned in the bottle.
“And then there's Water Tower, flavoured with our own homemade elderflower cordial,” says Adam. “It's named after the water tower you can see if you look through that window there; most of the elderflowers for the cordial come from the hedgerows around it.”
The process is laborious and takes months.
“Good cider is made like wine,” explains Adam. “You crush the fruit, extract the juice, add the yeast. The best cider is made from 100 per cent fruit juice – apple juice, of course, although you can use up to 25 per cent pear to vary the flavours. A lot of people ask ‘how's your brewing going?' but that's a specific term for beer.”
Chemistry graduate Ruby adds: “It's not brewed, it's fermented, so once your juice is with your yeast, the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide and the gas bubbles off. Ideally you want a long, slow, cool fermentation, a bit like breadmaking. The longer and cooler, the better the flavour.
“We do that in the autumn, and leave it over the winter – there's a vigorous fermentation initially, then as the sugar starts to get used up, it slows down. We then do what's called racking. You take the cider off the lees in the primary vessel, and put it into a secondary vessel to clear it.
“This is where it differs from scrumpy cider. Scrumpy is strong and cloudy with lots of bits floating in it. Our is unfiltered, but clear.”
The couple is now turning out around 3,000 litres of cider a year, and rising – which means their few apple trees at the back of the house just can't provide enough fruit. A couple of years ago, they took on the management of an orchard in the nearby village of Ebberston.
Adam was driving through the village and spotted the trees, only to discover the plot was owned by a woman who worked with his father, and who was happy for him to run it.
“It's an historic orchard, at least 100 years old. It had been used by her brother to graze his beef cattle, but not really for the fruit. But an old gentleman in the village told me he remembered scrumping apples from there in the 1940s, so we know it was a mature orchard by then. It was probably planted late in the Victorian era.”
The couple spend a lot of time at the orchard with their two young sons, the suitably sturdy and apple-cheeked Edward, who's two-and-a-half, and 15-month-old Wilfred.
“We've spent ages restoring the orchard to a diverse, productive environment,” says Ruby. “It's been completely reinvigorated. It involved bringing back lots of different wildlife habitats and planting wild flowers to encourage pollinators and beneficial insects. I can't begin to tell you how many hours and hours we've spent there, doing laborious jobs to improve the organic matter in the soil and keep the weeds down. We're actually beyond organic: we don't use any artificial treatments on the plants, and we make our own hay, then rake it by hand to make little mulch circles round each tree. We make homemade sprays with molasses and neem oil. That orchard completely embodies our vision.”
The next step towards the perfect good life for the Tildsley family is the creation of a second orchard and market garden in a nearby field they've just bought – they currently offer an organic veg box delivery service, but have to source some of the veg elsewhere as their own small garden can't keep up with demand. The new market garden should solve that one.
And just to keep her that little bit busier, Ruby makes bread and cakes – all organic, of course – for the shop. In Ruby's words: “What was once a tiny little garage has become an emporium of all sorts of lovely stuff!”
You can meet the Tildsleys at RV Roger's annual apple weekend, which this year today and tomorrow. Adam will be giving juicing demonstrations and Tree Top Press's ciders and cordials will be available to taste. For more information on Tree Top Press, visit treetoppress.co.uk

As we begin a new year it is difficult to imagine that it will be a happy one in Zimbabwe. Even optimists will find it hard to see anything but a stony road ahead.
Source: Stony road ahead – Zimbabwe Vigil Diary: 31st December 2016
We at the Vigil in the depths of a British winter are further chilled by the bleak analysis of Prince Mashele, executive director of the Centre for Politics and Research in South Africa (http://www.biznews.com/africa/2016/12/22/south-africa-will-finally-be-an-african-country/).
He argues that ‘Western' values of accountability, political morality, reason and so on are not African and that it is idle to hope that Africans will have democracies of the type existing in Europe.
He says: ‘People must not entertain the illusion that a day is coming when SA will look like the US. Our future is more on the side of Zimbabwe, where one ruler is more powerful than the rest of the population.' He goes on: ‘How else are we to explain the thousands of people who flock to stadiums to clap hands for a president who has violated their country's constitution? . . . In a typical African country people have no illusion about the unity of morality and governance. People know that those who have power have it for themselves and their friends and families.'
The Zimbabwean writer Pettinah Gappah, speaking about a recent visit home, told BBC listeners that, despite the hardships there, she came across many Mugabe supporters. Prince Mashele would sardonically have called them ‘true Africans'.
As we embark on 2017, we at the Vigil cling to the hope that Mashele is too pessimistic and that, having gone through so much suffering, Zimbabweans, given the chance, will find the road to freedom. Speaking at the Vigil, Ephraim Tapa said that free and fair elections were the key. Then the Vigil could shut up shop and we could all go home and rebuild our country into something that is not ‘typical' and will surprise Mashele. After all, many in the diaspora have learnt something from living in free and democratic countries.
So this new year we wish you all well but with a heavy heart. Even if Mashele is wrong there are many stones on the road.
Other points
With government workers still waiting to be paid for December we are getting desperate messages from our families. One of our supporters reports that he tried to send money to his mother by ecocash but they had no cash and could not pay out. He said the family had no Christmas celebration and stayed indoors except for going to church. Dealers on the black market were taking 15% commission. At the moment the only reliable way to send money is through international money companies such as Western Union.

The Crown is expected to continue their cross-examination of Christopher Garnier when his murder trial resumes on Tuesday. Garnier, 30, is accused of killing Catherine Campbell, 36, in September 2015.
Garnier is facing charges of second-degree murder and improperly interfering with a dead body. He has pleaded not guilty to both charges against him.
Campbell was a member of the Truro Police Service. She was off-duty at the time of the alleged offences.

The Crown has alleged Garnier struck Campbell on the head and strangled her at his friend's apartment on McCully Street before placing her body in a green bin, rolling it through the streets of north end Halifax and dumping it in a wooded area under the Macdonald Bridge.
After three weeks of testimony, the Crown officially closed their case against Garnier on Monday.

Defence lawyer Joel Pink said in his opening statement to the court that Catherine Campbell died as the result of a consensual sex or erotic asphyxiation that “unfortunately went wrong”.
Garnier testified Monday that Campbell asked to be choked and slapped after the pair went back to an apartment on McCully Street on the morning of Sept. 11, 2015.

ISLAMABAD - Asian Development Bank is likely to finance Naulong Dam project, located in Balochistan province, it was learnt reliably here Sunday.
The water and power ministry has also recommended that a contract should be awarded on EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) basis for the early completion of Naulong Dam project, official sources told The Nation.
In a meeting held in the ministry of planning, development and reforms, it was informed by an official of the EAD that, after a long time, ADB had taken water sector projects on the request of EAD, so Wapda should avail this opportunity to develop hydropower infrastructure in the country.
Naulong Dam, a medium-sized reservoir, is proposed to be constructed across Mula River in district Jhal Magsi of Balochistan. The project, with a water storage capacity of nearly 250,000 acres feet, will irrigate 47,000 acres of land. Some 4,300 employment opportunities will be generated during the construction, operation and maintenance of the project. Benefits of the project have been calculated as more than Rs 2 billion per annum.
Jhal Magsi is a huge plain-sharing Magsi tribal area between Sindh and Balochistan with minimum sources of water available to local residents. The project was approved by the CDWP with a cost of Rs 11.77 billion and then Rs 18 billion during the PPP government. Balochistan is water-starved region of Pakistan and, instead of constructing more and more water reservoirs, the departments concerned are creating hurdles in the execution of already approved projects, official maintained.
The meeting was further informed the project was originally approved at a cost of Rs 11.7 billion, but the work could not be started and the project was first revised at a cost of Rs 18 billion in 2012. As the work again could not be started, the sponsors of the project have now submitted another PC-I at a cost of Rs 26.55 billion, the sources maintained.
During the meeting, a Wapda official revealed when the cost of the project was Rs 11.7 billion, it had received a bid of Rs 18 billion, but when its cost was revised as Rs 18 billion, it received a single bid of Rs 28 billion, which was rejected. Later, the bid was reduced to Rs 19 billion by the contractor.
The planning ministry showed concern over the huge increase in the cost of the project and said that it was due to acute deficiencies and flaws in the PC-I. The ministry was also concerned over the drastic reduction of Rs 9 billion by the same contractor from Rs 28 billion in 2012 to Rs 19 billion in 2016 and said there might be discrepancies in the bid submitted by the contractor.
The ministry of water and power recommended that there was a need of thorough reconsideration as there was no cushion available for siltation in the reservoir. The water and power ministry further recommended that the contract should be awarded on EPC basis for the early completion of the project.
The planning ministry further recommended that the ministry of water and power should conduct objective study to ascertain/propose soundness of design and requisite correction in view of futuristic needs. The ministry of water and power was also asked to look into the possibility of cost-sharing option between the federal and provincial government.
It is pertinent to mention here that the Naulong Dam project was approved by the CWDP and Ecnec in 2012 and the planning ministry released an amount of Rs 2 billion, to the executor of the project in 2014, but so far no construction work on the project been has started.
A man who climbed onto a railway line and threw stones at police who were called to deal with him has been jailed for 16 months.
Dean Stallard caused two trains in Hartlepool to be delayed, and the rocks and missiles he threw damaged a police car and a signal box.
Stallard made his way onto the line at Powlett Road following a domestic incident, Teesside Crown Court heard.
“There was a fire at his property,” said Jenny Haigh, prosecuting.
“Stallard was under investigation for that, but he will not be facing any charges for it.
“Later that morning a member of the public alerted police to a man on the railway line who was behaving erratically.
“Officers arrived to find Stallard wielding an iron bar and throwing stones, bricks, and other missiles.
“Network Rail had to suspend two services for 48 minutes while Stallard was being dealt with.”
The court heard Stallard was eventually disarmed by armed police and police carrying riot shields.
“He made no comment when interviewed,” Ms Haigh added.
Stallard, 29, of Allerton Close, Hartlepool, admitted affray and criminal damage, both on January 23.
Laurie Scott, mitigating, said: “Mr Stallard's partner continues to support him.
“If he is allowed his liberty today, he has the offer of a full-time job which is something that has been lacking in his life in the last few years.
“There are two sides to Mr Stallard, for the most part he is a devoted partner and father.
“But he changes when things get on top of him, when he cannot cope he resorts to drugs.
“He had taken drugs on this day and went to the railway line with the intention of taking his own life.”
Judge Simon Bourne-Arton told him: “The observation by your counsel you are a man of two sides is a correct.
“When something goes wrong you thrash about, hurting someone or damaging property.
“Essentially, you are a selfish individual.”

The Lilongwe Senior Resident Magistrate Court the past week convicted and fined two people for stealing water through illegal connections.
The convicts identified as Stephano Kambale and Billy Matchado were arrested in February this year along three others Hanna Sitima, Helmes Chiwanda and Moses Jambo in a joint operation by the Lilongwe Water Board and Malawi Police Service.
Kambale aged 33 and 36-year-old Matchado were charged with Fraudulent Appropriation of Water contrary to Section 298 (A) of the Penal Code.
The court on Friday, Mrach 9 this year convicted and fined Kambale K100,000 in default to serve 12 month imprisonment with hard labour (IHL), he paid the fine.
While Matchado was on Thursday 15th March fined K90,000 in default to serve 15 months IHL. He failed to pay the fine and he is currently serving the sentence at Maula Prison.
Matchado, who once worked for LWB as plumbing novice, has been operating an illegal water connection ring in Area 50. According to information presented in court, this is not the first time for him to be involved in such offense; he was once arrested and fined on similar charges.
“As the Board, we will not relent until those who are perpetuating such malpractice are apprehended and are prosecuted by the court of law,” said Maurice Nkawihe, LWB assistant Public Relations Officer.
“We are losing a lot of money due to illegal connections; this is why we have decided to handle all illegal connections incident as criminal offenses; we are working hand in hand with Malawi Police to ensure all perpetrators face the arm of law.”
Billy Matchado and Stephano Kambale were arrested on 16th and 20th February, 2018 respectively.
Recently, the Lilongwe Water Board jointly with Police apprehended three people for allegedly having illegal water supply connections on their plots.
The three who have since been formally charged by Police are: Clapton Munthali of Area 24, Catherine Mnkhuntha of Area 46 (Nchinsapo), and Josephin Mwale of Area 8 (Mchesi).
They are expected to appear in court soon to answer to illegal water connection related charges.
According to information, it is not first time Josephin Mwale (who was arrested on 13th March, 2018) to be involved in illegal water connection.
She was twice penalized by the Board for connecting water supply to her eight houses in Mchesi illegally.
LWB and Police have intensified a crackdown campaign on those involved in illegal water connections.
The Board is facing an increase of illegal water connection cases within its supply area, losing about MK120 million every month to the malpractice.
Between October 2017 and February 2018, LWB registered 104 cases of illegal connections, 54 of them were confirmed cases. About 38 cases were charged and fined amounting to K226,359,566.16.
A total of 77,439.00m³ is estimated to have been lost due to the malpractice. Five of the cases were commercial customers, two were institutional and 47 were residential customers.
Meanwhile, LWB is calling well wishers to help with information that will lead to the arrest of those involved in illegal water connections.
Those who will provide correct information shall be rewarded a minimum of MK300,000.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Mattel Inc shares reversed course to rise as much as 10 percent on Friday, as investors looked past the toymaker's “ugly quarter” in the all-important holiday period to the management's confident tone on the turnaround efforts.
The company's shares dropped 7 percent premarket, after dipping as much 11 percent in extended trading on Thursday following the company's surprise quarterly loss.
“An ugly quarter, as expected,” D.A.Davidson analyst Linda Weiser said in a note, but added that she did not expect 40 percent of the decline in gross margin to recur in 2018.
Faced with weak demand for its brands such as Hot Wheels and Barbie due to a shift among children toward videogames and electronic toys, the company had stepped up efforts to cut costs, streamline its portfolio and pull back inventory from retailers.
But the bankruptcy of major customer Toy ‘R' Us in September threw a spanner in Mattel's works.
Mattel warned in October that the bankruptcy would cause it to miss its full-year revenue forecast and forced it to suspend its dividend to free up cash.
“We've taken the opportunity to make the tough decisions in 2017 to set the foundation for continued progress on our transformation in 2018,” Mattel CFO Joseph Euteneuer said on a call with analysts on Thursday.
The efforts seem to be paying off.
Mattel said it ended 2017 with retail inventory for key brands down over 20 percent and expected sales growth to more resemble point-of-sale growth going forward.
“We believe MAT took the necessary steps in 4Q to clean up inventory and enter 2018 in a better position, and believe they will likely now turn a corner on performance,” B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a note.
Analysts also highlighted management's expectation to achieve 40 percent of the $650 million of cost savings planned over two years, up from one-third previously.
Investors also cheered Barbie's first sales rise in five quarters, with the iconic brand up 9 percent during the holiday sales quarter.
“Barbie, Hot Wheels and Thomas & Friends growth is expected, but leaves over 70 percent of the business still struggling,” wrote Jefferies analysts, who cut their price target to $12.50 from $14.00.
The results come at a time when Mattel's shares have been buoyed by chatter of a takeover by Hasbro Inc. However, Mattel has snubbed the previous offers.
Mattel is expected to provide more details at its analyst meeting on Feb. 16. (Reporting by Uday Sampath and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)
Some have said the shortage of affordable housing in the Central Okanagan is reaching crisis proportions.
Now two engineers at UBC Okanagan in Kelowna, B.C. have partnered to create a solution to help ease the situation.
“It's more about connecting and less about transacting,” Happipad president Ken Chau said.
Happipad is a social renting website that matches renters with landlords.
“It's the equivalent of Airbnb but for long-term renters,” Happipad co-creater Cailan Libby said.
Happipad is free to browse but has a one time cost: $10 for renters, $30 for landlords.
When a connection is made, the platform handles everything online including the contract.
Both landlords and renters are able to give feedback on each other at the end of tenancy.
“Most references are false positives so it's a true, accurate system that allows people to provide unbiased, fair opinions,” Libby said.
After going live a month ago, the site claims to have 5,000 unique viewers.
The creators have plans to take their website around the world.
SURAT: The police busted on Saturday a ring involved in using stolen biometric data and arrested two fair price shop owners."The accused were using a software that contained ration card numbers, Aadhaar card numbers and biometric thumb impressions of PDS beneficiaries. They used the details to create fake records of food grain sale. We are investigating from where the accused purchased the software, who developed it and who supplied the data," said R Sarvaiya , assistant commissioner of police, detection of crime branch.Surat police commissioner Satish Sharma said some agencies were given contracts by the state government to collect biometric data to link it with ration cards."It is possible that data was saved by somebody in those agencies and later sold illegally," he said. Sharma asserted that the data was not stolen from Aadhaar cards and was not linked with the UIDAI database.The software, with bulk data of beneficiaries, was available for Rs 15,000, police officials said. They believe that there is a bigger racket in stolen biometric details at play.Babulal Chhogaji Boriwal, 53, and Sampatlal Rodilal Shah, 61, were booked under various sections of the IPC, including section 406, 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467, 468, 471 (forgery), as well as sections of IT Act and Essential Commodities Act. They were arrested after eight complaints were registered in different police stations by officials of the Surat collectorate following complaints of irregularities.During a probe, police found cases where online records showed some beneficiaries like Kishore Thakkar , a resident of Udhana in Surat, had availed of subsidised foodgrains between April and November 2017. However, cops discovered that Thakkar had not bought anything from the fair price shop.In 2016, Gujarat introduced the Annapurna Yojana. For transparency, the state had a verification system in which the beneficiary was issued subsidised foodgrains only after threestep verification in which they have to give their ration card number, thumb impression and UID number.The state had developed an EFPS application, which is loaded with database of beneficiaries, for authorised sales. However, the accused found a way to break into the application and continue fraud, say police officials.

LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia plans to drop treason charges against the country's main opposition leader and free him from prison on Monday under a deal brokered by the Commonwealth secretary-general, government and legal sources told Reuters.
The United Party for National Development (UPND) leader Hakainde Hichilema and five others were arrested in April and charged with treason after Hichilema's convoy failed to make way for President Edgar Lungu's motorcade.
Hichilema's trial had been due to begin on Monday in the capital Lusaka but two sources said the prosecution would apply to the court to discontinue the case.
The case has stoked political tensions in Zambia, seen as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies, following a bruising election last year.
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland visited Zambia last week and told reporters she had met Lungu and Hichilema separately and that the two leaders had agreed to a process of dialogue facilitated by her office.
"That process of dialogue, which the Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland is leading with the help of Catholic bishops, starts with the release of the opposition leader from prison," a government source told Reuters on Sunday, referring to local religious leaders.
"The state will discontinue the treason case in the public interest as both the opposition leader and the head of state are committed to burying their past and starting dialogue envisaged to help address some of the issues the opposition raised after the 2016 elections so that the 2021 elections are better held."
A spokesman for the UPND said the party was unaware of any plan to release Hichilema.
"We don't have anything on that. We are not privy to the agreement that was entered into between the two leaders and therefore can only wait for tomorrow," UPND spokesman Charles Kakoma said.
The UPND later said that Hichilema and his co-accused were transferred from Mukobeko Maximum Prison - about 130 km (81 miles) north of the capital - to Lusaka Central Prison.
"They were airlifted this morning and have arrived safely in Lusaka," the party said.
The government source said Lungu is committed to all aspects of the dialogue agreed between the president and the opposition leader, which include promoting peace, stability and public good.
"An overt act serious enough to warrant prosecution exists but the public interest seems to be the overriding consideration, so a nolle prosequi will be entered," a public prosecutor told Reuters, using the legal term for the discharge of a case.
The southern African country has always been relatively stable but relations between the government and the opposition have been fraught since August when Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) beat the UPND in a presidential election marred by violence and which the opposition says was rigged.
It was the second time that Lungu beat Hichilema, an economist and businessman popularly known by his initials "HH", in a presidential election by a razor-thin margin.
Lee Habasonda, a political science lecturer at the University of Zambia, said Hichilema's release would ease political tension, improve Zambia's image with investors and end mounting international pressure on Lungu's government.
"In the face of Zambia seeking international assistance, it is time to make such a move because the state does not lose anything by releasing the opposition leader and dealing with him in other ways," Habasonda told Reuters.
In June, church leaders including those from the influential Catholic church, called for Hichilema's release.
Last month Lungu invoked emergency powers to deal with "acts of sabotage" by his political opponents, after fire gutted the country's biggest market. [nL8N1JX3YC]
Under emergency laws police can prohibit public meetings, detain suspects longer than usual, search without a warrant, close roads, impose curfews and restrict certain people's movements.
The UPND has said Lungu's use of emergency powers is unnecessary and a ploy to make it easier for police to arrest its supporters.
On Thursday police freed another opposition leader, United Progressive Party leader Saviour Chishimba, after holding him in detention for a week on accusations of defaming Lungu, an offence that carries a maximum five-year prison term.
Chishimba hit the headlines in July after criticizing Lungu's decision to impose emergency powers and suggesting the president should go to hospital for mental tests.
When he invoked the emergency powers, Lungu said the measure would safeguard investments in the country, which is Africa's second-biggest copper producer and is currently in talks with the International Monetary Fund over a financial aid package. The president said the IMF was free to terminate the negotiations if it considered his actions were wrong.

Mid-century modern is dead.
That was the consensus at Tuesday night's Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, where property owner Steve DiCiacco received approval to expand the first floor of the vacant building that sits at 719 Danbury Road.
“That building was put up in the 1950s, and as near as I can tell, was supposed to be some kind of futuristic building,” DiCiacco said to the commission.
“Well, the future came and went — or maybe it just never arrived.”
Despite the building not currently holding a tenant, DiCiacco said, he'd like to expand the first floor to improve the building's aesthetic appeal. The building currently has a second story that overhangs the first floor by several feet.
“My 95-year-old mother says that it looks top-heavy,” DiCiacco said.
Planning and Zoning director Richard Baldelli said the square footage added to the building's first floor — the total would come in around 2,700 square feet — would not “even meet the requirements to need another parking space.”
“Move to approval,” Commissioner George Hanlon said after the presentation, “even though I think mid-century modern is coming back.”
Commissioner John Katz laughed at that comment.
“Most of us pray that mid-century modern is not coming back,” he said.

CARACAS, VENEZUELA—Venezuela's ruling socialists swept nearly all the races for mayors across the country, and President Nicolas Maduro is now threatening to ban key opposition parties from future elections in the oil-rich country wracked by economic crisis. Hundreds of supporters shouted “Go Home, Donald Trump” to interrupt Maduro at a rally late Sunday in the colonial centre of Caracas, where he announced that pro-government candidates grabbed more than 300 of the 335 mayoral offices. Sunday's voting marked the last nationwide elections before next year's presidential race when Maduro is expected to seek another term despite his steep unpopularity. “The imperialists have tried to set fire to Venezuela to take our riches,” Maduro told the crowd. “We've defeated the American imperialists with our votes, our ideas, truths, reason and popular will.” The elections played out as Venezuelans struggle with triple-digit inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and charges that Maduro's government has undermined democracy by imprisoning dissidents and usurping the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

Three of the four biggest opposition parties refused to take part in Sunday's contests, protesting what they called an electoral system rigged by a “dictator.” The last time the opposition refused to compete in congressional elections in 2005 it strengthened the government's hand for years. After dropping his vote into the cardboard ballot box earlier in the day, Maduro responded to the boycott. “A party that has not participated today cannot participate anymore,” Maduro said. “They will disappear from the political map.”

The country saw months of protests that left more than 120 dead earlier this year, and it is now facing U.S. economic sanctions as it seeks to refinance a huge international debt. The struggles have caused the president's approval rating to plunge, although the opposition has been largely unable to capitalize on Maduro's unpopularity. Maduro said the third electoral victory for the ruling party in little more than four months signalled that the socialist “Chavista” revolution begun by the late President Hugo Chavez has defeated its opponents who are intent on sowing violence in the country. In a country of 30 million people, 9 million cast ballots — about half of eligible voters. Maduro's opponents on social media questioned the figures. The mayoral elections follow a crushing defeat of opposition candidates in October's gubernatorial elections, where anti-Maduro candidates won just five of 23 races amid allegations of official vote-buying and other irregularities. Given the opposition's disarray, political analysts said they doubted Maduro's opponents would be able to rally behind a single candidate in next year's presidential election. “These were absolutely predictable results,” local pollster Luis Vicente Leon said on Twitter. “It's absurd to think that an abstaining political force can win the majority of mayorships.”

The Suns' only lead was 2-0.
Utah scored 14 straight points to go up 24-8 before Bender came off the bench for eight first-quarter points and Phoenix finished the first quarter with a 12-2 run to cut the lead to 28-23.
The Suns never got any closer. Mitchell sank a 3-pointer, was fouled by Booker, and made the free throw for a four-point play, igniting a 12-0 run that put Utah up 53-33 on Rubio's 3.
The Jazz led 62-40 at the half. They were up by 36 during the third quarter and 41 in the fourth.
It was the most one-sided loss for Phoenix since Jay Triano took over as interim coach three games into the season. He lamented the inconsistency of his team, which was coming off a home win over Dallas.
"It's probably the sign of a young basketball team, but it's disappointing to me," Triano said. "I'd like to think we make steps and we start moving in the right direction and then we take a step back."
MIGHTY MITCHELL
Mitchell is the seventh active player to score 40 as a rookie, and now he's done it twice. He scored 41 in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Dec. 1. The other six are LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Eric Gordon, Steph Curry and Blake Griffin.
Mitchell said this was better than his 41-point game because the team played better.
"My biggest thing is I was just relaxed and settled down," he said. "When I come into games relaxed and kind of calm, that's when I start to figure out things."
TIP-IN
Jazz: Mitchell will participate in the Rising Stars Challenge and the Skills Challenge on All-Star weekend. ... Rubio has five career triple-doubles, none with Utah. ... Utah's largest margin of victory this season was 47 points against Washington on Dec. 4.
Suns: Booker was 2 for 2 at the foul line to break the franchise record for consecutive free throws made in a season at 58. Kevin Johnson (1989-90) and Mike Bratz (1980) shared the previous record of 57. ... T.J. Warren matched his season low with four points. ... Suns signed guard Josh Gray to a 10-day contract. Gray had been with the Northern Arizona Suns of the G-League. He scored seven points, all in the fourth quarter, in his NBA debut. ... Center Alex Len (right ankle soreness) did not play for the second straight game and has missed five of the last six.

Bucking the weakness, Kobe Steel jumped more than 9 percent after it reinstated its annual profit forecast. (Editing by Sam Holmes)
The residents of 25 apartments in a multi-level building in Barrie were forced from their homes Monday night when fire broke out in their building.
The Barrie Fire Department was called to an active apartment fire just before 10 p.m. at 100 Little Ave., in Allendale. The fire, is believed to have started on the third floor of the building before spreading to the roof.

People forced from their homes took shelter down the street at the Allendale Recreation Centre front lobby, where they were met with paramedics. Barrie police say no injuries were reported as a result of the fire.
There is no word yet on what caused the fire. The investigation is in the hands of the Barrie Fire Department and the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal.
Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to thank first responders and the various charities and organizations that offered assistance during the fire.
Story continues below Thanking the angels on our shoulders for the fact there were no injuries tonight in the serious fire at 100 Little Ave. Many have lost everything they had. Thank you to first responders, Barrie Housing, Red Cross and City, County and Transit staff who are assisting tonight. — Jeff Lehman (@Mayor_Jeff) April 24, 2018
A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money to help cover the cost of damages, and to help residents devastated by the fire rebuild their lives.

Toronto police are seeking a man and a woman in a fraud case involving hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Police say a woman went into a bank on June 29 and, using false identification, posed as a client to gain access to that person's account.
They say she then transferred $400,000 from there to another account.
Police say a few days later, a man went into another bank and used a fake ID to pose as a client.
It's alleged he accessed the account in which the money had been transferred and used the funds to buy a large quantity of gold.
Security camera images of the two have been posted on the Toronto police website.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A chartered Amtrak train carrying U.S. Republican lawmakers was travelling at 61 miles per hour (98 kilometres per hour) when the engineer applied the brakes in a crash that struck a truck on the tracks in Crozet, Virginia, investigators said on Thursday.
The National Transportation Safety Board said in a briefing that the maximum speed limit at the grade crossing was 60 miles per hour and that the engineer in Wednesday's crash applied the brakes 20 seconds before the train came to rest, according to preliminary information downloaded from one of the train's event data recorders. The NTSB is still investigating whether the train braked prior to impact.
A passenger on the garbage truck, 28-year-old Christopher Foley, was killed and two others on the truck were injured, according to police. The NTSB has not been able to interview the 30-year-old driver of the truck.
No lawmakers were seriously injured but a Minnesota representative, Jason Lewis, was taken to a hospital as a precaution and released.
The train had hundreds of passengers onboard at the time of the accident, NTSB board member Earl Weener said.
The NTSB has not yet downloaded the forward locomotive video camera or event data recorder. The board said that when it reviews the video data it should be able to determine if the signals at the crossing were working or if the truck was moving.
The train was taking lawmakers to the annual retreat in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, just west of the Virginia state line. Amtrak said the collision occurred at 11:18 a.m. in Crozet, a tiny town between the college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, and White Sulphur Springs.
The Virginia Department of Transportation said the intersection where the crash occurred had flashing signals and gates to prevent motorists from getting on the tracks as trains approach.

PRESS RELEASE – REPRESENTATIVES of the Natural Disaster Risk Management Programme for the Caribbean Region (NDRM) is participating in the 10th edition of the Caribbean Conference on Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM), held at the Melia Nassau hotel of the Bahamas from December 4–9.
This conference, held under the theme, “The Road to Resilience – Check Point 2017: Building Resilience Through Partnerships”, gathered the most relevant decision-makers and professionals of disaster management, contributing to improve capacities and partnerships to fight climate change and strengthen disaster management strategies.
The Caribbean region is among the most vulnerable regions in the world. The recent succession of devastating hurricanes (starting with Harvey, then Irma, Jose and María) has hit the region, causing massive damages to people and infrastructures; at the same time, it had a huge negative impact on socio-economic outcomes.
The NDRM, funded by the European Union to support disaster risk and climate change reduction, will be exposing the activities carried out and the results achieved to reduce vulnerability to the long-term impacts of natural hazards and the impacts of variability of climate change, among relevant NDRM issues.
The main purpose of NDRM's participation at this event is to help improve the capacities of Natural Disaster Organisations (NDOs) and other relevant national agencies in prioritised technical areas, and strengthen their capacities, as the most relevant coordinating bodies in the region.
Daniela Tramacere, EU Ambassador to Barbados, Eastern Caribbean States, the OECS, CARICOM & CARIFORUM, stated that: “This is the most relevant event on disaster risk management for the region and it's a great opportunity to gather professionals and experts in the fields, to come together and build stronger relationships and exchange of knowledge. By providing financial support to Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, the Caribbean Development Bank and the Government of the Dominican Republic, the EU has contributed to developing regional networks and a platform of activities for better adaptation and resilience to climate change. Joining forces – this is what the EU is all about. Europe was built on cooperation, and it is in our DNA to build partnerships. Climate change is on top of our agenda and as a global challenge it can better be addressed together.”
The EU is committed with Disaster Risk Reduction supporting this programme but also humanitarian aid operations in support to the countries and the region after Hurricanes Irma and Maria through its Department on European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).
During these days, DRM practitioners and partners would have had the opportunity to join in different conferences and meetings to discuss and create new partnerships with the objective to align efforts to reduce climate change and work on disaster management risks.
From December 6-9, the NDRM in the CARIFORUM will exhibit its efforts and initiatives in its own stand, aiming to strengthen the capacities of CARIFORUM national and local governments and stakeholders in the implementation of a Comprehensive Disaster Management strategy.
Trucker Path, a three-year-old, Mountain View-based platform that helps connect drivers, brokers, shippers, and carriers, has just lined up $30 million in debt funding so it can start loaning some of those truckers money right after they deliver their freight.
It's seemingly a win-win. It means truckers needn't wait 30 to 60 days to get paid by the vendors who hire them. In the meantime, the loans are a new revenue opportunity for Trucker Path, which is charging its customers slightly more in interest than it's paying its debt provider: Flexible Funding, a lower-flying, 25-year-old lending institution in San Francisco.
It's the latest twist in the war to win over the hearts of the 1.6 million long-haul truckers in the U.S., a somewhat stunning 550,000 of whom are already using Trucker Path's app, according to cofounder and CEO IvanTsybaev.
Why do they use it? Well, partly to communicate to their peers where parking is, and isn't available. In fact, it's one of the stickiest features of the app, which began as a navigational tool but now features everything from crowdsourcing to the ability to track shipments from dispatch to delivery.
While people outside the industry might not grasp what a pain in the butt it is to park a truck, a survey by the Department of Transportation has shown that 75 percent of drivers say they regularly have trouble finding a safe place to park when they need to rest. Using Trucker Path, drivers save 11 hours, or $600, each month, insists Tsyvaev. Meanwhile, you can imagine the savings for enterprise customers like Pepsi and FedEx that send out thousands of trucks every day.
Trucker Path isn't their only option, of course. You've probably read about the growing spate of startups looking to elbow aside traditional trucking companies, including Turvo, which we wrote about here, and Uber Freight — a freight broker that's eventually expected, like Trucker Path, to offer a single platform where brokers, shippers, and carriers can work together in real time.
But Tsybaev says his company already has the kind of network effect that can mean the difference between barely surviving and thriving, and investors apparently buy his argument. The 60-person company — which has already raised $21.5 million from Renren and Wicklow Capital of Chicago, among others — says it's right now talking with investors about a Series B round and that it's already fielding term sheets.
The new funding should help on a number of fronts. One new feature the company has been working on is an insurance marketplace for its trucking customers; they'll gain access to numerous providers that would otherwise have trouble connecting with these individuals but can reach them more easily with Trucker Path's help.
Trucker Path also says it wants to beef up its enterprise sales force, and to create a fully automated marketplace, so truckers don't have to worry about negotiating with shippers or freight brokers. Indeed, ultimately, says Tsybaev, a trucker will be able to tell Trucker Path's app how long they'll be on the road, and it'll will immediately provide him or her with the “right freight at the right price.”
Then, thanks to its new debt facility, it can give that person a cash advance. Speaking of which, new equity funding will also come in handy on that front. As Tsybaev explains it, the company's debt lender provides capital for most of every invoice, but Trucker Path covers a small percentage, too.
“To scale into a multi-billion dollar business,” says Tsybaev, and naturally it means to, “we need more capital.”
South Korean golfer Ha Na Jang will return to the Women's Australian Open to defend her title. (AAP)
World No.16 Ha Na Jang is to return to defend the Women's Australian Open title at Kooyonga in Adelaide in February
South Korean star Ha Na Jang has committed to defend her Women's Australian Open at Adelaide's Kooyonga Golf Club from February 15-18.
Jang, 25, made a big impression in last year's final round at a windswept Royal Adelaide, making three birdies and an eagle in her final six holes to break clear of a big pack and win her fourth LPGA Tour title.
Women's Australian Open officials are thrilled to get Jang back, especially as she suddenly quit the LPGA Tour in the US in May to return home and play the Korean Tour fulltime.
She was quoted as saying at the time she had thought getting to world No.1 was her main goal and where her happiness lay.
"But I realised there are many more important things than that. Even though I won four times, I still felt empty inside. I made this decision because being with my family is more important to me than being the world's top golfer," she told reporters.
Golf Australia's tournament director Trevor Herden said securing the signature of such a fan favourite was a real boost.
"Ha Na was stunning in February - nobody who was at Royal Adelaide will ever forget that sensational finish," Herden said.
"That, along with her exuberant personality, is exactly what her huge Aussie fan base will hope to see again."
The Nashville Predators were the cream of the NHL's crop during the regular season but ultimately fell short during the playoffs. That doesn't diminish their regular-season prowess, where many players stepped up. Some Predators deserve to be recognized for their career years, and while they may not win any NHL awards, we should take a moment to highlight them.
Even if the Predators' season ended too soon for people's liking, but let's start the offseason on a positive note. Below is if only Predators players could win NHL awards. All stats below are at even strength unless expressed otherwise.
Selke Trophy
The Frank J. Selke Trophy is awarded to the best defensive forward in the NHL. While centers usually dominate the award, Calle Jarnkrok deserves it despite mostly playing on the wing.
Jarnkrok had the best offensive production of his career with 16 goals and 35 points in 68 games after an upper-body injury ended his season early. Twenty-nine of those points came at even strength as Jarnkrok provided some much-needed secondary scoring. Despite the decent offensive production, Jarnkrok started over 55 percent of zone starts in the defensive zone while consistently matching against second-line talent.
While starting against more talented players in the defensive zone, Jarnkrok produced average possession numbers while giving up the fewest goals of any Predator who played more than 48 games. His savvy defensive pressure was probably only matched by Austin Watson, although they contributed in different ways.
Watson relied on his brawn while Jarnkrok actively used his positioning to disrupt the opposition in the neutral and defensive zones. Nevertheless, no player is more deserving than Jarnkrok, as his stellar defensive play was more than worth his $2-million cap hit.
Norris Trophy
Defense wins championships, as the cliche goes, but who was the best among the most talented defense core in the NHL? There's only one answer in my mind, and it's P.K. Subban.
Subban is in contention for the actual James Norris Memorial Trophy and is likely to win after he scored 59 points in 82 games this season. That was good for second-best in his career and top 10 in just about every scoring category in the NHL among defensemen. He put up these incredible numbers despite being relied on by head coach Peter Laviolette to eat tough minutes in less ideal situations.
Subban was paired alongside Mattias Ekholm in order to shut down the opposition's best and brightest every night, and the duo looked good in the process. Subban started in the defensive zone over 57 percent of the time, yet put up better numbers than many of the elite defensemen in the NHL.
Guys like John Klingberg, Drew Doughty, and Marc-Edouard Vlasic are extremely deserving of the award, but no one was as good in all three zones as Subban. His 51-percent Corsi and Fenwick were positive despite playing against some of the best possession -riving players in the game night in and night out. Although his high-danger chance share was negative, Subban ended the year with above-50% goal and high-danger goal differentials.
Subban unfairly received the lion's share of criticism during the regular and postseason. He ate tough minutes yet continued to be one of the most consistent producers on the Predators. The team would be in a giant hole without him, and even someone of Shea Weber's caliber wouldn't be able to do all that Subban does. There's a reason he's likely to be the NHL's Norris winner this season.
Lady Byng Trophy
What does it mean to be a gentlemanly player? I'm quite not sure but I think it refers to penalties, in which case I think Kevin Fiala deserves the award.
While Fiala received 13 minor penalties in all situations this season, he drew a team-leading 28. Fiala was a gentleman on the ice because he played fun and physical hockey while never crossing the line. The Swiss star used his body and threw 34 hits, yet never put another player in the way of serious harm.
I think the best is yet to come from Fiala. Giving him this award is just another way to recognize his coming-out season.
Calder Trophy
The Calder Trophy is given to the best rookie of the year, and you may notice something about the Predators: they don't have any rookies (by traditional definition)! I, therefore, moved the goal posts, and my Calder award will be given to the best breakout player or newest Predator.
Who else deserves it besides Kyle Turris? I have concerns about his play, including his reliance on the power play as well as his lack of a presence in the defensive zone but it's hard to argue that Turris wasn't the best new Predator.
Turris had 42 points in 65 games and did a great job jumpstarting Craig Smith's and Fiala's offense. No one outside of that line had better numbers in terms of Corsi, Fenwick, goals, high-danger chances, and normal scoring chances. This might have to do with the fact that the second line received some heavy sheltering, but it shouldn't discount their success.
While the postseason was a disappointment, Turris was the shot in the arm that the Predators needed during the regular season. His spot on the second line is confirmed, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Turris take on more of the tough minutes.
Hart Trophy
The Hart Trophy was a heavily-debated award this season as people couldn't decide whether it meant the best player or the player most important to a team's success. I tend to think it's the latter, otherwise Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid would be the only winners for the next few years. With that in mind, Pekka Rinne was the heart and soul of the Predators this season.
Like Subban, there's a reason that Rinne will likely win the league-wide Vezina Trophy. He was spectacular during the regular season, and the playoffs were an accurate representation of what the regular season would've been like had Rinne not dominated. He sported a .927 save percentage in all situations while being a brick wall at even strength with a .938 save percentage.
These numbers are impressive, but the prettiest came from the high danger areas. The Predators surrendered 491 high danger chances in 59 games but Rinne only gave up 48 goals from the high danger area, good for a save percentage of .902. Those are elite numbers as the average tends to hover around 80%.
Without Rinne, the Predators wouldn't have sniffed the Presidents' Trophy. Every Predator should be happy with their regular season but Rinne deserves the most credit of anyone in the organization.

Librarians and breast cancer survivors find strength in friendship
Breanna Smith
bresmith143@gmail.com
West Baton Rouge Parish librarian Cyndi Jones is a breast cancer survivor that helps others the best way she knows how – by listening, being a friend and recommending a good book.
Before her diagnosis, she never felt sick and admits she was even a few months behind on getting her mammogram. But in July of 2008, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
“It would not have been found without a mammogram,” Jones said. “My tumor was flat like a postage stamp.”
Three years after Jones' diagnosis, Julie Aillet, Jones' now retired coworker at the West Baton Rouge Parish Library was diagnosed with breast cancer. The two worked 10 feet away from each other for more than 16 years.
“It was so odd and so amazing,” Aillet said. “She helped me so much.”
Jones only missed a couple of days of work because of radiation therapy and procedures during her treatment, she said. Most days she went to the Pennington radiology clinic in Baton Rouge for treatments on her lunch break, she said.
Jones recalled the seemingly endless days of doctor appointments, tests and procedures.
“Those were my darkest days,” she said.
Those dark days are what make her so eager to lend a listening ear or ask what she can do to help, she said.
“When people ask if they can help, say ‘Yes,'” Jones said.
Jones remained by Aillet's side throughout her treatment. Having a friend to go through it with her made all of the difference in the world, Aillet said. When she didn't know what questions to ask at doctor appointments, Jones did.
“I always tell people, ‘If ever you do have to go through it, find someone that has gone through it and reach out to them,” Aillet said. “Have someone hold your hand and talk to someone.”
Jones not only accompanied Aillet on doctors visits and provided a hand to hold, she helped Aillet receive more accurate and less painful treatment.
Jones' doctors asked her to consider participating in a clinical trial at Pennington Biomedical Center. Jones didn't even hesitate to say yes. She was one of 10,000 participants in the Oncotype DX test clinical trial.
Three years later, when Aillet was diagnosed, she benefitted from the same clinical trial.
Now, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer test is standard procedure.
Oncotype DX is a genomic test that predicts a breast cancer patients' response to chemotherapy.
Test results tell doctors the likelihood of a patient benefiting from chemotherapy and help doctors and patients determine the most appropriate treatment option.
Chemotherapy would not have changed Jones' results, she said, which she found out by participating in the clinical trial.
Without the Oncotype DX clinical trial results, Jones and Aillet both would have gone ahead with chemotherapy that would have had little to no effect different from radiation.
Instead of starting chemotherapy, Jones had her med port removed and surprised friends and family with the good news.
“I never would have imagined that it would help someone I know,” Jones said.
Jones and Aillet participate in Relay for Life and help spread awareness with Baton Rouge General, where both received treatment. What started out as sharing their stories and experiences has turned into much more than either of them expected.
“Now I'm on billboards,” Jones said laughing.
Both Jones and Aillet reiterate the importance of annual mammograms.
“In one year and one day I went from not having anything to having a 1.9-cm tumor that had already infiltrated the duct wall,” Aillet said.
Early detection means more treatment options and is something Aillet and Jones are more than happy to get on their soapbox about.
Neither Jones nor Aillet are involved with breast cancer organizations. Instead they have friends of friends that reach out to them for advice and help.
“I always open myself up to them, if you have questions please ask me,” Aillet said. “I'll tell you anything, I'll show you my scar, I don't care.”

Popular Globacom-sponsored TV situation comedy, Professor Johnbull, has again shown its commitment to the propagation of excellent family values in a new episode which airs on Tuesday.
Titled Married to the Family, the drama enumerates African values and peculiarities of the institution of marriage which goes beyond the two individuals involved, extending to the families of the couple.
Globacom said: "The tensions in many homes today are caused by the African man's concept of marriage and its requirements. Africa's world view about marriage is no doubt fantastic. However, there are some inherent excesses in the world and these excesses are, to a greater extent, inimical to the peace in many homes. The roles of in-laws in making or marring homes cannot be wished away. This is why every individual desirous of a tension-free home should book a date with Married to the Family."
According to the company, "what the institution of marriage is and how to avoid making 'our wife syndrome' become a slave reality", is what the new episode espouses .
Professor Johnbull, acted by the Nollywood veteran, Kanayo O. Kanayo, presents an opportunity to define a healthy marriage while making a case against in-laws' interference in the marriages of his neighbours.
Featuring Nollywood star, Kenneth Okonkwo (Chijioke in the episode), the episode showcases the other regulars including Olaniyi (Yomi Fash-Lanso) and Etuk (Imeh Bishop).
A senior North Korean official made a rare visit to the United States on Wednesday for talks about a possible summit between the leaders of the two countries but the sides appeared far apart on the central issue of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons.
Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy airport on a flight from Beijing. He was later seen entering a hotel in midtown Manhattan.
WATCH: North Korean envoy arrives in New York for talks
Kim Yong Chol is due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss whether to go ahead with an unprecedented meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim.
The summit, originally planned for June 12 in Singapore, has been cast in doubt as the two countries – which have technically been at war since the 1950s – test each other's diplomatic mettle.
Trump last week called off the summit after North Korea expressed anger at comments by senior U.S. officials. But Trump later said he was reconsidering his position and U.S., North Korean and South Korean officials have gone ahead with summit preparations anyway.

The White House said on Wednesday that negotiations at the demilitarized zone along the border between North and South Korea for the summit were going well and that it expects the historic meeting to take place on June 12.
Separately on Wednesday at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Admiral Harry Harris, the outgoing head of U.S. Pacific Command who is Trump's pick to be the ambassador to South Korea, said North Korea remained the United States' most imminent threat. “And a nuclear-capable North Korea with missiles that can reach the United States is unacceptable,” Harris said.
A U.S. official said negotiations about the summit's agenda have so far been slow going, and the two fundamental issues, the definition of North Korean denuclearization and whether both sides would take actions at the same time or separately, remained unsettled.
‘DENUCLEARIZATION'
Trump has sworn not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States and wants North Korea to “denuclearize,” or get rid of its nuclear arms.
But the leadership in Pyongyang is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming.
The U.S. official said the U.S. position remained that North Korea must agree to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization before it can receive any financial assistance, such as relaxation of some economic sanctions, new food or other aid, or new investment, and that the degree of assistance would depend on the pace and extent of Pyongyang's actions.
North Korea's position going into the meetings with Pompeo in New York, meanwhile, was that a pledge of denuclearization alone should open the way to economic relief, said the official, who is familiar with the talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon as saying in a speech on Wednesday that the differences between North Korea and the United States on the denuclearization issue remained “quite significant” and it would not be easy to narrow the gap.
However, Cho added that the engagement of the leaders of the two countries meant “chances are high that common ground can be found.”
Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean official to meet top officials for talks in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a vice marshal, met then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000.
A former military spy chief, he has played a central role in the thaw in relations over the past six months between North Korea and South Korea, as well as the United States.
During his tenure as a senior intelligence official, Kim was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010. He was linked by U.S intelligence to a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014.
North Korea denied any involvement in the attack on the ship and on Sony Pictures.
North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against what it sees as U.S. ambitions to overthrow its leadership and unite the Korean Peninsula. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.

Two civil rights groups want an end to the surveillance of Black activists, including those associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as for an end to the FBI's silence on a mysterious “Race paper.”
Several heavily redacted federal documents — released through Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Color of Change and the Center for Constitutional Rights — detail extensive surveillance efforts by the FBI. One report reveals that the agency sent informants to track an activist during the 2014 BLM protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown‘s death. Federal agents also surveilled the homes and cars of people connected to the protests, according to the November 2014 emails and intelligence reports obtained by the civil rights groups and later provided to The Intercept.
Reportedly, the documents describe federal efforts to keep watch of activists of color that went beyond online intelligence gathering, including social media monitoring of protesters' activities.
Also released as a result of the lawsuit were several Departments of Homeland Security emails, which mentioned the existence of a document described as the “Race paper,” the subject of another lawsuit filed by the civil groups Monday. The paper may refer to a “framework for evaluating the alleged radicalization of black activists,” lawyers in the case said.
FBI tracked a Black Lives Matter activist as they travelled across the U.S., documents show https://t.co/6IMi3hXPrU by @georgejoseph94 @mazmhussain — The Intercept (@theintercept) March 19, 2018
“In the absence of an open review, we are left with the disturbing possibility that DHS is using an unsound, racialized framework to surveil protected speech and activism,” Omar Farah, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told The Intercept. “If that's right, that is something the public desperately needs to know about.”
The federal documents don't directly mention Black Lives Matter, but they were released by the government as part of a request specifically about the movement, which has prompted federal surveillance and policing like other past movements for Black lives.
“What we have learned from history is that policies aimed at surveilling and harassing social movements among black people in the United States have never really ended.” https://t.co/QpgYurNRDU — The Intercept (@theintercept) March 19, 2018
The FBI denied that it surveilled people on the “basis of exercising their First Amendment rights” to The Intercept.
Documents in the case were also released after an FBI report on “Black Identity Extremist” groups came out last year. The Congressional Black Caucus criticized the report for wrongfully grouping together black groups into “one movement threatening law enforcement and public safety.”
Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, said he hopes the “war with Black activists” will end.

Detroit Heritage River Water Trail
The Detroit Heritage River Water Trail serves up a Great Lake, freighters as long as football fields, international waters, the only international wildlife refuge in North America, and the wildlife to go along with it.
Mary Bohling, MSU Extension educator with Michigan Sea Grant, said, “One of the things I really think is great about the water trail is you can be paddling in downtown Detroit with skyscrapers on one side and thousand-foot long ships on the other. You'll see beavers and bald eagles on other sections of the river. At the southern end of the river, it's like you're up north. The trail's both urban and wild. It's pretty incredible that you can have all that in a two-day paddle. You can also paddle with the U.S. on one side and Canada on the other side as it's an international waterway.”
There's also a bounty of launching sites.
Bohling said, “We have other 30 different access points. We're adding to that every year. We have a couple that are ADA accessible. A couple have rollers and one is electric, which lowers you into the water while you're in your boat, and we are adding to those too.”
The myriad launching sites let you find a section appropriate for your skills.
Tiffany VanDeHey, owner of Riverside Kayak, said: “There's a lot of variation. You can tour at different skill levels. The lower section where it empties into Lake Erie is easy paddling with lots of backwaters. Downtown is more advanced. Everywhere, there are of a lot of historical aspects.”
Riverside Kayak offers tours and rents boats too.
“We do tours up and down the river and are doing rentals on Belle Isle, which just became a state park.”

TORONTO – WestJet says it is reviewing its baggage policy after a customer complained that it discriminated against travellers from certain countries.
The airline currently has a policy that prevents travellers to Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago from checking in more than two bags, unless the extra luggage is “a golf bag containing golf clubs.”
Jared Walker tweeted about the policy after his 62-year-old mother was prevented from bringing an oversized bag on a trip to Jamaica to attend a funeral.
Walker, 30, said the policy is “absurd” and shows preferential treatment to tourists, as opposed to travellers returning to their country of origin.

WestJet told The Canadian Press in a statement that the baggage policy was in place for Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago “due to the amount of excess checked baggage brought by guests travelling to these particular destinations.”
The company said it's reviewing the aspect of the baggage policy related to golf bags, recognizing “the optics are poor.”
It further said that travellers who want to bring more than two bags to Jamaica or Trinidad and Tobago can do so through WestJet Cargo, its air shipping service.
The airline said it apologized to Walker and reached out to him in an attempt to resolve the issue. “It was never our intention to be discriminatory in this specific baggage policy,” said Lauren Stewart, a spokeswoman for WestJet.
Walker said he received an apology and other messages from the company Wednesday afternoon but it was too late to help his mother, who was already in Jamaica.

He said he booked tickets for his mother, Nellrene Walker, so she could attend her sister's funeral in Jamaica. After paying for the tickets, he saw WestJet's baggage policy, and called customer service, he said.
“They let me know that no exceptions were allowed,” said Jared Walker, who wanted to pay for his mother to bring a third oversized bag.
“It seems really ridiculous that this policy…only applies to two countries which happens to be tourist destinations, and that there's a golf club exemption.”
In immigrant communities, it's common to take goods back to their country of origin, especially when a family member has died, he said.
His mother is originally from Jamaica, and Walker was born in the United States after she moved to Florida. They both came to Canada in 1995.
WATCH: It wasn't bad weather that caused a flight delay of more than two days. It was a mechanical problem that held up a WestJet flight to Toronto from London until Monday evening.
He said when he originally asked why golf clubs are allowed, WestJet told him it was due to “weight distribution” and “baggage trends”.
Walker tweeted about the policy Tuesday night and said he received a message from the company around 1 a.m. saying it would allow his mother to pay to take the oversized bag.
But he said he saw the messages too late, and his mother flew out Wednesday morning.

Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. (Hadas Parush/Flash90)
In a dramatic press conference Monday, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon announced a sweeping cancellation of all import duties on a wide variety of imported consumer products. Included in the list of products that will be allowed in tax free are: household electronics; refrigerators and washing machines; clothing and textiles; makeup; and many other consumer products. The program will eliminate some NIS 800 million in import duties.
“This reform is important for the pocketbooks of all Israelis,” Kahlon said at the press conference. “We will not cause damage to the economy by intervening, and we will not actively reduce prices. Retailers wanted us to limit online shopping and we refused, but on the other hand we saw that 500,000 Israeli businesses were suffering. We decided to even the playing field. The large majority of imported goods will be exempt from import duties, and there will be a significant slashing of prices for consumers.”
Imported products sold in Israel generally have three tax components – import duty, purchase tax, and Value Added (sales) Tax (VAT). Import duty ranges from 0 percent on products made in countries with which Israel has trade agreements, to as much as 50 percent on large appliances from other countries. Most products imported into Israel are manufactured in China, a country with which Israel does not have a free-trade agreement. For example, many toys, furniture items, shoes, and eyeglass frames and lenses imported from China carry a duty of 12 percent, while larger electronics can carry a duty of up to 30 percent. Kahlon's plan cancels duties on nearly all consumer items across the board.
Kahlon also plans to cancel the purchase tax imposed on nearly all imported products. This tax ranges from 10 percent to over 100 percent of the value of a product. “Purchase tax was imposed originally to encourage Israelis to purchase locally produced goods, but most consumer goods are not produced here,” a Yisrael Hayom report quoted senior Finance Ministry officials as saying. “Thus there is no reason for the purchase tax today.” The report said that Kahlon has worked out arrangements with the heads of Israeli companies that do compete with imports, to provide them with assistance to compete fairly with imports.
According to Ministry projections, elimination of duties and purchase tax will reduce the price of consumer goods on average by 10 percent to 15 percent. More important, the Ministry said, is the fact that Israelis will have the opportunity to buy locally at the same prices they would pay online. The increased local sales will provide more VAT payments for the government, making up the losses from the other taxes. Online purchases are subject to VAT charges as well.
The government took in a total NIS 3.2 billion in import duties in 2016, including the high import taxes imposed on vehicles – which are not being eliminated. The government will “lose” at least NIS 800 million of that amount next year, based on Kahlon's announcement. The reason the government can afford this project is because it has an excess of NIS 20 billion in collected taxes so far in 2017, which, except for funds to pay for a tax break for Israelis earning NIS 11,000 a month, is still available for spending.
Last week, Kahlon canceled import duties on baby products and eyeglasses. Included in the order are baby products such as carriers, baby seats, cribs, swings, walkers, pacifiers, bottles, and other nondisposable items. Also canceled were duties on eyeglass frames and lenses. Many Israeli opticians, like opticians in many countries, ship prescriptions to China, where eyeglasses are made and shipped back from. Duties on sunglasses had been canceled in the past.
Noted Monday was the absence of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the announcement. Netanyahu is in Europe, leading reporters to speculate that Kahlon chose this week specifically to announce his plan, in order to “hog” the political spotlight for himself instead of sharing it with Netanyahu – in order to claim an accomplishment he can use in the next election, when they come. Kahlon, when asked about the timing of the event, simply said that Netanyahu was “up to date on what we are doing, and is fully supportive. This is a government plan we have been working on together,” he said.

Farah rebrands as Mohamed for road career
LONDON - British athletics great Mo Farah wants to be known as 'Mohamed' now that he is switching his focus to road racing, he has announced. "My road name is Mohamed," he said. "I just feel like Mo is done. I need to forget about what I've achieved and what I've done (on the track)." Farah, 34, made the announcement after bringing the curtain down on his glittering track career by winning 10,000 metres gold and 5,000 metres silver at the World Championships in London. Somalia-born Farah has won four Olympic titles and six world titles, but he bowed out under something of a cloud due to doping allegations against his American coach Alberto Salazar. He hit out at the media during an emotional press conference on Sunday, accusing them of trying to "destroy" his achievements.–AFP
Froome leads Sky's assault on Vuelta
LONDON - Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome said he had "unfinished business" with the Vuelta a Espana after Team Sky unveiled their line-up for this year's race on Monday. Froome, 32, hopes to emulate Jacques Anquetil (1963) and Bernard Hinault (1978) by becoming only the third rider to win the Tour and the Vuelta in the same year. A three-time Vuelta runner-up, Froome will be boosted by the presence of key climber Wout Poels, who returns after missing the Tour due to a knee injury. "It certainly feels as if I've got unfinished business with this race," Froome said. "I've finished second three times now, but I've got a good feeling about this year. It feels like we're on much more of a mission this year and aiming for the Tour/Vuelta double has been a huge motivation.”–AFP

Montreal
Denis Shapovalov's fairytale run was ended by in-form star Alexander Zverev, who battled through to the final of the ATP Rogers Cup. Canadian teenager Shapovalov captured the imagination of an entire country, after upstaging top seed and 15-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal as well as Juan Martin del Potro en route to the semi-finals in Montreal. But the 18-year-old was unable to overcome the hurdle of fourth seed Zverev, who prevailed 6-4 7-5 on Saturday.
In a glimpse of the future, 20-year-old Zverev – a four-time winner on the ATP Tour this season – needed three match points to see off Shapovalov and earn a showdown with Roger Federer in a repeat of the Halle decider, which the latter won in straight sets. It was an even contest in the first set, Shapovalov and Zverev going toe-to-toe until the ninth game.
Shapovalov double-faulted as he crumbled for the first time, handing Zverev a 5-4 lead, and the German served out the set. As has so often been the case during the tournament, Shapovalov was not overawed, sticking to his aggressive style, much to the delight of the crowd. And Shapovalov almost struck in the seventh game, but he wasted three break points at 0-40.
Zverev was as cold as ice from that point, though Shapovalov battled, claiming the decisive break for a 6-5 lead to silence the partisan stadium. There was one last rally from Shapovalov, who saved two match points and earned three break point opportunities of his own, though Zverev fended off all of them. Shapovalov sprayed a forehand wide and it gave Zverev a third chance to close out the match and he did. Swiss superstar Roger Federer turned in a precision performance Saturday at the ATP Montreal tennis, using thundering serves and clever backhands to defeat unseeded Robin Haase for a spot in the final.
The 36-year-old Federer blasted nine aces and lost just nine points on his serve as he extended his match win streak to 16—his longest win streak in five years. He raised his game to another level when it mattered most, beating Netherlands Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) in just 75 minutes.
“I'm very excited to be back in the finals,” Federer said. “A bit surprising, to be quite honest, because I hadn't practiced much.”
Federer has taken more time off this year than usual. He skipped the clay-court season from April to mid-June.
“I came from vacation, did some fitness, saw how I was feeling and said, ‘You know what, I practiced so much the last year, let's go play some matches.'—AFP
A routine fishing license check at a dam on the Des Moines River near Fort Dodge led to a chase and the arrest of a man wanted on two warrants.
State Conservation Officer Bill Spece says everything started Friday when he asked 30-year-old David Dayton of Fort Dodge for his fishing license . Spece says Dayton said he did not have a license and it turned into a foot chase and a scuffle to get him into custody. The foot chase started after Dayton gave Spece his brother's name instead of his own.
“The original name and date of birth that I was given, when I ran it is did show that individual had a warrant and that is what I was in the process of acting on,” Spece says. “And I did find out after getting him under control that he was not who he originally said and there were actually two warrants.” Spece says during the chase Dayton swung at him and hit him in the head, and he finally had to pull out his gun to arrest him.
“I did feel that he had intentions of harming me, so I did eventually draw the weapon after he did not listen to any commands to submit,” Spece says. Fort Dodge Police and Webster County deputies arrived to help out. Spece says this is the first time he's run into a situation like this and credits the training officers get for allowing him to handle it.
“Most individuals we deal with are very great people and very happy to see us out there checking licenses and appreciate the fact that we are protecting the resource. Very few people act like they don't want us out there,” according to Spece.
Dayton had two outstanding warrants, including a parole violation and failure to appear. He was charged with interference with official acts with bodily injury for the scuffle with Spece and was charged with fishing without a license. He was also found in possession of an unidentified substance, hypodermic syringes and other drug paraphernalia that will be tested at the DCI lab in Des Moines.Additional charges are pending.
Spece has been a conservation officer for a little more than one year. Prior to that he was an officer with the Eldora and Vinton police departments and the Marshal County Sheriff's office.
Tom Brady has spent the week documenting some highlights from his family trip to Montana, including a truly crazy hail storm and a double rainbow rainbow sighting. However he took his 4th of July Instagram story to the next level when he shot video of his uncomfortably close encounter with a wild bear.
The Patriots quarterback appears to be about 100 feet away from the animal as he quietly but animatedly whispers “it's a bear!” into the camera. You can hear someone else clapping in the background, a known technique for scaring off a bear in case of a run-in such as this one:
(Via @TomBrady Instagram) Anyone who's ever watched too much Animal Planet or the National Geographic Channel knows that an encounter with a bear in the wild can quickly turn deadly, as they are fast and fiercely protective of their young — and Montana is actually one of the few places in the continental U.S. where the formidable grizzly bear can still be found in the wild. It appears that this bear meant them no harm, at least from what we can tell in the video, but you never know. If it had been a mama with her cubs, ole Tom might not have had the chance to whip out his phone — and we all know he isn't exactly great at outrunning his opponents. More Tom Brady!

GM 9-speed automatic transmission Enlarge Photo
After General Motors and Ford committed to co-developing new 9- and 10-speed automatic transmissions, Ford has passed on the former.
Per the agreement, Ford took on work for the 10-speed automatic, used for rear-wheel-drive vehicles, and GM undertook the 9-speed automatic for front-wheel-drive applications. Ford's reason for rejecting GM's transmission? The efficiency gains didn't outweigh the extra weight and cost, Ford spokesman Mike Levine said in a statement to Automotive News on Monday. Strangely enough, Ford apparently decided against using the 9-speed transmission before GM introduced the unit.
Instead, Ford plans to adopt GM's 9-speed automatic for an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 8-speed auto will find its way to a handful of Fords and Lincolns to start such as the 2019 Edge and 2019 Nautilus. Ford plans to rework one of its 6-speed automatics to create an 8-speed automatic for performance-oriented vehicles. Ironically, the 6-speed automatic comes from a previous GM tie-up in 2002.
To Ford's point, the GM vehicles equipped with the 9-speed automatic feature minimal fuel economy gains. In fact, the 2019 Buick Envision, which switched from a 6-speed to the 9-speed, achieves one mile per gallon fewer than before on the highway at 25 mpg versus 26 mpg.
GM believes the 9-speed automatic provides a more seamless shifting experience and more premium feel.
"Smaller steps between gears in a nine- versus an eight-speed enable smoother shifts for customers," GM spokesman Tom Read said.
Although Ford has said "no thanks" to the 9-speed, GM has happily utilized the 10-speed automatic. The transmission is found in the Camaro ZL1 and GM's trucks and SUVs.
New research out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles has found one in three hospitalized patients experiences symptoms including feeling hopeless, having little interest in activities and problems eating and sleeping.
“One thing we notice is when people have down moods, they're actually less likely to take care of themselves,” said Dr. Waguih IsHak, lead author of the study. IsHak says patients with depressive symptoms are less likely to take medication or keep up with outpatient appointments.

“The end result is more frequent emergency department visits because their health deteriorates, and then they tend to stay longer in hospital…later on because their situation becomes a little more complicated.”
Dawn Mendenhall says she's not surprised by the study's findings.
The Calgary woman suffers from diabetes, endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She has experienced lengthy hospital stays on several occasions. Feeling depressed, she says, has impacted her care.
“During my hospital stay, I actually got up and walked out, because I was so upset and so depressed and so angry. I didn't care that I still had an IV in my arm – I just wanted to go home.”
IsHak believes patients would benefit from routine depression screening and treatment.
“We know that depression is a serious factor in any patient's recovery; these findings show that hospitals might experience improved outcomes by initiating a depression-screening program.”
The study is published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine.
LAHORE - Senior leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Chaudhary Muhammad Sarwar has said that alliance of opposition parties against corruption will be manifestation of national desire.

On the occasion, talking to media the PTI chief said that Sharif family owned four palaces in London, everyone knew it from the first day of the case. He added that the properties were amassed through black money.

Khan asked that who is responsible for Lahore's situation where RS 350 billion were spent on development. He demanded the accountability of Shehbaz Sharif over Lahore's situation.
Imran Khan further said that after the water crisis came to the fore, people are worried about the water shortage. “People used to mock us for the Billion Tree project, but now they understand the importance of the project,” he said.
Talking about election campaign, he said that the general election 2018 will be based on ideology as the political parties will have to explain to the voter the ideology behind asking for their votes. Earlier, an election was conducted in 1970 on ideology basis now it will be happened on July 25, he added.

Talks on increasing oil production cuts are largely rhetorical - expert
2017-08-14 18:00 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 14
By Kamila Aliyeva – Trend:
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih's comments about increasing oil production cuts are largely rhetorical, Arthur Berman, petroleum geologist and energy expert, told Trend.
“The Minister is saying that countries participating in the cuts have the ‘capability' and ‘option' to increase the levels. He does not, however, indicate whether there have been any discussions about deeper cuts or that there is even support for such an action,” he said.
Furthermore, expert recalled that, the compliance rate to current cuts for OPEC is only 75 percent and for non-OPEC – only 67 percent, according to IEA.
“Talk of increasing cuts, before showing compliance with existing cuts, will not win market's confidence. I see progress toward market balance, partly as a result of the production cuts, but a show of unity and resolve at this time is important,” he added.
Earlier, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Falih said that OPEC and non-OPEC countries party to the output cut agreement can consider the possibility of increasing the production cut quota, which currently stands at 1.8 million barrels per day.
On May 25, OPEC member countries and non-OPEC parties, Azerbaijan, Kingdom of Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Sultanate of Oman, the Russian Federation, Republic of Sudan, and the Republic of South Sudan agreed to extend the production adjustments for a further period of nine months, effective from July 1, 2017.
Current reductions will be based on the same terms as those agreed upon in November.

Things got so bad that the 90's pop diva appeared to exit the stage in anger after obviously (and badly) lip-syncing two of her most iconic tunes;”Emotions” and “We Belong Together.” Mid-song, a clearly flustered Mariah Carey said of “Emotions” that we're missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is.” In an attempt to save face, Carey then pointed the mic to the audience in an attempt to let the crowd fill in the gaps. “…we're missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is.” [Image by Greg Allen/Invision/AP] Things didn't get any better for the 46-year-old singer. Looking a bit dazed and confused, Mariah muddled through the remainder of the song (a chart-topper fans imagined she'd be able to sing flawlessly in her sleep), halfheartedly interacting with her backup dancers and just generally looking like she wanted the stage to swallow her whole. Decked out first in a sequined nude bodysuit and then in head-to-toe nude sheer shimmer, Mariah Carey attempted to redeem herself by launching into “We Belong Together.” The results were less than stellar. While the New Year's Eve crowd was enthusiastic and singing along to the obviously prerecorded vocals, Mariah Carey still couldn't get it together. “I'm trying to be a good sport here. That was… amazing.” As Fox News reports, while Mariah Carey tried to sing along to a second hit song, she simply couldn't seem to manage it. Alternatively pulling the mic from her mouth and looking mournfully at the crowd full of revelers, Carey was clearly lip-syncing, and poorly. She managed to make it through the song before exiting the stage, clearly flustered and angry with the situation. “It just doesn't get any better.” Even Milli Vanilli is embarrassed by Mariah Carey's debacle. pic.twitter.com/8179cHu7jA — Jimmy Traina (@JimmyTraina) January 1, 2017 It didn't take long for social media to rip the songstress to shreds, mocking her blatant failure, even widely agreeing that “Mariah Carey was drunk” during the performance. The video above became the most viewed on YouTube on New Year's Day as those who missed it tuned in to watch Mariah fall on her metaphorical face. On Sunday, spokeswoman Nicole Perna said that the performance had to be cut short. “Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances.” According to the people working for Mariah Carey, the reason for the painfully poor performance was “technical difficulties.” They claimed that Ms. Carey was dealing with sound equipment and mics that simply weren't working, even going so far as to claim that the equipment had been deliberately sabotaged so that the network could “get Mariah drama.” Mariah Carey's people claim that the biggest source of her New Year's Eve woes was a faulty earpiece, which they claim was reported to the production company before Dick Clark Productions made the decision to “go live anyway.” “She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously. A shame that production set her up to fail.” With 15 minutes left to 2016, you thought you'd seen the worst, then Mariah Carey happened #abcnye — Gloria Fallon (@GloriaFallon123) January 1, 2017 @cnnbrk Mariah should just own up to her horrible performance and move on. Stop with -blaming everybody else. @MariahCarey — Karla M (@TheNFL_Chica2) January 2, 2017 Finally getting around to watching @MariahCarey's performance & Man, only the queen can do a whistle note with her mouth closed! ???????? — DAVID VASQUEZ (@TheRealDav1D) January 2, 2017 Now @MariahCarey is saying that she was sabotaged on her #NYE Performance? Nah, you just blew it. — Greg Granger (@BattleCoachella) January 2, 2017 Mariah Carey's singing is so powerful, it can be heard coming from her mouth when it's not open. https://t.co/PZCdWPfuhw — Female Struggles (@comedyandtruth) January 2, 2017 The Mariah Carey team was reportedly so infuriated by the faulty equipment (and public humiliation) that they sent a written complaint to Dick Clark Productions addressing their allegations. As for Mariah Carey herself, she took her written complaint straight to social media, which was actively ripping her to shreds at the time. Decked out in emojis, the Mariah tweet indicated that she was taking her humiliation in stride and trying to look on the bright side. “S**t happens. Here's to making more headlines in 2017.” While Mariah Carey and her team are blaming Dick Clark Productions for her New Year's Eve disaster, the production company is having none the finger pointing. As Fox News reports, the company issued a statement claiming that the allegations of deliberate sabotage were “absurd.” [Photo by Greg Allen/Invision/AP] “As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists. To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.” Further, an unidentified source “close to the production” claimed that Mariah Carey opted not to do a sound check before going on stage, choosing rather to have a stand-in handle her pre-show rehearsal. That source reportedly stated that the decision of Mariah Carey not to participate in the final rehearsal was “atypical” for a live show, but that at the time of the rehearsal, the equipment appeared to be working fine.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Jacob Zuma faces a no-confidence vote this month, a new attempt to unseat the president by opponents emboldened by splits within his own party.
Zuma, who is battling corruption allegations, is in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party in December by Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president.
The 75-year-old president is expected to meet the ANC's six most powerful officials this weekend, but the agenda of the meeting has not been disclosed. Ramaphosa, 65, has been lobbying the ANC's national executive to force Zuma to resign.
The ANC has said it has discussed Zuma resigning before the end of his term in mid-2019, although his staunch supporters within the party say that will not happen.
Zuma, who has not said whether he will step down voluntarily before his second term as president ends, has been deserted by several prominent allies in the ANC since Ramaphosa took over leadership of what is the only party to govern South Africa since the end of apartheid.
On Friday, parliament speaker Baleka Mbete agreed to a request from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for a motion of no-confidence, though she refused to hold the vote before the president's state of the nation address on Feb. 8, and scheduled it for Feb. 22.
The rand, which tends to strengthen on signs Zuma could leave office, pared losses on the announcement from parliament.
Investors associate Zuma's tenure with a period of economic decline, with growth slowing to an average of 1.5 percent a year and unemployment up to 28 percent from around 23 percent when he took office in 2009.
Zuma narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in August, when some ANC lawmakers voted with the opposition.
“STATE CAPTURE” INQUIRY
He has survived several no-confidence votes during his rule thanks to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority. Although Zuma retains the support of a faction within the ANC, he no longer holds a top post.
In its letter requesting the vote, the EFF said Zuma was not a suitable head of state as he is likely to be embroiled in a judicial inquiry into state corruption. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing.
“The majority of parliament is going to say that Jacob Zuma will not be the president of South Africa because the biggest sentiment, even in the ANC, is saying that Jacob Zuma cannot continue as president,” EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu told eNCA television.
Zuma agreed to establish the inquiry into “state capture”, a South African term for government corruption, last month.
Another opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had lobbied speaker Mbete to postpone the state of the nation address until Zuma had been removed from office.
On Thursday, Mbete said she was aware of “processes going on, every day and every night” over Zuma's future but he was due to read the state of the nation speech next Thursday as he was still head of state.
Lukhona Mnguni, political analyst at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said Zuma could take his chances and wait for the no-confidence motion rather than decide to resign.
“Zuma might want to take his chances with the motion and see how many ANC members will come to vote with the opposition and those that would still vote to support him,” Mnguni said.
Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo's newest addition, a 10-year-old Amur tiger named Changbai, has completed her quarantine period and is now on exhibit. After arriving on Jan. 12, 2017 from the Philadelphia Zoo, the last three months were devoted to making her familiar with her new home. Once she was comfortable with her surroundings, Chang made her debut at the zoo in April.
Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are very rare, and are critically endangered in the wild. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) statistics, today's tigers are thought to occupy less than 7% of their original range. Threatened by habitat loss and degradation, poaching, tiger-human conflict, and loss of prey, four of nine subspecies have disappeared from the wild just in the past hundred years. Arguably the most endangered big cat remaining in the wild, Amur tiger numbers have dropped to fewer than 500. The future of the Amur tiger has been a major concern of the world's zoos for many years.
Managed by the AZA's Species Survival Plan (SSP), inter-regional transfers are arranged with careful attention to gene diversity in the hope that successful breeding will take place. Chang was sent to Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo as an excellent genetic match to the Zoo's resident male tiger, Petya. Chang can be seen in her new exhibit in the Predator area, near the Café.
“Chang is a beautiful tiger and is getting along very nicely with our Zoo staff, and with Petya,” said Gregg Dancho, zoo director. “We gave her ample time to become comfortable with her new surroundings, and now she's very much at home in her exhibit.”
Visitors will be able to meet Chang from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, in the Predator area near the Cafe.
“The Zoo's breeding program exists to bolster the dwindling number of animals still in the wild,” said Dancho. “It's a real testament to our Zoo's strong reputation for working to protect endangered species and to educate our guests about them. It's an important part of our mission and we're justifiably proud of that.”

About Amur tigers
The Amur, or Siberian tiger, is a rare subspecies of tiger, and the largest cat in the world. Adult male tigers can weigh up to 675 pounds, with females weighing up to 350 pounds. Chang is small for a female Amur tiger, weighing 297 pounds. Similar to people's fingerprints, no two tigers have the same striped pattern. Amur tigers differ from other tigers with fewer, paler stripes, and a mane that helps to keep them warm. They live in southeast Russia as well as small areas of China and North Korea. They live for 10-15 years in the wild, and up to 22 years in captivity.
VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria said on Wednesday it expects Iran to shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group.

The case cast a shadow over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Austria on Wednesday at which both sides discussed issues including salvaging the Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. decision to withdraw and reinstate sanctions on Tehran.
“We expect full clarification in connection with this and I thank you, Mr President, for assuring us that you will support this clarification,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters after meeting Rouhani.
Rouhani did not mention the diplomat in his remarks and the two leaders took no questions.
Austria summoned Iran's ambassador over the case on Monday and said it was stripping the arrested Iranian of his diplomatic status.
Iran on Tuesday reiterated it had nothing to do with the alleged plot and could provide “necessary documentation to clarify the dimensions of this scenario.”
Belgian authorities identified the diplomat as 46-year-old Assadollah A and said he is suspected of having been in contact with two people arrested in Belgium with 500 grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device in their car.
Their alleged target was a rally near Paris last weekend of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) - an umbrella organisation of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi'ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran.
Belgium also issued a European arrest warrant for a man of Iranian origin being held in France suspected of being involved in the alleged plot, a French judicial source said.
U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as former European and Arab ministers attended the NCRI meeting.
The NCRI held a small protest against Rouhani's visit on the edge of the area of central Vienna that police sealed off.
Foreign ministers from the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal - Iran, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss salvaging the accord.
European powers are putting together an economic package aimed at safeguarding the deal by shielding Iran from some of the impact of U.S. sanctions resuming. Rouhani has said Iran will stay in the accord if its interests are preserved.
Rouhani also met the head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is policing the restrictions the deal places on Iran's atomic activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The IAEA said the meeting was “part of the regular high-level dialogue between the IAEA and Iran”.
Rouhani's one-day visit to Austria followed a longer trip that was planned two years ago but which he cancelled at the last minute on unspecified security grounds.

A state board has issued its ruling on a dispute about the property taxes Archer Daniels Midland owed in 2015 on its facilities in Clinton.
Clinton Mayor Mark Vulich says ADM is challenging its property tax assessments for 2016 and 2017 as well. “It will be an ongoing process that each tax year ADM is appealing their taxes and that's o.k.,” Vulich says. “That is their right. Last year they won and this year we won and we'll just see how it goes.”
The mayor says for the 2015 tax year, ADM had asked the state board that hears property tax appeals to lower the taxes it owed the City of Clinton, the Clinton Community School District and Clinton County by about $1.3 million. The state board's decision reduced ADM's 2015 property tax liability by far less, in the range of $75,000 according to the mayor.
“I”m pleased with that,” Vulich says. “They have appeals now scheduled for every tax year since then, so we'll be doing it again for the next couple of years.”
About a thousand people work at ADM facilities in Clinton, making it the area's largest employer. ADM's corn mill in Clinton is one of the world's largest. ADM operates a separate plant in Clinton that produces plastic from corn sugar. ADM's campus in Clinton is so large that about a decade ago the company built its own electric generating plant for the facilities.

China's first overseas military base in the small African country of Djibouti is “probably the first of many” the country intends to build around the world, which could bring its interests into conflict with the U.S., according to American intelligence officials.
“China has the fastest-modernizing military in the world next to the United States,” according to insights provided Thursday by U.S. intelligence officials, who asked not to be identified discussing the information. That will create “new areas of intersection — and potentially conflicting — security interests between China and the United States and other countries abroad,” according to the officials.
The People's Liberation Army announced the establishment of a logistics support base in Djibouti in July, saying it would back up China's military's naval escort, peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in Africa and western Asia as well as military exercises and emergency evacuation.
Emergency crews were called to downtown Vancouver, Wednesday afternoon, where a taxi cab rolled over causing major traffic delays.

Police say the cab was southbound on Howe when it collided with a van pulling out of a parking spot.
The cab flipped on its side, while the van collided with a pickup truck. All drivers stayed on scene.
Police say the taxi had two occupants, with the passenger sustaining minor injuries. None of the drivers were hurt.
Crews took about an hour to clear the scene.
Ronan Male blends in well with the rest of his Grade 1 class, but it's something he did last spring that had him standing out from the crowd on Monday.
The six-year-old received a Citizen Lifesaving Award from Emergency Medical Services for the heroic deed he performed.
“She had the sugars,” Ronan said speaking about his mother. “I was playing on my iPad and I heard her crying. She started knocking over stuff. I tried to give her juice.”
On May 10, his mother Denise, who has diabetes, woke up with low blood sugar and fell out of bed.
The frightened youngster ran to his mother's aid after hearing her collapse.
“I called 911 and asked the desk to bring an ambulance and they came right away,” Ronan said, recounting what happened that day.
He ran to get his mother some juice and called 911 — all the while calmly sharing information with the dispatcher while paramedics arrived.
“I didn't like that her sugars were low,” Ronan said. “I said: ‘My mother needs an ambulance. My mom is diabetic. She has sugars.'”
EMS officials say what he did saved her life.
“He was so in charge of that situation. When we got there, he had done everything for us. It was amazing,” paramedic Dave Artindale said.
When EMS crews arrived to assess Ronan's mom, she was awake. Her son had already given her two juice boxes along with some snacks and had her sitting on the couch.
“He was very calm, he was very patient, he was very kind and understanding of his mom,” 911 dispatcher Monica Grela said. “Ronan didn't cry. I never felt like he was not going to follow direction. He did a great job.”
“He's a very smart little boy who has been taught by his parents what to do in an emergency situation.”
The first grader was recognized before his classmates at St. Angela Catholic School — who heard part of the 911 call dispatcher Grela took that day.
EMS officials shared some important tips about emergency situations.
“Children need to be prepared on a daily basis for emergency situations,” Grela said.
“Children who are capable of calling 911 need to know their address. If they can't remember it, have it written down somewhere that's accessible. They should also know their phone number, so we have a call-back number in case we get disconnected.
“It's also important for children to know they need to stay calm. Calmness is important in emergency situations.”
“He knew right away,” Ronan's mother said.
Denise McCormack added that because of her diabetes, she and her husband had always taught Ronan what to do in an emergency.
“He was very brave. He knew to give a couple of juices and I don't think I was drinking them well and that's when he knew to call 911. He was very smart.”
When it was all over, McCormack said she was so thankful to her son.
“I'm so proud of him. I think I cried for two days after. It was very emotional for me. Now he's always asking me, ‘Are your sugars OK mum? Are you feeling OK mum?' He's wonderful.”

WASHINGTON — Three women who have previously accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment shared their stories on NBC's “Megyn Kelly Today.”
Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey and Rachel Crooks on Monday told of alleged harassment by Trump spanning decades.

The White House called the claims false and “totally disputed in most cases.” It said “the timing and absurdity of these false claims speak volumes.”
One of the accusers, Rachel Crooks, called the White House statement “laughable.”

Crooks said of sexual misconduct: “I think politicians seem to be immune to this.”
Holvey described the pain the women felt after Trump's victory. “We are private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there, to try to show America who this man is, and especially how he views women, for them to say, ‘Meh, we don't care,' it hurt.”

The women, who first shared their stories before the November 2016 election, were holding a press conference later Monday to call for a congressional investigation into Trump's alleged behavior.
They cited the recent revelations of sexual misconduct by prominent men in business, media, and politics, for their decision to speak out publicly against Trump once again.
“The environment's different,” Holvey said. “Let's try again.”

EastEnders viewers were stunned tonight when Max Branning revealed he had married Rainie Cross.
Soap star Tanya Franks made a dramatic return to Albert Square as her character strutted into the E20 club.
Max couldn't have picked a worse wife - as Rainie is his former sister-in-law and a massive drug addict.
But Tanya has promised that her character has cleaned up her act and viewers will soon find out what she's like without relying on substances.
As well as revealing why she decided to return to Walford, the actress has speculated on Rainie and Max's future.
(Image: BBC)
Speaking the marriage to Max, she said: "Nobody in the world wants either one of them, but both of them have to look to at a new pathway.
"It's a bit like a kindred spirit from opposing ends of the scale. Two people that absolutely loathe each other, but actually there's a lot of similarity between the two for different reasons."
Tanya admitted they are both "self-destructive" characters that are always trying to find the next big thing, which seems to be ownership of the car lot this time.
One controversial point in the marriage is that Rainie is Tanya's sister, making her Max's former sister-in-law.
(Image: BBC)
However, Tanya has revealed that they don't speak about their family connection and doesn't see it as a betrayal.
She said: "No they don't talk about it and for Rainie actually, I think a lot of it is in spite of Tanya."
Tanya decided to come back after being sat down by returning producer John Yorke, who revealed Rainie's exciting upcoming journey.
Rainie, who first appeared in August 2007, will return permanently to the soap for the first time in three years.
(Image: BBC)
Tanya's younger sister has caused chaos during her last visits, most famously starting a drunken affair with Phil Mitchell and sleeping with Ian Beale for money.
One audience reaction, she said: "I think when people speak to me personally in the street or something they tend to be really favourable of her in that they enjoy what the antics of the character are going to bring.
"I quite often get the thing of “ooh has she cleaned up”? They want to know is she going to clean up or is she still going to be off the rails.
"I think one side of her they're quite intrigued by and this whole new venture now is a whole new dynamic so it will be interesting for me as well to see how the audience react to this.
On what the future holds, she added: "I would say nobody would imagine what it's like for Rainie and Max to be together so the only way to discover how potentially successful or disastrous this could be is just to view it and find out."

(Adds comments from Lazar, Oettinger, background)
BUDAPEST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Eight Eastern European EU countries agreed on Friday to support an increase in payments by member states in the bloc's next long-term budget, to help fill the hole after net contributor Britain leaves.
Ministers and other representatives of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania met in Budapest with the EU's Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger to discuss issues including the bloc's next budget plan.
The largest source of revenue in the EU's budget is a uniform percentage levied on the gross national income (GNI) of each member country.
The ex-Communist countries of the east are mostly net recipients of EU funds, and worried that a shortfall in the bloc's budget would leave them with less cash.
Oettinger said last month that the next EU budget should increase from around 1 percent of EU output to slightly more than 1.1 percent, to make up for funds the bloc will no longer receive from Britain.
Britain's exit in March next year will deprive Brussels of some 12 billion euros from an annual budget now running around 140 billion euros.
That hole has already prompted a round of sparring between other net contributors in the West, which do not want to make up the shortfall, and the ex-communist Eastern states, which say they should not suffer from cuts in EU subsidies.
“The eight countries agreed with the increasing of the GNI-proportionate payment, which is a major success of the day,” Orban's chief of staff Janos Lazar told a news conference.
“The eight countries opened the opportunity that the payment should increase even up to 1.1 percent (of gross national income).”
“We are encouraging the Commission to have a very ambitious budget because we need new fresh money for new tasks,” he added.
Oettinger reiterated that once Britain leaves the EU certain budgetary cuts will be necessary.
“I am extremely grateful for the eight member states that they were willing to contribute a bit more,” he told the same press conference.

Emotions will be running high for the Bauxite Miners (3-2, 1-1) come Friday when they play host to Mena (3-2, 0-2) for homecoming.
Less than a week after the unexpected death of Head Coach Daryl Patton's wife, Tracey Patton, the team has been forced to keep focus on this week's challenge, despite plenty of distractions.
It is unclear if Patton will be on the sidelines come Friday, but Athletic Director Josh Harrison said his head Miner has not and will not take a leave of absence from the team.
“Coach (Michael) Mattox is serving in a managerial role right now and we will welcome Coach Patton back when he is ready,” Harrison added.
Mena comes to town after dropping back-to-back contests to open 7-4A play, including a narrow 29-28 defeat to Malvern last week.
The Miners stunned the Leopards in Week 4, winning on a last-second TD toss at The Pit.
In Week 5, Bauxite took to the road, holding Ashdown's high-powered offense to only 21 points after the Panthers had averaged nearly 50 points per contest to start the year.
Senior quarterback Carson Cannon leads the Mena offense in 2017 and has completed 30 of 73 attempts for 593 yards and seven scores to one interception this year.
On the ground, Cannon and senior running back Justin Dean have teamed to rush for nearly 1,200 yards and 10 TDs collectively. Between the two, six runs have gone for 100 yards each time.
Dean is a dual threat as well, leading the Bearcats in receiving with 253 yards on 11 catches.
The senior hauled in three catches for 65 yards while rushing for 111 yards on 14 attempts.
As if his offensive attack wasn't plenty for the stat sheet, Dean adds to his totals on defense, leading the team in tackles with 44, most come after the line of scrimmage and in the open field.
Homecoming festivities will begin at 6:15 p.m. at The Pit, following by the football game at 7 p.m.
NEW DELHI (AP) — India's space agency said it successfully launched more than 100 foreign nano satellites into orbit Wednesday aboard a single rocket.
The Indian Space Research Organization said the nano satellites — those weighing less than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) — were sent into orbit from southern India. It said the launching of the 104 satellites was a record, overtaking Russia's feat of sending 37 satellites in a single launch in 2014.
The satellites belong to various companies in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, the Netherlands and Kazakhstan, according to the ISRO.
“All 104 satellites were successfully placed in orbit,” the Press Trust of India news agency quoted ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar as saying. They included an Indian Earth observation satellite.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the “remarkable feat by ISRO is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation.”
India has been striving to become a player in the multibillion-dollar space launch market, and has successfully placed light satellites into orbit in recent years. It hopes to eventually send astronauts into space.
In September 2014, India successfully guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Only the United States, the former Soviet Union and the European Space Agency had been able to previously do that.
Tegan And Sara's fifth album, The Con, turns 10 next month, and to commemorate the occasion, the Canadian duo has announced that they'll do an acoustic tour in the fall to celebrate the album. In a statement, they say that the tour is the first of two projects to coincide with The Con's anniversary, though details about the second one haven't been announced yet. (Back in 2014, they released a deluxe edition of So Jealous when it turned 10, so it's probably something like that.) Check out their statements and the dates on The Con anniversary tour below.
In 2007 we released The Con, forever changing the course of our career and connecting us to so many of you for the first time. To honour the album's 10th anniversary, we will be celebrating with two very special projects this year.
Today we are excited to announce the first project – The Con X: Tour.
This fall we will travel across North America performing special acoustic arrangements of all 14 songs from The Con in order, followed by other T&S classics. Tickets go on sale this Friday at http://teganandsara.com/shows/, and a portion of proceeds from this special tour will benefit the Tegan and Sara Foundation.
As we look back today, the first few records of our career felt like we were navigating winding mountain roads. But with The Con it was obvious we had turned a corner and hit an open stretch of highway – it was our first fully-realized Tegan and Sara record. The album was written about love, death, fear and anxiety, and 10 years later we continue to be amazed by how much it touched people. Much of it hasn't been performed live in nearly a decade so it's with great pleasure that we take these beloved songs back to the stage.
San Diego, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Minneapolis, Detroit, Brooklyn, Boston, Upper Darby, Atlanta and Austin… we'll see you all soon! There will also be more dates announced, and please visit teganandsara.com/shows and teganandsarafoundation.org for all details.

LANSING (AP)  Michigans the largest labor union is endorsing Gretchen Whitmer for governor.
The United Auto Workers, which represents 385,000 active members and retirees in the state, announced the endorsement Monday at its international headquarters in Detroit. Whitmer, a former legislative leader, is among four main Democrats seeking the nomination in Augusts primary election.
She previously won the backing of the Michigan Education Association, the states second-biggest union.
UAW President Dennis Williams says Whitmer is a champion who will protect members safety and jobs while strengthening their schools and communities. In her campaign, she has talked about protesting outside the Capitol when Republicans enacted a right-to-work law in 2012. (Continued below.)

“More than 200 graders will be on duty as of midnight Saturday, and by Sunday evening front-end loaders will be clearing lanes,” Infrastructure Operations director Janet Tecklenborg said.
The city is asking Edmontonians to move their vehicles out of marked seasonal parking zones. If drivers don't, they're at risk of receiving a ticket or having their vehicle towed.
“We know that Edmontonians have places to go, and we rely on their co-operation to keep our city on the move,” Tacklenborg said.

Bahria Town distributes cheques among 512 affectees of Sasta Bazar Fire
ISLAMABAD (PR): Bahria Town, as per its commitment, distributed cheques among 512 affectees of Islamabad fire incident, at a ceremony held on Friday. The guest list included members of Bahria Town Islamabad's management and marketing teams, prominent personalities, members of civil society and media representatives.
On 27th August 2017, a fire erupted in the garments section of Islamabad Sasta Bazaar, which destroyed small stalls causing huge loss to small businessmen. This news saddened Chief Executive Bahria Town who promptly announced a relief amount for the affectees of the mishap. Due to the delay in the preparation of list of affectees on the part of the government, Bahria Town had to face an inevitable delay in distribution of relief cheques among the affectees.
Bahria Town's Brig (r) Tahir Butt distributed the cheques for relief amount among the affectees. The recipients of the cheques thanked Bahria Town for this help. Bahria Town is the safest and the most sought-after luxury lifestyle community in the twin cities.
Bahria Town's zoo, parks, golf courses, restaurants, luxury gym and cineplexes attract hordes of visitors from the two cities. In addition to these facilities, Dastarkhwan and other welfare projects in health and education sectors make Bahria Town the most loved brand name in real estate sector.
Students send inspiring salute to teachers
KARACHI (PR): The students of SMB Fatima Jinnah Govt Girls School paid a warm tribute to teachers across Pakistan by forming a human chain message commemorating Teachers' Day. The gathered students formed the phrase “Salam Ustaad” in Urdu, sending a strong message of recognition and respect to the individuals who work tirelessly to educate the future of the country.
Inspired by a similar human sentence that was recently formed in Manila, Phillipines, over 1000 students of the school got together to organise the human chain message. International Teachers Day is celebrated around the world on October 5 to send a strong message of support to teachers. The occasion also brings opportunities to discuss issues faced by teachers.
In Pakistan, teachers are mostly dedicated professionals who are aware of their shortcomings, and are eager to improve their performance. A study by AlifAilaan shows that in order to improve their effectiveness in the classrooms, teachers require trainings, textbooks of high quality, a curriculum that is based on the learning needs of children, and a language policy that takes into account the cultural and linguistic diversity that constitutes the fabric of Pakistani society.
Pakistani teachers need guidance, mentoring, and safe environment to work in, but perhaps most of all, teachers need to be heard. Inspiring displays of recognition, like the one displayed by the students of SMB Fatima Jinnah Govt Girls School, go a long way in building the confidence of teachers and recognizing the trust parents across the country have in the nation's teachers.

A24 has released the first trailer for The Florida Project, the highly anticipated new film from Tangerine filmmaker Sean Baker. Written by Baker and Chris Bergoch, the film takes place on a stretch of highway just outside of Disney World and follows six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) over the course of a single summer as the two live week-to-week at a budget motel called “The Magic Castle.” Willem Dafoe stars as the motel's manager, who strikes a kinship with Moonee and begins to feel responsible for Halley's well-being.
Tangerine was a crackerjack debut from Baker—a hilarious, moving, gorgeous, and unique comedy shot entirely on an iPhone and featuring characters we rarely see onscreen. The Florida Project debuted at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year to wildly positive reviews, and indeed this trailer showcases a terrific follow-up feature. Baker showed a knack for getting to the root of humanity in each of his Tangerine characters, and focusing on low-income children in Orlando, a city where young ones are surrounded by imagery of “Disney Magic”, seems to be an inspired choice. The awards campaign whispers have already begun for this one, especially with regards to Dafoe's performance, and this trailer confirms The Florida Project is a must-see.
Check out the Florida Project trailer below and click here to ready Greg's review from Cannes. The film also stars Valeria Cotto and opens in theaters on October 6th.
This is a new riding, created in the 2015 to account for the rapid population growth in south Surrey. It stretches from Langley to Mud Bay and south to the US border. Based on returns from the 2013 election — which would have translated to a near 5,000-vote win — this should be a safe seat. BC Liberal Cabinet member Stephanie Cadieux is running in her third Surrey riding in three elections. The area's rapid growth has led to shortages of classroom space in schools, something the Liberals recently tried to address with the announcement of $217 million in school funding.
Candidates
BC Liberals' Stephanie Cadieux currently serves as the Minister of Children and Family Development. Cadieux was first elected in 2009 in Surrey-Panorama. Prior to entering politics, she was the director of marketing and development for the BC Paraplegic Association and the president of Realwheels Society. She is the first wheelchair-bound MLA since Doug Mowat from 1983-1991.
NDP's Jonathan Silveira is a realtor. Silveira has a background in University politics, having served on the CFS, the SFU Student Society and on the SFU Board of Governors. He was involved in negotiations to create the UPASS, the student transit pass. In 2014, he founded “Surrey Kids Matter” and ran unsuccessfully for School Trustee.
Green Party's Pascal Tremblay is the co-founder of “The Good Kind” agency, which his website says, “helps social change organizations and campaigns amplify their impact and outreach efforts.” He is also the founder of an apparel company that has a social justice focus.

Devin Hester, who officially retired with the Chicago Bears on Monday, said he's not happy about the possibility the NFL could soon eliminate one of his fortes -- the kickoff return.
"At the end of the day kickoff and punt return is one of the key aspects of the quality of football," Hester said. "You've got to let these guys play football. It is what it is.
Editor's Picks Future of kickoff to be discussed at NFL summit The future of the kickoff in the NFL will be discussed at a planned summit that is being finalized to discuss player safety.
"You try to find ways to eliminate injuries. But the minute you step on the field you're bound to get hurt somewhere. That's just the nature of the beast. And I think taking that out of the game is big. I don't like to see it happen."
Hester and running back Matt Forte both signed one-day contracts with their original team Monday at Halas Hall so they could retire as Bears, and an emotional ceremony capped careers rich in highlight-reel material for the former second-round draft picks.
For Hester it may mean a spot someday in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
"Every athlete wants to be in the hall of fame," Hester said. "If there's one out there that says they don't really care about it then they're playing the wrong sport."
No other player is in the Hall based solely on returns, but Hester's league record of 20 TD returns could make him a candidate. He had 14 punt return TDs, five on kickoffs and one on a missed field goal.
Not included in those 20 returns is his most well known, because it came during his rookie year and in the postseason -- the 92-yard return for a TD in 2007 on the opening kickoff of Super Bowl 41.
Whether a special teams player should be in the Hall is a question for voters, but Hester pointed out kicker Morten Andersen made it.
"I don't really look at it like, 'Will he make it as [the first] return man?'" Hester told reporters when asked about his chances. "Sometimes you've got to put guys in the Hall of Fame for being the most dangerous person out there on the field."
If Hester eventually gets in, he might be the only returner considered because the number of diagnosed concussions in the NFL last season (291) has the league considering the future of the kickoff. At last month's owners meetings, the league's medical department presented statistics showing that concussions are five times as likely to happen on kickoffs as on an average play, according to Green Bay Packers president Mark Murphy -- who is a member of the competition committee.
The NFL is finalizing plans for a summit to be held May 1-2 at NFL headquarters in New York to discuss player safety, including a focus on the future of the kickoff.
"It's one of the most exciting plays when you're playing this game of football," Hester said. "If I'm the last to be, the one who's the best to be at the return game, that's an honor. But at the same time, I want to see it continue to play out."
Like Hester, Forte is a player whose impact may soon be a rarity. In an age when many teams use multiple backs, Forte retired after 10 years with 14,468 yards from scrimmage, the most by any NFL player during the past decade.
"Going into the NFL, I knew it was a production-based league and consistency is better than peaks and valleys," Forte said. "So I wanted to be the best at all times and be available at all times for my teammates and my team."
Forte's consistency was so great, he managed to finish second only to Walter Payton in franchise rushing with 8,602 yards. After eight Bears seasons and two with the Jets, Forte had 9,796 yards rushing, 4,672 receiving and 75 TDs.
"Given how great Walter Payton was, it just didn't seem right that my name was just right there next to his," Forte said. "It's just kind of surreal to me that my name is right there with him in this organization."
Forte decided to retire after an injury-filled 2017 season with the Jets. He deflected much of the credit for success to teammates on both sides of the ball, and recalled being frustrated going against Hall of Fame inductee Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs and Charles Tillman at his first practice.
"Playing against a defense like that from a young rookie groomed me to know I'd just arrived here and I hadn't made it and I had to work very hard to continue to be very consistent in my production," Forte said.
ESPN's Kevin Seifert and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
LAHORE - The Punjab Food Authority (PFA) on Wednesday seized a huge quantity of substandard ketchup at a factory in Samanabad. The factory was allegedly manufacturing ketchup using chemicals, and without pulp.
The PFA seized 10,000 liters of substandard ketchup at Ajwa Foods' ketchup production unit located in the residential area of Samanabad.
This was the second time in less than 48 hours that such a huge quantity of substandard ketchup was seized. PFA Director (Operations) Rafia Haider said that PFA's vigilance cell raided the factory and found that a mosaic of substandard and fake colours and chemicals was being used in ketchup.
When PFA teams raided the factory, raw material was being shifted in dirty blue drums without any regard for safety standards. The sample test of the seized ketchup was fond unsatisfactory. On the report of the vigilance cell, the factory was traced and sealed.
On Sunday, PFA carried out a raid on a ketchup factory - Punjab Foods Products - and dispose of 8,000 liters of substandard ketchup in Madina Park near Rohi Nullah.

Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded more than a week in a partly flooded cave said they were healthy on a video released Wednesday, as heavy rains forecast for later this week could complicate plans to safely extract them.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
READ MORE: Can a group of boys learns enough about diving to escape a Thai cave? Yes, says one dive master
The video lasting about a minute was recorded sometime Tuesday and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page Wednesday morning. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23. The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown Tuesday in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
WATCH: Boys soccer team found alive in cave in Thailand
In all of the videos the boys have appeared in good spirits. In the most recent videos a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of relatives, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.
Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside, said she had thought it was a 50 per cent chance that her son would be found.
“It's like he has been given a new life,” she said, adding that she'll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they're safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
READ MORE: Rescuing boys soccer team stuck in Thai cave could take months — a look at the risky options
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn't believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be Wednesday.
“If it's risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,” Narongsak said. “It has to be 100 per cent safe.”
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand's rainy season typically lasts through October.
WATCH: How risky is it to bring the boys out by SCUBA diving?
The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation , said in a statement that “although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks considering.”
Gary Mitchell, the group's assistant vice chairman, said getting out of the cave requires about a kilometer (half a mile) of diving total, though not all in one stretch, and takes about three hours.
“There's air pockets along the way,” he said. “It's confined spaces. It's almost zero visibility. There are currents to battle against in places as well. So it's a really quite a strenuous environment to be in,” he said.

A Toronto home where alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur worked and stored his landscaping equipment is being revisited for further evidence and possible human remains, police said Wednesday.
Toronto police said they are continuing their search efforts at a property located on Mallory Crescent in the city's Leaside neighbourhood where the remains of seven men were recovered from large planters earlier this year.
READ MORE: Alleged Toronto serial killer Bruce McArthur had low risk for violence in 2003, psychological report says
Authorities said that between May and June, investigators were able to conduct searches at 100 other properties related to McArthur's landscaping business but nothing was found.
The 66-year-old was arrested in January and charged with murder in the deaths of Andrew Kinsman and Selim Esen, who went missing from Toronto's Gay Village in 2017.

Later that month, he was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, and Dean Lisowick. In February, he was also charged in the death of Skandaraj Navaratnam.
In April, police charged Mcarthur in the death of Abdulbasir Faizi, who was reported missing in 2010, and days later charged McArthur in the death of Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, who came to Canada from Sri Lanka and was not reported missing.

Det. Sgt. Hank Idsinga, the lead investigator in the case, had said earlier this year that the search for further remains at the Mallory Crescent location will continue once the weather warmed up and that cadaver dogs will be deployed for the ground investigation.
Police said they will conduct further excavation of the area and an update on the search will be provided once the operation is complete.

‘American Animals': Playing at cops and robbers
Photo: Courtesy The Orchard Jared Abrahamson (left), Evan Peters, Blake Jenner and Barry...
Producer Robert Evans' quote, “There are three sides to every story: your side, my side and the truth,” is a notion at the heart of British filmmaker Bart Layton's “American Animals.”
The story is based on the 2004 theft of Audubon folios and rare books from the Transylvania University Special Collections Library in Lexington, Ky., by four students. But Layton, who normally makes documentaries, chose to blend documentary and drama in his telling of the tale.
“That came out of the fact that they didn't remember the same things, the same events in the exact same way,” Layton says during a chat in San Francisco, where “American Animals” screened at the SFFilm Festival. “You're left with a choice: Do I choose to fictionalize the one that is the most convenient or do you make a virtue of the fact that you've got lots of unreliable narrators?
“Also, memory is pretty unreliable. I like the idea that it's hard to get a sense of what happened. There is no single truth. … I think all of that presents opportunities for me, as a filmmaker, to kind of shake up the idea of what a true story is. Because we've all seen that ‘based on a true story.'”
Layton was so intrigued that the teenagers — Spencer Reinhard, Warren Lipka, Eric Borsuk and Chas Allen — would attempt such a heist that he reached out to them. At the time, they were serving their prison sentences, but a correspondence began. Layton wasn't sure if there was a movie in their story; the theft itself struck him as slight, but he was impressed by their honesty and curious about what would motivate four young men from privileged backgrounds to throw away their futures in such a flamboyant manner.
“They didn't know who I was, particularly, and they probably didn't have anyone with whom to pour their hearts out,” Layton says. “A lot of the stuff they put in their letters was really surprising and really honest.
“That's probably what made me think I wanted to tell the story, because particularly Spencer, who I ended up making the central character, the sort of audience proxy, he talked about wanting to become an artist and feeling that he was never going to have anything worth making art about, because he was never going to have anything approaching a meaningful life experience. His life (before the theft) was sort of too nice, in a way.”
All four men appear in the film, sharing their memories and observations. Barry Keoghan, Evan Peters, Blake Jenner and Jared Abrahamson play the fictional thieves, youngsters playing at cops-and-robbers, who watch heist movies to learn how to commit crimes. That most of these movies end with their antiheroes jailed or dead never dawns on them. Neither does the idea that real-life crime has real-life stakes.
“I don't think really it was about the crime and the idea that they would get rich from it,” Layton says. “I don't think they ever could imagine they would. I think it was about the fantasy. I think that's what they were seduced by, and I think they just got more and more lost in that fantasy until it got to the point where they'd left reality behind.
“I don't think they thought they'd ever go through with it. I think they thought they would get right up to the precipice and not jump off it. But specially in a gang, no one wants to be the one that calls it off.
“One of them, I think it was Eric, in a letter, talked a lot about ‘Fight Club,' the book, and how that had a huge impact. and talked about how when Warren presented him with this idea, of being part of this thing, for him, it was almost like a kind of version of ‘Fight Club.'
“They had a secret that put them apart from everyone else, made them better than everyone else who were just going about their normal lives. That's, I think, what they fell in love with.”
Layton acknowledges that “American Animals” is packed with ideas and observations about privilege, masculinity, the imprecision of memory, a society where individuals monitor their value by social media clicks and likes and fleeting fame, and more. But all of that is wrapped in the trappings of genre.
“Everyone loves a heist movie,” Layton says. “I think what I always look for in a story for a film is, first and foremost, kind of page turner, but actually it's about something else. It's sort of a heist movie by stealth. You get all the things that you demand from a great heist movie but, hopefully, you come away thinking about something other than, ‘Oh, yeah, it was just a crime, and that's that.'”

Islamabad - The Islamabad High Court is likely to take up Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Usman Dar's petition seeking disqualification of Federal Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif for concealing his Iqama in the coming week.
The PTI leader has sought disqualification of the federal minister for foreign affairs on the grounds that Khawaja Asif had concealed the facts that he was an Iqama holder, legal advisor of a company in the UAE and his recent labour card was issued on June 29, 2017.
Petitioner Muhammad Usman Dar has moved the petition through his counsel Sikandar Bashir Advocate and nominated Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and secretary National Assembly as respondents.
Dar stated that he was a candidate for the national assembly seat in 2013 general elections from NA-110 Sialkot on the ticket of PTI.
Petitioner's counsel mentioned in the petition that on the basis of information and facts that have recently become known to the petitioner and the documents bearing signatures and photographs of the Respondent No. 1 available with him, he considered it his national duty and lawful obligation to institute a petition under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) against the Respondent No. 1 as, it is submitted, he is not entitled to hold the office of MNA nor that of Federal Minister as he is disqualified under the Constitution.
Therefore, Dar requested the court to initiate quo-warranto inquisitorial proceedings in this regard requiring the respondent to explain that under what authority of law he is holding public office.
In his petition, Usman said that Khawaja Asif is full time employee of an Abu Dhabi-based company Int. Mech & Elec Co. LLC (IMECL) and continuously employed since July 2, 2011.
The petitioner has attached some documents with the petition on the basis of which he claimed that Khawaja Asif remained full time salaried employee of the company on various positions including ‘Legal Advisor' and ‘Special Advisor'.
The petitioner said that against his employment, Asif was entitled to receive 35,000/- UAE Dirham as salary and 15,000 AED as monthly allowances that is being received and currently receivable being an MNA as well as foreign minister of the country.
He contended that Asif never disclosed this source of income in Pakistan consequently he is no more ‘Sadiq' and ‘Ameen'. Before his recent employment Asif had also been an ‘Iqama' holder previously from May 9, 2007 till May 8, 2010. UAE ministry of labour also issued ‘Labour Card' to Asif on June 29, 2017 whose validity is till June 28, 2019. In his nomination papers for 2013 general elections, Asif mentioned his occupation as a businessman while the employment contract reveals another story, the petition said.
He argued that the respondent intentionally concealed this information from the public, from the federal board of revenue (FBR) in his tax returns and in violation of Representation of People Act (ROPA) 1976.
The petitioner said that Khawaja has disclosed in his wealth statement an amount of Rs-6820964/- as foreign remittance but that cannot be related as Asif did not mention this amount as salary.
Therefore, the PTI leader prayed to the court to disqualify Khawaja Asif being Member of National Assembly under article 62 and ROPA 1976.
Have you ever found yourself pre-occupied with financial worries? You're chasing a deadline at work, but at the back of your mind is the worry about missing your credit card payment deadline.

The meaning of financial freedom
You are free from financial worries when you define your goals and systematically invest to achieve them. You are also stress free when you buy adequate life and health insurance and also insure important assets like your house. In order to be completely stress free, you need to engage with financial products more. Don't just buy what is sold, make sure you understand the product you buy so that you can't be missold a product.

At least one person was killed and 30 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia when white nationalists protesting plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general clashed with counter-demonstrators and a car plowed into a crowd.
SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Despite other players around the NFL continuing to protest racial inequality and the racially-charged events taking place in Charlottesville, Virginia., over the weekend, San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid still does not intend to resume kneeling during the national anthem this season.
Reid explained why after the Niners' Monday afternoon practice.
"I think for me, the anthem thing went so sideways, it kills me that it went the way it went because that's not how we intended it to be," Reid said. "You guys know what we were trying to get accomplished with that but I think for me personally, (I'll) just keep talking about it, whether that's social media or you guys talking to me or whatever events I can make it out to during the season just to keep raising awareness on different topics to hopefully make that change that we're talking about."
Reid was the first player to join quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his protest during the national anthem last preseason. He first knelt next to Kaepernick before the team's final preseason game against the San Diego Chargers. Reid and linebacker Eli Harold joined Kaepernick in kneeling for the rest of the season.

Raiders' Lynch remains seated during anthem Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem prior to the team's preseason opener against the Cardinals.
Season ends for 49ers' Reid with torn biceps San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid suffered a torn biceps in his right arm on Sunday against the Patriots, an injury that will require season-ending surgery with six games to go in the season. 2 Related
Throughout the year, Reid said he hoped the protest would spark conversations that would lead to change at the highest levels of politics. After the season, Reid said he believed those conversations had started and he intended to stand for the national anthem during the 2017 season. Reid and the rest of the Niners stood for the "Star Spangled Banner" before the team's preseason opener against the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday night.
Reid has also kept in touch with Kaepernick, going so far as to attend Kaepernick's "Know Your Rights" camps in Chicago and New York City in the offseason. One of the topics the pair discusses is when and where Kaepernick will get back in the league.
Kaepernick opted out of the final year of his contract with the Niners before they were set to release him and he has yet to sign with another team. Only the Seattle Seahawks have even had him in for a visit.
Reid has paid close attention to Kaepernick's job pursuits and takes umbrage with the idea that Kaepernick needs to speak out to get a chance.
"I think that's ridiculous," Reid said. "What does he need to say to prove that he wants to be in the NFL? He's training every day. He's been to the Super Bowl. He has the tape. What is coming out and saying 'I want to play in the NFL' do? It's obvious. I think it's just a diversion, along with all the other false narratives that are out there about him. It's just something to deflect away from why he's not (in the league). They're trying to put the blame on him for not being in the NFL."
Based on the support Reid saw Kaepernick receive during their time together in Chicago and New York, he said he could see signing Kaepernick as a net positive for a team.
"I would say that their bottom line would go higher with him on the team," Reid said. "His jersey sales were No. 1 in the league last year during the protest so I think that speaks for itself."
Reid and Kaepernick chatted on Sunday about what was taking place in Charlottesville and, according to Reid, reached a familiar conclusion.
"I think it's becoming more apparent for people to see the issues that we're talking about, especially in the way it happened in Charlottesville," Reid said. "We're just hopeful that if we keep talking about it, we don't let it go away because a lot of people just want things to blow over like 'Oh, that's an isolated incident.' But it happens every day. If we keep talking about it, hopefully we can make this change. It needs to stop being hopefully. It needs to happen. It needs to happen now."
U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified officials.
Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Former FBI Director James Comey told Congress last week he believes he was fired by Trump to undermine the agency's Russia probe.
The Washington Post, citing five people briefed on the requests who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, and Richard Ledgett, the former deputy director at the NSA, had agreed to be interviewed by Mueller's investigators as early as this week.
The obstruction of justice investigation into Trump began days after Comey was fired on May 9, according to people familiar with the matter, the Washington Post said.
Trump's legal team quickly denounced the report on Wednesday.
"The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal," a spokesman for Trump's legal team, Mark Corallo, said.
A spokesman for Mueller's team declined to comment.
Several legal experts told Reuters that Comey's testimony last week that Trump expected loyalty and told Comey he hoped he could drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against Trump.
Comey would not say in his testimony last week whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Mueller "to sort that out."
After Comey's testimony, Trump said he had been vindicated because his former FBI director confirmed telling Trump on three occasions that he was not under investigation.
While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.
Chargers offensive tackle Joe Barksdale almost took his own life in 2017 due to an ongoing battle with chronic depression.
“Just kill yourself. Just do it. What's the point of living if you're going to be this miserable the rest of your life? Just kill yourself,” were the thoughts that raced through Barksdale's mind in November 2017 as he was sharpening a knife to commit suicide, according to the Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike.
Barksdale disclosed to Woike that he was molested as a child and that he shared his struggles with quarterback Philip Rivers this season at one point. The QB was highly supportive, but Rivers and two other teammates that Barksdale confided in all told him that they would keep the information between them.
That was actually the opposite of what Barksdale wanted.
“This goes to show you the stigma in the league. All three of them told me, ‘Hey, don't worry. This is between us. I won't tell anybody.' My thing was, I'm telling you so that you can tell other people . . . If I could save another person, maybe that's why the attempts [to harm himself] didn't work,” Barksdale said, per Woike. “They're like tattoos,” Barksdale said of the painful encounters he had which included being molested, picked on and feeling as if he couldn't find any way to overcome his depression. “No one had any answers for me,” Barksdale said, per Woike. “They wanted to help. But they couldn't. At the end of the day, I still felt … fear, shame, guilt, denial, and anxiety.” Barksdale was able to persevere by using music as an outlet and with the support of his wife, Brionna, and has now released his debut album “Butterflies, Rainbows & Moonbeams.” However, his depression still represents a daily battle for the 29-year-old tackle.
“Some days, you can talk yourself out of it. Some days, you can't. Some days, it just feels impossible,” Barksdale said, per Woike. “This is who I am. I am as depressed as I am black.”
The NFL has several services in place for players dealing with the types of issues Barksdale faces, including NFL lifeline, a 24-hour crisis hotline available to current and former players and their families.
Science and technology have a profound impact on everyone's life, but the dense jargon experts use to talk about them make it hard for laypeople to get a grip on these fields. Now a new tool that automatically identifies jargon could help scientists get their point across more effectively.
The “De-jargonizer” is the brainchild of Ayelet Baram-Tsabari, an associate professor at the Israel Institute of Technology, working on science education and communication. Before moving into academia she worked as a journalist, where she wrote about science.
She says she received frequent complaints from scientists about how science was poorly represented in the media, blaming it on unprofessional journalists, the ignorant general public and a failing education system.
“But there was only one community that did not need to change anything—the scientists themselves,” she told Singularity Hub by email. “They did everything perfectly. And I remember thinking that the only group scientists can directly influence is themselves, and they could use a little help.”
The researchers were keen to note that scientists are not willfully making their language indecipherable; they simply suffer from the so-called “curse of knowledge.” After spending years studying a topic, it's hard to remember what you didn't know before you became an expert, which makes it hard to judge what terms are going to pose stumbling blocks for a general audience.
So her group set to work creating a free online tool to automatically identify the technical language that alienates outsiders from discussions about science and technology with the hope that experts use it to adapt their articles, blogs, and speeches to be more accessible.
To build it the group hoovered up more than 90 million words from the roughly 250,000 articles published on the BBC's website between 2012 and 2015. These words were then classified based on how frequently they were used, and this analysis was then used to build the online tool.
When a text is uploaded or pasted into the online tool, an algorithm color-codes words using black to denote commonly used words, orange for intermediate difficulty words, and red for jargon.
Being based on a statistical analysis, the system's classification is not always perfect, but the researchers say the corpus will be updated periodically, and they hope to make it possible for users to flag errors in classification to help fine-tune the system.
Baram-Tsabari says the system should also be translatable to any language that has a significant amount of written online content so it can establish word frequencies. She says they are testing the approach on Hebrew at the moment, and it seems to work well so far.
In a paper in the journal PLOS ONE last week, the researchers tested the De-jargonizer on 5,000 pairs of academic paper abstracts and their corresponding lay summaries, which are aimed at a wider audience.
They found the lay summaries did include less jargon than the abstracts—10 percent compared to 14 percent. But previous research has found that readers need to be familiar with 98 percent of the words for them to adequately comprehend the material.
That means that even when scientists try and adapt their writing for non-experts, much of it will still be going above people's heads. Baram-Tsabari hopes the De-jargonizer can help scientists bring those figures down.
“I believe it is our duty as well as interest to make our work, mainly funded by taxpayer money, accessible to members of society,” she says. “I want to see evidenced-based public discourse, and it's hard to use evidence if the experts don't do their share of communicating clearly.”

ROME (Reuters) - A low, “flat tax” rate for individuals and businesses alike can invigorate Italy's economy, reduce tax evasion and strengthen public finances, a close ally of Silvio Berlusconi and possible future economy minister told Reuters.
Renato Brunetta, leader of Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party in the lower house of parliament, said a flat tax would be the centre-piece of the campaign by the centre-right alliance, which is expected to win the most seats in a March 4 election.
“It will be an epoch-making, revolutionary reform and our decisive weapon in the election campaign,” said Brunetta, a former economics professor at Rome's Tor Vergata University and one of Berlusconi's closest collaborators for the last 20 years.
The centre-right bloc made up of Forza Italia, the anti-immigrant Northern League and the far-right Brothers of Italy will win the election but probably fall short of a working majority, opinion polls suggest.
Brunetta is proposing a single income and corporate tax rate of about 23 percent. It would replace staggered income taxes going from 23 percent to 43 percent, the main corporate tax rate of 24 percent as well as unpopular regional taxes on business revenue of around 4 percent.
The former public administration minister said in an interview with Reuters that the tax measures would cost state coffers some 50 billion euros ($62.4 billion).
The Northern League wants the flat tax rate set at 15 percent, and the two parties have yet to settle on a compromise.
Numerous countries have experimented with a flat tax to stimulate growth. The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania introduced the system in the mid-1990s and Russia followed suit several years later.
Italy has been the euro zone's most sluggish economy since the start of monetary union in 1999. Gross domestic product grew around 1.5 percent last year, its strongest rate since 2010 but still weaker than most of Italy's European partners.
Italy's unemployment rates stands at 10.8 percent, two points above the euro zone average.
‘FULLY FUNDED'
Brunetta said the money to fund his proposal would come from scrapping a plethora of tax breaks and incentives for families and firms which he said amounted to 175 billion euros.
The flat tax is not the only costly proposal in the centre-right's election platform of tax cuts and extra spending which Roberto Perotti, an economist at Milan's Bocconi University, estimated would cost up to 150 billion euros per year overall.
Other measures include increasing pensions and scrapping inheritance and capital gains tax, and road tax on most cars.
Brunetta said all the measures were fully funded, partly because the flat tax would generate a virtuous cycle in which people and companies would no longer feel the need to evade high taxes. He said this in turn would lead to companies investing, employment rising, higher economic growth and more tax revenue.

“It's a win-win strategy where tax-payers, state coffers and the Italian economy all benefit,” said Brunetta.
The flat tax has been proposed by four-time prime minister Berlusconi ever since his first government in 1994, but he has never managed to enact it. Brunetta said previous attempts had made the mistake of trying to reform the tax system gradually, whereas what was needed was a “one-shot” approach.
The flat tax would be passed in the centre-right's first budget, he said, along with a pension overhaul to replace unpopular 2011 reforms that raised the retirement age and helped calm markets at the peak of the euro zone debt crisis.
That reform gradually raised the pension age for women to 65 in 2018 from 60 in 2011, bringing it more into line with the rules for men, and prescribed regular increases for both men and women thereafter, based on updated estimates of life expectancy.
The new “fully sustainable” system, would be based on the broad principle that people can retire when they want, and get a pension based entirely on the contributions they have paid in.
NO 5-STAR TALKS
Brunetta, 67, who is known for his combative personality and prodigious energy, made no secret of his ambition to be economy minister if the centre-right bloc wins the election.
“I have seen plenty of worse ones and I think I have the political and academic qualifications required,” he said. “Of course everyone has their aspirations and it's something we will all decide together.”
Brunetta made light of the frequent friction between Forza Italia, which presents itself as a moderate, pro-European force, and the Northern League, which wants an end to budget restraint and sees Italy eventually leaving the euro zone.
He said tensions were a “completely natural” result of the largely proportional electoral system which meant the parties were competing within the coalition as well as being allies.
Berlusconi, who is barred from public office following a 2013 tax fraud conviction, has not yet said who Forza Italia's candidate for prime minister will be, and Brunetta said he was unlikely to do so before the election.
He said if the March 4 vote produced a hung parliament the most likely solution would be a rapid return to the polls.
He flatly rejected a call by the leader of the 5-Star Movement, which polls say is the most popular single party, for the other parties to back a 5-Star government based on jointly negotiated and agreed policies.
5-Star's and Forza Italia's election platforms have several points in common but Brunetta said the anti-establishment movement's aggressive attacks on its mainstream rivals meant he would “not even sit down to talk” with them about policy.
“They are insulting, destructive, violent and anti-political,” he said.

Back in 2015, Denver outfits The Yawpers brought their blues rock sounds to Bloodshot Records with their label debut, American Man. The trio is now back with their follow-up, Boy in a Well, set for release this Friday, August 18th.
Produced by The Replacements' Tommy Stinson (who also plays on the album) and Alex Hall (JD McPherson, Pokey LaFarge), Boy in a Well is a concept record about just what its title suggests. Set in WWI-era France, the story follows a mother who abandons her child down a well, where he grows up alone and afraid. The complex and ambitious tale is told both through 12 muscular, unpredictable rockabilly tracks and an accompanying comic book by the Legendary Shack Shakers' J.D. Wilkes.
“I wanted to write a melodramatic tragedy, but one so tragic that it has kind of a necessary levity,” says frontman Nate Cook, who wrote the record in the wake of his failed marriage. “Musically, the intention was to make a biting, frenetic, punk fueled record that sounded like it was recorded in the '50s. Nodding to the past, present, and future. Emphasis during recording was placed almost solely on the spirit of the take and or song, often sacrificing polish for authenticity.”
Pre-orders are available here, but you can listen to the entirety of Boy in a Well ahead of its official release below.

In addition to sharing the new album with Consequence of Sound, the band has provided an exclusive track-by-track breakdown of the entire thing. Below, Cook takes us through the record's theme and creation, while drummer Noah Shomberg digs into the songs' structure and dynamics. Read on to get the gritty details of Boy in a Well.
“Armistice Day”:
Nate Cook (vocals, guitar): As the first song of a record that's both historical and narrative, the writing on this one proved maybe the most difficult. Sonically, we all tried to maintain a very muted, fogging opening, and then midway tear through to something more immediate. On the narrative side, this is the song where the eponymous character is conceived by a young French girl and a soldier returning from the front lines. Instead of hope, I tried to set up a life that is entirely perverted by and beholden to the past.
Noah Shomberg (drums, vocals): One of the main musical themes Jesse [Parmet, guitars/vocals] and I attempted to address with BIAW was to create intensity without using large dynamic shifts as a tool. However, sometimes you just have to smash. The song starts out nebulous in groove and slowly builds intensity via rhythmic shifts. The purpose of the drums and guitar here is solely to create a bed for the vocals to rest on. The song builds progressively throughout the third verse but not necessarily in volume until the last vocal melody refrain.
“A Decision is Made”:
NC: Obviously a more rockabilly tune, and necessarily. We needed to forward the narrative substantially here, so there's quite a bit of exposition and explanation. Rockabilly lends itself to wordier songs, and so I was able to cram a pregnancy, parental abuse, a birth, and a messianic complex into three minutes.
NS: Straight up rocker. I tried to re-imagine the “rockabilly” shuffle on the drum kit and explore different ways of phrasing it. Where can I place accents to help build tension and build intensity through the verses?
“A Visitor is Welcomed”:
NC: The girl who threw our titular character down a well has dealt with the trauma through delusion. She believes her child is the second coming of Christ, and brings offerings of food, gifts, etc to the monster that is growing underneath.
NS: The groove on this song was inspired by a few late nights watching Ken Burns' documentary on Jazz. We wanted to use a groove that sounded like the “Big Four” as a nod to our musical heritage. It's a groove that originated from drummers in second line bands in the late 1800s.
“Room With a View”:
NC: The first song told entirely from the perspective of the Boy in the Well. I attempted to not use personal pronouns, and make sure his description were limited to comparisons, as he has had no interaction with the outside world, and has no real sense of “I”.
NS: Stay out of the way. The function of the drums here is to support and add color. Nothing more, nothing less.
“Mon Dieu”:
NC: In a shameless ripoff of Steinbeck, this song finds a rabbit falling in the well, and the boy's desire for love killing it. This becomes the impetus for him climbing out.
NS: Looking back, this song felt like it came together the easiest. It was one of the first songs we jammed on and completed. The drum arrangement is all over the place. It's maniacal and suits the performance of the song just right. We recorded this song with only one microphone which forced me to hit the cymbals a little bit differently. Instead of crashing with the middle of the stick, I played everything with the tip of the stick. I think it adds a cool sonic texture to the drums in this song.
“The Awe and the Anguish”:
NC: We recorded the first two thirds of this song entirely on a field recorder that was the same [Alan] Lomax used. We used one mic, and self controlled dynamics, which was new for us. This serves two functions, one being demarcating the boy's transition from the well to the outside world, and also to demonstrate the alien nature it presents to him.
NS: This was another attempt to stay out of the way of the vocals (and story). The melody and guitar part are so vibey, all it needed was some maraca and a few downbeats on a marching bass drum … until the end.
“Mon Nom”:
NC: This is a song entirely about the boy's search for identity, and finds him using personal pronouns as he grasps a greater sense of who or what he is. Given his upbringing, most of his conclusions are pretty menacing. The last repeated line means “I am the second coming of Christ” in French.
NS: In my opinion, this song achieved everything we were trying to do with the performances on the record. We use rhythm to build the intensity of the whole song. The drums start out stripped down, eventually adding each part of the drum set and then variations of the basic groove to build tension. Nate's vocal delivery is incredibly dynamic, starting in a low Johnny Cash rumble and ending in a Nick Oliveri style scream. The vocal delivery complements the lyrics most effectively on this song. Additionally, Jesse's guitar playing is straight forward and outside of the box all at once.
“Face to Face”:
NC: In the course of her routine visits to the well, mother encounters son. They recognize each other. In a bizarre sacrifice form, and out of some novel primal instinct in him, they have an “Oedipal” encounter.
NS: Rhythmically and harmonically, this song is outside of the wheelhouse. One of the more interesting instrumental arrangements on the record for me. We tested what we could get away with on this one, but still kept the style somewhat familiar.
“No Going Back”:
NC: The encounter is predictably violent, and some innate ethical boundary has been crossed. The mother lies still, presumably dead, and the boy, having destroyed (again) something he loves, is wracked with agony.
NS: I don't recall what inspired us to write a rockabilly song in 5/4, but we got a kick out of how unusual it sounded. It took us several hours of playing various grooves and parts in 5/4 to wrap our heads around it. Nate and I keep the groove straight forward and Jesse does a great job at smoothing out the angular feel. The transition to 4/4 in the chorus gives the song some serious momentum. Some of the playing towards the end of the song is a personal nod to a drum hero of mine, Jon Theodore [of Queens of the Stone Age and The Mars Volta]. Lastly, I think this is another instrumental arrangement that compliments the lyrics/story.
“God's Mercy”:
NC: This is basically a suicidal lament, as the boy throws himself back down the well. Finishing the job this time.
NS: This is a lullaby, so I did what seemed natural: Stay out of the fucking way. We used a ribbon mic placed about three feet above the tom, cranked the gain, and I played the floor tom with my hands. We achieved a pretty cool sound.
“Linen for the Orphan”:
NC: Months have passed. As it turns out, the girl was only rendered unconscious during the encounter with her son, and has come to term with their child. Unfortunately, she dies in child birth. Her parents, not wanting the child, decide to get rid of him. After a doctor smothers the child with a sheet, they need to find a place to dispose of the body.
NS: This guitar/drum vibe was inspired equally by the Cramps and the Dead Kennedys. I loved the feel of the song “Police Truck”, so Jesse and used that for some of the inspiration for the verse grooves. My favorite parts are the builds in the song. I tried to use the bells of the cymbals to build intensity rather than just crashing. I also tried to get as quiet as I could but without ever getting too loud. Tension, release, tension, release.
“Reunion”:
NC: The body is taken to the well, and thrown onto the bones of its father.
NS: The main riff was taken from a jam session that Jesse and I had from the previous summer. We brought that to a rehearsal and Nate pushed the song into a surf pop direction to juxtapose the lyrical content. Irony, a classic Cook move. We had our pal, Tommy Stinson, lay down some 12 string on this track which added a pretty and twangy sonic layer to the song. All in all, what better way to end the record?
ERIN-Dustin Johnson will aim to exploit his big-hitting prowess on the longest course in major championship history when he tees off at the US Open on Thursday, bidding to become the first back-to-back champion in 28 years.
The world number one won his first major in last year's US Open at Oakmont, after several near-misses, and is the bookmakers' favourite at the picturesque Erin Hills course in rural Wisconsin. Hosting a major for the first time, the intimidating 7,741 yards, par-72 layout is not for the faint-hearted, promising a physical and mental challenge for the very best.
Many holes feature blind or semi-blind tee-shots, while the course's mid-section runs on an outward-inward path that will ensure players face variable winds. Factor in fairways bordered by deep fescue grass that some have already described as unplayable, and it appears likely that the tournament will live up to its billing as the toughest test in golf.
Johnson, however, who missed the Masters in April after a freak accident where he slipped on steps and hurt his back on the eve of the tournament, was adamant the length of Erin Hills would suit his game. "It's just a very, very difficult tournament to win," the 32-year-old said, noting the US Open challenge and the reputation of this year's venue. "I like really tough golf courses. I tend to focus more and play better. I like knowing par is a good score for some reason. I don't know why. I play better when I'm playing for pars."
If he defends his title, Johnson will be the first man to win back-to-back US Opens since Curtis Strange in 1988 and 1989. Strange, now working as a television analyst, backed Johnson to complete the double. "We're at a bomber's paradise, and the best player in the world is the bomber," Strange said. "Wherever DJ plays, he's the longest out there. I have a feeling he'll be amped this week."
With Tiger Woods absent, still struggling to resurrect his career after back surgery, and Phil Mickelson likely to skip the tournament to attend his daughter's high school graduation, this year's US Open could mark the end of an era. If Mickelson fails to show as expected -- he retains a tee-time despite vowing not to attend -- it will be the first time since 1994 that neither player has featured in the first round of the US Open.
World number two Rory McIlroy, who won the event in 2011, has declared himself ready despite a frustrating season dogged by niggling injuries. The Northern Irish star has played only one event since the Masters after rib and back problems forced him to withdraw from the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
McIlroy arrived in Wisconsin last week to begin surveying a course he believes he can thrive on. "I don't think it's a secret that I feel like my driver is one of the biggest weapons in my bag," McIlroy said on Tuesday. "If I can get that in my hands more regularly, and I think if the field has to hit driver more, as well, that plays into my hands, too."
While other players have complained at the tangled acres of fescue grass, McIlroy was dismayed to learn some of the rough had been cut back following the complaints. "These are the widest fairways we've ever played in a US Open," McIlroy said. "You've got 156 of the best players in the world here. If we can't hit it within that avenue, you might as well pack your bags and go home."
The last six majors -- including Johnson's maiden US Open victory -- have been won by players who had never won a major before. One of the likeliest candidates to continue that streak at Erin Hills is 22-year-old Spaniard Jon Rahm, the former amateur world number one. Rahm, who turned pro in mid-2016 and claimed his maiden PGA Tour win at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in January, said he is ready for the challenge of Erin Hills. "It's like a links golf course on steroids, everything is a little bigger," Rahm said. "But I think it's US Open, they expect our best."
LAHORE: Around 43 suspects, including Afghan nationals were arrested in a search operation in Lahore, late Tuesday night.
According to reports, the officers carried out raids in various areas to hunt for accomplices of Lahore blast culprit and detained 40 Afghanis.
Counterterrorism Department (CTD) police has also shifted the affected DSNG van of private news channel and mazda to police station for further investigation.
Forensic official said that despite various parts of human body were recovered from the blast spot, it's difficult to identify the terrorist.
SAN BRUNO, Calif. -- The West Coast Conference has hired former Pac-12 executive Gloria Nevarez as the league's new commissioner.
The WCC announced Monday that Nevarez will replace Lynn Holzman and become the fourth full-time commissioner in conference history. Holzman left in January to become NCAA vice president for women's basketball.
Nevarez spent the last eight years with the Pac-12, where she served as the senior associate commissioner and senior woman administrator overseeing all Pac-12 championships with the exception of football.
Nevarez was the league's primary liaison for men's basketball where she played a comprehensive role overseeing officiating, scheduling, television issues management, event management and the student-athlete experience.
Nevarez will be one of 10 female conference commissioners in Division I and the first Latin American woman to become a Division I commissioner.
Denver Broncos kicker Brandon McManus signed his restricted free agent tender Wednesday afternoon, according to Adam Scheffer. The tender is worth just $2.8 million, but McManus has been vocal about wanting a long-term deal. The team placed the second-round tender on him back in March.
McManus, who took the starting job from Connor Barth at the start of the 2015 season, has been exceptional for the Broncos after a rough start to his tenure in Denver. Since then, he has nailed 59 of his 69 field goal attempts and 67 of 69 extra point attempts.
The Broncos are a team that has an extraordinary history of kickers. Jason Elam played for the team from 1993-2007, being voted to the Pro Bowl three times and helping the team win back-to-back Super Bowls during his tenure. He is considered to be among the best kickers in NFL history.
Jason Elam played for the team from 1993-2007, being voted to the Pro Bowl three times and helping the team win back-to-back Super Bowls during his tenure. He is considered to be among the best kickers in NFL history. Elam was succeeded by Matt Prater and though his time with the team wasn't as long, be broke the NFL record by kicking a 64-yard field goal in a game.
Hopfully the fact that McManus has signed his tender can help the two sides work toward a long-term agreement so that he can add his name to that impressive list of Denver kickers some day.
PEORIA, Ariz. (AP)  Despite all the young players in camp, San Diego Padres manager Andy Green asserts spring training is not a classroom and that players better be ready to execute at a high level.
"We're here to create a curve of expectation," Green said Tuesday, reporting day for pitchers and catchers. "This is not a development level but an expectation level. Players need to differentiate their different curves and possess the ability to recognize where they are in the process."
The club's expectation is that it will improve on last season's 68-94 record and last place finish in the NL West. Given the change in direction and emphasis on younger players, the challenge for Green appears formidable. Still, the energy level is high.
"I love the players we have here," said pitcher Clayton Richard, who is attempting to earn a spot in the starting rotation. "At the corners with (Yangervis Solarte and Wil Myers), these guys are among the best in the league. The outfield defense is about the best of any club. I'm excited about this team, and excited to get going."

Of pitchers on the Padres' roster on the final day of last season, Christian Friedrich, Keith Hessler, Luis Perdomo, Colin Rea, Buddy Baumann, Brandon Morrow, Jose Torres, Kevin Quackenbush, Brad Hand, and Ryan Buchter remain. Among those in camp, Green identified veterans Jhoulys Chacin, now with his fifth major league team, and Richard as those with an inside track as starters.
Otherwise, Green pointed out the field is wide open and there could be as many as 10 candidates for a rotation spot.
Green is entering his second season in San Diego with a different outlook.
Last season, it was necessary to learn about his players and establish a pattern.
"Now, I know what to expect," Green said. "There will be a quicker pace to the camp and many things I set up last year that took time are now in place."
New photos of the British royal family are always welcome, and on Wednesday, a never-before-seen photo of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry came to light thanks to Queen Elizabeth II, as reported by E! News. Photographs were taken of a Wednesday meeting between the Queen and George Brandis, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at Buckingham Palace. In the image of the Queen and Brandis, a framed picture on one of her end tables can be seen and it's of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
As you can see in the zoomed-in photograph below, Harry is sporting a blue suit, white collared dress shirt, and a dark tie. As for Markle, she's in a light-colored dress (possibly white or a pale blue) and has her hand resting on Harry's chest. As blurry as the image is, it's still gorgeous. These two never take a bad photo.
It's unclear where or when the picture was taken, but Harry's suit definitely resembles the same one he was wearing when the beloved couple announced their engagement in November 2017. The former Suits star's outfit differs, since she was wearing a dark dress with a white jacket during their first official appearance as an engaged couple. However, she could've always changed her outfit for another photo opportunity on the same day her engagement was revealed. Or, this unseen photo of them was simply snapped at a completely different time. Harry could always have more than one blue suit or has worn this same one multiple times.
WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images
According to Hello! magazine, it's quite possible the image was taken by Alexi Lubomirski, the photographer who took both their engagement and their wedding photos. As suggested by Hello!, Lubomirski could've snapped some pictures for the family that were to be only for personal use. Marie Claire echoed a similar thought and wondered if Markle and Harry had a private photo shoot separate from their engagement and wedding pictures.
Whatever the case, the above image is beautiful like all of the other pictures Lubomirski has taken of the newlyweds and their family. It's clearly not a hard job to photograph Harry and Markle.
Like Lubomirski told Reuters in after the May 19 royal wedding about the wedding photos, "It was just one of those magical moments, when you're a photographer and everything falls into place." He also said, "One word that I really kept throwing around in my head was 'familial', because when we did the engagement pictures and you got the sense that they were together, that black and white picture when they were really embracing and hugging, and you felt that love."
He truly adores taking photos of them, because their love is so honest and real. "It was wonderful to get that instantaneous read on them," he told CBS This Morning in April about taking photos celebrating their engagement. "Because, you know, love is — when you see young love or any — any love when it [is] in its genesis stage, it's the most beautiful thing to see. And I'm a cheeseball, so I love that kind of stuff."
Who knows if Lubomirski also took the never-before-seen image, but the royal family is strict about which photos they release to the public — and when they put them on display. They typically release pictures in an official capacity and on special occasions, like birthdays, engagements, and weddings. So, to see this photo of Harry and Markle, albeit blurry, is a rare opportunity.
It's also sweet to know the Queen has a framed photograph of Harry and Markle in Buckingham Palace. It shows how much she adores not only her grandson and Markle individually, but them as a couple.

ISLAMABAD - Senate Special Committee on Circular Debt was Tuesday informed that during last five years (from 2013-18) the circular debt has reached to Rs 573 billion.
The committee, held with Senator Shibli Faraz in the chair, discussed the issues of circular debt , electricity theft and load shedding.
Briefing the committee, Joint Secretary Power division said that from 2013-18 the circular debt has reached to Rs 573 billion. He said that the running defaulters is Rs 348 billion. He further said that the government is providing a subsidy of Rs 52.22 billion to AJK, Rs14.2 billion to Fata and Rs31.4 billion to industrial sector.
The joint secretary said that 650 MW electricity is being provided to K-Electric. He said that from March to July 2018 the generation cost of the electricity is Rs 8.52 per unit the consumer cost is Rs 11.9 per unit.
Terming the electricity theft and nonpayment of bills by influential people as a financial terrorism, the Senate committee has asked the government to make strategy for controlling the same.
The poor people are paying electricity bills regularly and if they miss one bill their electricity is being disconnected while the influential people are regular defaulters and due to their high contacts nobody is disconnecting their connections, said Shibli Faraz.
He said that avoiding paying electricity bills and dodging the punishment with their influence is financial terrorism.
He said that the government needs to adopt strategy to fight such the financial terrorism and should be dealt under Anti Terrorism Act.
Regarding loadshedding Pepco MD said that there are total 8631 feeders which have been divided in various categories.
"On the first category there are 5367 feeders where the losses are less than 10 percent. While at the end category the losses are more than 80 percent," he said.
Briefing the committee, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) CEO Imranul Haq said that their circular debt has surpassed Rs 300 billion which is affecting the performance of the state owned oil company. "That's why the company is facing problem in the investment," he said.
Imran said "They are getting only 9 percent payments monthly for the oil supply. Even now the Power Division has demanded 19000 tonnes furnace oil and if they refused the fuel supply to the power sector 9000 MW oil based electricity will vanish from the system."
The committee asked the MD PSO to provide the details of the circular debt and its proposal for its resolution to the committee in written.
Briefing about loadshedding and performance of the company, SEPCO Chief Executive Officer said that out of total 487 feeders, in SEPCO region, 51 have less than 10 percent losses while 299 have more than 80 percent losses.
He said that due to absence of writ of law the circular debt is increasing. The provincial government is not cooperating in controlling the theft.
He informed that 11800 applications have been given against the electricity theft where only 79 FIR were registered.
It is hard to work against the power thieves due to political interference, he added.
Hesco CEO said that there are 409 feeders in the Hesco region. Currently 118 feeders are loadshedding free while on the remaining there is 6 to 8 hours loadshedding, he added.
Pesco Chief said that the total consumers of Pesco are 3 million and there is capacity to consume 5000 MW electricity however due to weak transmission and distribution system the company can take only 2100 MW electricity.
"In absence of proper system Tesco is also getting power from Pesco. There are total 906 feeders in Pesco region where 17 to 18 are being shared with Tesco, he added. On 205 feeder there is a loss of 50 percent or above.
Shibli Faraz asked Pesco chief to provide the feeder wise details of the loadshedding. The meeting was attended by Senators Dr Jamaldeeni, Mir Kabeer, Usman Kakar, Sujjad Turi, additional secretary Power Division and other officials.

Earlier today, LCD Soundsystem announced another residency at the new Brooklyn venue Brooklyn Steel, where they played some of their first non-festival reunion shows back in April. Now, James Murphy has shared a lengthy note on Facebook explaining the reasoning behind these new shows:
hi there again…
i really just wanted to say something about these new shows in brooklyn.
last time we played Brooklyn Steel, we did 5 nights, and the tickets sold out quickly. everyone got very mad, and we in the band got all upset, and there were cries of bots, etc.. so we dug in, worked with the promoter to delete a bunch of questionable transactions, tried to control tickets the best we could, and discovered that it was actually very few pro scalpers and bots. (fact is, scalpers were announcing tickets for sale to our show before they were even available at all, with the idea that they could put out crazy prices in the beginning, and if anyone bit, they'd scramble to try to find a ticket, or, well, i guess sell a fake one). the fact was that there were many more people who wanted to see us than we had tickets for, which is awesome and a bummer at the same time.
outside of all that, the shows were very fun for us. we were close to home and the crowd was fucking great. we got the idea that we should do it again as soon as possible in hopes that more people who wanted to see us but missed us could come see us then. and this is the first time when both we and the venue had a block of dates available in a row, so here we are. 7 nights. with the 5 before it's like, more than a big venue, which we hope will be just fine.
i had a lot of back and forth about these shows with our very wonderful, concerned, thoughtful and on it managers and agents, and the professional consensus was that playing them was, frankly, a bad idea. to explain: we just did this in april, so they might seem “less special” now. for reasons i can't seem to quantify, the earlier gigs were considered special, so they were in higher demand and sold out very quickly. but the undermining of some of the specialness is precisely what we'd love to accomplish with these gigs. they're just some gigs. they're in our home town, so we can totally walk there. they're no more special than any other gigs. nothing unusual will be happening, other than what always happens at our gigs, which is us playing a bunch of songs as well as we can. we're going to be playing a LOT in the near future, so they're certainly not worth getting on a plane for, in our opinion. it's NOT a finite resource. it is certainly 100% not worth paying some crazy amount over face value for them. we're playing in other places this year, a lot, and that's likely close to wherever it is you live (unless you live far from things, which i'm sorry about — but it still wouldn't be worth flying to these.)
playing more seems to be the best antidote. unless we play big places, which are ok sometimes, but not our favorite things all the time. or, if i read some blogs correctly, we should charge way, way more for the tickets. this isn't interesting for us mainly because people with a lot of extra money aren't the only people we want to play to. (don't get me wrong: we're aware that if the tickets are, like, $15, they just get resold for a lot more, and we sit there like morons wondering how we're going to pay our crew, but, you know…) the last solution, which i like, is requiring an ID which matches your ticket. this is somehow still totally illegal here in new york, which makes me pretty bonkers.
so, that's where we are. here are some shows which we're really excited to play, and we think are worth maybe precisely what the tickets cost. and maybe if no one buys a scalped ticket for more than the face value, the room will feel a little empty, but at least we'll be done with this crap once and for all, as scalpers aren't in it to troll music fans — they're in it to make money, and if no one feeds them, the natural consequence is that they'll just thin way the fuck out.
thank you guys for reading.
james
ps. i really didn't want to make any more announcements of any kind until we had a release date for the LP, but these shows are this week, and we're still getting the artwork finalized so they can make covers, which we need to solidify the date, so that's still happening. watch this space. and by “this space”, i mean the internet.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  A review board in Raleigh is refusing to allow an anti-abortion group to move next to a center that offers the procedures.
The News & Observer of Raleigh reported (http://bit.ly/2lJI9xA) the city's Board of Adjustment voted 3-2 Monday against allowing the Hand of Hope Pregnancy Resource Center to move next to an abortion clinic. The Hand of Hope is a nonprofit that encourages alternatives to abortion.
The newspaper reported Hand of Hope has been trying for nearly a year to open an office next to A Preferred Women's Health Center.
Health center spokeswoman Calla Hales says she's relieved by the decision.

TROY, Ala. (Troy Athletics) – On a sunny day in Troy, Wesley Person made it rain in Trojan Arena en route to a 93-71 win over UT Arlington in Troy's first game at home in more than a month.
Person had a career-high 39 points on a career-high 10 3-pointers. The junior also had a career-high 13 field goals on 13-19 shooting.
It didn't take long for Person and the Trojans (10-8) to show off the offensive firepower that would be displayed throughout the night. UT Arlington (12-5) led for just 48 seconds in the game and never in the second half.
Two free throws by Kaelon Wilson tied the game at 14 with 9:56 left in the first half, but that would be the last time the game was within reach for the Mavericks.
Person quickly turned the game into a 3-point shooting clinic. By halftime, the guard was up to 20 points on five 3-pointers to give Troy the 46-36 lead at the break.
Any attempt for the Mavericks to cut into the deficit coming out of the half was quickly thwarted by a 12-5 run in the first 4:13. From the 4:44 mark of the first half through the end of the game, Troy led by double-digits for all but 17 seconds.
With Troy leading 77-62 with 5:22 to go, Person pulled up near the top of the key and launched a 3-pointer that hit nothing but net and gave him 33 points.
That shot surpassed his previous career-high of 31 points that he ironically set against UT Arlington on Jan. 5, 2015 of his freshman season.
His night still wasn't over yet as he hit two more 3-pointers for good measure to get to his total of 39 points, which was just eight points shy of the Troy record of 47 points set by Calvin Aultman against Jacksonville State on Feb. 28, 1991.
While Person stole the show, it was also a huge night for Jordon Varnado. The forward had 24 points on 10-16 shooting and three rebounds. That total was just three points shy of his career-best 27 points against Alabama A&M earlier this season on Dec. 10.

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Tuesday announced to take action against its those members who are contesting July 25 election as independent candidates after the refusal of party tickets — a decision that has been seen by many members as intimidation tactics without having any legal consequences.
A spokesperson of PTI in an official announcement told media that PTI had decided to take action against those members who “violated discipline” by deciding to contest election as independents.
PTI said that such names would be forwarded to a two-member disciplinary committee, comprising former secretary information PTI Naeemul Haq and PTI's Additional Secretary General Arshad Dad for further investigation and necessary action.
The announcement comes after many disgruntled PTI leaders have announced to contest independently after refusal of party tickets to them. The PTI spokesperson said that all party members had already submitted affidavits with the party stating that they would not contest elections as independent candidates in case the party did not issue them tickets. “Therefore, this is not only violation of the party discipline but also of affidavit and Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution (regarding Sadiq and Ameen),” the statement reads.
The disciplinary committee will forward its report to party chairman Imran Khan and the action would be started immediately, the spokesperson added.
A number of PTI members have been protesting over the refusal of party tickets and have alleged that the party had issued tickets to electable and old status quo politicians while ignoring the ideological workers.
Many of the PTI workers had staged a protest sit-in in front of the residence of party chief in Bani Gala, Islamabad while Imran Khan has recently declared that the award of tickets was the most unrewarding and difficult times in his entire life. Rifts have emerged within the senior leadership of the party over the award of tickets for the National Assembly and provincial assembly seats.
PTI had sought affidavits from the ticket applicants that they would not contest election in independent capacity in case of refusal of tickets— a move that raises many questions whether a political party can deprive candidates of their right to contest election.
The matter is now before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that will decide its legality. The commission on last Monday had summoned PTI chairman Imran Khan on July 4 to seek his reply while hearing an application against submission of assurance affidavits.
The petition had been filed by a PTI ticket hopeful. During the hearing, the petitioner's counsel informed the court that the PTI had sought assurance affidavits from applicants of party tickets which stated that they will not leave the party or contest as independent candidates in case they were not given tickets.

You may have had friends who say that they fell in love a couple of weeks after meeting someone, but other people can be together for months and months and still not be sure. So how long does it take to fall in love with someone?
If you're questioning why you don't feel "in love" as quickly as you think you should, then it's time to give yourself a break. Because with love, it's often better to think about the long term.
It's not that you can't have strong feelings for someone very quickly — but, often those strong feels will actually be lust or infatuation, which can feel a lot like love in the beginning. So, when it comes to how long it takes to fall in love, you need to give yourself some time to make sure that's really what you're feeling.
"In my estimation it takes longer than a lot of people think that it does!" relationship therapist Aimee Hartstein, LCSW tells Bustle. "There's no one answer or time frame but I generally find that when people say they are in love after four weeks or even after eight weeks they are talking about lust! We can have lust and passion at first sight, but it takes longer than that to really get to know someone and figure out who they are and how the two of you connect. Love is definitely something longer term."
So how long it takes to fall in love can really depend on — and, if you're taking a little longer, it might just mean that you're holding out for the real thing. "And of course you should take it at your own pace," Hartsein says. "Even if the person you are dating proclaims their love early on, that's no reason for you to start questioning yourself and your feelings. Everyone is different."
And, interestingly, it seems like certain factors mean we fall in love more quickly (or think we've fallen in love more quickly). Here are some things that can effect how quickly we fall in love — because it can vary so much from person to person.
Positive Thinkers Can Fall In Love Faster Andrew Zaeh for Bustle It makes sense when you think about it — more positive people find it easier to talk themselves into a more positive mindset generally and that includes their feelings toward someone else. “Positive thinking can increase how much love you have for your partner for several reasons,” Yvonne Thomas, Ph.D., a Los Angeles-based psychologist tells Bustle. “First of all, if you are already thinking positively in general, you are much more likely to notice and appreciate those qualities in your partner that you love rather than take these characteristics for granted or or overlook them. Also, if you typically tend to engage in positive thinking, you are likely to be a more open-hearted person in general, as well as towards your partner than someone who tends to be more of a negative or even neutral kind of thinker.” So us cynics out there might take a little longer to fall in love — but that's OK, too.
Men Might Fall In Love Faster Than Women Andrew Zaeh for Bustle It may go against every gender stereotype ever — but that's exactly why gender stereotypes are total BS. According to a study in The Journal of Social Psychology, men fall in love faster than women. The study also found that they expressed it faster — but some experts think this might be more to do with men being more secure in their convictions rather than actually falling in love faster. "Generally, men are seen as less emotional and may not question their emotions as much as women do," Rachel Needle, Psy.D., licensed psychologist and certified sex therapist in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells Bustle. "On the other hand, women are often more likely to analyze their feelings and hesitate before saying 'I love you.' Thus, a man might not actually be in love, but will say it when the feelings are strong and believes that he is. Despite what much of the media and society claims, many men do desire meaningful connections and relationships. They might sometimes fall harder faster, but there is no telling how long that feeling will last."

Provincial head of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Quetta, Dinesh Shrestha has emphasized upon complete law & order situation for smooth repatriation of Afghan refugees .
Talking to Voice Of America (VOA), he said there are more than 37,000 Afghan refugees who had left for Afghanistan last year and at least 15,000 registered Afghan migrants had already left for Afghanistan.
He said the migrants are being repatriated following the steps taken by the Afghan government, international community and human rights organizations.
Replying to a question, he said Afghan refugees migrated to areas of Afghanistan where peace has been restored, however, it is difficult to dispatch all Afghan refugees in a year because Iran is also sending Afghan migrants and in Afghanistan, there are a number of homeless people due to which difficulties of the people will further complicate.
He said the UNHCR is of the view that the Federal govt should keep in mind difficulties of migrants as it is planning to send Afghan refugees back in their country and its modalities are being finalized.
Meanwhile, it is also reported that the federal government has yet to formalise its repatriation policy for Afghan refugees. However, numbers that emerged after setting up a border management system at Torkham have not only baffled officials in Khyber-Paktunkhwa but have also brought into question the entire policy. From June to October, 678,845 Afghan refugees left K-P through the Torkham border. Of these people, only 287,763 were repatriated through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) voluntary repatriation centres (VRCs).
‘This means 391,082 individuals (probably unregistered Afghan refugees) have fallen off the radar. This stat points to an anomaly in figures quoted by the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) and the UNHCR. He said any policy framework that was formalised with statistics that are not based on real-time data would only cause a humanitarian crisis.
The figures further show that the incoming movement from Afghanistan to Pakistan from March to May this year had been 620,179 individuals. But after enforcement of border regulation only 167 Afghan nationals have been documented to enter through Torkham till the end of October. KP is hosting 62% of the Afghans living in Pakistan. While the official statistics from ministry of Safron show that 0.650 million refugees reside in the province and there are around 0.6 million unregistered refugees. If the 391,082 unregistered refugees from this 0.6m people have already left the country in the last 5 months then only around 2.1m unregistered Afghans are left in the country.
However, the official said entire data is questionable and based on data from 2004. ‘A census to document Afghan refugees by the Commissionerate Afghan Refugees (CAR) was called off twice,' he said.—APP

A vulnerable French nanny was murdered and her body thrown on a bonfire by the former girlfriend of a Boyzone founder, a court heard.
Victim Sophie Lionnet, 21, was allegedly killed after being accused of a series of 'outlandish' crimes by Sabrina Kouider, 35.
Kouider and partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, held the "naive and vulnerable" victim prisoner at their £900,000 home in Wimbledon, southwest London, in the days before her death, jurors heard.
During this time she was subjected to horrific violence, the Old Bailey was told.
Koudier, the ex-girlfriend of Boyzone founder Mark Walton, held a "brutal and oppressive inquisition" of the nanny, prosecutors claim.
The court heard Kouider accused her nanny of being "in league" with Mr Walton and in rambling complaints said he controlled her through "black magic".

Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: "The last days and hours of Sophie's life must have been truly wretched.
"She was subjected, at times, to a brutal and oppressive inquisition and to significant violence."
Ms Lionnet died after suffering fractures to her sternum, four ribs and her jawbone.
Kouider and Medouni then tried to cover up the murder by burning her body in their garden, jurors heard.
"The plan was to dispose of Sophie's body and to explain her disappearance by inventing a story that she had left under something of a cloud and had returned to France.
(Image: Internet Unknown)
"Another missing person, no longer their responsibility, her disappearance nothing to do with them."
Their plan was only foiled when a neighbour became concerned about the fire and dialled 999, jurors were told.
Ms Lionnet's charred body was discovered by at the house in Wimbledon Park Road on September 20 last year.
The young victim, from Troyes, northeast France, had moved to the UK in 2016 to improve her English.
"Sophie was not only young, but also naive and particularly vulnerable and this made her an easy target for abuse and exploitation," said Mr Horwell.
"Sophie had a big heart but was not worldly wise and it was easy to take advantage of her."

Ms Lionnet's health began to deteriorate in the period leading up to her death because of her 'bizarre and oppressive' life, the court heard.
"At times she appeared scared and hungry,' said Mr Horwell.
"She complained that she was being beaten and that she was not allowed to return to her home in France."
Kouider was seen shouting and screaming at Sophie, the court heard.
She accused the young Frenchwoman of stealing a diamond pendant and plotting against her, the court heard.
Mr Horwell said: "Precisely what was in Sabrina Kouider's mind may be difficult to determine but it seems that the more outlandish the allegations the more she pursued them, despite the fact they were denied and despite the fact there was no evidence to support them.
(Image: Joe Alvarez)
"Her allegations appear to have been contagious because Medouni was beguiled by Kouider and her obsessions and delusions and he began to adopt them himself.
"Eventually they confronted Sophie and wanted her to confess to conduct and crimes she had not committed.
"Sophie became a prisoner in the Wimbledon home and she must have been terrified.
"The defendants mistreated and intimidated Sophie in a manner that is way beyond anything that could be considered normal or rational.
"Sophie must have found this unnatural and increasingly toxic situation wholly outside her experience and ability to manage.
"At times she made confessions to please her oppressors and then would withdraw them.
"And so the pressure increased and so did the violence against her."
(Image: Twitter)
The court heard firefighters discovered Sophie Lionnet's remains under the ash of the fire in the garden.
"Without such vigilance the two defendants might well have got away with murder - which was, of course, their aim," said Mr Horwell.
The prosecutor told jurors that it was understandable if the case appeared 'difficult to believe at first blush'.
"How can someone be treated in such an appalling manner and not leave?" he asked.
"How can someone confess to fantastical allegations which are not true.
"It is likely that never before will you have encountered a combination of individuals such as these two, Sabrina Kouider and Sophie Lionnet."
Kouider was said to be 'vindictive, overbearing and controlling' while Sophie Lionnet was 'timid, uncomplaining and especially vulnerable to manipulation and threats.'
Mr Horwell said it was 'a unique and highly dangerous combination that led to murder and the attempted disposal of a body.'
Medouni and Kouider, both of Wimbledon Park Road, Southfields, southwest London, both deny murder.
The trial continues.

Spring is upon us. You can smell the fragrance of flowers in the air. This coming April 20, however, a different flower will be on everyone's mind, one that your mother is not happy about so soon after Easter. But like Christ, many will be elevating their spirit with the help of cannabis. Like delicious snack food, music will be needed for this unofficial holiday, so we at the Clarion have compiled some tunes to accompany the good vibes of the day.
While some may point out a missing essential 4/20 song, an all encompassing list is impossible. Lists serve as a guide to what artists people should be hearing, and there will no doubt be many 4/20 playlists with many different artists. Take a listen with this one, though, and get caught up in classic beats mixed with hypnotic guitar riffs and abstract melodies.
We split the playlist into day and night, offering chill daytime vibes paired with an elevated night time spirit.

LOS ANGELES -- Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo announced power-throwing lefty Robbie Ray will start Saturday's Game 2 in the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Lovullo said he waited as long as he could to make the decision official after Ray was used for 34 pitches during Arizona's wild-card victory over the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday.
"I talked to him after his throwing program yesterday," Lovullo said.
"He said he felt fantastic. I had a conversation with him today, and he said he felt even better. The type of relationships that I've established with these guys is built on trust and communication. So it was a swift and easy conversation."
Robbie Ray dominated the Dodgers this year, going 3-0 with a 2.27 ERA and 53 strikeouts over 31 2/3 innings. Carlos Herrera/Icon Sportswire
Ray, Arizona's No. 2 starter during the season, dominated the Dodgers this year, going 3-0 with a 2.27 ERA and 53 strikeouts over 31 2/3 innings. Ray went 15-5 overall during his breakout fourth big league season with a 2.89 ERA. His ERA ranked fourth in the NL, and his 218 strikeouts ranked third. Ray led the league in strikeouts per nine innings (12.1).
"Within three or four minutes, I could tell by the look in his eyes that he wanted the ball tomorrow and he was ready," Lovullo said. "We had minimal concerns."
Ray's appearance Wednesday was his postseason debut, an experience he hopes will smooth things for him on Saturday during a postseason in which several top starting pitchers have struggled.
"My arm feels great and ready to go," Ray said. "I wouldn't lie to him. I wouldn't give this team anything but 100 percent of myself. I feel like that would be cheating me and cheating the team. So I feel 100 percent and I feel ready to go."
Lovullo repeated his comment from Thursday that he expects No. 1 starter Zack Greinke to throw in Monday's Game 3 in Phoenix. However, he has not made any decision about a possible Game 4.
"We're expecting some dogfights out there and some really, really strong battles," Lovullo said. "We're going to use every bit of force that we possibly can to make sure that we take care of today. So where that lands us on Game 4, we're not sure at this point."

“You are not allowed to fly IFR in a Light-Sport Aircraft” is a common dismissal from many in aviation.
Is it factual to say that filing and flying by reference only to instruments in a LSA is excluded by regulation? Is it wise to use these aircraft for flight into conditions of reduced visibility?
By 2017, I venture to say almost everyone in aviation knows about Light-Sport Aircraft and the Sport Pilot certificate, but a superficial knowledge can result in an incomplete understanding. A few details might be helpful.
Think about IFR in an LSA this way: Can you fly IFR in a homebuilt aircraft? Can you do so in a Cessna 172?
Does it matter that these two distinct types have not gone through a thorough IFR evaluation by FAA?
If you know IFR can be done in either aircraft type — assuming aircraft and pilot are qualified and current — then why should such flying be prevented in LSA?
The matter might become cloudier if you heard the advice issued by ASTM F37 on this subject to LSA producers.
Sorting It Out
ASTM is an international standards-writing body and F37 is the ASTM committee that has labored for more than a dozen years to provide the FAA with LSA industry consensus standards.
These standards are needed for the FAA to “accept” — not to “certify” — Special LSA.
The F37 group has been working on an IFR standard for some time without arriving at a consensus.
Partly because the work on an IFR standard continues, the committee urged manufacturers not to promote IFR capability until the new standard was in place and accepted by the FAA.
F37's advice is directly related to a present lack of an IFR standard, plus possible resistance from groups that have to meet FAA regulations.
However, neither the committee's advice nor the regulation that created Sport Pilot/LSA prevents a qualified pilot in a properly equipped aircraft from filing IFR.
Instead, being able to do so relates to a manufacturer's preference, plus written FAA-issued operating limitations.
So, can it be done or not?
Bristell USA, importers of the beautiful LSA of the same name built in the Czech Republic by BRM Aero, has a different approach. It uses the ELSA opportunity.
An Experimental LSA must start out as a bolt-for-bolt copy of the SLSA version. It does not have to adhere to the so-called 51% rule, but upon completion it must be identical in every way to fully manufactured models.
The owner may not use an ELSA for compensated flight instruction or rental as can be done in a Special LSA, but in other ways, they are the same airplane.
Once an ELSA has its certificate, the owner can change panel gear and other components (even the engine) without seeking permission for such changes from the manufacturer as would be required for a SLSA.
What About IFR Instrumentation?
“At Dynon we are often asked if our avionic products are ‘certified' for IFR flight,” said Robert Hamilton, president of Dynon Avionics. “In fact, there is no such thing as ‘IFR certification' for amateur-built and LSA, and so answering the question requires an explanation.”
“The relevant regulation is FAR 91.205, which lists equipment that is required for various types and times of flight: VFR, VFR Night, and IFR,” he explained.
Included for IFR flight are such things as two-way communication and navigation equipment, gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator, sensitive altimeter, and artificial horizon.
Given the ASTM committee's prohibition, have you a path to operate an LSA using the IFR system? Yes, a way exists.
At Sebring 2017 in January, I flew in a well-equipped LSA with Bristell USA's John Rathmell. John is a highly experienced pilot knowledgeable about Bristell's IFR option.
The Bristell — an evolution of the popular LSA Piper once sold — featured dual, large screen Garmin G3X digital instruments backed by a few analog gauges, meeting Technical Standard Order (TSO) requirements.
With these round instruments and presuming a qualified pilot following IFR procedures, the Bristell can be used for IFR flight… if it is registered as an Experimental LSA or ELSA.
Once an ELSA has its certificate, the owner is allowed not only to make changes as he or she wishes, but also to operate in the IFR system, assuming other requirements are met.
To fly under IFR rules, the pilot must have an IFR rating, must be current in those skills, and the airplane must be qualified by the means referenced above, and maintenance must be up-to-date.
You cannot — and more importantly should not — go fly into clouds simply because you have wonderful equipment on board from companies like Dynon, Garmin, or MGL Avionics.
Plenty of recreational or sport pilots may not care about flying IFR. If you fly strictly for fun in visual conditions weather, good for you! Have at it and enjoy!
Yet, if you want an affordable new aircraft with desirable features and if you like the versatility of IFR, it is possible.
In summary, if you are an instrument pilot, and if you are current, and if you have a medical, and if you purchase an aircraft like the Bristell and register it as an ELSA, no regulation prevents you from filing and flying IFR including into IMC.
Only you can judge if that is a smart activity for you on any given day, and I hope you'll make that decision wisely.

Saskatchewan Roughrider Duron Carter has been released from custody after being arrested at the Saskatoon airport for marijuana possession.
Saskatoon police say they were contacted by Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) officials just before midnight on Thursday, where authorities had stopped a traveler, searched his bags and located marijuana. There is no word on the amount Carter allegedly had in his possession.

Carter is scheduled to make his first court appearance at provincial court in Saskatoon on March 27.
The Southern Alberta Model Railway Club hosted its annual open house this weekend, allowing the public to see their newly expanded facility in Gyro Park.
The club has seen a steady growth in membership from people of all ages since its incorporation in 1972.
Braeden Dunne, 20, became member of the railway club after an open house in 2015.
Soon after his enrolment, plans for a major expansion took place, with construction finishing in September 2017.
“The expansion is a very great thing for us,” Dunne said. “Not only does it allow us more room to grow for the layout itself, it gives us more space for our open houses, and it gives us more opportunities for the trains.”
Like many other members in the group, his passion for modelling began at a young age.
“My dad got me into the hobby at about age six. He had a little setup, a little layout in his basement for me and that was when I was first introduced to modelling myself,” Dunne recalled.

People who visited the open house have fond memories of the club, hoping to pass them along their kids.
“My dad brought me here one time, when I was like 10, so that would have been 20 some years ago.. and we had our kids with us, so we thought it would be fun to show them,” Colin Sheen said.
“Our little boys are obsessed with Chuggington, the show Chuggington, they love trains.”
The work done by the club is not going unnoticed.
“A lot of the details – the small little details. Like there's one over here, there's a house and they're playing basketball and there's even a guy dunking on the rim – so even little details like that is pretty cool,” said Sheen.
The club has grown from a modest 10 members to 30, meeting every Tuesday.

“Solo: A Star Wars Story” has earned the ignominious distinction of premiering to the lowest opening for a Disney “Star Wars” film yet — bowing with $103 million over the four-day holiday weekend.
Normally a debut of over $100 million would rank as a roaring success, but there are reasons that folks on the Disney lot may be starting to sweat. After all, this is one of the most storied film franchises in movie history; a premium brand with few equals. Moreover, it's not an ideal start for a film with a budget over $250 million, and it's a launch that potentially means that this installment could fall short of previous films in the series, most of which end their runs with over $1 billion globally.
“When the bar is set this high, there's a lot of Chicken Little [syndrome] going on,” box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said of reports already labeling the newest “Star Wars” installment as a flop. “That's not the case, but when you have a franchise that's been this successful, any misstep becomes a big deal.”
Analysts are pointing to timing for “Solo's” soft debut. Instead of sticking to the standard plan of rolling out a new “Star Wars” film every year, Disney and Lucasfilm opened “Solo” a mere five and a half months after “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” The second installment in the sequel trilogy launched in December of 2017 and ended its impressive run this April with $1.3 billion worldwide, including $620 million in North America. A year earlier, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” premiered with $155 million and went on to make $532 million domestically and $1 billion globally.

“Oversaturation is always a concern,” box office analyst Jeff Bock said. “You can't make an inferior ‘Star Wars' film. Audiences will call it out. It makes them hesitant to buy a ticket to the next film.”
The Han Solo standalone film certainly had a bumpy gestation. After producer Kathleen Kennedy fired directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and replaced them with Ron Howard, almost 85% of the movie was reshot and Michael K. Williams' role was recast with Paul Bettany due to scheduling conflicts. It's hard to say how much behind-the-scenes turmoil impacts moviegoing, Dergarabedian said, though it's definitely something “Star Wars” aficionados were aware of.
“When you have fans that are that religiously enthusiastic about the ‘Star Wars' property, any change can cause a shift in the force,” he said. “‘Star Wars' fans have a high standard of what they expect. The type of things that most audiences wouldn't really care that much about, ‘Star Wars' fans care about it.”
With the bar for success set in the billions of dollars, it was only a matter of time until a new “Star Wars” movie stumbled. But perhaps “Solo's” opening weekend gross doesn't mean disaster for Lucasfilm — instead it could be an opportunity to look at smaller movies for this cash-flush franchise.
It may be time to start reframing the anthology movies not as lucrative standalone flicks for legacy characters (a Boba Fett adventure is also in the works), but as rare opportunities to break out of their own cumbersome canon. However, Lucasfilm may not be ready to deviate too far from the “Star Wars” look and feel to keep directors like Lord and Miller employed.
The “Star Wars” films of the past five years have attracted notable directors, including J.J. Abrams (“The Force Awakens,” “Episode IX”), Gareth Edwards (“Rogue One”), Rian Johnson (“The Last Jedi), and Ron Howard (“Solo”). But they've also battled a perception of being filmmaker-unfriendly. Kennedy's team brought in Tony Gilroy to oversee reshoots on “Rogue One” and Lord and Miller reportedly ran afoul of management by employing too much of an improvisational spin on the material. “Solo” may be a sign that audiences want something fresh, but that can only happen with buy-in from the top.
“It's become obvious there are problems within Lucasfilm,” Bock said. “You don't see that in a lot of big name franchises. There is something that's not working.”
The “Star Wars” brain trust may want to borrow a page from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These superhero films have been hailed for embracing a range of genres — from spy thriller (“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”) to comedy (“Guardians of the Galaxy”) to sci-fi (“Doctor Strange”) without missing a beat. That's allowed the studio to release multiple films a year. That's also why “Avengers: Infinity Wars” could premiere just a few short months after “Black Panther” with no sense of MCU fatigue. Both earned over $1 billion globally.
“There's so much possibility within the ‘Star Wars' franchise,” Bock said. “It seems to me [Disney and Lucasfilm] are cutting their own hand off in terms of creativity. They're playing it much too safe.”
It may be time to move beyond Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. Future “Star Wars” films that exist separate from the original trilogy sage might allow bold casting choices and could attract a variety of directors and writers who could stretch narrative possibilities and take chances (though maybe not too many chances).
“The whole point is to mix it up. The anthology opened up a nice opportunity to bend the rules a bit,” Dergarabedian said. “If every movie looked the same and it didn't do well, we would say it's because it's the same old thing. They would be accused of being cookie cutter.”
Perhaps that could be something audiences see with the upcoming series from “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, as well as the separate Rian Johnson-helmed saga that was announced last year. Neither is expected to deal with the Skywalker family saga, and that presents an opportunity.
Next time instead of rebooting Han Solo with a younger actor, Disney might try creating some new iconic characters. After all, that strategy seemed to pay off with the 1977 original.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria is heading for a catastrophic partition and could see the return of Islamic State if there is no inclusive peace settlement, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Monday.

“The truth is that a soft, long-term partition of Syria, which (is) the one that we are witnessing at the moment, in different areas of control, will be a catastrophe, not only for Syria but for the whole region,” he told an audience at Geneva's Graduate Institute.
“Without an inclusive political process, including those who are excluded, particularly the majority, the Sunnis, Daesh will come back,” he said, referring to Islamic State by its pejorative Arabic name.
* Euro near multi-year peaks on yen, dollar
* Bond yields spike as inflation expectations flare
* Amazon shares jump 6 pct after hours on record profit
* Bitcoin tumbles further from December's record high
By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro neared multi-year peaks on Friday as talk of policy tightening in Europe and expectations that inflation is set to gear higher drove up borrowing costs globally.
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries jumped to a near four-year peak, markedly steepening the curve and squeezing out investors who had feverishly bet on a tighter spread between longer-dated and short-dated yields.
Global central banks have recently struck a more hawkish tone with impressive economic data and buoyant oil prices driving up long-term inflation expectations.
The European Central Bank, for one, is widely expected to end its asset-purchase programme as early as September. That has pushed five-year German Bund yields above zero for the first time since 2015. UK gilt prices also cheapened significantly.
Investors reacted by bidding the euro broadly higher from a more than two-year top on the yen and a three-year peak on the dollar at $1.2509.
Yet rising U.S. yields have failed to prop up the dollar index, which slipped for a third straight day to loiter around a three-year trough.
“The trade weighted dollar continued to weaken very broadly in 2018 with the two key pillars being growth strengthening elsewhere in the world, supporting emerging market forex... and central bank divergence narrowing, supporting euro, yen and British pound,” JP Morgan analyst Charles Perrin wrote in a note to clients.
“The currency was also dragged by U.S. politics.”
The United States is witnessing deep partisan political divisions and intraparty squabbles with lawmakers unable to find common ground on most issues. The federal government shut down last month for three days when Republicans and Democrats failed to strike a deal to fund public operations.
The dollar is not far off a 4-1/2 month low against the yen .
Bitcoin, the world's biggest and the best known cryptocurrency, continued to tumble after hitting a record high $19,666 in December on the Bitstamp exchange. It was last down 11 percent at a more than two-month trough of $8,940.
EQUITIES PAUSE
Asian shares were muted following mixed signals from Wall Street. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan paused around record highs.
Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent while South Korea's benchmark index eased 0.4 percent.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.14 percent, the S&P 500 eased 0.06 percent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.35 percent.
High-profile tech companies reported after the closing bell on Wall Street, with Amazon.com surging 6 percent after reporting the largest profit in its history.
Alphabet was down nearly 3 percent in extended trade after its earnings missed estimates.
Apple bounced more than 3 percent after posting its results.
In commodities, gold hovered near a six-month peak at $1,348.2 an ounce.
Oil rose after a survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' commitment to its supply cuts remains in place, even as U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970.
U.S. crude rose 36 cents to $66.16 per barrel and Brent edged 89 cents higher to $69.78.
Local skating star Reese Rose captured the silver medal in the under-12 juvenile ladies event at the Ontario Starskate Figure Skating championships held this weekend at the Kingston Invista Centre.
And Rose wasn't the only local athlete to dazzle on the ice. Alex Lee from the Fort Henry Figure Skating Club won a silver medal in Silver Triathlon and a bronze in the Star 10 competition.

Rose and Lee were just some of the many talented young athletes who performed to the best of their ability in the 56 different events held in Kingston over the weekend.
And to hear officials from Skate Ontario describe the weekend, Kingston deserves a medal for delivering an excellent event.
“We're based out of Mississauga, so we don't know this area and without the local organizers. We just couldn't pull this off,” said Michelle Hunsley from Skate Ontario.
The Kingston skating community came through with a gold medal performance, both on and off the ice.
“I'm proud of everyone,” said Glenda Cartwright, the event coordinator.
“It was March break and that's a difficult time to recruit volunteers, so we extended invitations of support from clubs throughout the region,” continued Cartwright.
“We had volunteers from Athens, Brockville, Gananoque, Stirling and Frankford, as well as the local clubs from Kingston, Fort Henry and the Loyalist Club from Amherstview. They all came together to make this a wonderful event.”

With the logistics of running such a huge competition in place, it allowed Skate Ontario to do what they do best.
“We wanted them to have a fun and learning experience. That's what this event is all about,” Hunsley said. “We know that everyone can't be on the podium, but we do hope that skaters strive for personal goals. They're all winners. They've all qualified to be here and they've all worked very hard. They should be proud of their accomplishments no matter where they finish.”
Jezus — not Jesus — fancies himself a prophet. He's the leader of a doomsday cult in Hawaii, where its mostly male (and mostly naked) followers prep for the end of the world, building a giant ark that will save them come the apocalypse. On the day that religious scholar and best-selling author Reza Aslan meets him, a barefoot Jezus whirls Dervish-like on the floor of his canopied, open-walled hut, spinning around while feverishly flailing his arms, screaming to the sky, clearly on the brink of some catastrophic mental breakdown.
“It gets way crazier than what you saw,” says Aslan, who spent a week with the doomsday cult as part of his experiential six-episode series on CNN, “Believer With Reza Aslan.”
But on June 9, CNN dropped Aslan and declined to pick up a second season of the series after he tweeted about President Donald Trump's respsonse to the London terrorist stabbings on June 3. What will this mean for the show's Emmy chances? A tough question, but will Emmy voters judge Aslan harshly, or will they, like Aslan's passioniate “Believer,” be open-minded about unfettered expression?
That Aslan throws himself into such situations so open-mindedly and without condescension is one of the hallmarks of “Believer,” which explores the day-to-day inner-workings of six different religious sects around the world, including a group of excommunicated Scientologists in Haifa, Israel, who still practice the core beliefs of the church; the Santa Muerte (“Saint Death”) community in Mexico; and goat-sacrificing voodoo followers in Haiti.
“We didn't have a template for what we were doing,” says Aslan of the series. “We had no format, we had no paradigm. We knew that we wanted to do something that had never been attempted before. There were tons of shows in which a guy stands in front of some religious group and points at them and says, ‘Isn't that interesting!' And that wasn't what we were going to do. Ours was about participation. We weren't there to judge, but to take part and listen.”
“Believer,” says Aslan, is not aimed at exploitation, but at creating compassion and deeper understanding of both spirituality and religion.
That's not to say it hasn't escaped its share of criticism.
“My spiritually is far, far deeper than my religion, and I think that's one of the points of the show, that faith and religion are different things,” he says. “Religion is how you define your faith. But faith is bigger and more expansive than religion. It's why we call the show ‘Believer.' We are interested in the things that people believe, not the institutions that formulate beliefs for them.”
Whether he's sampling the brain of a human corpse or dunking in the Ganges River in India at the behest of the Aghori community — human cremains and microbes of fecal matter pooling around him — or dancing in the streets with the Na Nachs, a fringe sect within the ultra-Orthodox community in Israel that promotes happiness (and, by default, marijuana consumption) as a pathway to God, Aslan is fully immersed in every aspect of the experience.
There are gorgeously haunting moments in the series — “People ask me in which episode I had the deepest spiritual experience. I still have my Santa Muerte; I see her every day,” says Aslan — and there are times where things get downright uncomfortable. In one such scene, an Aghori devotee, unclothed and smothered in human ashes, attempts to urinate on Aslan in a pronounced agitated state.
That episode is the one that audiences thought “funniest,” says Aslan. Aslan also knows that you can't possibly create a show about world religions without stoking controversy and offending someone, somewhere.
“This is the kind of show that you are either love or you hate,” he says. “I've never met anyone who was lukewarm about this show. It's like, this is either the best show I've ever seen, or this is an abomination — you should be burned alive.”

Canada's population is aging rapidly and as baby boomers are delaying retirement, the workforce is also growing older, according to a new study from Statistics Canada (StatsCan).
StatsCan reports that in 2016, 38% of Canadians aged 55 and older were still in the workforce, which represents the highest proportion since data has been collected (starting in 1976). In 1996, just 24% of older Canadians were still working.
The increase in labour force participation was widespread across age groups, including seniors aged 65 and older and across all categories of educational attainment, the StatsCan report says. Among seniors, 14% were still working in 2016, up from just 6% in 1996, StatsCan reports.
Several factors are driving the increase in labour force participation among older Canadians, including an increase in the educational attainment, the report says.
"However, more than half of the overall increase in the labour market participation of seniors are due to other … factors," the StatsCan report says. "These factors could include an increase in the debt levels of older Canadians, increased wages and more favourable employment opportunities, or better health."
The aging of the Canadian workforce tracks the aging of the overall population. In 2016, the 55-plus category accounted for a record 36% of the working age population; this is forecasted to grow to 40% by 2026. Ultimately, this trend "will create a challenge for the labour market, government finances and the health-care system," the study says.
"As baby boomers age, it is unclear whether the labour market participation of older Canadians will continue to increase into the future," the report says, although it notes that factors such as longer life expectancy, debt levels and job opportunities may help sustain the trend.

WASHINGTON – While the U.S. president trashes NAFTA as a one-sided, job-killing disaster possibly worth scrapping, the man who will lead the American negotiating team when talks start this week is an old proponent of the accord.
U.S. chief negotiator John Melle has sung NAFTA's praises in the past.
He's a career bureaucrat and unlike the boss in several ways: mastery of details, encyclopedic knowledge of Canada and Mexico, understated sense of humour and a work vocabulary that forgoes talk of good guys versus bad.
Melle's worldview, according to friends, is that nobody's a saint when it comes to free trade; everyone's a bit of a protectionist sinner, and, if their mutual interests align, they just might get along and get a deal.

He once praised the three-way pact with Canada and Mexico before the U.S. Congress.
“NAFTA partners today are not only better customers of one another, but better neighbours, more committed partners and more effective colleagues,” Melle told a Senate hearing on NAFTA's 12th anniversary, in 2006.
He listed positive developments in the United States since NAFTA, which he worked on earlier in his career at the office of the United States Trade Representative.

He cited a major unemployment drop – from 7.1 per cent in the dozen years pre-NAFTA, to 5.1 per cent in the years after; a near-doubling in the growth rate of U.S. industrial production; even a five-fold increase in the growth rate of manufacturing output.
The first round of negotiations for a new NAFTA begins Wednesday in Washington.

A Canadian friend says both countries are lucky Melle is at the table. Laura Dawson said talks will be less problem-prone than under someone with superficial knowledge of the trade file who needs a primer on every issue.
Melle apparently carries a trade encyclopedia in his head.
“I've been doing trade for 20 years,” said Dawson. “And John has forgotten more than I ever knew. On an issue like softwood lumber when I would be like, ‘How does this work? And what happens there?' he could go back through all the iterations of softwood and explain how this worked, and that, and why. Just a depth of knowledge.”
A former supervisor says the depth of experience gives him hope the countries might achieve the otherwise impossible mission handed them: completing a trade negotiation in just a few months, before the Mexican election.
The negotiators know their files and each other and can start working quickly, said Robert Holleyman, a former deputy U.S. trade representative.

“John Melle is a great guy – a longtime hand,” said Holleyman, now president at C&M International in Washington.
“There's less posturing (with these professionals); they can roll up their sleeves, get down to business. … They can avoid the small talk and get down to, ‘Okay, how do we work this out?”‘
Chris Sands, a Canada-watcher at Johns Hopkins University, said Melle won't mind being tough with Canadians.
VIDEO: NAFTA renegotiation could make online shopping from U.S. less costly
Sands said the northern neighbour has a habit of resorting to the victim card in talks with the U.S., arguing for a better deal because it's friendly or harmless to the U.S.
That won't work on Melle, Sands said.
Unlike some in the U.S. government, he said, Melle does not see the neighbour through rose-coloured glasses. Rather, he's a clear-eyed realist for whom nations act in their own perceived interest.
READ MORE: Rona Ambrose on Liberal government's NAFTA advisory council
Sands says he sees all countries as guilty of hypocrisy on trade – preaching open commerce, while practising protectionism. That includes the northern neighbour, with Canada's import controls in dairy, telecommunications, banking and alcohol.
“He's a bit of a cynic on that kind of thing – I think, with justice,” Sands said.
“Every deal is transactional (to him like), ‘If you do that, it's because it's in your interest. If we do this, it's because it's in ours. We'll try to do a deal.' But from the position that nobody's innocent here …
“You almost have to do that with the Canadians. Because if you fall for their lovability they had you at, ‘Hello'.”
Canada-U.S. trade lawyer Mark Warner employs a more vivid metaphor: “He knows where all the bodies are buried.”

When Canadians claim to be free-traders, Warner said, Melle can quickly point to restrictions on U.S. wine in Canadian stores.
“You're not going to put one over on him.”
In addition, the most sensitive decisions won't be made by the negotiators. They will turn to their bosses, the ministers responsible for trade. The ultimate signoff on any deal, eventually, comes from the big boss.
In Melle's case, that means Trump.

Crops are divided into following categories: short term, medium term, long term.
Short term- Seeking to restore food base.
Program: ‘Grow to Eat', which is immediately effective seeks to encourage everyone with access to land to grow food crops for consumption and/or resale.
Some farmers are selling provisions and some vegetables on the roadside but soon vegetables are projected to be in short supply.
The aim is to have a range healthy vegetables available between 6 weeks and 3 months.
Short term crop varieties have been identified to plant.
There will be distribution of seeds by Monday, October 9th.
Government has placed an order for white potatoes which may be harvested in 6 weeks.
Officials are also planning on sending teams of persons to help farmers clear their land and till their soil.
Medium to long term plants include root tubers: dasheen, yam, cassava.
Longer term plants include: tree crops, bananas, etc..
Fertilizer is ready for banana farmers and possibly root crop farmers.
Organic fertilizer is being imported from Martinique.
Forestry land has been severely impacted and seedlings for reforestation are being immediately procured for forest management and tree planting along water sheds.
Fisheries- Roseau complex has totally caved in and declared uninhabitable, however the Marigot and Portsmouth fisheries complexes are operable.

Golf - The 146th Open Championship - Royal Birkdale - Southport, Britain - July 20, 2017 India's Anirban Lahiri hits his tee shot on the fifth hole during the first round
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - A disappointed Anirban Lahiri has given up hope of winning the PGA Championship but is eyeing an under-par finish, he said after falling 11 strokes behind second-round leaders Hideki Matsuyama and Rory McIlroy on Friday.
Lahiri played a bogey-free back nine crowned by a birdie at the last to overcome a loose first nine and post a two-over 73, qualifying for weekend play at Quail Hollow.
The 30-year-old Indian, who tied for second at the Memorial tournament in June, expected more of himself.
"I'm actually quite disappointed with where I am, honestly, but that's the way it is right now," Lahiri told Reuters after signing for a three-over 145 halfway total.
"I think I've been playing pretty good. It's just these last two days I haven't scored very well. I missed a lot of putts, had a bunch of three-putts. I think around the green has been poor, but I think tee to green I have been pretty solid.
"I will try to improve on the weekend and try to get a couple of scores under par."
Lahiri said the firmness and speed of the new greens at Quail Hollow has been perplexing.
"It's a very demanding golf course. You have to be good off the tee and I've done that. So I've done the hard part, right?
"But it's also demanding on and around the greens. And I think that is the department where I've struggled this week so far," he said.
Lahiri said the roll-outs down grain on the contoured greens can be severe. "That's just how it is. That's rub of the green for you," he said.
Lahiri, who finished fifth at the 2015 PGA Championship, had a specific goal in mind.
"I just want to see if I can get a couple of rounds in the 60s," he said. "I think I'm playing well enough to shoot a couple of good scores under par. I want to finish the tournament in red figures."

"We don't anticipate that this is going to cause a devastating impact to New Orleans or exceed the ability for the pumps," Gov. Jon Bel Edwards said Thursday.
The storm is expected to become a hurricane before making landfall late Saturday or early Sunday. Landrieu said forecasts are for New Orleans to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimetres) of rain, which its pumps can handle.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency in six southernmost counties. State officials, at a briefing Friday in Gulfport, warned that Nate's main danger in that state will be from up to 10 feet (3 metres) of storm surge in low-lying coastal areas, as well as from winds that could damage mobile homes.
"If you are in an area that has flooded, I would recommend you evacuate that area until the storm has ended and the water has receded for your own personal safety and for the safety of the first responders that will be responding in the event you are trapped," Bryant said.
Dozens of offshore oil and gas platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have been evacuated as Nate churns through warm waters.
The storm threatened to disrupt one of the Mississippi coast's biggest annual tourist events, the "Cruisin' the Coast" auto show. Biloxi firefighters warned more than 700 recreational vehicle campers that they may need to leave early. The event continued as normal Friday, but Saturday's events were cancelled, replaced by a brief closing ceremony.
The northern Gulf Coast areas targeted by Nate largely have been spared the worst effects of a catastrophic hurricane season, but Louisiana's emergency declaration for Nate isn't its first since the start of summer. In August, a weakened Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Louisiana after dealing a devastating blow to Texas and then nudging back into the Gulf of Mexico. Edwards also issued an emergency declaration in August for storm-related flooding in New Orleans.
On Alabama's Dauphin Island, owners hauled boats out of the water ahead of the storm and tourists cancelled beach reservations for the weekend. The major concern was that Nate's storm surge was projected to coincide with high tide.
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director Lee Smithson expressed confidence that the federal government would be able to provide help to Mississippi even as the Federal Emergency Management Agency continues to respond to previous hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
Bryant authorized the use of the Mississippi National Guard to respond to any damage. Officials said they would open 11 evacuation shelters in areas away from the immediate coast, and that the regional bus system could transport people who can't drive to shelters on their own.
"This is a fast-moving storm," Smithson said.

The Richmond, Virginia band Left Cross play a fast, brutal, almost feverish version of old-school death metal, their lo-fi production gurgle helping their songs descend into blurry murk. The band serves as a sort of unifier between Richmond's thriving punk and metal scenes; while the music is pure metal, the politics and context aren't too far removed from crust punk. The band just came out with a new album called Chaos Ascension, and it sounds like a monster. Stream it below.

A Tom Thomson painting that was given away as a gag gift just months ago fetched $481,250 on Wednesday night at the Heffel Fine Art Auction House semi-annual auction in Toronto.
Until recently, “Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park” was collecting dust among a pile of artworks in Glenna Gardiner's Edmonton basement.
The 71-year-old retired nurse said she used to laugh off her late father's claims that the painting was created by Thomson, often considered the forefather to the Group of Seven.

Watch below: On March 30 2018, Julia Wong spoke to an Edmonton woman who got the shock of her life when she found out she was the owner of a very rare painting.
The work's origins became a running joke between Gardiner and a longtime friend, who insisted it was authentic, leading Gardiner to present it as a gag gift.
The two brought it to Heffel Fine Art Auction House for appraisal, where experts verified its pedigree and valued the sketch at between $125,000 and $175,000.
The two friends will be taking a Mediterranean cruise with the profits, Heffel said in a release.
Wednesday's auction of 118 works — which raised a total of $14.1 million — included pieces by Paul-Emile Borduas, whose 1956 masterpiece “Figures schematiques” led the auction by fetching $3.6 million — an auction record for the artist.
“Morning, Lake Superior” by Group of Seven founder Lawren Harris sold for $1.1 million — far above the pre-sale estimate of between $100,000 and $150,000. The small work is described as a preparatory sketch for a pivotal canvas by the artist, hanging in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.
Other Group of Seven paintings offered in the auction included A.J. Casson's “Farmhouse Near Wingle.” The canvas also sold well over the pre-sale estimate at $541,250 (est. $150,000 — $250,000).
Other highlights include “Strawberry,” a large-scale canvas by Jack Bush, which set an artist record by selling for $691,250.
Two works by Quebec-born Jean Paul Lemieux sold at above pre-sale estimates. “Le Cavalier dans la neige” sold for $841,250 and “Le temps retrouve — Kent House 1913” fetched $391,250.

NEW DELHI: The government's ambitious mega health care programme for 10 crore poor families will roll out by October 2 and is to be funded in a 60:40 proportion by the Centre and states, with the premium per family estimated at Rs 1,000-1,200.Ten crore families or 50 crore beneficiaries, classified as 'deprived' in the socio-economic caste census of 2011, will be covered by the scheme. It will be a cashless Aadhaar-linked facility with beneficiaries availing treatment anywhere in the country in empanelled private or public hospitals.With some experts questioning how the scheme will be funded and the quantum of premium, Niti Aayog has calculated an outgo of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore a year for the Centre and is confident of successful implementation with the help of low premiums it hopes to get from insurance firms.To substantiate their optimism, government sources pointed out that the Rajasthan government currently offers a cover of Rs 3.75 lakh a year for a premium of Rs 500 per family and the utilisation or claims rate is around 2.5%.Officials said the national health protection scheme unveiled by finance minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament on Thursday is much larger and, thus, offers considerable leeway for striking a bargain with insurers.Officials said various state schemes and global examples had been studied by Niti Aayog before a presentation was made to PM Narendra Modi and the FM.As of now, Budget 2018-19 has allocated only Rs 2,000 crore for the existing insurance scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, which will be channelised for implementing NHPS initially.Director-general of health services Dr B D Athani said NHPS would help reduce impoverishment due to high cost of treatment. "Nearly six to seven crore people fall into poverty every year due to medical expenses. The insurance scheme will help check this trend," he said.Allaying fears about funding of the ambitious project, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said the government would have additional resources of Rs 11,000 crore through the additional 1% cess introduced in the Budget."The expected coverage for the first year based on states' acceptance is 50%. The government will require Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 crore to start the scheme," said Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.Health minister J P Nadda held a media briefing to allay concerns over the scheme, touted as the world's largest government-funded healthcare programme, and along with Niti Aayog outlined financing as well as a timeline for implementation and rejected the opposition's charge that NHPS is a 'jumla'.Paul said the Aayog has been working on the project for one-and-a-half years. "We have held meetings with state representatives also on the issue. Further meetings will be held over the next few days to work out the nitty-gritty so that the scheme is available to beneficiaries by October 2," Dr Paul said.NHPS will replace RSBY, which was launched in early 2008 for those below the pover-ty line (BPL) and provided an annual coverage of only Rs 30,000.States like Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu run their medical insurance schemes where most of the premium is borne by the state while in some cases beneficiaries pay a token amount. However, coverage is only up to Rs 3 lakh.Paul said once NHPS comes into force, states will have to align with its procedures but will have the flexibility on how to implement it. "The states can choose to rope in a public insurance company or create a trust to run the insurance scheme," he added.
CALGARY—Calgary is becoming a city to be reckoned with in Canada's skateboarding landscape. We now have more than 35,000 skateboarders (and counting), according to the City of Calgary — including even more women. Skateboarders can shred a different park every day of the week, a far cry from what our city's skating scene looked like less than a decade ago.
Spencer Corbett, 24, has been skateboarding since he was 11, and has witnessed its growth in the city to the point where Calgary is mentioned in the same breath as Canada's skateboarding hubs, Vancouver and Toronto. ( Ruwald de Fortier / For StarMetro Calgary )
There are more than 10 new skateboard parks operational or under development in Calgary and neighbouring towns. “I'd say it's a complete, almost polar, opposite,” said Spencer Corbett, brand director, team manager and event co-ordinator for the board shop The Source. “Before, there was only one skateboard park (Shaw Millennium Park, Calgary's oldest operating skate park and, according to the city, Canada's largest outdoor skate park), and it was the hub for all skateboarders. You wouldn't find skateboarders in suburbs or anywhere, everyone just met downtown and it was a very small community.”

Now “there are endless options,” Corbett said, adding that with all the new options in the city, the perception of skateboarding has shifted for the good. Corbett, now 24, began skateboarding at age 11 in Calgary. He said he started because his family couldn't afford team sports. And because of skateboarding's very as-solitary-or-social-as-you'd-like-it and bare-bones nature, it was an easy sport to keep up with while growing up in a family of a single parent with four kids. At one point in his career, Corbett said he rode for brand sponsors for everything from shoes to boards, and based most of his work out of Calgary. He said that Calgary wasn't (and still isn't, exactly) a hot spot for those looking to transition to the professional level, but our city ranks third in the country behind Toronto and Vancouver, Canada's skateboarding capital. What keeps Corbett and other skateboarders invested for such long periods of time? Corbett said it's the creative aspect of skating that fuels most people's fires.
“It's like your own art form, it's your own piece of work. It's like your paintbrush and the city's your canvas kind of thing,” he said. “You're able to just create your own masterpiece out of it, and everyone's skating's different, so just the never-ending evolving of different tricks and what it brings.”

And to further boost Calgary's skateboarding cachet, the city now boasts a Ninetimes skate store downtown, and officials with skateboard shoe king Vans paid a visit in April with a House of Vans pop-up event, paying homage to Calgary's skateboarding history. Corbett said The Source is also working on its first full-length skateboarding movie, and recently sent 20-years-old team member Ashton Dobler to New York City to film him skating in one of the skateboarding hotbeds of the United States. “It was the best 10 days of my life,” said Dobler. “People are kind of realizing that skating is a good thing and it brings good things to the community now, that these parks have showed up,” he said, adding Shaw Millennium Park used to be seen as a seedier part of the city, but that's changing now thanks to more families getting into skateboarding. Corbett has also seen the positive ripple effects for neighbourhoods. “Especially (in) today's day and age, kids are always inside playing video games or watching TV and whatnot. (Skateboarding) kind of comes back to our roots and gets kids outside again. “It gives the community more of a personality, as well.” Plus, Corbett said, since skateboarders always have each other's backs, it's “one of the more accepting communities.” “It doesn't matter where you come from, your ethnicity, who you are, it's very accepting. “It looks badass and it's fun.”

A little after 4:30 p.m. ET, Delilah Cassidy tweeted about a potential travel disaster that ended with a chance interaction with Gresham, who, essentially, swooped in to save her day all for $50.
Cassidy, who, according to her twitter profile attends law school at Arizona State, was boarding a flight when she was informed by the American Airlines gate agent that she would have to pay to carry her bag on. She tried to consolidate her bags but, after measuring them, the gate agent told her she would have to pay $50.
Cassidy, who had just returned from a European trip, said her credit cards weren't working yet. She tried to pay cash at the gate, but the agent told her she'd have to go back to the ticket counter to pay with cash. That would've meant she would miss her flight.
She tried to plead with the gate agent, who wouldn't budge. Just then, Gresham, who Cassidy didn't recognize, came up and asked how much the charge was. He was told $50 and said, "I got it," Cassidy tweeted.
"I'm astonished and tell him it's fine not to worry and he hands the lady his card as the American Airlines employees stand in silence shocked by this man's generosity. They swipe the card and he tells me to have a great flight and hop on board," Cassidy tweeted.
Once on board, she tried to offer Gresham, who she still didn't recognize, cash as she passed by him in first class. He wouldn't accept it and told Cassidy to pay it forward.
"I'm crying as I write this and as I board the flight. This man was an angel," she tweeted.
It wasn't until after her flight that she found out the man who helped her was Gresham.

Las Vegas-based data center operator, Switch, went public on the New York Stock Exchange today, under the ticker “SWCH.”
After pricing its IPO above the proposed range at $17, the company closed at $20.73, up almost 22%. The company raised $531 million in its offering.
Here's how Switch describes itself in its filing: “We believe we are a pioneer in the design, construction and operation of some of the world's most reliable, secure, resilient and sustainable data centers. Our advanced data centers are the center of our platform and provide power densities that exceed industry averages with efficient cooling, while being powered by 100% renewable energy.”
Switch has over 800 customers and considers eBay its largest.
The company brought in $318 million in revenue last year, compared to $266 million the year before. Profits went down from $73 million in 2015 to $31 million in 2016. The first half of this year saw $35 million in profit, flat with the same period in 2016.
Intel Capital was the largest venture backer, which owned 5.3% prior to the IPO. Switch raised an undisclosed amount of funding since it was formed in 2000.
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BMO Capital Markets and Wells Fargo Securities were the bankers underwriting the IPO. Latham & Watkins and Goodwin Procter served as counsel.
Chris Singleton, a Goose Creek native who plays collegiately at Charleston Southern, was chosen in the 19th round of the Major League Draft with the 585th overall pick on Thursday.
Singleton, who was thrust into the national spotlight when his mother was one of nine people killed in the Emanuel AME Church shooting, just finished his junior season with the Buccaneers.
The Lowcountry native hit .276 for CSU in 2017 with 4 homers and 21 RBI.
In 2015, just a day after his mother, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, was killed in the church shooting, Singleton spoke to reporters publicly forgave the shooter. His words "Love is stronger than hate" swept across the nation.
An urgent appeal has been issued by the NHS for two regularly required blood types after an increase in demand and the bank holiday weekend has left a significant stock shortage.
Levels of blood types O negative, the "universal" blood group often used in an emergency when a patient's blood type is not known, and B negative, which is required by patients with serious blood disorders like sickle cell, are in short supply.
The bank holiday weekend saw a drop off in the number of donors giving blood, meaning that the stocks of these two groups could fall below two days' worth.
Ideally, around six days' worth of stock of all respective blood groups is needed.
Other long-term factors that have hindered healthy levels of O negative blood include the increasing use of it as an emergency substitute for Ro blood.
This is a rare blood sub-type more common in black people, but many don't know they have it until they donate and there is currently a huge shortage of Ro blood donors.
Levels of B negative, also a blood group more common in black people, are low because many patients with serious blood disorders like sickle cell, a disease which affects red blood cells, need it.
Currently there are 15,000 people living with sickle cell in the UK and over 300 new babies are born each year with the condition.
The NHS Blood and Transplant unit is struggling to match these demands.
There is currently an urgent appeal for more people from the black community to give blood, as NHS Blood and Transplant needs at least 40,000 new black donors to help patients of sickle cell.
Over 7,000 have come forward since the appeal last June, but more are needed to help ease the pressure on blood stocks.
Mike Stredder, director of blood donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: "The overall demand for blood is declining year on year. However, the need for specific blood groups such as Ro blood type and O negative are on the increase.
"We need an additional 4,000 regular O negative donors to those we have now to consistently provide seriously ill patients with the blood they need. If you know you are O negative or B negative and have never donated before, now is the time to make a difference.
"If you are O or B negative, please call us on 0300 123 23 23 to get a priority appointment or walk in to one of our fixed site donor centres to give blood."

The USWNT will face South Korea in a pair of friendlies late this October. | Source: Francine Scott - VAVEL USA
US Soccer announced earlier today that the US Women's National Team will be playing in October friendlies against the Korea Republic. They will first be playing Thursday, October 19th in New Orleans, Louisiana. The venue will be at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, home to the NFL's New Orleans Saints. Kickoff is scheduled for 8 pm ET. The last time the U.S.A. played in New Orleans was against China PR on December 16, 2015. It was the last game of the United States' Victory Tour for winning the Women's World Cup that year, and it was also the last game of U.S. WNT legend, Abby Wambach. They ended their Victory Tour and the year, though, in a 1-0 loss.
On October 22nd, the U.S. WNT will make an appearance in Cary, North Carolina at Sahlen's Stadium. It will be the first time since 2014 that the U.S. WNT has played at WakeMed Soccer Park, where they last beat Sweden 4-1. Sahlen's Stadium and WakeMed Soccer Park are home to North Carolina FC and the NWSL's North Carolina Courage. Several players from the Courage have made appearances on the national team. In the most recent call-up for the Tournament of Nations, four Courage players made the roster including (defenders) Abby Dahlkemper, Taylor Smith, (midfielder) Sam Mewis, and (forward) Lynn Williams. Each player made an appearance at least once throughout the tournament. Jaelene Hinkle and Ashley Hatch have also been previously called up to the national team. Kickoff for the match against the Korea Republic has been scheduled for 2 pm ET.

Against the Korea Republic, the United States leads the overall record with seven wins, zero draws, and two ties. The last time these two teams faced off was on May 30th, 2015, just before the Women's World Cup that the U.S. would end up winning. That match ended in a 0-0 draw, so it is expected that a technical team like the Korea Republic (ranked 16th in the world) will play a good game against the top-ranked U.S. WNT.
To any fans interested in going to either game, tickets will go on sale August 18th at 10 am local time. Fans that are looking to purchase tickets for the North Carolina game are encouraged to do so as soon as tickets go on sale because the match is expected to sell out early due to limited seating capacity. Sahlen's stadium can only seat 10,000 fans, while Mercedes-Benz Superdome can seat over 76,000 fans, so it is encouraged that fans act early to secure a seat

Detroit — National Republican Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel on Monday denounced violence that erupted during a white nationalist rally in Virginia over the weekend, saying “it's unacceptable” and “not welcome” in the Republican Party.
McDaniel made the remarks in advance of a planned roundtable discussion in Detroit with several dozen area business leaders, clergy and representatives of community groups.
The weekend rally in Charlottesville was held by those opposing a plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The event erupted into chaos, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency and turned deadly as a driver plowed into the crowd.
“As chairman of the Republican Party I want to be perfectly clear that white supremacy, neo-Nazi, KKK and hate speech and bigotry is not welcome and does not have a home in the Republican Party,” said McDaniel, who extended thoughts and prayers to the victims.

“We are going to continue conversations and engage in a dialogue that helps us move forward, because what we saw this weekend shows that we need more work done in moving forward and ... uniting this country,” she added, prior to the closed-door session at the party offices on Livernois.
“This office symbolizes to me the conversation we need to have across this country as to how do we break down these walls of racism and bigotry that clearly still exist. By being a Republican office in Detroit for four years that never shuts its doors, we are committed to continuing to fight for ways that we can move beyond our hateful past and create a brighter future of unity across the country.”
McDaniel, who was elected RNC chair in January, also defended President Donald Trump's early response to the tragedy, which earned him criticism from Democrats and Republicans after he blamed bigotry on “many sides.”
Trump, she said, has come out against “bigotry and racism and hate in all its forms” and today, she believes he'll go even further.
“All of our leaders have to do that across party lines,” she said. “This isn't a partisan issue, this is an American issue.”
Michigan Republican Party Chairman Ron Weiser, who co-hosted Monday's roundtable, added the extremists “do not speak for me or the Republican Party.”
“Together we can fight against racism and hatred and talk to each other about what matters,” he said. “If we do that, then we honor the best of America.”
Facing backlash over his initial reaction, Trump condemned hate groups as “repugnant” and declared “racism is evil” in remarks delivered Monday at the White House.
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Brandon Dillon contends Trump's delay in addressing the tragedy and his initial suggestion that both sides have some culpability has “emboldened” the groups. The public comments offered Monday by the president didn't rectify it, Dillon said.
“He gave a very boilerplate statement denouncing racism and saying that these groups are bad, which is something that obviously is the minimum bar for anybody holding elected office,” he said.
“It's a tragedy what happened in Charlottesville. Unfortunately, I think we are going to see more and more of this as these Nazis and others are emboldened because the president of the United States and others won't take them on,” Dillon said. “We have to confront this head-on. Any equivocation in denouncing this kind of people is un-American and not sharing the values this country stands for.”
Monday's roundtable is the fourth held at the Detroit GOP office over the last year. Past sessions have featured Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and Donald Trump Jr., among others, officials said.
The private discussion was expected to cover education, criminal justice reform, jobs and the economy.
“For far too long, Democrats have taken urban centers for granted and truthfully Republicans have not been reaching out to the extent we should,” Weiser said in his brief opening remarks. “We are trying to change that.”
Dillon countered that not only does the Democratic Party reach out and have grassroots organizers in Detroit, they also have elected Democratic officials who are always working with their constituents.
“Is everything perfect? Absolutely not. But the idea that somehow Republicans are better served to address issues of urban centers is preposterous on its face,” said Dillon.
McDaniel on Monday touted Trump's efforts to improve economic policies to benefit the country's urban areas. She said consumer confidence is up as is the job rate and touted the presidents tax reform plans.
She also stood behind Trump's response to North Korea's nuclear program and said he has demonstrated that he will not tolerate an attack on the United States, including a territory such as Guam.

A Jewish organization is calling on Vancouver's elected officials to speak out regarding anti-Israeli protests that happened over the weekend.
B'nai Brith Canada Spokesperson Aidan Fishman says some protesters spewed hate at Jews who attended to show their support for Israel.
READ MORE: What does Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean for the city's status?
He says Israeli flag was ripped up, and another painted on a piece of cardboard was burned.
“We obviously don't expect the mayor to take a position on the Jerusalem issue – that's not even the point. But we do expect the mayor and other city officials to state unequivocally and on the record that hatred and intimidation will not be allowed in the public square.”
Fishman says there's no place for that kind of behaviour.
“It's one thing to disagree over policy issues, like where Israel's capital should be or how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be solved. But one way it definitely can't be solved is by literally burning the other side's national symbols.”
The Canada Palestine Association says while it didn't organize Saturday's rally at the Vancouver Art Gallery, it says it does not consider burning the flag of Israel an anti-semitic gesture, and don't equate all Jewish people with Israel.
The Mayor of Vancouver has not yet responded to a request for comment.
The protests were in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's naming of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of American international policy.

London firefighters remain on the scene of an early morning blaze at a south London auto body shop Tuesday.
Fire crews were called to Quality Auto Body & Collision at 4192 Perkins Rd. near White Oak Road and Exeter Road at around 5:18 a.m.
London District Fire Chief Al Braatz said officers from Engine 9 were first on the scene.
“They saw fire and smoke at the southern unit through the windows and it was pretty heavy,” he said.
“They knocked down a fair bit of fire from the outside before making entry. They worked very hard to get the fire out.”
There were no injuries reported.
The fire has been extinguished but the cause remains under investigation.
“Right now we're just in the very early stages of our fire investigation,” said fire inspector Jack Burt.
“We'll be here for a few hours today trying to figure out the origin, circumstances and cause of this fire.”
A total damage estimate has not been made.
Troubled credit lender Provident Financial has appointed acting chairman Malcolm Le May as its CEO with immediate effect.​
Mr ​Le May, who was appointed to ​Bradford-based Provident's board in 2014, fills a position that has been open since August, when a second profit warning prompted the departure of CEO Peter Crook.​
Provident has been hit by problems at its door-to-door lending operation and the group's troubles have been compounded by investigations by the financial watchdog into two of its businesses.
​Mr ​Le May said that his key objective is to execute a turnaround of the group, resolve the regulatory issues and make progress at the home credit business.
The company said the home credit arm “continued to make good operational progress” and that talks continue with the Financial Conduct Authority relating to investigations of its Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn business-es.
Provident expects to report a loss of about ​£​120​m in its consumer credit division for 2017 as it struggles to win back customers.
The firm first warned about problems at its door-to-door lending operation in late June after a botched reorganisation led to a shortage of staff.
Senior independent director Stuart Sinclair will take over as acting chairman as the company begins the process of appointing a new external chairman​.
Analyst Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: “The decision to make a permanent appointment from within will perhaps come as a surprise to some who may have hoped for a fresher pair of eyes.
“Furthermore, it suggests to us that the group has struggled to attract a suitable external candidate, which is perhaps not surprising given the multitude of issues facing the company, being both operational (the well-reported issues with the Home Credit business) and regulatory.
“That said, we view Mr Le May as a very able and well-respected candidate, who is more than capable of tackling what is currently a challenging situation for the group.”
CHICAGO, IL (April 16, 2017) /PRNewswire/ — Kicking off their first season as Official Bourbon of the Chicago Cubs, Jim Beam® Bourbon is releasing Jim Beam® “Game 7 Batch,” a limited edition expression and commemorative label featuring bourbon that completed its 4 years of barrel maturation the history-making date of the Cubs' Game 7 World Championship game last fall and set aside for release in the 2017 season.
To celebrate this first-ever release of a unique batch of Jim Beam's 4-year Kentucky Straight Bourbon, global partner Mila Kunis visited Wrigley Field on Saturday, April 15, to throw out the game's ceremonial first pitch before surprising bar goers with a preview of the product, which will be available in limited quantities at select Chicagoland retailers starting in June 2017.
Jim Beam® Bourbon brought Mila Kunis to The Cubby Bear and other iconic Wrigleyville bars on Saturday April 15, 2017 to surprise fans with a toast to the season and a preview of the new limited edition Jim Beam® “Game 7 Batch,” a hand selected batch of bourbon that completed its 4 years of barrel maturation the history making date of the Cubs' Game 7 World Championship game last fall.Jim Beam® “Game 7 Batch”
With appearances at three of the neighborhood's most iconic Wrigleyville bars, Kunis gave unsuspecting Cubs fans a sneak peek at the limited edition Jim Beam® “Game 7 Batch” bottle and toasted the crowd to another historic season.
“We're proud to call the Chicago Cubs part of our growing family, so in celebration of the Cubs' history-making victory, we wanted to release a history-making bourbon for the occasion,” said Jim Beam's 7th Generation Master Distiller Fred Noe. “This exclusive Jim Beam® ‘Game 7 Batch' is our gift to the fans in Chicago from our home in Kentucky.”
“We love to see passion between our team and our Legacy Partners, and Jim Beam's ‘Game 7 Batch' is a perfect example of two historic brands coming together in the spirit of celebration,” said Chicago Cubs President of Baseball Operations, Crane Kenney.
Jim Beam “Game 7 Batch,” created with a hint of victory, is aged 4 years; however, this hand-selected batch features liquid that was completed its barrel maturation on the exact day the Cubs won the World Championship, delivering an oak vanilla aroma and a sweet finish that mirrors the ending of last year's historic season. The product, packaged with a commemorative blue cap, batch sticker and specialty label to celebrate Cubs heritage, has a suggested retail price of $17.99 for 750mL and will be available for purchase in the Chicagoland area this June.

Back in the early '00s, Bump J was a young king of Chicago rap, a name who constantly came up in next-to-blow conversations. But it never quite panned out for Bump J, and he spent most of the past decade in prison for a 2007 bank robbery in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. But Bump got out of prison last month and almost immediately released the anthemic comeback single “Good 2 Be Home.” And now he's teamed up with two fellow rap veterans, Yo Gotti and Pusha T, on the hammering, purposeful “Fuck Up The Summa.” Check it out below, via Fake Shore Drive.
No word yet on a new Bump J album or mixtape, but, I mean, give him time.
Leeds County OPP say they witnessed disturbing scenes of motorists taking their eyes off the road, to shoot video of a recent multi-vehicle pileup on Highway 401. That's distracted driving and it doesn't sit well with Const. Sandra Barr, who works media relations with the Leeds Grenville OPP.
“If you're not concentrating on the road, if you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing, which is driving, then it's a collision waiting to happen.”
The plea comes after an accident Wednesday near Mallorytown, west of Brockville. Police say drivers were using their cell phones to film the 11-vehicle pileup as they drove past. Barr says a need to fill that social media fix isn't worth it.
“We're asking people to simply stop doing that. It's dangerous, it's against the law, it's illegal. We know that it's distracted driving. I'm not sure what word… what words can we say to get people to stop doing that, I don't know what it is. So we're asking people, we're putting out a plea, stop doing that.”

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas legislators who favor balancing the state budget with a big income tax increase are preparing to test fellow lawmakers' appetite for such a fix.
The state House was planning to debate a bill Wednesday that would boost personal income taxes to raise more than $1 billion over two years, starting in July. The measure would abandon core policies championed by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback.
The measure has bipartisan support but Republicans in the GOP-controlled House are split.
Kansas faces budget shortfalls totaling nearly $1.1 billion through June 2019. The state has experienced persistent financial problems since Republican lawmakers slashed personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at Brownback's urging.
The bill would end an exemption for more than 330,000 farmers and business owners and boost income tax rates.
A Gray man was arrested Friday after Laurel County Sheriff's deputies say he tried to take a vehicle, only to be stopped by the owner last Friday night.
Deputies arrested Jerry R. Mosley, 42, in a parking lot off of West Cumberland Gap Parkway.
Deputy Gilbert Acciardo, the department's public affairs officer, said deputies were called to the business about 7 p.m. in response to a complaint that an individual, later identified as Mosley, had allegedly attempted to steal a parked vehicle only to have the owner pull him out of the vehicle.
“He then traveled across the road to another business where he attempted to open the door of another vehicle,” Acciardo said noting he was pulled out of that vehicle as well.
Deputy Rick Cloyd responded to the call, taking Mosley into custody on charges of theft of a motor vehicle of the value of $10,000 or more but less than $1 million and second-degree disorderly conduct.
Mosley is being held in the Laurel County Correctional Facility on a $10,000 cash bond.
Mosley is scheduled to be arraigned today in Laurel District Court.

KARACHI - United Bank Limited (UBL), a prominent department with a rich history on the Pakistan domestic circuit, is considering scrapping its cricket team. UBL only returned to the fray seven years ago in 2011 after missing 15 seasons between 1997 and 2010. ESPNcricinfo understands financial considerations are the major reason, with the bank deciding to review its investment in sports.
UBL downplayed the development, but one official confirmed that several options were on the table, including the possibility of disbanding the cricket team. The players have not been informed yet but the PCB has been informed about the motion - though they denied any official confirmation. If UBL pull out, which is likely, they will also lose their representation at the PCB governing body, with the bank having been on the board for the last four-and-a-half years.
Since the team's return in 2011, Pakistan's domestic cricket has been revamped multiple times, but UBL consistently finished among the top four teams in the circuit. They played the President's Trophy final in 2014, losing to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), and lost to the same opponent in the 2016 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (QEA) final. Since being established in 1975, UBL have won the QEA four times, the Pentangular Cup three times, and the Patron's Trophy once, in addition to several limited-overs titles.
In each era, they invested significantly in young talent, with players like Waqar Younis, Tauseef Ahmed, Mudassar Nazar, Basit Ali, Saeed Anwar, Mushtaq Ahmed, Salim Jaffer, Rashid Latif, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Azhar Mahmood playing for the franchise. The present lot, including Shan Masood, Saad Ali, Sohaib Maqsood, Mohammad Asghar, Mir Hamza, Rumman Raees and Umar Akmal have been nurtured at UBL under the mentorship of Younis Khan.
The influx of banks into Pakistan's domestic cricket began in the early 70s, with Abdul Hafeez Kardar, the then PCB chairman, encouraging them to provide employment opportunities for players. UBL emerged after a merger with the now defunct Commerce Bank, which had been on the first-class scene since 1973.
UBL had a large sports department covering cricket, hockey, badminton and table tennis actively until 1997, when it shut following the privatisation of the bank and a change in management. It also owns a sports complex in Karachi with its own first-class cricket ground.
Veteran hockey broadcaster Don Cherry is facing backlash after appearing to deny the existence of climate change and calling people who believe in the widely accepted phenomenon “cuckaloos.”
Cherry, 83, made the remarks to co-commentator Ron MacLean on Saturday night during the first intermission of the game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins, a day after Ontario's newest forecasting groundhog Wiarton Willie signalled six more weeks of winter.

During his “Coach's Corner” segment, Cherry, seated behind a plush groundhog toy, asked MacLean if he and his “left-wing pinko friends” could explain their fears over rising temperatures in light of the prevailing cold weather.
MacLean tried to deflect the question, but Cherry insisted, “I'm just asking you, the cuckaloos are always saying there are warming trends — we're freezing to death.”
Unsurprisingly, Cherry's views were quickly picked up by Canadians, with many taking to social media to express their disapproval.

Here's the thing
Don Cherry (as much as he is a Canadian Icon and is loved) should not be on television.
He knows hockey, yes
And literally nothing else of the world right now but can't help himself from commenting.
He is unbelievably expired. — Cahhrles (@SmokesIndoors) February 4, 2018
at this point @hockeynight putting don cherry on television is legitimately irresponsible. — 𝕓𝕠𝕓𝕓𝕪 𝕔𝕠𝕠𝕜𝕒𝕔𝕚𝕟𝕠 (@bobbycappucino) February 4, 2018
It's not the first time that Cherry has suggested that cold weather disproves the existence of climate change, however.
During one Hockey Night in Canada broadcast back in 2008, Cherry reacted to a video of environmental activist David Suzuki promoting Earth Hour by calling him a “left-wing kook.”
“We're all dying of cold and he's talking warming trends,” Cherry said on that occasion.

HAFIZABAD-The All-Pakistan Special Persons Federation (APSPF) on Sunday held a demonstration in front of Press Club Hafizabad against the failure of police for not arresting the teacher and his accomplice for allegedly raping a handicapped student.
The girl is student of Government Special Education Centre Hafizabad. The protesters led by Hafiz Muzammal Riaz, the federation's chairman, and its other office-bearers strongly condemned the inhuman act of teacher Zohaib Bashir and clerk Zakaullah of the education centre. They allegedly subjected her to their animal lust for more than a year. They called upon the DPO and chief minister of the Punjab to take prompt measures for their early arrest. They also demanded dismissal of the principal of the centre otherwise they would be constrained to launch a country-wide protest demonstration.
According to the brother of the victim, the police have miserably failed to arrest the accused who have got pre-arrest bail from the district courts on Saturday till January 5. He demanded justice and deterrent punishment to the accused.
Hafizabad termed polio-free district: The district administration has said that Hafizabad is polio-free district of the Punjab as no polio case was reported in the district during the last year.
For the success, it credited the anti-polio campaign, health officers, Ulema, social workers, teachers and parents who played their positive role in administration of drops to the children in the district.
The district coordination officer expressed these views while presiding over a meeting of Anti-Polio Committee Hafizabad in district complex. Ali Randhawa said that officers and officials of the health department performed their duties with responsibility and commitment to make the anti-polio campaign successful in the district.
He added that with the special efforts of EDO Health Dr Muhammad Aslam Shaheen, the performance of Health Department had improved. The EDO apprised the meeting that anti-polio vaccine was administered to more than one lakh and ninety three thousand children in the district.
32 SUSPECTS NAILED: The district police have arrested 32 suspects during a search operation carried out in Kasooki Police precinct on Saturday. According to police spokesman, the Kasooki Police nicked 32 suspects during a search operation. Later after biometric verification, 27 of them were released. The police also recovered huge quantity of illicit arms and drugs from six persons and registered separate cases against them, the spokesman said and added that accused Amar, Mujahid, Azam etc had also been involved in robberies and other heinous crimes.
He said that the police have been put on high alert across the district in view of prevailing security situation and new year celebrations.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Former Nepali prime minister K.P. Oli on Sunday looked set for a return to power after winning his seat in parliament and his Communist UML party and Maoist allies on course to win a majority.

Counting is still under way following an election on Thursday that capped a near-decade long transition to democracy from monarchy and a civil war in which more than 17,000 people died.
Oli, 65, has vowed to form a government that lasts its full five-year term, something no prime minister has achieved since parliamentary democracy was established in 1990.
His campaign has called for the extension of the Chinese railway network into Nepal and implement of hydroelectric, airport and other infrastructure projects to create jobs.
“We can expect Oli to lead a stable government with the Maoists as strong allies,” said Bipin Adhikari, a constitutional expert. “Once there is political stability he can implement a development agenda and attract foreign investment.”
Instability has spooked investors, curbed growth, spurred corruption and slowed reconstruction after a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people.
Nepal is a natural buffer between China and India, with the ruling Nepali Congress party considered pro-India and the left alliance seen closer to China.
“If Oli leads the new government, he will be forced to be pragmatic in maintaining a geo-political balance with both,” said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times.
Final election results are expected to take about a week, election officials said.

Three days after cracking California's top 20 largest wildfires, a Ventura County blaze surged its way upward and now has potential to be the biggest in state history.
The Thomas Fire officially became the fifth-largest wildfire on record after charring 230,500 acres as of Monday morning, according to Cal Fire data.
It's right behind the Zaca Fire, which began July 4, 2007 and burned 240,207 acres over 60 days in Santa Barbara County's Los Padres National Forest.
The Thomas Fire, which is just south of there, has been burning for seven days, ravaging through developed areas, destroying hundreds of buildings and forcing thousands to evacuate. It is only 15-percent contained and has a good chance of surpassing the Zaca Fire in size.
"The likelihood is there," Ventura County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Eric Buschow said. "It's nowhere close to being done."
Authorities say it's too early to predict whether the Thomas Fire will get big enough to become the worst fire on record. The spot is currently held by the 2003 Cedar Fire, which burned 273,246 acres and killed 15 people in San Diego County in less than two weeks.
RELATED: Threat of wildfire exists close to Coachella Valley
Working its way up
The Thomas Fire sparked Dec. 4 near highways 150 and 126, north of Santa Paula in Ventura County. The cause is still under investigation.
It entered the list of 20 worst wildfires after growing to 132,000 acres by Friday morning. That about tied it with the Soberanes Fire, which was ranked 19 after burning 132,127 acres in Monterey County in July 2016.
But the Thomas Fire didn't spend much time at the bottom of the list.
Fueled by powerful Santa Ana winds, it quickly spread and destroyed 794 buildings while threatening 18,000 others. Flames moved westward and what began near Santa Paula as a Ventura County wildfire had also become a Santa Barbara County wildfire.
"It's not like it started on the county line; it started in a populated area of our county," Buschow said. "If you look at a map, Santa Paula is not close to the county line."
In addition to destroying hundreds of buildings, it's blamed for the death of a 70-year-old woman who's car overturned while she tried to evacuate.
In fact, most of the state's largest wildfires occurred in rural areas and caused significantly less structural damage. No one died during the Zaca Fire, which destroyed only one outbuilding.
There also were no fatalities during the second and third worst wildfires in California history: The August 2012 Rush Fire and the August 2013 Rim Fire, respectively.
Lightning sparked the Rush Fire and flames burned 271,911 acres in Lassen County in Northern California. The Rim Fire, which was human-caused, burned 257,314 acres in Tuolumne County and destroyed 112 buildings.
October's Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County became the most destructive fire in state history after it destroyed 5,643 buildings in Northern California's wine country. It burned 36,807 acres and killed 22 people.
The deadliest blaze was the Griffith Park Fire in October 1933. The Los Angeles County fire left 29 people dead, burned 47 acres and damaged no buildings.
RELATED: Why the SoCal fires are a sign of things to come
Where it may go
Varying winds and landscape have caused inconsistent trends in the fire's activity and all officials can say for now is that the fire has been getting bigger.
It entered Santa Barbara County Sunday and forced evacuations. More than 85,000 homes and businesses lost electricity and the University of California - Santa Barbara was forced to cancel classes and reschedule final exams.
With the fire heading into Santa Barbara County, flames are now inching north toward the Los Padres National Forest - the site of the Zaca Fire.
Area winds are blowing north and northeast and its 40-mph gusts could help spread the fire, according to the National Weather Service.
"The embers of the fires, they'll get blown ahead of the fires and start new fires," said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist. "This will probably go on until about Friday."
Buschow said there was "easily" enough forest land for the Thomas Fire to consume and overtake the Zaca Fire. He added the 2007 burn area likely recovered, since it had several years of rain prior to California's historic drought, which began in 2007.
"There's plenty of fuel, even in some of these areas that burned in the last 10-15 years," Buschow said.

LAHORE - PML-Q president Ch Shujaat Hussain yesterday said that no anti-government alliance is in the making.
Talking to reporters at his residence along with Ch Pervaiz Elahi, the former prime minister said that there was no positive outcome of his recent meetings with political leaders in Karachi.
Asked why the opposition parties were reluctant to join hands against the government, the PML-Q leader said that it was so because they preferred their personal interests to the national ones.
“They will not be able to unite against government unless they set aside their personal agendas. Grand alliance will materialise only when all parties agree on some common primary purpose.”
When questioned about Javed Hashmi's recent statement that Imran Khan longed for a judicial martial law during PTI sit-in in 2014, he said he had not heard about such kind of martial law in the world and that there was no possibility of such things in Pakistan.
To another question, he said politicians should avoid giving statements on sub-judice matters and judiciary should not be dragged into politics. “Let the judges take decisions according to their conscious,” he said.
Ch Shujaat termed Year 2017 very important for the country. He said PML-Q will field its candidates everywhere in the next general election.
Speaking on occasion, Ch Parvez Elahi criticised recently promulgated civil administration ordinance by Punjab government, saying that Shehbaz Sharif restored a 150 years old system and despite having majority at all three tiers of government, he was not willing to empower local government representatives. Instead of empowering the people's representatives, he said, Punjab CM empowered bureaucracy and DCs by introducing the ordinance.
He said Punjab CM was running a one-man show in the province and wasting billions on showy projects while there were almost no health and education facilities in the province. He said people of the province were no more ready to bear Sharifs after their ‘nine-year directionless rule'.
The former Punjab CM claimed that PML-Q was the most popular party in 2008 but the then COAS Ashfaq Kayani and CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry started hatching conspiracies against their party and forced key members of PML-Q to join PML-N. Now, he said, Nawaz Sharif was facing problems with those members who were gifted to him by the former general and CJP.
To a question, he said people of Pakistan would take a sigh of relief and peace would not be disturbed if Supreme Court convicted Nawaz Sharif in Panama case.
He said process of party reorganisation was in progress as Ch Shujaat will now visit Balochistan and he himself was starting a tour of Punjab districts. He said the reorganisation process would be completed in four months.
The statement said that office-bearers and senior lawyers of various bar associations including presidents and general secretaries of five district bars of southern Punjab called on Ch Shujaat and Ch Pervaiz at their residence and announced joining PM-Q.
Those joining the party included Bahawalnagar District Bar President Ch Zulfiqar Bajwa, General Secretary Masood Wattoo, Finance Secretary Ejaz Amin Baloch, Fort Abbas Bar President Parvez Bajwah and General Secretary Shahid Hussain Ghullu, Haroonabad Bar General Secretary Iftikhar Warraich, Ahsan Qureshi, Shahid Hassan, Ahmad Naeem Qureshi, Mohammad Irfan Qureshi, Rashed Muhammad Warraich, Rafaqat Ali, Shahid Bashir Cheema, Sajid Warraich, Ch Khalid Javed and Nasir Ramzan, and Shujabad Bar General Secretary Malik Kashif Wattoo, Ahmad Naseem Qureshi, Altaf Hussain, Fazal Akbar Sahotra.

NEW DELHI: Relief worth Rs 12,000 crore for the middle class (Rs 8,000 crore as standard deduction to salaried taxpayers and Rs 4,000 crore to senior citizens) is being cited by the government as it seeks to brazen out the attack from large stock market players grousing against the longterm capital gains ( LTCG ) tax.While a relook on the proposal to impose LTCG tax on stocks and equity mutual funds has been ruled out, senior government officials said the tax concessions for the middle class will cost the exchequer almost as much as the Centre's annual health insurance bill Amid efforts to forge a narrative about middle class having been squeezed, the budgetary figures cited by the government not just reflect an attempt at perception management but, perhaps more importantly, a defiant signal that it will not back down on LTCG in the face of the complaints.A day after the bloodbath on the bourses, though not exclusively because of the LTCG tax, officials said that while the Modi government has been sensitive to the concerns of the middle class since its first Budget, the need for succouring the poor cannot be ignored for the sake of a section which is far better off.Officials have sought to clarify that additional cess to finance social sector schemes, including the health cover, will be applicable on the tax and not on the taxable income and will push up the annual outgo marginally.Finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia had told TOI that the additional outgo for someone with a Rs 40,000 tax liability will be Rs 400.In addition, the government has maintained that those without transport or medical allowance from their employer, including pensioners, stand to gain more from the annual standard deduction of Rs 40,000.Although the government may have wanted to do more for the middle class, fiscal compulsions reduced its elbow room, at least during the 2018-19 financial year when it opted to focus more on the poor and senior citizens. The LTCG tax is seen as a major exercise to raise resources and a move towards bringing stocks and equity mutual funds on a par with property.In fact, government officials have maintained that the proposed 10% levy is "concessional" and is seen as a starting point for further reforms. The top leadership is also clear about the need to end the "disparity" and many view the absence of the levy as a subsidy for the super rich at a time when there is growing concern over widening income disparity.In fact, officials said the message is that the government will go ahead with the levy even if it means a fall in stock market indices for the next few days. In any case, it is not LTCG tax alone that has resulted in the fall. What has also affected stock market sentiments is a slippage on the fiscal front as well as weak stock markets globally.

He said that during the last three years 20,328 CNICs had been revoked or re-issued out of total 32,582 impounded blocked CNICs.
Khan said that 4,491 persons had been recruited in the Civil Armed Forces constituted under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The recruitment was made by HQ Pakistan Rangers (Punjab), HQ Pakistan Rangers (Sindh), HQ Frontier Corps (KP) and HQ Frontier Corps (Balochistan) under the relevant recruitment rules.
He said, however, the total local personnel recruited were 2,994 out of total 4,491 personnel.
Parliamentary Secretary for Planning and Development Ibadullah told the house that according to the estimates based on 2013-2014 data, about 55 million people of Pakistan were below the poverty line.
He said that according to the latest survey Pakistan's poverty line had been set up at 3,030 rupees per adult per month.
He said that 38 sites had been identified for establishing Special Economic Zones by the respective provincial governments out of which nine sites were shortlisted for inclusion in the CPEC in the 6th JCC meeting. Industrial parks/SEZs are part of long-term plan, which is to be accomplished by 2030.

A lengthy series of charges has been laid against associates of the Red Scorpions, Jamie Bacon's gang, after almost 450 grams of fentanyl and much more were seized by the Kamloops RCMP.
The charges flow out of an investigation looking into drug trafficking activities that took place between October 2016 and March 2017, said a Monday release from the RCMP.
It's an investigation by the Kamloops Targeted Enforcement Unit (TEU) that yielded a seizure of $191,445 in cash, 1.3 kilograms of cocaine, 448 grams of fentanyl, 56 grams of heroin, 717 grams of methamphetamine, 231 grams of MDMA and a firearm.
WATCH: The co-founder of the Red Scorpions is shot and killed in a Kamloops street. Paul Johnson reports.
The investigation first led to a vehicle being stopped north of Merritt on Dec. 1, 2016.
The vehicle was being driven by Coquitlam resident Gregory Wilson; police said a search yielded a “substantial” amount of money.
Charges of possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000 were subsequently laid against Wilson and Kamloops resident Brandon Chappell.
READ MORE: Charges stayed against gangster Jamei Bacon in connection with ‘Surrey Six' homicides
Then, on Jan. 14, the RCMP searched Kamloops' Heavy Metal Gym as well as Chappell's home.
While searching Chappell's home, officers found more money, as well as drugs and a firearm.
Chappell was then charged with possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000, possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking and unlawful possession of a firearm.
RCMP then conducted more searches on March 30.
One, again, took place at Chappell's residence, the other at the home of Kamloops resident Erwin Dagle.
Police once more found a large amount of cash, and that resulted in a third charge of possession of property obtained by crime against him.
At Dagle's home, police found cash, along with drugs including fentanyl, carfentanil, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. He's been charged with five counts of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking and one count of possession of property obtained by crime.
The TEU carried out additional actions that included arresting street-level traffickers, as well as searching a Kamloops hotel room where police found more controlled substances.
Police have forwarded those matters to the Crown so that charges can be approved against “several other persons.”
“This case is an example of the motivated nature of those allegedly involved,” Staff Sgt. Simon Pillay said in a news release.
“Despite overt enforcement action, these drug activities continued on until those involved were eventually arrested and charged.”
VANCOUVER—The Transportation Safety Board says a large, breaking wave hit a whale-watching vessel off British Columbia's coast in October 2015, overturning the boat and dumping passengers and crew into the water.The board makes three recommendations after the fatal capsizing, including that all commercial passenger vessels operating beyond sheltered waters carry emergency radio beacons that indicate their positions.Six people, five Britons and one Australian, died in the capsizing and 21 others were rescued on Oct. 25, 2015, near the resort community of Tofino.The board also recommends that passenger vessels across Canada adopt risk-management processes that identify hazards, such as areas known to have large, breaking waves.The report says search and rescue authorities were not aware of the capsizing for 45 minutes because the crew didn't have time to transmit a distress call and it was only by chance that they were able to activate a flare, alerting rescuers nearby.Article Continued BelowRead more: ‘Our hearts are broken,' posts Milton family whose dad died in Tofino sinkingIn the days after the capsizing, the board said many passengers were standing on the top deck on one side of the ship when a large wave hit the opposite side, rolling the boat and sending the passengers and crew into the water.Clinton Rebeiro, the investigator in charge for the board, said offshore waves travelling over a rising ocean floor and meeting opposing tides can cause waves to become higher or steeper, but determining when that will happen “is almost impossible to predict.”
LOS ANGELES-Scarlett Johansson has spoken about the appeal of her role in the upcoming live-action re-make of Japanese anime classic Ghost In The Shell that's due out in 2017.
The 32 year old spoke at a fan event in Japan about her lead role as ‘The Major', a cyborg counter-cyberterrorism field commander tasked with thwarting an outfit that aims to bring down a new artificial intelligence program.
“I didn't actually know the material. When the script came to me it came with a copy of the anime, and when I first saw it seemed quite daunting, I think, because the anime is so philosophical and I didn't know how it would translate to a live-action film or how I could contribute to it. But it was alluring, definitely!”
About her complex role as The Major, she said she was interested in playing “three sides… the ego, the super-ego and the id” all at the same time in a cyborg character “who has an idea of who she thinks she was and who she now isn't in the life she's living now, and then the person she feels she is, this sort of gnawing and clawing feeling, in her ‘ghost'.”
The anime version of Ghost In The Shell came out back in 1995, which in turn had been adapted from a manga series, and is generally regarded as one of the finest movies of its genre.
When the news was announced way back at the start of 2015 that Johansson would be playing the lead, many accused the film's producers of ‘whitewashing' – the practice of casting white or Western actors in historically non-white character roles.
There was a great deal of controversy for several months that has consistently hung over the production, but this question did not come up in the discussion.
She was also asked about how she wanted fans of the original to feel when watching the new movie.
“For me, I have such a soft spot for The Major because of her journey of self-discovery. Although it's set in this explosive world that's so visually stunning and action-packed, to me it's a coming of age story, about the loss of innocence and the re-birth you can have from that. I hope the fans connect with The Major the way I did.”

These pitches, more than a dozen of which were reviewed by The New York Times, were not part of an employee stock program. Instead, they appear to be high interest loans, with the company as borrower and its workers as lenders. (nyti.ms/2nvM0Az) ($1 = 64.1200 Indian rupees) (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)

A street robber was arrested after her 17-year-old victim bravely fought her off and took photographs.
Kasey Willis was jailed for 28 months for attacking the college student as she walked home.
The victim said she had been shocked and distressed by what had happened, which has knocked her confidence and left her wary of going out, Teesside Crown Court heard.
“The offence happened at about 1.30pm,” said Paul Newcombe, prosecuting,
“The victim, who is 17-years-old, was walking from Brinkburn Sixth Form College in Hartlepool towards Baden Street.
“Willis, who is 25-years-old, approached the victim from behind and tried to grab her bag which was slung over her shoulder.
“The victim fought back, and there was a struggle between the two.
“Willis refused to give up, telling the victim she had a knife and would stab her.
“Willis put her hand over the victim's mouth to stop her crying out. The victim resorted to biting Willis's finger.
“Eventually Wills did give up, telling the victim she could keep her bag,”
The court heard the victim took photographs of Willis as she walked away.
“She denied the offence on arrest,” said Me Newcombe.
“At first she gave a false alibi, but admitted what she had done after being picked out of an identity parade.”
Willis, 25, of Chepstow Walk, Hartlepool, admitted attempted robbery on October 31, last year.
Laurie Scott, mitigating, said: “Ms Willis left home at 15, and she suffered all the feelings of family rejection.
“She kept out of trouble until she was 23, but then began a relationship with a drug dealer which led to her becoming addicted.
“All of her offending so far has been to get money for drugs, which was the case here.
“She is disgusted with herself for what she did that day and is genuinely sorry.
“If Ms Willis is allowed her liberty, she has a friend she can live with in an area outside the negative influences of her peers in Hartlepool.”
Judge Simon Bourne-Arton jailed Willis for 28 months.
The judge told her: “Up to now your offending has mostly been shoplifting and the like.
“This attempted robbery is significantly more serious.
“You took advantage of a young girl who bravely fought you off.”
Santander banks in Clitheroe has reopened after a terrifying night-time raid.
Two robbers armed with a chainsaw and baseball bat targeted the bank in Castle Street at 11pm last night (Thursday) as security staff were delivering cash.
The offenders threatened the security guards before stealing cassettes containing an unknown quantity of cash. Police said no on was injured in the incident.
Earlier today, crime scene investigators taped off the bank while bank staff waited outside for news.
Officials at Santander have since revealed the branch has reopened.
A spokesman said: "We have been cooperating with police in relation to the incident at our Clitheroe branch which took place last night. The branch has now reopened and we apologise to customers for any inconvenience.”
This is the second time in a year the bank has been targeted. In November last year, armed robbers targeted a vehicle delivering cash to Santander bank, Clitheroe.
A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: "We were called at around 11pm last night to reports of an armed robbery at the Santander bank, Castle Street, Clitheroe.
"It is believed two men, armed with a baseball bat and a chainsaw, have entered the bank as security staff have been delivering cash. They have made threats before making off with cassettes containing cash. Fortunately nobody was injured. "No arrests have been made as yet and our enquiries are now ongoing to establish exactly what occurred.
"We would ask anybody with information about the incident to contact us on 101, quoting log number 1586 of October 5th.

ISLAMABAD - Model Ayyan Ali Tuesday filed contempt petition against the Ministry of Interior secretary for not removing her name from the exit control list (ECL) despite court judgments on the subject.
Ayyan filed petition through her counsel Sardar Latif Khosa, praying: “The interior secretary has committed contempt of court and may be punished and be directed to produce the notification of removal of model's name from the ECL with the direction not to obstruct Ayyan from travelling abroad.” Latif Khosa stated that Ayyan was being persecuted under the extreme “administrative tyranny”, which has been let loose. The apex court has dismissed the petition on January 30,.
Ayyan's name was placed on the ECL for the first time on November 20, 2015. The Sindh High Court had set it aside on March 7, 2016. The court upheld that judgment on April 13, 2016.
However, the ministry, after a week, again put her name on the ECL. The SHC set aside that order as well.
The counsel stated that repeatedly they had sent letters and the courts orders requesting for removal of Ayyan's name from the ECL.
He said that two weeks had lapsed neither her name was removed from the ECL nor the secretary interior responded to her letters or requests.
The counsel said that the ministry was defying the courts' orders as the interior minister was hell bent upon victimising and persecuting the petitioner, who would not be allowed to travel abroad come what may.
Latif Khosa said that the unending torturous ordeal and agony through which the petitioner had been subjected to was unknown in the history of any civilised country.
He said that Ayyan's mother was seriously ill in Dubai, while his client was under the peril of damages at the hands of the foreign contracting obligations.
“Apart from the physical incarceration and the huge financial loss, her right of movement and her liberty stands constricted in violation of her fundamental rights sanctified as inviolable and inalienable by the Constitution,” Khosa said.
MOSCOW – Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko turned up at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital Wednesday less than 24 hours after police reported he had been shot and killed at his Kyiv apartment building. The country's security services said Babchenko's death was faked to foil a plot to take his life.
Ukrainian police said Tuesday that Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back Tuesday and found bleeding there by his wife. Authorities said they suspected he was killed because of his work.
Vasyl Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, announced at a news conference Wednesday that the security agency and the police had solved Babchenko's slaying. He then startled everyone there by inviting the 41-year-old reporter into the room.

To the applause and gasps of the press, Babchenko took the floor and apologized to the friends and family who mourned for him and were unaware of the plan.
“I'm still alive,” he said.

Before ushering Babchenko into the room, Gritsak said investigators had identified a Ukrainian citizen who had been recruited and paid $40,000 by the Russian security service to organize and carry out the killing. The unidentified Ukrainian man in turn hired an acquaintance who had fought in the separatist war in eastern Ukraine as the gunman.
Babchenko, one of Russia's best-known war reporters, fled the country in February 2017 after receiving death threats. He spoke and wrote about leaving the country because of the threats against him and his family.. He said his home address was published online and the threats he received were made by phone, email and social media.
Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian lawmaker who also moved to Ukraine, said Wednesday that Babchenko continued being threatened after he settled last fall in Kyiv, where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station. Babchenko did not take the intimidation too seriously, according to Ponomarev.
Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine were topics on which the journalist was scathingly critical of the Kremlin.

Islamabad - Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) has almost completed over 90 percent construction work on the Labour Complex, being built along Islamabad Expressway to provide accommodation to the registered industrial workers of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
An official source at Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development told APP here on Tuesday, that the complex, being built on 1,476 kanals of land, consists of 500 houses and 1,008 flats. He said the complex would be completed by the end of December 2018 and will be handed over to the workers through the set criteria and policy of the department.
He said around 65,000 workers of the twin cities were already registered with Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) and these houses and flats would be handed over to them on merit.
WWF is an autonomous body working under administrative control of Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development and adding that this department is working for the welfare of industrial workers across the country.
He said the project would be completed at the cost of Rs 3,145 million and all basic needs would be available in this complex including shopping centre, community centre, schools, mosque and playgrounds.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world's biggest refining complex, is planning to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a first sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran.

Reliance's call to quit buying oil from Iran followed Washington's decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear accord which has raised the threat of sanctions on entities dealing with Iran, after “wind-down” periods of three to six months expire.
Oxford is taking more steps to meet its zero waste target.
As the county moves forward with its goal of creating zero waste by 2025, county council recently approved issuing a request for information (RFI) to research and review new waste recovery and reduction technologies.
This comes after a waste audit of what is coming into the landfill site, what is in garbage bags on the street, what garbage is being generated in the industrial and commercial sectors and what is leaving and staying in the county.
Chief administrator Peter Crockett said that the county wants to take responsibility for waste generated in Oxford.
"We now have a much more crystallized picture of our waste issue," Crockett said. "What council has said is that we want to be responsible for our own waste and we want to keep it and manage it internally to our community... Part of that responsibility is how do we reduce the waste that we create."
Right now, the county is looking into mechanical sorting of waste coming to the site, removing organics and plastics, for reuse, repurposing or recycling, and gasification technologies to create energy from waste.
Warden David Mayberry said research into these technologies should begin in the next couple of months, and he hopes council will see a full report in the fall.
"We'll be able to bring a report to county council to say that these are the technologies and methodologies to resolve a significant portion of our waste right now," Mayberry said. "I'm hoping by late fall that we'll be able to bring something forward with a recommendation."
Last year, the province passed the Waste Free Ontario Act, aiming to reduce the 11.5 million tonnes of waste sent to Ontario landfills each year. The province is asking for an 80 per cent improvement in diversion rates by 2050.

Bleachers frontman and producer-to-the-stars Jack Antonoff recently put together the soundtrack to Love, Simon, the first gay romantic movie ever produced by a major Hollywood studio. And as its first single, he released the surging, triumphant, Paul Simon-esque Bleachers jam “Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song).” Today, Bleachers have shared that song's video, which is a bit of a Hollywood production of its own.
The video, from director Isaac Rentz, plays out as a grand meta-joke. It starts out looking like the strings-swelling ending of a romantic comedy, with Antonoff running to meet his date at the premiere of Love, Simon. But things go spectacularly wrong, again and again. It's well-produced and not unfunny, though it doesn't really offer many clues as to why Antonoff dresses so much like '90s-era Jerry Seinfeld. Check out the clip below.
The Love, Simon soundtrack is out now on RCA.
Stevensville Town Council President Bob Michalson needs to give up his vendetta against the Mayor. It has been a difficult thing for the community to witness and he has now clearly crossed the line of acceptability in his most recent attempt to shut down the town in order to carry out his aims. Not one of his fellow council members could go along with his misguided attempt to put a spending freeze into effect, and for good reason.
Number one, there is no fiscal crisis. No department is buying a bunch of tires without council approval as he suggested. Perhaps, like some other council members and even a former clerk, he bought into the notion that the Mayor was putting forth an unbalanced budget (which is not legal) when he shared the preliminary results of a zero-based budgeting process in which the departments figure out their true needs based on their duties and obligations and then ask for the amount of money that would meet those needs. Cuts then have to be made that will negatively impact those services. In this case, the excess came to about $125,000. This is the painful part of the budgeting process and in this case, it was the employees who stepped up. No one got a raise, not even a cost of living increase, but the budget got balanced without gutting any departments, and that includes filling the vacant positions on the police force.
Not only is there not a fiscal crisis calling for a spending freeze, but there was going to be no prior notice and no public participation in the process. Michalson himself stated at the meeting that he and his “sources” had “done their homework in advance”. Unfortunately, none of them is a lawyer and not one of them thought to ask the Town Attorney.
This brings us back to Michalson's vendetta. It began several months ago when he and another council member sought an opinion from the Town Attorney on whether the Mayor's actions (which amounted to a statement to the press) were illegal.
Michalson didn't like the answer he got and his answer to that has now been made famous once his emails were made public. If he can't get the Mayor on some legal infraction then he will just “make his life miserable.”
He has certainly given that aim every effort he can muster. But so far to no avail.
So how do you make the Mayor miserable enough to leave? By taking an action against him that he cannot impede, or as Michalson put it to the mayor, “I'm sorry, but there is nothing you can do about it.”
And yet there was something the Mayor could do about it and he did. He asked for public comment and took it, despite that fact that Michalson tried to cut him off by blurting out, “There is no public comment.” There was also some pertinent comment from a couple of employees who were rebelling at the idea of having their departments shut down.
Trying to ramrod through an issue such as a spending freeze without a bit of public notice or public participation shows extremely poor thinking regardless of any laws. But it is also definitely against the law. This is not simply the Bitterroot Star's opinion, it's our attorney's opinion. It is hard to believe that neither Michalson nor any one of his “trusted sources” thought a legal opinion was needed in this case.
Even though other council members have expressed strong feelings about the Mayor's “lack of communication with the council” and questioned his actions legally at times, not one of them could go along with Michalson on this, and that speaks loudly to how far he's gone off track in his vendetta.
Maybe one of his trusted sources could help us all out and tell him it's time to give it up, because he doesn't seem to want to listen to anybody else.
YouTube is modifying its search algorithms to prevent conspiracy theories and fake news videos from making it to the top of its search results, following outrage over the high visibility of videos spreading misinformation about the Las Vegas mass shooting, the Wall Street Journal reports.
On Wednesday, the very first result in a YouTube search for “Las Vegas shooting” was a video that claimed the gunshots came from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, rather than the 32nd. The video showed images of a flashing light coming from a room on the lower floor, using it to advance a theory — ruled “false” by Snopes — that multiple shooters were involved in the massacre.
READ MORE: Search ‘Las Vegas shooting' on YouTube, and a conspiracy theory might be the first hit
Other high-ranking videos suggested the attack was a false flag orchestrated to advance the gun control agenda, or that the attack may not have happened at all and that the victims were “actors.”
But as of Friday, the first page of search results for “Las Vegas shooting” yielded only results from reputable news organizations such as the BBC, CNN, the New York Times and the Guardian.
That's because YouTube on Wednesday night began actively promoting more established sources in search results pertaining to the shooting as well as other major news events, the Journal reported, citing an unnamed source close to the video-sharing website.

Some of the implicated videos have since been taken down from YouTube, but others remain on the site.
According to The Guardian, YouTube had been preparing the changes for months but decided to accelerate the roll-out this week.

LONDON - A man who alleged he was a victim of an historical child sex ring involving high-profile figures including senior political and military individuals has been charged with perverting the course of justice, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
British police launched a major investigation in 2014 after the man, who cannot be named and has only ever been known by the pseudonym of "Nick", told detectives he had been abused at military locations and at apartments close to parliament. He also said the pedophile gang had murdered three young boys. The allegations led to ex-lawmaker Harvey Proctor and former army chief Edwin Bramall being identified as suspects in the media after police searched their homes.
His claims were later dismissed and detectives were criticized for dozens of serious failings. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said a 50-year-old man had now been charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud following a new police inquiry.
"The police investigation provided evidence that the man had made a number of false allegations alleging multiple homicides and sexual abuse said to have been carried out in the 1970s and 1980s," said Frank Ferguson, the CPS Head of Special Crime.
"Following careful consideration, we have concluded there is sufficient evidence to bring a number of criminal charges."
The charges included that he "made a false allegation of witnessing the child homicide of an unnamed boy committed by Mr Harvey Proctor" and that he alleged he had been abused by a pedophile ring involving senior ranking military officers and an unnamed TV presenter.
When the allegations were first made, police described the claims as "credible and true", comments which detectives later acknowledged were misleading.
Police closed down the "Operation Midland" in 2016 and a review found serious mistakes had been made in the investigation and in a similar inquiry which had examined allegations about Leon Brittan, a former Home Secretary (interior minister) in Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.
Brittan died in 2015 without knowing he would not face prosecution while police later apologized to Proctor and Bramall and paid them compensation.
Operation Midland was launched after a series of child sex scandals and revelations that celebrities, such as former BBC star Jimmy Savile, had been involved in widespread abuse.
“Riverdale” fans can be privy to some additional connective tissue in the Archie Comics world with the release of the show's complete first season on DVD.
Included on the DVD are deleted scenes — including a key moment from episode two, “A Touch of Evil,” which shows the moment Veronica learned her mother would be applying to work at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe, the local diner.
Hermione Lodge took up the job early in the season since Hiram Lodge being incarcerated essentially dried up her income stream, but viewers weren't given many heads up besides a general impression that the Lodges' lives were going to be drastically different in Riverdale. Hermione simply appeared in her waitress' uniform at the diner, with a few throwaway lines explaining her presence.
“Mom, that place is a poor man's Shake Shack,” Veronica says in the deleted scene. “And have you ever — no offense — worked before?”
More deleted scenes are available as part of “Riverdale: The Complete First Season,” which hits shelves on DVD August 15. The set will feature all 13 episodes of the first season and also include additional bonus material and a gag reel. It will be released on Blu-Ray via the Warner Archive Collection, which can be found on Amazon and other online retailers. A digital version will also be available for purchase online from iTunes, Amazon Video, and more.
Season 2 of “Riverdale,” which was renewed in March, will premiere on The CW on October 11.
Watch the deleted scene below:

LCCI chief decries FBR raids
LAHORE (STAFF REPORTER): Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) Acting President Muhammad Nasir Hameed Khan has urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to not treat business community as criminals and stop conducting raids at the markets as such practices create harassment amongst the business community. While talking to a delegation of Pakistan Automobile Spare Parts Importers & Dealers Association (PASPIDA) here at the LCCI, Khan said that the business community is the major source of revenue for the government but the FBR is busy to squeeze them. “Tax officials have agreed to suspend raids for one month but this is not the solution. No such action should be taken without taking concerned chamber and association on board”, the LCCI acting president added. He said that importers of automobile spare parts are already paying 100 percent advance sales tax at source even before sales therefore such raids should not been conducted as such measures are disturbing honest taxpayers.
He said that unfortunately concerned Chambers and associations are also not being taken into confidence before taking such ultimate actions in the markets.
The LCCI acting president said that FBR would not be able to meet its revenue target set for the year 2017-18 if anti-business measures like raids on business premises are not stopped.
He urged Federal Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to immediately stop the FBR from this practice that is pushing the tax payers to the wall besides denting the reputation of a business-friendly government. He said that the FBR was constituted to facilitate the businessmen but it is presently doing the other way round through. He said that these acts of the FBR are not only defaming the government but also vitiating the business atmosphere in the Punjab.
BISP to cover all households in Balochistan: Marvi
ISLAMABAD (STAFF REPORTER):BISP Chairperson Marvi Memon has said that the injustices done to the poor population of Balochistan during the previous survey will not be repeated and not a single household in the province will be left out in the National Socio Economic Survey this time. Marvi said this while launching the NSER pilot survey in Kila Saifullah during an Area Opening Meeting which was attended by a large number of local elders and notables. According to a press statement, the BISP chairperson said that the present government has taken initiative of launching a computer-based survey instead of a paper one. She said that in light of the instructions of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, injustices done to the poor population of Balochistan during the previous survey will be addressed in the current survey. The total households covered during the previous survey in Kila Saifullah are approximately 30,900 which do not truly represent the poverty in the region. She explained that other improvements in the survey included data verification through NADRA as well as other agencies.
Sharing the success of self-registration approach employed by BISP on trial basis in the district of Nasirabad, she said that against the estimated households of 31,000 covered during the last door-to-door survey, BISP using the desk approach has registered more than 60,000 households which is a remarkable achievement.
Highlighting the importance of NSER, she said that this survey is not only for the poor rather the whole country will benefit from this survey. She said that robust monitoring and spot checks will ensure that this survey is done on apolitical basis. BISP has recently launched door-to-door survey in 16 pilot districts of all provinces and regions including FATA which include Kila Saifullah and Kech districts of Baluchistan. The pilot phase of survey will be completed by May 2017 after which a national roll-out will be launched during August 2017.
Minister for Public Health Engineering Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai, in his address, appreciated the efforts of the BISP chairperson in reaching out to the poor in the nook and corner of the country.

Islamabad-The Embassy of Nepal celebrated Mount Everest Day 2018 in collaboration with Serena Hotels under its Adventure Diplomacy Initiative.
The event was held at the Islamabad Serena Hotel with more than two hundred dignitaries, including members of the diplomatic corps and government, in attendance. Nepal has been celebrating Mount Everest Day since 2008. Aitzaz Ahmad, Special Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was the chief guest of the event, along with mountaineer Abdul Jabbar Bhatti, who became the fourth Pakistani to scale the world's highest peak, Mount Everest in 2017.
CEO of Serena Hotels Aziz Boolani said, “Pakistan and Nepal have both been blessed with spectacular mountains and extraordinary historical treasures many of which are world heritage sites. These are treasures that allow us to build our tourism and share the wonders with the rest of the world.”
Ambassador of Nepal Sewa Iamsal Adhikari shared that the Everest Day is special in the history of mountaineering, because in 1953 Mount Everest was scaled for the first time. Since then some 4,000 climbers have reached the peak.

DeLong pleaded guilty Tuesday in Allen Superior Court to theft where value of property is between $750 and $50,000. A second charge, theft defendant has a prior conviction of either theft or conversion, was dropped.
DeLong is currently on monitored release in lieu of a $2,500 bond, and a plea agreement calls for him to receive a 2.5-year sentence, with two years suspended and two years on probation. He also must pay $2,800 in restitution.
He has been assigned a public defender and is scheduled to be sentenced May 22.
An officer of the Nigeria Customs Service, Baba Nwaguyawo, has been crushed to death while attempting to stop a convoy of the Nigerian Army at the Agbara end of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway on Friday.
The convoy was reportedly used as a diversion to smuggle some cars into the country.
It was learnt that operatives of the NCS at the Agbara checkpoint had attempted stopping the convoy for a routine search when a Nigerian Army van piloting the fleet killed Nwagiyawo.
It was gathered that the deceased, with service number 53225, was until his death an anti-smuggling operative of the Federal Operations Unit, Zone A, Ikeja, Lagos.
It was learnt that the four vehicles, suspected to be smuggled under the guise of Army convoy, were two units of Mercedez Benz Sports Utility Vehicle ML 350, one Toyota Venza, and a Mercedez Saloon car.
A source said, “The incident happened on Friday. Actually, three joint units of customs, including the NCS, Seme, Customs Intelligence Unit and Federal Operations Unit, were set to intercept the vehicles which were being piloted by a team of military men, led by Captain A.M. Murnai with Force No. 45EB/15FER with Army operation vehicle no. NA2021B05.
“Each of the smuggled cars had two soldiers in uniforms inside, as an act of subterfuge and deception, with Captain Murnai inside the piloting van.
“At the point of stop-and-search, the military men resisted and forced their way through, knocking down the deceased in order to pave way for the smuggled vehicles to escape. Two of the smuggled vehicles crushed the customs officer simultaneously.”
It was gathered that the victim's remains were deposited in the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital mortuary, Ikeja.
Some of the culprits, who were arrested together with their official vehicle, were detained.
They were later moved to the Ibereko Barracks, Badagry, on the instruction of the Commanding Officer, Ibereko Barracks, for further interrogation.
The Public Relations Officer of the NCS, Mr. Joseph Attah, confirmed the incident.
He said, “It is true that we lost an officer in that unfortunate incident. Investigations are ongoing by the Army and the NCS authorities.”
The spokesman for the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, Lt. Col. Olaolu Daudu, said the matter was being investigated.
”I am in Badagry now to investigate the matter,” he said.
It was learnt on Sunday that officers of the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army and the FOU, Ikeja, were in a joint meeting over the incident.

Officers found a man with serious injuries and he was rushed to hospital for treatment. There is no word on his current condition.
A black 2013 Ford 150 Supercab with Saskatchewan licence plate 868 JPH and two guns were taken from the home.
Police have laid charges against a man and two boys in the attack police believe was not random.
Trenton Laliberty, 21, and two teens, 14 and 15, are charged with aggravated assault and forcible confinement.
Laliberty, who is from Denare Beach, is facing additional charges including theft, assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon while prohibited.
He is described as six-feet tall, 200 pounds with brown eyes and hair. Laliberty has the word “LIVE” across his right knuckles, “LIFE” across his left knuckles, and a cross on his right wrist.

The 14-year-old is also charged with theft, unlawfully being in a dwelling, mischief, and failing to comply with a recognizance.
The boys can't be identified under provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
Police said all three should be considered armed and dangerous and are warning anyone spotting the truck to not approach it and instead report it immediately to the nearest police detachment.
Anyone with further information is asked to contact Creighton RCMP at 306-688-8888 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.
Denare Beach is approximately 560 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.
It's been a cold start to February and Mother Nature isn't letting up, below freezing temperatures continue along with snowfall warnings west of Calgary.
As of 3 p.m. Saturday, a snowfall warning was issued by Environment Canada for the city of Calgary.
Environment Canada issued a snowfall warning earlier this morning throughout central and southern Alberta.
Conditions in some central Alberta areas, closer to Edmonton, improved around the lunch hour and some of the warnings were dropped. However, as of Sunday at 1:30 p.m., a snowfall warning remains in effect in Jasper National Park, Nordegg, Banff National Park, Kananaskis, Canmore, Crowsnest Pass, Pincher Creek and Waterton Lakes National Park.
Most areas under the snowfall warning are expecting 20 to 30 centimeters of snow this weekend, but along Highway 93N, also known as the Icefields Parkway through Jasper and Banff National Parks, total amounts of 40 centimeters are possible.
511 Alberta reports highways are partly covered with snow and ice west of Calgary. Closer to Banff and Lake Louise, roads appear worse and are listed as snow-covered, especially on the TransCanada Highway and the Icefields Parkway. Travel along the Icefields Parkway is not recommended due to heavy snowfall, strong winds and poor visibility.
In Calgary, snow will continue this afternoon with a temperature steady near -20 C, but with a brisk north wind of 20 kilometres gusting to 40 kilometres per hour, it will feel more like the -30s all day. The snow will taper off this evening, but there is another round of precipitation heading our way late Sunday afternoon and evening.
The city of Calgary is expecting around 10 centimeters of snow by late Sunday night. So far today, Calgary has reached a temperature high of -18 C at the Calgary International Airport — well below the city's average daytime high of -2 C.
The Iowa Department of Revenue started accepting state tax returns for 2017 last week. Department spokesperson, John Fuller, says they're doing some things to try and help you navigate through the process.
“We've created a sort of microsite or site within our bigger website that sort of breaks that down into three easy steps and helps them understand what happens,” Fuller says,”how to file, when to file, what tools are available, things like that.” The website is www.tax.iowa.gov.
Some people might be a little bit apprehensive about filing with all the talk recently about the changes in the federal tax system. Fuller says you shouldn't worry about that.
“Filing state taxes this year will be much the same as it has been in the past. Next year will probably be different. This year there are not a lot of changes,” Fuller says. The Iowa Department of Revenue pushed in the past for people to switch from paper to electronic filing, and Fuller says that' now how a majority of the returns are sent in.
“About 90 percent. I think most people find that it's a little bit easier to do that,” according to Fuller. “A lot of times, whether they use a third-party software company, or go on our site, I think it's just a little easier to navigate through. I think most people are just more comfortable with that.” If you get onto the website and still have some questions, he says the department welcomes phone calls.
“We get a lot of phone calls — obviously depending on what time of day and what time you call — you may have to wait a few minutes. And that phone number is 515-281-3114,” Fuller says. He says they give out some of the same advice every year to Iowa taxpayers on how to make the process go better — and he says it still applies.
“Start early, because you may be missing something that you thought you had. So, avoid waiting to file until the last minute,” Fuller says. “File electronically if you can because it helps avoid mistakes. And take a minute when you are done to just double-check your work.” The deadline to file your Iowa tax returns is April 30th.
Hamilton police are continuing to search for suspects after shots were fired near the Meadowlands in Ancaster.
Police received the call around 6:30 Sunday evening from residents who said they heard shots being fired in the area of Oneida Boulevard and Algonquin Avenue, not far from Mohawk Road and Highway 403.
Nobody was hurt, but two vehicles were seen fleeing the scene.
Police say one vehicle has been recovered and they're looking for the second.
It's described as a dark grey or black Ford F150 pick-up truck.
The driver of the pick-up is described as a white male with a heavy build and shaved or bald head.
The passenger is described as a white female with a blond ponytail.
Police believe this was an incident between the occupants of the vehicles and the residents of the area were not involved.
Anyone with information about this investigation is urged to contact Division 30 detectives by calling 905-546-4930. To provide information anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or submit online.

PESHAWAR - A high-level mission of United Nations' International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday visited Shaheen Muslim Town and adjoining union councils to review the status of immunisation against polio virus.
The delegation, led by UNICEF Deputy Country representative Cristian Munduateand and Chief Health and Nutrition Section Kennedy Ongwae, visited EPI fixed sites in Shaheen Muslim Town-I and II, where they were briefed on micro-planning and routine immunisation status. Members of the delegation on the occasions stressed for the need of integrated approach so that each component of the health drive compliments other.
The mission also reviewed various activities around community based vaccination (CBV) and visited outreach sessions in the far-flung areas of Shaheen Muslim Town.
It appreciated the synergy of polio eradication initiative (PEI) and Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) and maintained that coordinated approach would yield positive results in improving health indicators in the area.
The UN mission stressed on supportive supervision by government and partner staff and working out detailed micro planning for routine immunisation at the union council levels.
Chief Field Office UNICEF Charles Nzuki, Health Specialist Dr Jamil, polio team leader and deputy team leader Dr Johar and Huma Arif and others were also present on the occasion.

People across the region will today gather to honour the sacrifice of Anzacs with services for Anzac Day.
Two such people are Manjimup nine-year-olds Jessica Leoni-Arnott and Mazlyn Membry, who will take part in the Manjimup Anzac Day march.
“I really like remembering the people who fought for our country to honour them,” Jessica said.
Jessica's grandfather Kenneth Bartlett fought in World War II and returned home.
“Services are a nice way to remember what the soldiers did for us,” she said.
Mazlyn is also looking forward to the march.
“My poppy went to the Vietnam War and he came back — I love him so much,” she said.
Mazlyn also said she enjoyed her school's Anzac service, which was held before the term ended.
Manjimup's dawn service is at 6am and the main service at 11am.
An international company is building its U.S. headquarters right here in Oakland County.
VDL Steelweld Michigan LLC., is planning to invest $1.2 million and create 43 jobs in Troy. The company is part of the VDL Group, a global company that designs, produces, and installs robotic production systems.
Troy was chosen over locations in California and South Carolina. The city plans to assist the company with marketing and promotion support.
Jeff Mason, CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said VDL Steelweld will become a contributor to the states vehicle supply chain.

This investment further enhances our reputation as the center for the global automotive industry, said Mason.
As a result of this Michigan investment, the company was awarded a $300,000 grant funding from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
VDL Steelweld recently established operations in the U.S. to better serve original equipment manufacturing customers and Tier 1 suppliers in North America.
VDL Group is a family owned group of 94 different companies in 20 countries and more than 16,000 employees. It was established in 1953 and had an estimated revenue of $5.6 billion in 2017.
VDL-owned companies produce a diverse range of products from large welded constructions to complex mechatronic systems, busses, coaches, and automated guided vehicles. In addition, VDL has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that produces cars for BMW.
The world's largest companies are starting to feel China breathing down their necks, as the economic superpower has started extracting apologies from major brands that do not refer to Taiwan as Chinese territory.
The democratically elected government of Taiwan has remained distinct from the Communist-run People's Republic of China since 1949. Nevertheless, China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and treats it simply as a rogue province that will one day be reunited with the mainland, under a policy known as One China.
READ MORE: Donald Trump agrees to honour ‘One China' policy in call with President Xi Jinping
The policy has been in place for decades, but Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed renewed emphasis on it since he was re-elected and granted sweeping new powers in March.
One China has been a thorny issue for other world powers, including the U.S. and Canada, to navigate. Most nations officially acknowledge Taiwan as part of China, even while maintaining unofficial ties with the government in Taipei.
But while China has succeeded in isolating Taiwan from maintaining official nation-to-nation relations with most of the world, it's largely kept that campaign in the political sphere.
That is, until recently, when private companies have started facing backlash from the Chinese government or its citizens for not conforming to the One China policy.
“What's at stake is we're allowing a revisionist regime with a terrible track record on freedom of speech to dictate what we say and write in our own countries,” J. Michael Cole, a senior fellow with the China Policy Institute and the University of Nottingham's Taiwan studies program, told The Associated Press.
“If Beijing does not encounter red lines, it can only keep asking for more.”
Major brands fearing backlash
Wholesale giant Costco landed in the middle of a One China controversy this week after a 2016 letter from a human resources executive surfaced on Chinese social media. The letter sought to clarify an issue with a website drop-down menu in which Taiwan was not included as an option.
“We have retail locations in Taiwan and very much consider it a country,” wrote Patrick Callans, senior vice-president of human resources and risk management at Costco.
Costco has not yet commented on the letter, which caused major outcry on Weibo, China's social media network.
The Royal Bank of Canada was nearly drawn into a similar issue this week when a Vancouver newspaper suggested that the bank had reclassified Taiwan as a province of China on its website. A screenshot in the report showed “Taiwan (Province of China)” listed as an option for sending wire transfers.
RBC told Global News on Tuesday that nothing has changed in the way it refers China, and that its naming conventions adhere to international standards.
“For certain money transfer services, country descriptions are pulled directly from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),” RBC told GlobalNews.ca in a statement on Tuesday. “RBC has followed the ISO naming convention since January 2016.”
Taiwan is listed on the ISO website as “Taiwan (Province of China).” However, it appears to be listed as simply “Taiwan” on all RBC pages accessed by GlobalNews.ca.
“Adoption of ISO standards is not a political statement,” an RBC spokesperson said in a statement to GlobalNews.ca.
“RBC respects the people, cultures, sovereignty and supervisory organizations of every country where we operate.”
Mercedes-Benz, Zara, The Gap, Medtronic, Marriott Hotels and Resorts, Lufthansa and Delta Air Lines have all backtracked or apologized in recent months for public incidents that ran afoul of the One China policy with wording or images in their products.
In the case of Mercedes-Benz, the carmaker faced backlash for using a quote from Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post.
The Gap ran into trouble when it released a T-shirt with a map of China on it that did not include Taiwan.
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on corporations to push back against China's aggressive One China demands.
“We strongly object to China's efforts to bully, coerce, and threaten their way to achieving their political objectives,” the ministry said in a statement to The Associated Press.
“We call on all countries around the world to stand together to uphold the freedom of speech and freedom to do business. We also call on private firms to reject China's unreasonable demands to change their designation of ‘Taiwan' to ‘Taiwan, China.'”
Sky-high demands
Air Canada acquiesced earlier this month to a letter from China's Civil Aviation Administration, which called for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau to be re-labelled as parts of China on its website.
Air Canada was among 36 foreign airlines to receive the letter threatening severe sanctions for airlines that refused its request.
READ MORE: Taiwan is no longer listed as independent country on Air Canada booking website
The letter was also sent to some of the most prominent airlines in the United States, prompting a sharp response from the White House.
“This is Orwellian nonsense,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on May 5.
“The United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content.”
Most of the airlines that received the letter have since altered how they refer to Taiwan online.
The wrath of China
The United States and Canada do not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, under their own versions of the One China policy.
The U.S. has not declared its official support for Taiwan as a country, but it has continued to maintain a strong connection to the island through various military and travel agreements. A new, unofficial U.S. embassy, dubbed the American Institute in Taiwan, is slated to open in Taipei next month.

Private businesses are not bound by their respective countries' One China policies, although many have kowtowed to Beijing in the face of its economic might.
READ MORE: Xi Jinping's historic power grab a ‘critical moment in China's history'
But the battle over brands is just a small part of China's efforts to pressure Taiwan into returning to the fold.
Taiwan has long resisted China's overtures for reunification, even as the number of countries that officially recognize it has dwindled.
Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic became the latest countries to abandon Taiwan this month when they opted instead to strengthen ties with Beijing. Most of Taiwan's remaining allies are tiny countries in Central America, South America and the Pacific Islands.

China's president vowed in March to push for “peaceful reunification” with Taiwan.
“The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed and it is absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China,” Xi said at a session of parliament in Beijing.
“Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will be met with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history.”

NEW DELHI: Alleging humiliation, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan wrote to Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra that henceforth he will not practice in the court, days after the CJI took exception to the conduct of some senior lawyers.
Chief Justice Misra had last week voiced strong objection to the conduct of certain Senior Counsel raising their voices during hearing at the conclusion of Delhi government's plea and also the Ayodhya matter.
In the brief letter that was delivered to the office of the Chief Justice on Monday, Dhavan said: “After the humiliating end in the Delhi case, I have decided to give up court practice.”
Dhavan in his letter also told the Chief Justice: “You are entitled to take back the Senior Gown conferred on me, though I would like to keep it for memory and service rendered.”

Part sporting epic, part media extravaganza, part assertion of national identity, the Tour de France cycle race will depart from Noirmoutier-en-l'île in the Vendée region on Saturday, July 7. What makes this barnstorming annual event so compelling?
Held every July, the Tour de France — literally “tour of France” — is an epic, 2,200-mile cycle race lasting 23 days. It is divided into 21 day-long stages, or étapes, that take competitors up sheer mountainsides, down zigzagging hairpins, and across deceptively flat plains in a grueling, immensely physical contest culminating in a sprint to the finish on the majestic Champs-Elysées in Paris.
A casual observer might be surprised to learn that a mass bike ride across rural France (with incursions into neighboring countries) is now the world's third most popular sporting event, after the Olympic Games and the Soccer World Cup. La Grande Boucle, or “great loop”, as the Tour is also known, garners TV audiences of some 3.5 billion across 170 countries1. Here at home, between 10 and 12 million spectators line the roadsides during the three-week event to cheer on the riders and, more generally, soak up the festive atmosphere.
So what attracts these mega-audiences, including people like myself who almost never put foot to pedal? Part of the answer is that the Tour de France has always been about much more than cycling. One astute observer has called it a magical mystery tour combining sport, culture, and politics. Even the origins of the race are distinctively French, rooted as they are in a political spat.
“The Greatest Cycling Event Ever Organized”
At the turn of the 20th century, public opinion in the country was split into two bitterly antagonistic camps over the guilt or innocence of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a French army officer accused of selling secrets to the enemy. On the pro-Dreyfus side of the fault line was a sports newspaper, Le Vélo, whose chief editor came out vocally in the captain's defense. The paper's stance aroused the ire of the anti-Dreyfusards, including several auto and cycle manufacturers, who founded their own paper, L'Auto-Vélo. The original paper successfully sued for plagiarism, forcing the upstart to change its name to L'Auto. Fearing an exodus of cycling-loving readers, and the revenue they generated, the editor and his backers decided to organize a long-distance cycle race across France. And to advertise it heavily.
Just as important, L'Auto portrayed the race as a showcase for the values and virtues of a modern, industrial nation and its vigorous, healthy youth. Billed as “the greatest cycling event ever organized,” the first Tour de France was staged in 1903. In the ensuing 70 years, with a hiatus during the two world wars, the race took on an almost mythical quality, with stories of riders repairing broken bikes on the village blacksmith's anvil before soldiering on to the finish line. Stories about the magic powers of the #51 on the winning rider's shirt. Stories about the Eternel Second, the underdog who never won the Tour but was always more popular than the winner. Stories about completing the steepest of hill climbs despite ripped tendons and broken bones. Stories about pilgrimages to the monument honoring a rider who collapsed and died on the Mont Ventoux.
The Myth of the Tour
And of course, being France, the myth has been talked up by intellectuals. Take the philosopher Roland Barthes. He described the race as “a utopian image of a world searching obstinately to reconcile itself through the staging of a totally clear portrayal of the relations between man, men, and Nature.” The great Yogi Berra might have described the bike race more straightforwardly: “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”

On a less lofty note, La Grande Boucle has been immortalized in the marvelous Astérix et le Tour de Gaule, which sees the wily warrior touring the country, picking up regional culinary specialties along the way, in order to thumb his nose at the Roman occupiers, who may have conquered Gallic lands but would never vanquish the doughty natives.2
Even today, in our eclectic and ironic era, the Tour serves as a showcase for the beauties and charms of a privileged land. TV cameras linger lovingly on proud church spires, stately châteaux, gorgeous landscapes, pretty vineyards, and sleepy hamlet. These and other images evoke a timeless vision of France, a place steeped in history and sure of its identity. As one commentator put it, the Grande Boucle is a pre-modern contest in a post-modern era.
A Small Fortune for Each Stage City
Such is the Tour's media exposure that towns and villages vie for the honor of hosting an étape or simply being on the itinerary. In my Burgundian village, which was on the 2010 circuit, the mayor spent a municipal fortune repaving the main road, leaving the side streets full of potholes, so that the cortege of riders, advertisers, journalists, and camp followers could whiz past in comfort. Apparently, the 15 minutes of fame were worth the outlay. Similar scenes are repeated every year across the land.
It's not just about sport, of course. The Tour was conceived partly for publicity purposes, and the “caravan” of advertisers and sponsors that precedes the riders is an integral and much-loved part of this show on wheels. (In fact, the Tour's website says that 47 percent of spectators come primarily to watch the caravan.) Just picture it: a 170-strong fleet of brightly painted and often wacky vehicles filled with smiling, waving youngsters who pelt the crowd with trinkets, candy, and mini-sausages as they careen past at nearly 30 miles per hour. Who needs targeted web ads?
There has always been something rather old-fashioned about the Tour de France, the ultimate man- versus-machine contest. In reality, however, the event is constantly evolving. For example, riders originally raced in teams sponsored by cycle manufacturers. In the 1930s, the teams were organized along national lines. Thirty years later the trade teams returned, and the era of big-name sponsorship be- gan as banks, insurance companies, and major retailers competed against sporting goods firms for eyeballs (and, today, for, clicks).
Greg LeMond, the First American Winner
Likewise, starting in the 1990s, the Tour's organizers made serious efforts to internationalize the race, which had long been focused on France and its immediate geographical neighbors. The first U.S. team, 7-Eleven, made its debut in 1986. And that same year, the race was won by an American rider, Greg LeMond, who became the first person from an English-speaking country to head up the general classification. One less savory evolution has been the reliance of some riders on increasingly sophisticated performance-enhancing drugs. The stimulants of choice in the early days were wine — combined, in the case of one rider, with oysters — and ether. These have made way for EPO, growth hormones, testosterone, and chemical boosters.
As the Grande Boucle becomes globalized, it has less and less to do with French sporting prowess: an elderly lady once complained to me: “Je ne sais pas pourquoi on l'appelle ‘le Tour de France': ce n'est jamais un Français qui gagne !” Indeed, no French rider has won the Tour since 1985. And, comble de l'horreur, the winner for the past three years has been a een a Brit, Chris Froome. Just as significantly, the status of French as the event's official language is receding. English has become increasingly important, arguably since the seven-year winning streak of U.S. rider Lance Armstrong (who was later stripped of his titles) and the rise to prominence of American and British cycling teams. What's more, today's squads are composed of riders from many different countries, so the choice of English as the lingua franca seems logical. Even the official Tour de France media hub is now called Le Race Center. Ô mon God!
A Popular Pursuit
Another big change is the phasing-out of the “podium girls” — known, demurely, in French as les hôtesses du Tour — who greet each day's winners with flowers and kisses (but are not permitted to talk to them!). Even though these poised and accomplished young women do a taxing job in often trying circumstances, the organizers have concluded that the tradition is ill-suited to the times. So, they are following the example of other major sporting events, notably Formula 1 motor racing, is trying to ditch a red-blooded-male image.
Thus the Tour de France is accelerating into the modern era with drones, bike-mounted GoPro cameras and real time data analytics. Nevertheless, in a world of “eventism” and sporting gigantism, there's something romantic about this contest, something old-fashioned yet timeless, something patriotic but not nationalistic. Despite the big money and global coverage, the Grande Boucle is, in essence, a popular pursuit dating from a time when cars were for the bourgeoisie and bikes for the working class. It is a global sports event that can be watched live for free; a street party that goes on for weeks; a contest where the winner shares the (relatively modest) prize purse with the entire team, including the mechanics and bus drivers. And it's accompanied by a publicity caravan that hands out gewgaws rather than cash and corporate freebies. In short, the Tour de France is reassuringly accessible. And what if a French rider doesn't always win? As Yogi Berra philosophized: “If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be.”

When Saudi security forces stormed into Abdullah's home in al-Awamiya, a majority Shia town in the eastern province of Qatif, in February, he was nowhere to be found. He had been in hiding since security forces first raided his home in May last year.
Since then, *Abdullah says he has been taking refuge in different homes and corner shops every two days.
Abdullah is worried he may never see his family again if he is caught. He is yet to meet his baby girl, who was born six months ago.
“I haven't seen my wife in nine months and I just have a photo of [my baby],” he told Middle East Eye in a phone interview. “It hurts me so much not being able to be with them.”

Dozens of other young men, say activists on the ground, have gone into hiding in al-Awamiya, with no place to go since there are checkpoints manning the town's exit points since August, when Saudi forces flattened most of the town's old quarter and forcibly relocated many of its residents.
I haven't seen my wife in nine months and I just have a photo of [my baby] - Abdullah
“I still don't know why they're after me. I think it's because I participated in protests against the state [during the Arab Spring],” said Abdullah. “The whole community is scared. I think I know at least 50 people who have been seized by police [in al-Awamiya].”
Six of Abdullah's family members have been arrested within the last year. According to Abdullah, the same day security forces raided his home in February, his nephew was dragged out of his sister's house without explanation. Abdullah claims those arrested in al-Awamiya are taken to a prison in the eastern city of Dammam and later charged with harbouring terrorists or attempting to overthrow the state.

These charges, suspects Abdullah, are handed down to people who protested against the ruling family during the Arab revolutions which erupted in 2011. At the time, many Saudi Shias rallied behind the charismatic Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, who called for an end to the Saudi monarchy and spoke out against religious and political discrimination of Shia in the kingdom.
Every time I saw him his health was deteriorating. He was often limping, and he became very thin - Zahkih, wife
Al-Nimr was arrested by Saudi authorities in 2012 and sentenced to death. On 2 January 2016, he was executed along with 46 other prisoners, mostly held on charges of terrorism, sparking protests across the region.
Saudi Arabia is notorious for its intolerance towards religious minorities, notably Shia communities who continue to face arrest, imprisonment and even the death penalty following unfair trials.
In a 2017 report, Amnesty, along with Human Rights Watch, said that in recent years it has recorded an increase in death sentences against political dissidents in Saudi Arabia, including members of the Shia Muslim minority. The organisations said that there are at least 38 members of Saudi's Shia community – who make up 10 to 15 percent of the population – currently sentenced to death.
Guilt by association
Family members of the executed cleric say that the government is now after them. One of his cousins, Jihad al-Nimr, fears for his life and is looking for a way to escape al-Awamiya.

“I think I'm wanted because I joined [al-Nimr] in demonstrations and protested his execution,” he told MEE. “I also protested when the authorities refused to hand over [his] body so that we could give him a proper burial.”
My mother pulled me away from my father, so the police could drag my dad out of the house - Maria, daughter
Just days after Jihad went into hiding in November, police raided his home and arrested his brothers and nephews. The women, said Jihad, were forced into a separate room where they cried out for their sons and husbands who were dragged away.
“They took my two brothers and nephews,” said Jihad. “Their wives and mothers have been trying to find out where they are being held, but authorities have told them nothing.”
The spokesperson of the Saudi General Prosecutor's office did not respond to MEE's requests for comment by the time of publication.
Meanwhile, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman claims that the kingdom's problem is not with Shia but rather with Iran, as he reiterated in a recent interview with The Atlantic. But Jihad believes that more Shia will die under his rule.
A reformer?
While Saudi Shia have long been marginalised in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, some claim that the oppression has worsened since Mohammed bin Salman was appointed by his father as next in line for the throne in June last year.
The authorities continue to use the death penalty as a political weapon against Saudi Arabia's Shia minority - Dana Ahmed, Amnesty campaigner on Saudi Arabia
According to Dana Ahmed, the Amnesty campaigner on Saudi Arabia, 26 men have had their death sentences upheld by the Supreme Court since Bin Salman took power, rendering their execution imminent.
“The authorities continue to use the death penalty as a political weapon against Saudi Arabia's Shia minority,” she told MEE.

Shortly after Bin Salman assumed power, al-Awamiya was being pounded to rubble by Saudi security forces who have been engaged in clashes with armed Shia residents since May.
The residents were resisting the demolition of the historic al-Masora neighbourhood. In April last year, the United Nations called on the Saudi government to halt the demolition of the 400-year-old walled district, warning that it threatened "the historical and cultural heritage of the town with irreparable harm".
However, the Saudi government plans to build a development project, including a shopping mall in its place, after claiming that the neighbourhood was harbouring Shia militants. Al-Awamiya, the hometown of al-Nimr, has long been a flashpoint for protests by Saudi's Shia minority since the Arab revolutions in 2011.

By the time fighting came to a halt in August, security forces had set-up checkpoints at every exit and maintained a heavy presence in the town. With the ongoing police raids, Shia from al-Awamiya and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia say they are living in perpetual fear.
[Bin Salman] keeps telling the West that he will reform Islam, but he keeps raiding the homes of Shia and stripping us of any political rights - Abbas
As the youngest monarch of the kingdom, 32-year-old Prince Salman has long portrayed himself as a reformer, and was recently on his first trip abroad since he assumed power in a bid to charm foreign leaders.
After he assumed power, Saudi Arabia announced that women will be allowed to drive, bringing an age-old policy to an end. However, *Abbas, who lives in al-Awamiya, told MEE that Shia Muslims in the community are not buying into the image that Bin Salman is portraying of himself.
“Bin Salman is already acting like he's the king of Saudi Arabia,” Abbas told MEE. “He keeps telling the West that he will reform Islam, but he keeps raiding the homes of Shia and stripping us of any political rights,” he said in a phone call with MEE.
Death row
Abbas al-Hassan is one of the 26 prisoners on death row. His wife, Zakih, told MEE that al-Hassan was arrested on 2 June 2013. Her two daughters, she says, clung onto him as the officers wrestled him away from their home in Jeddah. Maria, who was just 15 years old at the time, remembers feeling the grip of her father's hand for the last time.
“My mother pulled me away from my father, so the police could drag my dad out of the house,” she told MEE. “I really hope my father comes back to us. We really miss and need him.”
I really hope my father comes back to us. We really miss and need him - Maria, daughter of prisoner on death row
After languishing for three years in a prison in Jeddah, al-Hassan was sentenced to death in December 2016 for ostensibly colluding with Iranian authorities and operating a spy cell in Saudi Arabia, charges that he and his family deny.
The evidence brought against al-Hassan was based on a confession that he says was extracted under torture. He never told his wife details about the mistreatment, except that his legs were tied to his hands and that he couldn't sleep for days.
The authorities also reportedly threatened to imprison his wife and children if he didn't tell them what they wanted to hear.
Ahmed, the Amnesty campaigner, told MEE that other prisoners reported being tortured by being slapped in the face and beaten on the back.
Fourteen Shia were reportedly threatened with more beatings, she says, unless they signed a confession in front of a judge.
“Authorities should have investigated the allegations of torture, but they never have,” she told MEE.
Weeks after the death sentence was handed down to al-Hassan, his lawyers appealed the decision in January 2017. During that time, Zakih visited her husband every second week in prison.
“Every time I saw him his health was deteriorating. He was often limping, and he became very thin,” she said.
In December, prison guards told Zakih that her husband had been moved to a prison in the capital Riyadh and that she wasn't allowed to visit him.
Fearing the worst, she travelled to Riyadh to inquire about her husband at the Supreme Court. The judges told her that al-Hassan's death sentence had been ratified by the Supreme Court along with 11 other Shia prisoners, in what was described by Amnesty as a "grossly unfair mass trial".
Amnesty International has found that death sentences are often ratified without informing the families or lawyers of inmates.
“I refuse to accept that my husband will be killed. This isn't fair for him or for our family,” Zahkih told MEE.
I refuse to accept that my husband will be killed. This isn't fair for him or for our family - Zahkih, wife
Taha Hajji, a Saudi Shia human rights lawyer who advises Zakih from Germany, said that lawyers of political detainees risk reprisal if they speak to the press.
He was forced to leave the country for trying to persuade authorities to spare the life of cleric al-Nimr over two years ago.
“Shortly after [al-Nimr] was executed, I received a call from the prosecutor's office informing me that I was wanted for arrest,” he told MEE.
“I can't know for sure the official charges, but I thought I should try to fly to Istanbul from Saudi Arabia despite the risk of being arrested at the airport. I was lucky that nothing happened,” he added.
While Hajji is safe, al-Hassan might not be so lucky. Zakih says that there is nothing they can do to appeal the death sentence after it's been ratified. She nonetheless continues to visit her husband who was returned to the prison in Jeddah in January.
With no timetable given for the execution, she doesn't know how many more times she will get to visit him.
“I can't contemplate a life without my husband,” she told MEE. “I have so much pain in my heart, but I try to act strong in front of him.”

Long before the iPhone or even the Mac, Apple was a handful of people working in an industry that was only just beginning to take the idea of personal computing seriously. In the earliest days of those early days, Steves Wozniak and Jobs made their first device together: the Apple I. Few of these were sold, and fewer still survive — but the Living Computers museum in Seattle managed to get three. And one of them was Jobs' personal machine.
Paul Allen, the museum's founder and patron, has caused to be assembled quite an impressive collection of devices from Apple's history, many of which have been restored to working condition. The public will be able to tinker with a NeXT Cube as well as early Macs, but the pride and joy of the collection must be the Apple Is.
The new exhibit, which highlights the collaboration and competition between Apple and Microsoft over the years as the companies grew, is open today.
The Apple I, you may or may not remember, wasn't much of a hit. Only 200 were made — by hand — and it wasn't long before the company put its hopes in the Apple II, which would go on to be more popular by far. One of the Is, however, Jobs kept in his office as a demo machine for industry people.
When Jobs left in 1985 he left in a hurry, and this I was left behind on a shelf. Don Hutmacher, one of the company's first employees, grabbed it and it stayed in his possession until he passed away last year. His wife generously allowed the museum to take care of it, and you can imagine their gratitude.
The team had their suspicious, but a tag inside the metal chassis — and the fact that it had a chassis at all, since Apple Is came just as boards — suggested it was more than a rare Apple I; it was the rarest. It's signed “BF,” which would have been employee number one, Bill Fernandez. This was definitely, the team decided, Jobs' custom machine.
Because the Apple I didn't have a ROM, and Jobs didn't want to have to program it from scratch any time someone wanted to see it in action, he had a custom EPROM attached to it that initialized the computer with BASIC when it started up. Its RAM, the engineering team suspects, was also augmented so it didn't run out and crash during the demo.
The team at the museum read the contents of this EPROM and used it to set up a second, less historic Apple I. That one, which has had its power components modified to be a little less prone to catching fire or warping the circuit board, will now be available in this primed state for anyone to play with. Yes, anyone — the only operational Apple I on the planet right now, and your kid can type “butts” on it with fingers still greasy from the sandwich they got across the street.
Crunchbase Steve Jobs Bio Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of [Apple]( http://www.crunchbase.com/company/apple ) and formerly [Pixar](/company/pixar). Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California to Joanne Simpson and a Syrian father. Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, California then adopted him. In 1972, Jobs graduated from Homestead High School in Cupertino, California and enrolled in Reed College in Portland, … Full profile for Steve Jobs
That's the mission of the museum, though: the Apple I, along with dozens of other ancient computers, from Altairs to mainframes from the 60's, are deliberately there to be touched and, if not truly understood (few kids know BASIC these days), at least experienced.
Ahead of the exhibit's opening, a small reunion was held for a handful of people who had a hand in the early days of Apple, Microsoft, and the home computer industry. Steve Wosniak and Paul Allen met — for the first time, amazingly — and chatted over an Apple II. And it wasn't until someone took stock of the situation that they realized that the entire original team that built the Apple I in Steve Jobs' garage — minus the departed Steve — were together again for the first time in decades:
Apple 1 Team Retouched Paul Allen and Woz Apple Group with Labels V3 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit
The museum has also been working with the University of Washington to compile an oral history of this era of computing, and many of the people who figured in the creation of the Apple I.
Now that the exhibit is open, feel free to drop by the museum and touch a few pieces of computing history — though you may need to brush up on your BASIC.
MULTAN - The first national dental conference organised by the Nishtar Institute of Dentistry recommended yesterday that the government should take measures to provide oral health to poor people as more than one-third of Pakistanis do not have access to dental care.
Addressing the conference, Khawaja Jalaluddin Roomi, Chairman Board of Management Nishtar Hospital and Medical College said that five major issues like banning quackery, improving education standards, school-based programme and medical aid programme for adults would have been initiated to ameliorate this crisis. He pointed out Pakistanis are living short and keeping no teeth in old age. As the elderly population increases, its oral health needs and ability to access care are garnering more attention.
Mr Roomi said that it is a good step that the first national dental conference was held in Multan by Nishtar Institute of dentistry and prominent scholars, researchers and dentists joined this conference to exchange their experiments and expertise. He stressed the need for launching an awareness drive for oral health to keep the society disease free. He said that there should be proper arrangement for the poor children particularly school-going children. He said that people, especially those belonging to underprivileged sections of society are forced to seek dental treatments from more than 40,000 non-qualified dental practitioners. Although these "quacks" offer easily accessible and affordable solutions to the painful dental problems of the poor patients, but in doing so they play havoc not only with their oral health but general health as well.
The experts stressed that a healthy public policy at national level alone can create a supportive environment for the communities to gain control over and improve their health. To translate such a policy into reality, reorientation of the healthcare system for focus on prevention, effective Dental Health Education (DHE) and Oral Health Promotion (OHP) is needed. This can be achieved by harnessing the power of the booming electronic media by advertisement against tobacco and betel use and for implementing laws like ban on smoking at public places and under-age sale, considering the fact that it is the most common cause of oral cancer in Pakistan.
Principal of NID Prof Dr Riaz Ahmed Warraich, Medical Superintendent Dr Ilyas Tanvir, Dr Amjad Bari and Dr Waqas Ahmed addressed the conference while a number of scholars read out their research papers.

Most people think of cruise holidays as lazing on a ship, basking in the sunshine and making the occasional excursion to a new city or port.
However, nowadays cruises are upping the stakes with their itineraries - and a cruise ship getaway can transform into an action-packed adventure holiday.
And if you're looking for adventure, the Amazon River is a pretty spectacular place to start.
Mark Ellis boarded Fred Olsen Cruises' Amazon River Adventure to experience cruise ship holidays unlike any other - and he discovered what it's really like in the heart of the jungle...
Mark's travel diary
A trip on a cruise ship might seem an unlikely way to start an adventure holiday. But this is no ordinary cruise – in fact, we are nearly 1,000 miles from the sea.
We are exploring the amazing Amazon, and the scale of this river is as breathtaking as the scenery.
Our destination is Manaus in Brazil, a quarter of the way along the river's 4,000 miles where it is still an astonishing 10 miles wide.
The city is the gateway to the heart of the Amazonian jungle where, at any moment, you expect to see Sir David Attenborough emerge from the undergrowth.
After all, it is home to 2,000 different types of birds, many rarely seen as they hide in the 200ft-high tree-top canopies. There are also at least 3,000 species of fish below us.
Aboard our Fred Olsen ship, the 929-passenger Braemar, expectations had been high as we set off for the capital of the Amazonas State and the starting point for many of our trips by land or river.
Nearly half the passengers had gathered on deck with bags packed ready to go ashore to explore after an early breakfast, but hopes of our expected early arrival began to fade.
The unpredictable Amazon had taken a hand and strong currents, plus having to navigate carefully through giant logs and floating vegetation, meant we would be at least a few hours late.
But our captain Jens Gulowsen came to the rescue with a quick call to the Fred Olsen HQ in Ipswich securing an extra night's stay in the city and re-arranging excursions so we wouldn't miss a second of our planned Amazon explorations.
Captain Gulowsen told me: “As you see, it is not just a cruise, it is an adventure. This is the exciting thing about the river, it is constantly changing and presents real challenges.”
On arrival, some passengers faced another challenge – a night in the rainforest in wooden lodges, with lessons in jungle survival techniques and a guided tour to see wildlife including capuchin and woolly monkeys.
The forest comes alive after dark with the calls and cries of its countless birds and animals, and the lodges, like the local fishermen's homes, are on stilts as this giant river can be hit by floods that cover an area of land the size of England.
Our party set off instead for a spot of caiman hunting in a motorised canoe on a lake fed by countless tributaries of the Amazon.
As the outboard motor was switched off, our guide began searching the overgrown margins with a flashlight to catch the eyes of these beasts, one of the largest of the alligator species.
To our astonishment he captured one, hypnotised by the light, and brought it aboard for pictures before returning it unharmed to carry on searching for prey in the shallows.
These waters are also home to wild pink dolphins, who get their hue from the number of blood vessels running beneath the surface of their skin. On one of the many Amazon trips available, you get to feed them.
And then there are the delights of piranha fishing, dangling chunks of raw meat into the water on fishing lines. I didn't get a bite, but kept my fingers and toes out of the water just in case they were there.
Back on board ship, there was always plenty to see on deck – such as the Masked Booby, a huge gannet-like bird with a 6ft wingspan which enthralled us with spectacular nose-dives into the water from 100ft to catch fish.
At night, moths and giant flying insects were attracted by the light and an early inspection of the deck around the pools found several uninvited passengers.
Our first port of call in the Amazon – after leaving Barbados on our 14-night cruise – had been Santarem, around 400 miles up the river. Once an isolated jungle outpost, but now a busy trading centre.
Another 150 miles upstream is Parintins, famed for its Boi Bimba festival, the biggest in Brazil after the Rio Carnival. A taster of this colourful folklore tale in dazzling costumes is put on for visitors.
Braemar is not a large ship, but small does not mean less. It has comfortable cabins, excellent food and service, entertainment for all ages and nightly shows better than anything you will see on Saturday night TV.
The ship attracts a devoted following of loyal passengers who keep coming back.
Some had even been on the cruise before this one and were staying on for the next one in the Caribbean, a testimony that speaks for itself.
As we left the chocolate brown river, it was astonishing to think we were being swept back down into its 200-mile wide mouth by fresh water that enters the grey North Atlantic at a rate of 45 million gallons every second.
The first men who sailed into the Amazon centuries ago must have thought they were entering an unknown world.
I know how they felt.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  President Donald Trump's pick to oversee Medicare and Medicaid advised Vice President Mike Pence on health care issues while he was Indiana's governor, a post she maintained amid a web of business arrangements  including one that ethics experts say conflicted with her public duties.
A review by The Associated Press found Seema Verma and her small Indianapolis-based firm made millions through consulting agreements with at least nine states while also working under contract for Hewlett Packard. The company holds a financial stake in the health care policies Verma's consulting work helped shape in Indiana and elsewhere.
Her firm, SVC Inc., collected more than $6.6 million in consulting fees from the state of Indiana since 2011, records show. At the same time, records indicate she also received more than $1 million through a contract with Hewlett, the nation's largest operator of state Medicaid claims processing systems.
Last year, her firm collected an additional $316,000 for work done for the state of Kentucky as a subcontractor for HP Enterprises, according to documents obtained by AP through public records requests.

In financial disclosures posted this week, Verma reported she has an agreement to sell SVC Inc. to Health Management Associates of Lansing, Michigan, within 90 days of her confirmation.
In a statement, a spokesman for Verma said there was no conflict of interest and added that she has the support of former officials who served with her under Pence.
Her firm was "completely transparent in regards to its relationship with HP and that there was never a conflict of interest," spokesman Marcus Barlow said in a statement.
A spokesman for Pence did not respond to a request for comment.
Verma faces a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday. Democrats in Washington are aware of many of her consulting arrangements, and have broader concerns about her philosophy about government entitlement programs, lack of background in Medicare and inexperience leading a large organization.
As a trusted adviser to Pence, she had an office in the state government center and took on duties usually reserved for state administrators. Verma was also widely respected for her grasp on policy and designed a federal Medicaid waiver that allowed Pence to undertake his own conservative expansion of the program while still accepting money made available through the Affordable Care Act.
Verma did not specifically address how she would handle decisions related to HP in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services that was released this week. The letter outlined her plan for managing potential conflicts of interest should she be confirmed by the Senate to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Her relationship with HP was first reported by the Indianapolis Star in 2014.
Legal and ethics experts contacted by AP say Verma's work for Hewlett, and offshoot HP Enterprises, raised questions about where her loyalties lay  to the company, or to state taxpayers.
Richard Painter, former President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, called Verma's arrangement a "conflict of interest" that "clearly should not happen and is definitely improper."
Such arrangements are typically prohibited for rank-and-file state employees under Indiana's ethics rules and laws, but they're murkier when it comes to consulting work. Contractors have often replaced state employees in a GOP bid to drive down the number of public employees, distinctions between the two can be hard to discern.
"She was cloaked with so much responsibility and so much authority, people thought she was a state employee," said Debra Minot, a former head of Indiana's Family and Social Services Agency under Pence who worked with Verma.
Indiana University law professor David Orentlicher compared Verma's dual employment to an attorney who represents both the plaintiff and the defense in a lawsuit. It's also similar to federal contract negotiator with a side job for a company they regularly negotiate with, he said.
"If you have one person on both sides of the negotiating, they can't negotiate hard for both sides," said Orentlicher, a former Indiana Democratic state lawmaker.
There was at least one instance where Verma crossed the line in Indiana when she was dispatched by HP to help smooth over a billing dispute, said Minot.
"It was never clear to me until that moment that she, in essence, was representing both the agency and one of our very key contractors," said Minot, who was removed as head of the agency by Pence over her disagreements with Verma. "It was just shocking to me that she could play both sides."
State contracts show Verma's duties to Indiana and Hewlett have overlapped at times. One agreement she held with the state's social services agency required her to "provide technical assistance" to state contractors, as well as the governor's office. Another duty was "contract development and negotiation" with vendors, which included HP and HP Enterprises
Verma reported her salary with SVC is $480,000 and her business income from the company as nearly $2.2 million.

Time is running out for Londoners to file their nomination papers to run for city council this fall.
A review by 980 CFPL shows there are far fewer people registered to run for city council this year compared to previous years.

As of Wednesday morning, there are only 31 people running for 14 seats on city council this fall. That's down from 72 in 2014 and 54 in 2010.
There are also fewer people running for mayor so far this year: 11 people have filed papers to run, down from 15 in 2014 and 2010.
“There's this famous slogan in politics that a week is a long time. I think three weeks is even longer,” said Andrew Sancton, the former head of Western University's local government program.
“I think it's quite likely that more candidates will emerge — I'm certain more candidates will emerge — so I'm not terribly concerned about it.”
Although he feels there's still plenty of time for candidates to register, Sancton is more interested in what issue will be this election's major focus.
“What I'm looking for is not so much the number of candidates there are, but whether there's going to be a sort of organized group of candidates, or even a less organized group of candidates, who want to put the brakes on bus rapid transit (BRT). I think that's the big question for this election,” said Sancton.

Those opposed to BRT have been anything but silent, which is why Sancton is surprised the issue hasn't sparked more candidates to come forward.
“Maybe that's still going to happen, but if it doesn't then it's going to be a rather typical, incumbent kind of election,” he said.
As of Wednesday, there are four councillors who would be acclaimed on July 27 if no one runs against them. So far, no one, including Ward 3 Coun. Mo Salih has registered to run in Ward 3.
Londoners have until July 27 to file their nomination papers for the municipal election this fall.

Prince Harry believes in his relationship with Meghan Markle so much, he's reportedly rejected the idea of having a prenuptial agreement ahead of their marriage.
A source allegedly told TheDailyMail, “He's determined that his marriage will be a lasting one, so there's no need for him to sign anything.”
Harry is following in the footsteps of his older brother William, who also refused to sign a prenup.
The royal couple plan on getting married in May. In case you missed it, invited guests include Obama, Elton John and no invite for our current commander in chief, Trump.
RELATE STORIES:
Also On Magic 95.9:
The Austrian Grand Prix produced another thrilling contest in Formula One's 2018 season, and another with an unexpected result. Our F1 editors Laurence Edmondson and Nate Saunders are joined by columnists Kate Walker and Maurice Hamilton to discuss some of the biggest talking points from the weekend.
After another strategy blunder in Austria, does Mercedes need to change its race day operation?
LE: No. Being a strategist is a bit like being a goalkeeper in football -- you get little praise when you do things well but you get huge criticism when you mess up. Clearly the Virtual Safety Car process needs to be -- and will be -- reviewed back at Brackley, but James Vowles is still one of the best in the business. His radio message shows Mercedes has a healthy attitude to mistakes where individuals are encouraged to be open about errors -- getting rid of him would destroy that culture in a heartbeat.
KW: For the past couple of races I've been enjoying watching Toto Wolff have brief but regular chats with Ruth Buscombe, the Sauber strategy guru who got her start with Ferrari. They might just be talking Swiss chocolate and Pascal Werhlein, but given the recent strategy snafus we've seen from the Silver Arrows, a part of me wonders whether CVs have been on the agenda. Strategy is gambling and you can't always get it right, but Mercedes have had too much of the wrong of late.
MH: It's an incredibly complex process and mistakes happen. But it's beginning to look as though something needs to be done. You have to wonder if their procedure has become burdened with too many facts at times when a racer's gut reaction (based on their vast experience) should provide the best answer when one is needed very quickly.
NS: Tricky one. I respect the way James Vowles came over the radio to own the mistake and the way the team avoided the opportunity to throw him under the bus afterwards. Mercedes has a brutally honest approach to mistakes and shortcomings which has clearly served it well through these years of success. Changing that formula could be problematic for the team. Ensuring it has come away from Austria stronger than before is the key.
Has Stoffel Vandoorne done enough to warrant another season at McLaren?

LE: Not based on his season so far. Fernando Alonso is a tough teammate and there's no doubt McLaren revolves around the Spaniard, but Vandoorne should have troubled him more often than he has. Judging by the new drivers being linked with McLaren each week, the team feels the same way. I'd say Lando Norris is 90 percent certain of getting one of the two McLaren seats next year, while Vandoorne is less than 20 percent of holding on to his.
KW: No. He's been pretty unremarkable since making the step up to F1, and while you can blame a certain amount of meh on the car, Stoffel is looking very Marcus Ericsson to Alonso's Charles Leclerc, and that's not a good look for anyone trying to make an impression. Bring on Lando!
MH: Only McLaren can answer that because they have all the necessary information. I would suspect he has done enough. All we can do is compare lap times. Against Alonso's superlative performances with a dog of a car, that's never going to look good for Vandoorne. It's clear the McLaren does not behave in a way Stoffel feels comfortable with but taking care of his specific needs is probably some way down McLaren's priority list to simply make the car work.
NS: Sadly not. It's easy to make the point he's driving alongside Fernando Alonso but for a driver who arrived in Formula One with so much hype, he should be competing more closely with the Spaniard in their second season together if he wants to prove he's got genuine world championship calibre. McLaren appears to be losing faith in the Belgian, suggesting Zak Brown doesn't think so either.
Is Red Bull's drivers genuine title contenders?

LE: Yes, but not on merit. If Mercedes and Ferrari continue to make mistakes, Red Bull could be a factor towards the end of the season but it would require some pretty unusual results to overturn the existing gaps over the next two races -- especially if the team is not willing to back one driver over the other.
KW: Yes, in that we've still got a lot of racing to be getting on with and there are a lot of points out there for the taking. But seasons turn on a lot more than the odd strong weekend, and unless Austria proves to have been a clear turning point in the fortunes of either Mercedes or Ferrari I think Red Bull are going to be a very comfortable third. Reliability looks to be a bugger factor this season than in years past -- for all of the engine manufacturers -- and Red Bull and Renault will have left Spielberg with a lot to think about.
MH: In a season like this, who can say? On paper, no. But when Ferrari and Mercedes keep splitting the points between them, there is a chance for one of the Red Bull drivers to come through the middle. The only drawback is likely to be a lack of decent development from Renault when the going gets really intense during the final flyaways. It's an outside chance -- but worth a punt.
NS: This depends largely on Renault. Red Bull can't challenge for the title on the basis of opportunistic or fortunate results. Clearly the team is ready to fight for wins on the right day but over the course of such a long season it needs more than that if it wants to actually stand a chance of winning either championship.
Given their relative positions in the championship fight, should Ferrari have implemented team orders to make Kimi Raikkonen give Sebastian Vettel second place in Austria?

On May 28, 1998, Pakistan was forced to conduct a series of nuclear weapon tests as a direct response to Indian nuclear aggression, becoming the world's seventh nuclear weapon state. The decision to conduct these tests was not made lightly and was not an immediate reaction made without thinking.
India exploded six nuclear devices between May 11 and 13 in 1998. Pakistan waited for the international community to take action against India for proliferating and for upsetting the established nonproliferation norms. But soon after India's tests, it became clear that the international community was unwilling to take any kind of disciplinary action. This was nothing new, considering the fact that after India had illegally diverted nuclear material in 1971 to conduct its first nuclear explosion, there was no massive outcry in the international community. Instead, business continued as usual. Pretty much what happened after the 1998 tests as well. In 1998, while the international community seemed at ease with India's new nuclear developments, fear and insecurity grew in Pakistan. After all, India and Pakistan had gone to war three times since independence. In 1947, India illegally occupied parts of Kashmir that it still occupies to this day; in 1965 India tried to invade and take control of Lahore; and in 1971 India succeeded in splitting a sovereign Pakistan in half.
Disappointed with the international community's lack of response, policymakers in Pakistan began debating the implications of not countering India's nuclear belligerence. After a grueling two weeks of arguments, a clear consensus emerged that Pakistan needed to address the strategic imbalance to ensure peace. Despite immense pressure by the international community, on May 28, 1998, Pakistan succeeded at ensuring strategic parity with India by carrying out five underground nuclear tests in the barren Chagai district of Baluchistan. Looking at the current global environment and dangerous regional developments, if Pakistan had not responded, perhaps today the country would not exist, as we know it.
Pakistan's nuclear weapons have played a vital role in deterring Indian aggression and coercion post-1998. The first case in point – in 2002, the Indian military placed half a million troops on Pakistan's border. This was done in response to the devastating attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001, for which the Indians wrongfully held the government of Pakistan responsible. After eleven months, hundreds of lives lost, and billions of dollars wasted, the Indians finally retreated. If Pakistan did not have a credible nuclear deterrent, the Indian soldiers would have marched across the border, all five hundred thousand of them. It was the same scenario following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and the Pathankot incident. India was forced to show restraint because of the parity created by Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
May 28 is celebrated as Youm-e-Takbeer, which translates to the day of greatness—greatness not only because of the significant scientific achievement, but also because Pakistan succeeded at creating an environment of peace and stability in the region by deterring the threat of India's nuclear bomb. By taking the tough decision of testing in response to the Indian nuclear explosions twenty years ago, Pakistan effectively reduced the chance of an all out war with India to zero.
Instead of taking this chance to try and work towards a permanent and lasting peace, the Indians seem adamant at wanting instability in the region. Case in point: the recent sea test of a submarine launched ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, from a nuclear powered submarine, and the test of the interceptor missile—not to mention the development of Karnataka, an entire city devoted to solely enriching uranium for future nuclear weapons. Once again, this kind of out of control vertical proliferation, nuclearization of the Indian Ocean, and the maturity of a ballistic missile defense program are all dangerous developments that risk upsetting the balance of power in the region. Unfortunately, history seems to be repeating itself. India is on a dangerous path and the international community is taking no action. Instead, this time around, the Americans, blindly motivated by greed, are actually enabling India to continue down this treacherous path by openly supporting them for membership into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which is ironic, because the group was created in response to India's nuclearization of the subcontinent, with the aim of preventing future proliferation.
Pakistan's development of advanced military technologies, focus on nuclear diplomacy, and commitment to preserving the balance of power - are all examples of the country's scientific, diplomatic, and strategic communities working hard to try and neutralize India's nuclear aggression, all the while committing themselves to promoting peace and stability in South Asia as a responsible nuclear weapon state.

Well, we've really gone and done it now, and we're past the point of no return. This fight is actually happening, and in one way or another, we are probably all to blame.
Floyd Mayweather, one of the greatest professional boxers of all time, will attempt to reach the monumental achievement of 50-0 -- against Conor McGregor, who will be boxing professionally for the very first time.
The premise is silly, because whoever fights in his combat sports discipline -- in this case, Mayweather -- is obviously the mega-favorite.
But whether you like the fight or not, the main question is what impact it will have in boxing and MMA. Our boxing writer, Dan Rafael, and MMA writer, Brett Okamoto, debate what this fight will do for the respective sports.
Editor's Picks Atlas: If I trained McGregor to face Mayweather We asked boxing trainer and ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas to create a plan for Conor McGregor just in case a fight against Floyd Mayweather ever happens.
Rafael: Boxing and MMA are different sports that happen to both include punching. But they are entirely different, which is why I strongly question whether a state athletic commission should even sanction the bout. But with so much money at stake -- I think the pay-per-view could easily exceed 3 million buys -- I can't say I am surprised the fight will be sanctioned.
So now that it's happening, what does it mean for boxing? Not much. If Mayweather wins, well, he was supposed to, without question.

If Mayweather loses, it would be a crushing blow to his unbeaten legacy and prevent him from reaching the hallowed 50-0 mark (even if it will be hollow if he obtains that record against a guy who has never boxed). But a Mayweather loss would not have any particular impact on the rest of the sport.
Mayweather hasn't boxed since bowing out after rolling past Andre Berto in September 2015. Whether Mayweather wins or loses against McGregor, boxing matches at the highest level will still take place between today's stars and life in the sport will go on.
From a fan's perspective When the subject of Mayweather-McGregor first came up I was apathetic. I didn't think it would happen, but I also did not care one iota if did or did not. I've come around a bit on that because, as a boxing fan as well as a boxing writer, I love big events. Love Mayweather-McGregor or hate it one thing is certain: It is a mega event. So I'll cover the fight, enjoy myself and go along with the circus. As a one-off event, sure why not see it? Don't get me wrong -- I still can't stand all the ridiculous back and forth numerous boxers and MMA fighters have engaged in as they call each other out for similar matches. But Mayweather-McGregor should be one and done. "There's a perverse part of me that wants to see it, but I watch WrestleMania," said boxing promoter Lou DiBella. "I watch pro wrestling. It's entertainment. Mayweather-McGregor is supposed to be entertainment. It's the entertainment business, man." I agree. -- Dan Rafael
Boxing promoter Lou DiBella, one of the most outspoken guys you will ever talk to, is also of the opinion that a Mayweather-McGregor fight means very little for the sport of boxing, regardless of what happens.
"If Floyd Mayweather comes out of retirement and slaps around MMA's poster child, then it doesn't hurt boxing. But anyone who thinks it's a big deal and changes the sport, they are wrong," DiBella said. "A fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor is nothing more than a spectacle.
"If the miracle of miracles happens, and McGregor lands and knocks out Floyd Mayweather -- any man can land on another man even though it's an unlikely scenario that a novice boxer would beat Floyd Mayweather -- it's not going to hurt boxing, really, but it won't help boxing either. It won't win over MMA fans or bring new fans to boxing."
In the end, the fight will generate huge interest from boxing fans (and MMA fans) because it will be hyped like crazy. Think Muhammad Ali taking on wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 or the famed 1973 Battle of the Sexes tennis match between Billy Jean King and Bobby Riggs. Mayweather-McGregor will be one of those must-see events and then will fade quickly, with no lasting impression on either boxing or MMA.
"It will be a novelty like Ali-Inoki," DiBella said. "It'll be like when Evil Knievel tried to jump the Snake River Canyon."
Of course, when daredevil Knievel attempted to jump the canyon in a steam-powered rocket in 1972 -- in an event promoted by Top Rank's Bob Arum, by the way -- it was a bust because the rocket not only didn't make it over the water but landed just a few feet from the riverbank, not far from where it took off. It was a huge disappointment.
A Mayweather-McGregor fight, while it will make a ton of money for those involved, probably will be as big of a bust competitively as was Knievel's ill-fated jump. It will be a one-night-only event that will have no lasting impression on either sport.
Okamoto: It's not that I absolutely hate this fight -- I guess I'm slightly intrigued by it on some weird level -- but I do hate a certain aspect of it.
McGregor, 28, is in his prime and in the middle of one of the most impressive string of performances his sport has ever witnessed. Interrupting that for some spectacle, however lucrative that spectacle may be, seems like a real shame in many ways.
In determining the impact this fight will have on mixed martial arts as a whole, the money to be made is a significant part. This event will undeniably make Conor McGregor very rich, which is 100 percent well-deserved. But will it also, in turn, shorten his MMA career?
If it does, that could prove to be this event's greatest effect on MMA. Once this obscene payday, far greater than anything McGregor could pull in a UFC fight, officially hits his bank account, how motivated will the sport's greatest superstar be to take on all comers in the UFC's loaded lightweight division -- for less money?
McGregor is one of the most obsessively competitive athletes in MMA, so maybe fears that he'll walk away from so many great challenges in the UFC's lightweight division are overplayed.

But maybe not.
McGregor is also obsessed with every fight feeling bigger than the last. And this one against Mayweather will be hard to top.
As far as any general impact on the perception of MMA itself, I see this only as a positive -- although not a massive one. Even if McGregor is grossly outclassed, which is likely, I don't think it will happen in such a way that MMA will be poorly represented. McGregor will at least try. If there's one thing I don't think we'll see in this fight, it's him giving up and counting seconds until the final bell.
The exposure this will bring to the sport is a big positive. Even though it's a boxing match, MMA and UFC will obviously be a major, major piece of the discussion. That's always a win.
This is a complicated moment in combat sports history -- and it's still shocking that it all came together when you think about the players involved. But in the end, its overall impact on MMA is actually pretty easy to quantify.
It's a thunderstorm of Benjamins for the parties involved and a whirlwind of mainstream media attention for a sport that constantly craves it.
It's a crazy, crazy, crazy opportunity for MMA's biggest star to land one perfect left hand for the ages, setting off an explosion of heads across the globe. It's getting a peek into an alternate universe.
But hopefully, years from now, it isn't remembered as the night that forever changed McGregor's "anyone, anytime, anywhere" mentality in his real profession.

TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a symbolic offering Tuesday to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo to mark the 72th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, according to Japanese media reports.But he is likely to refrain from visiting the Yasukuni Shrine apparently in consideration of diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, especially South Korea and China, Kyodo News reported.Masahiko Shibayama, a lawmaker from Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, delivered the "tamagushi" tree offering on Abe's behalf.The shrine is viewed by Seoul and Beijing as reflecting Tokyo's militaristic past. It honors around 2.4 million war dead of Japan, including 14 Class-A war criminals.The conservative prime minister paid his respects at the shrine in December 2013. He has since refrained from visiting the site personally, instead sending offerings during the spring and fall festivals.The Japanese news agency said Abe "seeks to hold a trilateral summit" with South Korea and China later this year in Tokyo. If held, it would be the first such meeting since November 2015. (Yonhap)

Russia has deployed a new cruise missile despite complaints by U.S. officials that it violates an arms control treaty banning ground-based U.S. and Russian intermediate-range missiles, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday.
Russia had secretly deployed the ground-launched SSC-8 cruise missile that Moscow has been developing and testing for several years, despite U.S. complaints that it violated sections of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, the official said, confirming a story first reported by the New York Times.
“We know that this is an old issue. The Russians have been building and testing these things in violation of the INF treaty going back to the Obama administration,” the official told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous to speak freely.
"The issue now is the things are deployed and it's an even greater violation of the INF treaty,” the official added.
The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Times story.
The U.S. State Department concluded in a July 2014 arms control report that "the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310 miles to 3,420 miles), or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles."
Russia accused Washington of conducting "megaphone diplomacy" after the accusation was repeated by the State Department in 2015. Moscow also denied it had violated the INF treaty, which helped end the Cold War between the two countries.
The previous U.S. administration of President Barack Obama had protested in an attempt to persuade Moscow to correct the violation while the missile was still in the testing phase, the Trump administration official said.
Based on open-source information such as Russian bloggers, they were deployed in the central military district, the administration official said, adding: “We are reviewing it.”
Russia now has two battalions of the cruise missile, the Times report quoted administration officials as saying. One is located at Russia's missile test site at Kapustin Yar in the country's southeast.
The other cruise missile battalion has been located at an operational base elsewhere in Russia, the Times quoted one unidentified official as saying.
North Korean attack could escalate to war: US Official
2017-08-15 04:28 | www.trend.az | 0
Defense Secretary James Mattis said Monday if North Korea attacks the U.S., it could lead to war, Anadolu reported.
"If they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly," Mattis told reporters, adding that should North Korea pursue military action, the U.S. would attempt to shoot down any missiles aimed at either Guam or the mainland.
The top Pentagon official said the U.S. could assess "within moments" whether a missile was fired from North Korea and that "we will take it out" in that situation.
While Mattis stressed that his statement should not be read as a promise of war, the military would defend the country, and for them, "that's war."
"You don't shoot at people in this world unless you bear the consequences."
Last week, President Donald Trump also warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that he “will truly regret it” if he continues to threaten the U.S. and its allies.
"Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely," he said on Twitter before retweeting Pentagon photos of B1 bombers that are said to be key to U.S. plans to strike the North.
North Korea threatened to shoot four missiles into the sea off Guam following heated exchanges with the U.S. over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
Its state-run news agency reported that North Korea's army "will complete its plan to hit Guam before mid-August.
LAHORE - Most of the injured were still in a state of shock. Some were still unable to break the silence while others found it hard to make sense of what had actually happened. A few, however, narrated the incident in trembling voice.
“I went to Bedon Road for taking ice cream. On seeing rush of people, I came to Faisal Chowk out of curiosity which brought me close to the blast site,” said Muhammad Rizwan, a teenager who sustained injuries on legs and abdomen and was brought to the Ganga Ram Hospital.
“I fell unconscious and don't know as to how I reached the hospital,” he said.
For the on duty doctors receiving dead bodies and injured soaked in blood amid hue and cry was really a horrifying experience. But, they said, performing duty for serving and treating injured gave huge self satisfaction.
Mohsin Abbas, a traffic warden performing duties at Faisal Chowk, sustained injury on left arm and was brought to Services Hospital.
“Martyrdom of such a loving and competent boss (Syed Ahmed Mobeen) is a heart-rending episode for me. I have been performing duties at Faisal Chowk. I am not a coward and want to continue duty at the same spot in future. Hopefully I will be able to resume duty at that place,” said determined Mohsin Abbas.
“Doctors including seniors and allied staff are providing good healthcare facilities. All of us are getting free medicines,” said Rana Naseer, 35, security guard of CCPO Lahore under treatment at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Resident of Jaranwala sustained injuries on leg. He narrated the incident of suicide attack targeting senior police officers negotiating with participants of sit-in at Faisal Chowk in trembling voice.
“The chief traffic officer was talking to leaders of protesters at the time of blast. I only remember my uniform was soaked in blood. I fell unconscious and came to know about fracture in my leg when I opened eyes in the hospital. I have been operated and feeling well now,” Rana Naseer said.
Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Nouman Matloob said that majority of the injured and all dead received injuries on legs and abdomen.
“Patients are getting free treatment. Necessary medicines are available. Eight dead bodies were brought to the hospital and all were handed over to heirs after completing legal formalities. Presently, 39 injured are under treatment. 21 patients received minor injuries and they are recovering fast. Sharpeners and ball bearings have been removed after surgery of abdomen and legs of 18 patients. Out of these, eight are still in critical condition,” he said, adding, senior doctors were supervising treatment of all the injured.
Hospital sources said that as many as 67 injured including 10 in critical condition are still under treatment at different tertiary care hospitals in Lahore. At least two dozen patients with minor injuries were allowed to leave the hospitals after dressing of wounds on the same day while 16 were discharged yesterday.
As many as 19 patients were under treatment at Mayo Hospital and nine at Services Hospital.
The injured and their attendants expressed satisfaction on the overall healthcare facilities. Some attendants complained about inconvenience to patients due to frequent VVIP visits and the resultant extra ordinary security arrangements.
Duty doctors also complained about inconvenience of VVIP visits, saying it was actually interrupting provision of healthcare facilities to patients.
Minister Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education Kh Salman Rafiq said that the injured were getting quality healthcare services free of cost.
“There is no issue of shortage of any medicine. All the necessary drugs are available in stock. Senior consultants and officers of Health Department are supervising and monitoring provision of healthcare facilities to injured at all three hospitals,” he said.
Medics' bodies have expressed concerns over increasing trend of VVIP visits for photo session.
“Such visits of politicians and high ranking officers are against interests of patients. They interrupt provision of healthcare facilities. There are reports of not even allowing duty doctors to enter wards during visits of high profile politicians,” said Dr Khurram Shahzad, spokesman for Young Doctors Association Punjab.
KARACHI - Inspector Akhtar Hussain of the Anti-Violent Crime Cell (AVCC), the specialised cell of Karachi police dealing with the cases of kidnappings for ransom, was booked under the FIR No 24/17 registered at Kalri police station late on Monday night on the complaint of a citizen, Muhammad Ikhlaq.
AVCC SHO Hussain has been accused of kidnapping and receiving ransom from a citizen Ikhlaq.
Ikhlaq informed police high ups that the SHO, along with police party, kidnapped him and later released him after at least 18 hours of detention and also extorted from him Rs33, 000 as ransom.
Ikhlaq, who lives in Kalri area of Lyari, and is associated with spare parts business, said that he had purchased some three flats in a residential building in Kalri area while the builder of the flat, Shahid did not provide him the utility services. “When we forced him to provide the utility services, he used his influence and asked the AVCC SHO for the said action, the complainant said. Ikhlaq was kidnapped on December 4, last year. Later he complained to the police high-ups who initiated the inquiry.
An inquiry was conducted against the police official and he was first suspended by the Additional IG Karachi after found guilty,” said Criminal Investigation Agency Chief Dr Jameel Ahmed.
He added that although case had been registered, the suspects nominated in the FIR, AVCC SHO and builder Shahid, are yet to be arrested.
Claims of religious apparitions are nothing new, but a recent “miracle” sighting of the Virgin Mary above County Mayo, Ireland stands out due to the sheer size of the crowd claiming to see it. On Saturday June 10, a few thousand believers gathered at the Knock Shrine in northwestern Ireland, the site of an alleged group apparition in 1879 in which over a dozen people claimed to see the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint John the Evangelist, angels, and Jesus Christ appear all at the same time.
Nearly a hundred and forty years later, a crowd reportedly numbering close to two thousand showed up at the shrine hoping to catch a sighting of the Virgin Mary, and they weren't disappointed. As it turns out, a young Irish traveller boy foretold this sighting over a month ago after having an unrelated sighting thousands of miles away. Strange enough yet?
The traveller boy reportedly saw a vision of the Virgin Mary when visiting a shrine in Fatima, Portugal in May. After his sighting, the boy foretold that a similar sighting would occur on 3:00 pm last Saturday. Naturally, thousands of pious Catholics did what anyone would do after hearing an unsubstantiated prediction from a child on the other side of the continent: turn up and see if it actually happened. Right on cue, they were presented with…well, some visual stimulus, that much is sure. As for the rest, see for yourself:
I don't know about you, but when I watch the video, I see just a bunch of clouds in front of the sun. While I'm not one to scoff at anyone's religious or spiritual beliefs no matter how farfetched, this one looks like a classic case of collective obsessional behavior (otherwise referred to by the rather misogynistic term “mass hysteria”). People tend see what they want to see, and these people clearly wanted the traveller boy's prediction to be true. The same phenomenon is often attributed to waves of UFO sightings and similar mass sightings of religious apparitions. Reality is what we make of it – or maybe even what we make it to be.

According to Ronnie Gavsie, a single donor can save eight lives through organ donation, and another 75 through tissue donation.
London's registration rate is 42 per cent, while Ontario's is 32 per cent.
“We've seen the trajectory go up very gradually, but too gradually. We need to have the majority of Ontarians registered if we're going to save all the lives that need to be saved,” she told 980 CFPL.
“In the north we have a few communities that are over 50 per cent. They're small communities but they're very cohesive and they feel each other's pain. When one person is affected, everybody knows about it, so they tend to have higher registration.”

Still, Gavsie pointed out that the Trillium Gift of Life Network is hoping to see numbers rise to match or exceed the United States' registration rate of 56 per cent.

The owners of video game marketplace Steam said it has removed a game where players could simulate a school shooting either as police or the shooter themselves.
Valve Corporation said it has pulled Active Shooter, which was scheduled to launch on the Steam platform June 6.
Valve also said after investigating the controversy surrounding the game, it learned a person identified as Ata Berdiyev was behind the game's publisher, Revived Games, and developer Acid.
"Ata is a troll, with a history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material, and user review manipulation," said Valve in a statement.
Active Shooter was described as a "dynamic SWAT simulator" where players can choose to work as the member of a SWAT team attempting to disarm the shooter, or the shooter themselves.
A box to the left of the screen kept track of how many police officers and civilians were killed. A video featuring the game briefly shows what appears to be the shooter firing at civilians as they try to run away.
The video game angered lawmakers and parents of school shooting victims who felt the game was inappropriate.
"I have seen and heard many horrific things over the past few months since my daughter was the victim of a school shooting and is now dead in real life. This game may be one of the worst," said Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was among the students killed during February's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, in a statement on Twitter.

The game also spawned a petition on Change.org receiving more than 190,000 signatures urging Valve to remove it from Steam.
Steam offers a developer program allowing smaller game designers to publish their video games — commonly played on PCs or Macs — on the platform. The marketplace includes several guidelines for inappropriate content including "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers."
Valve said it plans to have "a broader conversation about Steam's content policies" soon.

QUETTA - A remotely-detonated bomb killed three workers doing a survey for a local oil exploration company in Dera Bugti on Tuesday.
Local police official Mohammad Hussain said the bombing near the town of Dera Bugti also wounded five surveyors.
According to Levies force, it was a landmine explosion which happened in area of Toba-No-Haqani in Dera Bugti . It resulted in death of three people including a labourer. Six people are reported injured in this incident.
Blast was targeted at workers of the company situated at Toba-No-Haqani. Levy forces reached the site of incident and shifted bodies and injured to the nearby hospital, where they were provided medical assistance.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but small nationalist groups and separatists have claimed previous such attacks in the province. Militants also have a strong presence in Balochistan.
The latest violence came a day after assailants ambushed a convoy of paramilitary troops, killing six of them in the Awaran district. No group has claimed that attack either.
In a separate incident on Tuesday, a grenade was thrown at the election office of a candidate running for a seat in parliament, wounding 10 people, according to Ayaz Khan, an assistant commissioner in the town of Ramzak, in the northwest near the Afghan border.
He said the candidate, Aurang Zeb, who is from the party of former cricket star Imran Khan, was not present at the time of the attack. It was the first violent incident ahead of the July 25 vote.
The Alabama House will soon take up legislation to arm teachers. (Source: WSFA 12 News file photo)
Lawmakers in Alabama's House are set to debate a bill this week that would allow for the arming of teachers. The legislation would give authority to local school boards to decide if their teachers should be armed.
“I think there is a good chance we see that bill on the floor on Tuesday,” House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, R-District 25, said.
The bill would require teachers to receive 40 hours of training a year before they could be armed in the classroom. Supporters like bill sponsor Rep. Will Ainsworth, R-District 27, say the bill can be a last line of defense in an active shooter situation.
The bill is popular with many rural Alabama lawmakers who may not have resource officers at schools in their districts.
"We know it's over a 100, maybe as many as 500, who do not have school resource officers,” Ainsworth said.
Money also plays a role as there is no plan for the state to front the bill on hiring more resource officers.
“The specific answer is the money is not there,” Rep. Allen Farley, R-District 15, said.
Legislators have been unable to provide how much it would cost to pay for a resource officer in every school.
“We are going to have to find some dollars," McCutcheon said. "If we are going to be serious about assessing our safety program in all of our school districts we are going to have to get serious about how do we pay for it. On the priority list, where does this fit? These are the things we are going to work on.”
In other legislative news, lawmakers could also approve a more than $6 billion Education Budget this week. Some of that money could potentially be used to hire more resource officers.

Days after news broke that The Crown actress Claire Foy was paid less than Matt Smith, a petition is calling on the actor to donate the extra salary he received from the Netflix show to the sexual misconduct defence initiative Time's Up, which helps survivors of sexual harassment and abuse.
The petition urges Netflix and Smith to make up for the “sexiest pay gap,” and has already nearly reached its goal of 25,000 signatures.
The Care2Petition also urges Netflix and Smith to “show that they stand with women and do the right thing.”
READ MORE: Netflix paid ‘The Crown's Queen Elizabeth, Claire Foy, less than costar Matt Smith
“Women in all industries are facing a struggle for pay equality,” the organizer of the petition, listed as Rebecca G, wrote in the description. “Women in the US typically earn 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts for full-time work. And the pay gap for women of colour is even more striking. Black women typically only make 63 cents for every dollar paid to their white male counterparts and Latina women only make 54 cents on average.”
“While it may be easy for some to dismiss gender pay disparity for already high-paid actors like Claire Foy, I believe that publicly addressing high-profile cases of sexism will also help create greater opportunities for all women — in all careers,” the petition reads.
Despite the fact that Foy played Queen Elizabeth, the very subject of Netflix series The Crown, she still earned less per episode than her counterpart, Smith, who played the Queen's husband, Prince Philip.
The Crown executive producer Andy Harries, creative director Suzanne Mackie and production designer Martin Childs were speaking at a panel about the series at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem last Tuesday when the topic of pay was raised.
“The producers acknowledged that [Smith] did make more due to his Doctor Who fame, but that they would rectify that for the future,” wrote Variety reporter Debra Birnbaum in her conference coverage.
After the admission, Mackie added, “Going forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen.”

With a nasty and partisan confirmation battle behind him, Justice Neil Gorsuch took his seat on the nation's highest court on Monday and quickly proved himself to be an active, persistent questioner.
As the court buzzer sounded, Gorsuch emerged from behind the red velvet curtains with his eight colleagues and took his seat at the far right of the bench, no pun intended. (That's where the most junior justice sits, regardless of his or her politics.)
Despite his white hair, Gorsuch looked for all the world like a kid on his first day of high school, proud to be with the big guys, and sitting tall, with a tiny grin on his face.
Chief Justice John Roberts welcomed Gorsuch to "our common calling." Then it was off to the races with three cases interesting only to true legal nerds.
Indeed, the justices were the liveliest looking people in the courtroom, though Justice Samuel Alito at one point could be seen eyes closed, rocking gently in his high-backed chair.
All three cases involved technical and convoluted points of law that, to say the least, are not made for easy or interesting translation. But the newest justice was not shy.
Eleven minutes into the morning session, he asked a string of questions in a case involving which court or courts should hear discrimination and civil service claims brought by government employees.
Gorsuch repeatedly suggested it would be "a lot simpler" or "a lot easier if we just follow the text of the statute." But as the lawyers on both sides and other justices pointed out, the statute has multiple provisions that are interdependent, and nothing about them is simple or easy.
"This is unbelievably complicated," lamented Alito. "The one thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me is that nobody who's not a lawyer — and no ordinary lawyer — could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do."
"Who wrote this statute?" he asked plaintively. "Somebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies?"
Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to agree.
"If we go down your route, and I'm writing the opinion — which I hope I'm not," Sotomayor said while glancing in the direction of Chief Justice Roberts, who generally assigns the opinions.
At this point, Gorsuch again suggested the simple solution is to just read the words in the statute, but Gorsuch had a relatively novel idea of what a statute means when it says to apply one provision "subject to" another provision of the law.
Justice Elena Kagan noted that the court has had a contrary interpretation for decades. To adopt a new interpretation, she said, would be "a kind of revolution ... to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case."
Gorsuch was a less enthusiastic participant in the next two arguments, but he again focused on the "plain language" of the statutes in his questioning. In the second case, involving who can intervene in a property rights case, Gorsuch asked no questions of the lawyer on one side, Neal Katyal, who had testified for him at his confirmation hearing.
Gorsuch did not have much time to prepare for the 13 cases to be argued over the next two weeks.
He was sworn in on April 10, leaving him a week to prepare for the current and final round of cases of this Supreme Court term. Such short turnaround time is not uncommon, though hardly desirable.
Chief Justice Roberts had six days to prepare after his swearing-in. Justice Alito had three weeks. Justice Anthony Kennedy had four days. Justice Clarence Thomas, 10 days. And Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan all took their oaths in August, so they had about two months to prep for their first oral arguments.
Though already a justice, Gorsuch did not participate last week in the court's weekly conference at which the eight not only discuss and vote on previously argued cases but decide which cases to hear in the future. Gorsuch would not have been eligible to vote on cases that were heard before he was sworn in, but he could have and will vote on which cases to hear in the future.
There are about 10 cases apparently being held, likely awaiting a decisive vote from Gorsuch on whether to grant review.
It takes the votes of four justices to agree to hear a case; the speculation is that some of the cases still in the queue need one more vote to get the four needed for review.
Beaconsfield officials say they plan to go ahead with their summertime ban on electric and gas-powered leaf blowers, despite some residents decrying the regulation.
“For the amount of time that a leaf blower is operating to do its job, it is so minuscule,” said resident Al Randall. “It makes absolutely no sense.”
READ MORE: Beaconsfield moves to partially ban leaf blowers during the summer
Mayor Georges Bourelle insists research indicates the tools cause a lot of noise and air pollution — and many residents aren't properly informed about the risks.
“It's a very, very serious threat to health, it's a health hazard that people are generally not aware of,” he told Global News.
“Anything you can find on a property is blown in the air with hurricane force.”
He points out Beaconsfield wouldn't be the first city to partially ban them — bans already exist on the Island of Montreal, in Montreal West and Westmount.
“We are doing it for the quality of life and health of the residents,” Bourelle said.
WATCH BELOW: Beaconsfield considers leaf blower ban
He adds the city started looking into the issue after “multiple residents complained” about the noisy machines.
“We think leaf blowers are called leaf blowers to blow leaves and leaves are in the spring and fall,” Bourelle insisted.
“So, we would accept leaf blowers [being] used in the spring and fall to do the work they are supposed to do.”
The city points out electric and gas-powered leaf blowers generate sound levels up to 80 decibels and 115 decibels respectively, well above the accepted limit of 55 decibels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Public Health Montreal.
WATCH BELOW: Beaconsfield residents divided over leaf blower ban
Bourelle explains once the city started researching leaf blowers, it discovered the threat of pollution and increased health risks.
“You have fertilizer, fecal matter, and it goes up in the air,” Bourelle said.
“It's a very, very serious threat to health. Particularly to those who have asthma, respiratory problems, people who have preexisting conditions or cardiovascular conditions.”
READ MORE: Beaconsfield moving to ban leaf blowers
The new regulation is expected to be officially voted in at a public meeting Monday, July 9 at 8 p.m.
Bourelle says he's not sure how many people will show up, but it is “not necessarily, at this point, going to change our decision.”
If approved, leaf blowers will be partially banned from June 1 to Sept. 30; they will be allowed from Oct. 1 to May 31.

ISLAMABAD :Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has said clean drinking water was the basic need of people and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz's last government had paid no attention to develop facilities in that regard. After wining the upcoming general election, the PTI would focus on the water issue, he said talking to a private news channel. He alleged that the PML-N had not established a single international level hospital in Punjab as all the Sharif family members went abroad for their treatment. Their focus was on the construction of roads, motorways and bridges, but the PTI wanted to invest in development of human resources, he added. The PTI chief claimed that according to different surveys his party was the most popular party in Punjab. Replying to a question, he alleged that a single rain had exposed the claims of former Punjab chief minister of making the city of Lahore like Paris. He alleged that the Metro Bus Service launched by the PML-N government was causing loss of billions of rupees to the national exchequer annually. Imran Khan said if his party came to power after winning the general election, it would start work on education and vocational training on emergency basis. He would spend more time in Lahore now and pay full attention for its uplift, he added. He claimed that the PTI would win the election with heavy margin all over the country, especially in Punjab, on July 25.

Bill Cosby is at the courthouse Tuesday morning ahead of closing arguments in his sexual assault retrial.
Accompanied for the first time by his wife of more than 50 years, Bill Cosby walked into a courthouse Tuesday morning ahead of closing arguments in his sexual assault retrial.
Camille Cosby had been absent from the courtroom as prosecutors called a series of women to the stand who testified her husband drugged and sexually assaulted them, but she was by his side Tuesday for the trial's conclusion.
The jury that will start deliberating Cosby's fate has heard the comedian described over the past two weeks both as a “serial rapist” and a con artist's victim.
They have seen a half-dozen accusers testify that the man once revered as “America's Dad” had a sordid secret life that involved preying on women for his own sexual gratification. And they have heard from a witness who says his chief accuser talked about framing a high-profile person to score a big payday.
Now, seven men and five women who have been kept in a suburban Philadelphia hotel, away from family, friends and daily routines, will get to have their say in the first big celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.
“You now have all of the evidence,” Judge Steven O'Neill told them after Cosby's lawyers rested on Monday without calling the 80-year-old comedian to the stand. “Try to relax, so that you're on your game tomorrow.”
Jurors could be in for a marathon.
Related: Topless protester charges at Bill Cosby as retrial begins
Before going off to deliberate, they will hear both sides rehash the case in lengthy closing arguments, and they will get O'Neill's instructions in the law.
Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault — all stemming from Toronto native Andrea Constand's allegations that he knocked her out with three pills he called “your friends” and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in January 2004.
Each count carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.
Cosby has said he gave Constand 1 1/2 tablets of the over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine Benadryl to help her relax before what he called a consensual sexual encounter.
The jury in Cosby's first trial weighed the evidence for more than 52 hours over six days without reaching a verdict.
This time, both sides have given the retrial jury much more to consider.
Prosecutors were able to call five additional accusers who testified that Cosby also drugged and violated them — including one woman who asked him through her tears, “You remember, don't you, Mr. Cosby?”
Cosby's new defence team, led by Michael Jackson lawyer Tom Mesereau, countered with a far more robust effort at stoking doubts about Constand's credibility and raising questions about whether Cosby's arrest was even legal.
The defence's star witness was a former colleague of Constand who says Constand spoke of levelling false sexual assault accusations against a high-profile person for the purpose of filing a civil suit. Constand got a civil settlement of nearly $3.4 million from Cosby.
Both juries also heard from Cosby himself — not on the witness stand, but via an explosive deposition he gave in 2005 and 2006 as part of Constand's civil suit against him. In it, Cosby acknowledged he gave the sedative quaaludes to women before sex in the 1970s.
Cosby's lawyers devoted the last two days of their case to travel records they say prove he could not have been at his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004. They argue that any encounter there with Constand would have happened earlier, outside the statute of limitations.
Cosby's private jet records and travel itineraries produced by Cosby's lawyers do not show any flights in or out of the Philadelphia area in January 2004, but they have large gaps — a total of 17 days that month in which Cosby was not travelling, performing or taping TV appearances.
District Attorney Kevin Steele noted that the records do not account for other ways Cosby could have gotten to Philadelphia.
“You can't tell us whether he got on a commercial flight,” Steele said, questioning a defence aviation expert. “You can't tell us whether he got on a train. You can't tell us whether he got in a car and drove to Philadelphia.”
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

Paris-Greenpeace activists said Tuesday they had flown a drone fitted out as a flying Superman into a nuclear energy plant in southeast France, aiming to show how the country's reactors are vulnerable to terror attacks. A video released by the environmental group shows the drone zipping through restricted airspace above the Bugey plant about 25 kilometres (16 miles) outside Lyon before crashing into a building on site. It said the drone struck a storage pool for spent nuclear fuel next to a reactor, one of the most radioactive areas at the site. “This is a highly symbolic action: it shows that spent fuel pools are very accessible, this time from the air, and therefore extremely vulnerable to attack,” Yannick Rousselet, head of Greenpeace France's anti-nuclear campaign, in a statement.
French electricity group EDF played down any security risk, saying police forces had intercepted one of two drones launched by Greenpeace at dawn on Tuesday.
“The fuel building is key for security, designed in particular to withstand natural or accidental damage, which ensures its high degree of robustness,” the company said, adding that it would lodge a complaint with police.
Greenpeace has carried out several actions aimed at highlighting the danger posed by French nuclear plants, which generate the bulk of the country's electricity needs.
In February, eight activists were sentenced to jail terms or fines after breaking into a plant and setting off fireworks last year.
After Greenpeace activists broke into another nuclear plant last November, the French government opened a parliamentary inquiry into nuclear safety and security.
The findings of the report, which include an analysis of potential risks of drones equipped with explosives, are expected to be released soon.
In 2014 and 2015, drone flights were reported over several French nuclear plants, including Bugey, though Greenpeace denied any involvement.

MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell said on Friday its fourth-quarter net profit more than doubled from a year earlier due to one-off sales, though lending income remained under pressure because of ultra-low interest rates.
Net profit came in at 147.7 million euros ($184.5 million), slightly below analysts' forecasts of 150 million euros in a Reuters poll.
Sabadell booked profits of 50 million euros related to the sale of HI Partners.
Its full-year net profit of 801.5 million euros was in line with its revised net profit target of 800 million euros but below forecasts of 804 millions.
Like its domestic competitors, the bank is struggling to lift earnings from loans as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins.
Sabadell, Spain's fifth largest bank, said its net interest income, or profit from loans minus funding costs, fell 2.35 percent in the fourth quarter to 924.6 million euros, below forecasts of 932 million euros, and was 1.7 percent lower than the previous quarter.
Sabadell was one of the two banks to move registered headquarters out of the northeastern region of Catalonia to seek legal certainty as the region's leaders pressed ahead with a secession campaign in October.

Just over two weeks after Oakman Inns was awarded the prestigious Princess Royal Training Award, their Human Resource programme received further recognition at the National Innovation in Training Awards (NITAs) at the Café de Paris in London.
The NITAs celebrate those who have demonstrated training excellence and innovation in the licensed retail sector.
Oakman Inns, which was started by entrepeneur Peter Borg-Neal in Tring, Herts, now has 20 contemporary Inns with letting rooms and ‘all-day' pubs across Beds, Bucks, Herts, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and beyond.
And it is fast establishing itself as a leading operator in the industry having won the award for The Best Casual Dining Training Programme after passing a rigorous first stage entry process, followed by a final judging assessment by the British Innkeepers Institute (BII). The assessment included a demanding process of presentations and interviews in front of a panel of industry experts last month.
Oakman Inns' CEO, Mr Borg-Neal, said: “I am delighted for this recognition of the work Oakman has undertaken under the guidance and inspiration of our HR Director, Jill Scatchard and Learning and Development Manager, Laura Douglas. We have already felt the impact on staffing of the Brexit decision and the fall in the value of sterling, so we are all having to work much harder and very quickly to enthuse, recruit and train the people we need for tomorrow.”
Oakman Inns, which owns and operates 20 distinctive pubs, restaurants and inns, has developed its own bespoke Online Craft Academy to support their growing teams with knowledge and experience. Reflecting the ethos and personality of the company, Oakmanology was designed from scratch by CPL Online to mirror the company's existing HR programme and to support each Oakman employee's progression in their chosen career pathway. Learning activities are as visual as possible and after a compulsory ‘induction' stage, all the craft modules are available 24/7 to every individual regardless of their job role or personal career journey.
This inclusive, flexible approach means that everyone, whatever their role or passion, has access to a structured learning environment where they can find out about other roles and develop new, core skill-sets required for running a casual dining venue.
Jill Scatchard, Oakman Inns' HR Director, said: “Oakman has won many awards for our staff engagement; for the wide range of benefits we provide; and, most importantly, the career path we develop for our employees. Using the Oakmanology programme, the progress of each individual can be tracked in real time which is linked to an achievement-based incremental pay programme. We have seen more team members experiencing real personal growth and expressing a desire to progress within the company and make a career in hospitality.”
BII CEO, Mike Clist, commented: “The NITAs are a celebration of the most successful individuals and businesses in the licensed retail market today. Our finalists have shown that they value, support and champion their people by continuing to invest in and develop their training programmes. It's vital that we recognise, reward and share their successes so that we can encourage further innovation in our fantastic industry for years to come. The use of new technology and the holistic approach to the way they design their training programmes, has benefitted their businesses from the ground up and directly impacted on financial performances, growth and staff retention - we congratulate them all.”

TOKYO-A billion-dollar Valentine's Day bounty is on the cards for Japan's retailers as women celebrate the festival of romance by stocking up on ‘obligation chocolates' for men.
February 14 is a huge money-spinner for the country's confectioners, with women traditionally expected to fork out for chocolates and gift them to boyfriends, husbands, colleagues and bosses.
This year's Valentine's Day haul is estimated at 138.5 billion yen ($1.22 billion), up three percent from 2016, according to Kinenbi Culture Laboratory, an organisation that researches Japanese holidays and other annual events.
Part of the growth, according to the organisation, is due to Valentine's Day falling on a weekday for the first time in three years, meaning more women will buy “giri choco” - or obligation chocolates - for the men they work with or for.
On Monday, 27-year-old Maika Suzuki visited a floor dedicated to Valentine's Day at the Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo's Nihonbashi area to buy more than 30 boxes of chocolates for her male co-workers. Such chocolates “are for expressing gratitude to men,” she explained as she surveyed products on offer from 110 manufacturers.
“Japanese men are happy to get chocolates” as there is a culture in Japan that women give them to men, she said.
“We can also boost their pride” by giving them chocolates on Valentine's Day, she added. Although Japan is one of the world's most efficient and high-tech societies, marketeers have exploited the country's rigid gender roles and social pressures to conform.
Valentine's Day first appeared in Japan in the late 1950s when a firm called Mary Chocolate advertised February 14 as “the only day of the year a woman professes her love through presenting chocolate” - establishing it as Japan's currency of romance.
But confectionery maker Ezaki Glico said in its 2016 report that only 8.7 percent of 312 female respondents gave chocolates to the men they love.
In a sign of equality, however, the country next month celebrates White Day, a Japanese event confectioners cooked up in the 1980s to keep the cash tills ringing that sees men buy a white gift such as vanilla cookies, marshmallows and handkerchiefs for the women in their lives.
Marie Kondo, 24, bought nearly 30 boxes of chocolates for the men in her office, forking out a total of 10,000 yen.
“But I'm going to spend more for myself,” she said, adding that she plans to buy chocolates from Sadaharu Aoki, a high-end Japanese chocolatier.
“To me, Valentine's Day is not a day to confess love.”
The family of young battler Bradley Lowery has launched an appeal for smiles from people touched by cancer.
They are looking for video clips to show how the cruel disease affects all ages and how strong these people are, which will be pulled together into a video.
The appeal coincides with the announcement that Hartlepool sister act Olivia Crawford and Georgia Fletcher aka Liv'n'G are to release a cover of Charlie Chaplin's 'Smile' in aid of Bradley.
A post on the Bradley Lowery's Fight Against Neuroblastoma Facebook page read: "We are looking for clips of families, young people, anyone who has been touched by cancer.
"We want to show how all ages can be affected, and how strong these people are, smiling through the pain.
"They can be taken on a phone (landscape if possible) and sent to smileforbradley@gmail.com
"We want to put as many clips into the video as we can."
The post added: "Bradley Lowery and his family have touched the hearts of the nation and the world, he has made us aware of the awful disease cancer and its effects, on him and his family.
"Yet through all of his treatment, all of his pain, he has shown the world such strength, and hope, in a time when the world needs hope; with something as simple as a smile.
"It is so fitting that recently Bourne Music Co, based in New York gave us the rights to record and release the fantastic Charlie Chaplin song ‘Smile'; the lyrics added in 1954 by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons giving it a sense of ‘melancholy and optimism' making it the song that everyone knows today.
"A firm favourite with Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Nat King Cole, Barbara Streisand, Josh Groban, it has been recorded by a plethora of huge artists.
"Liv'n'G are releasing the song in aid of every person fighting, surviving, and with the heart and strength to smile, on June 23 and for pre-order June 16.
"It would be amazing to get clips of you guys from around the world smiling, just take it on a phone (landscape / sideways) and send the clip to us at smileforbradley@gmail.com. In the email please let us know your name, age and where you are in the world, and also add that you allow us to use the clip in the video."
NEW YORK: In just two seasons, Indonesian Muslim designer Anniesa Hasibuan has made the hijab her trademark -- and dazzled New York fashion week´s catwalk this week by styling it with flowing, iridescent gowns fit for a princess.
Like in her New York show last fall -- which cemented her status as a rising star -- all of the models who showcased Hasibuan´s autumn/winter 2017 collection sported lustrous gray hijabs that sculpted the facial features while carefully covering the hair.
Other than the hijab, the traditional head and neck covering many Muslim women wear, the 30-year-old designer´s clothes evoked nothing of the "modest Muslim" style that sometimes stirs controversy and exacerbates anti-Muslim sentiment in western countries.
On the contrary, Hasibuan´s collection features shimmering, on-trend pleats, silver and golden ruffles, and long trains adorned with pearls, glitter or embroidery that recalled royalty of the Middle Ages.
The models were not chosen at random -- the young designer held casting calls specifically seeking first and second-generation immigrants, seeking to show that "fashion is for everybody."
"There is beauty in diversity and differences -- something we should not be afraid of" she told AFP, speaking through an interpreter.
"I believe being a fashion designer can bring a lot of changes -- and beautiful changes, of course."
- Growing fame -
She unveiled her second New York collection amid controversy over US President Donald Trump´s recent executive order on immigration, currently blocked by a US court, that bars refugees and migrants from seven Muslim-majority nations. The decree ignited mass protests and global condemnation.
Hasibuan, however, aims to keep her work, which is primarily geared toward Muslim women, "separate" from politics.
"I´m here bringing the beautiful voice of the Muslim women, the peace and the universal values that fashion can offer," she said.
Her dream, she said, would be to dress Kate Middleton, whom the designer said is "like a queen," adding that she admires the Duchess of Cambridge for "her elegance."
Hasibuan won worldwide praise for her fall collection in New York last September, the first to feature a hijab in every look.
Since then she has opened new stores in her home country Indonesia as well as in Malaysia, Turkey and Abu Dhabi -- proffering modern Islamic clothing dripping in glamor.
Chiara Sari, Indonesia´s vice consul in New York, donned a white hijab atop a black, velvet top and black pants to attend the show, pulling her contemporary look together with a statement necklace.
The hijab, Sari said, is Hasibuan´s "trademark, and I don´t think she will lose that."
Since Trump´s contentious decree Sari said she has spent significant time reassuring her fellow Indonesians in the United States, while also urging them to "avoid traveling abroad" to reduce the risk of not being able to re-enter.
For Sari, Hasibuan´s growing fame is a gift. "Hopefully that will increase familiarity with Islam in general, especially now when it is getting a lot of bad press," she said.
Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have remained extremely private about their relationship since news of their romance broke in May this year, but over the weekend, they made several rare public appearances together.
The first was after Swift's performance at the Jingle Bell Ball in New York on Friday night. After the concert, she and Alwyn were photographed heading home in an SUV, stepping out together holding hands.

The second was during Swift's appearance across the pond, at London's Jingle Bell Ball the following day. This is where she and Alwyn turned up the PDA. After taking the stage, Swift was spotted in the audience cuddling with her beau as he put his arm around her.

Raptors coach Dwane Casey was plotting moves against the Washington Wizards in a meeting when assistant coach Rex Kalamian got a message on his phone asking if everyone was OK.
They turned on the TV and suddenly basketball strategy was forgotten as the Toronto coaches learned of the horrific van attack that left 10 dead and 15 injured Monday.

Team president Masai Ujiri said his phone blew up with “hundreds of texts from people all over. They kept asking ‘Is everything OK?”'
It wasn't.
Basketball took a backseat Tuesday as the Raptors, like everyone else in the city, struggled to make sense of such a violent act.
While his team practised, Ujiri showed up unexpected to address the media. But the Nigerian native's message was for his fellow Torontonians.
“I really feel strongly that it's a time for us to come together and support one other and not be afraid,” he said.
He urged people to “believe in our city.”

“Everywhere I go I brag about this city,” he added. “It's the safest place in the world, it's the best city in the world and it's going to continue to be the best place and the best city in the world … We must continue to live our lives and not be afraid.”
Casey, meanwhile, said he had just been telling people over the weekend how safe Toronto was and how it was a melting pot without the kind of crime other cities have.
The attack stuck close to home for the coach. “It's not too far from up the street from where I live.”
Just as the Maple Leafs did Monday night in their game against the Boston Bruins, the Raptors plan to show their support Wednesday for the victims of the attack prior to Game 5 of their first-round playoff series against the Wizards.

Ujiri and Casey both said Monday's nightmarish events put life — and sports — in perspective.
“What we do doesn't really matter sometimes,” said Ujiri.
“I can't imagine what it would be like to be on that sidewalk.”
“My drive home, all I thought about was that. And the heaviness of it. And how you should come out of this,” he added. “But the next thing I thought about was I still know how we are, I still know what this city is and I know that this kind of things can never put a city or country like this down.”
Added Casey: “There are things much bigger than sport right now that's going on in the world and right now in Toronto … but hopefully sport can give a relief, a reprieve, some joy in our lives a little bit and lighten things up a little bit.”
Ujiri, who said he fears “nothing and no one,” said he believes 98 per cent of the people around the world are “unbelievable people.”
As for the other two per cent who may have problems, “we should work on making those people better.”

But he said things can happen anywhere, noting he was in Denver just days before the 2012 mass shooting inside a cinema in nearby Aurora, Colo., that left 12 people dead and 70 injured.
“You can be anywhere in this world these days and things happen,” he said. “We just have to be a little bit aware and we have to care about each other more. Care about your neighbour, know who your neighbour is, know who people around you are a little bit more and, I think, show more affection to these people.”
Toronto and Canada remain his home, he said, saying they are “an example of the way a city or a country should be.”
Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said Monday's events were sickening.
“It's just a sad time, a sad day. It's kind of hard to put into words how you feel,” he said.
Lowry, a Philadelphia native, paid tribute to the police officer who made the arrest without firing his gun.
“Kudos to that officer,” he said.
The 25-year-old man arrested would likely have faced a different fate in the U.S., Lowry added.
“I think in America he would definitely have been shot up,” he said.

The Raptors won the first two games of the series at home by margins of 114-106 and 130-119 before losing the next two 122-103 and 106-98 at the Capital One Arena.
Mistakes have cost the Raptors. Toronto is currently last among the 16 playoff teams averaging 17.0 turnovers a game. During the regular season, the Raptors were sixth best in the league at just 13.4 turnovers per game.
Casey said cutting down on those errors is crucial.
“We clean up half of those and that will help us tremendously.”
(Reuters) - Chia Yen Wu of Taiwan set two records on her way to the semi-finals at the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship in southern California.
At 13, Wu became the youngest semi-finallist, while her quarter-final match on Friday stretched for 12 extra holes, the longest in U.S. Golf Association championship history.
Wu, the 63rd seed, sank a 20-foot putt to finally end her match against American Lauren Stephenson as the sun was slipping below the horizon at San Diego Country Club.
Earlier, at the eighth extra hole, Wu drained a 75-foot birdie putt to match Stephenson's birdie and extend the marathon match.
"My caddie just told me, ‘I want to go eat dinner,'” said a smiling Wu, referring to club champion Scotty Patel, who put his local knowledge to good use.
“He reads the lines pretty well, and he tells me, ‘You can make it,' and gives me confidence,” Wu said.
Patel said he tried to keep Wu loose throughout the playoff.
"She says she has 14 boyfriends in her bag. Every single club in her bag is her boyfriend,” he joked.
Wu also dodged a bullet in qualifying, emerging from an 11-woman playoff for eight spots in the championship proper.

A beautiful September day in 201, quickly turned into the worst day of David Fowlie's life, when he learned that his 28-year-old son Michael had gone into cardiac arrest while cycling on Purcell's Cove Road.
“There was no previous history with Michael,” said Fowlie. “Even going back a couple of generations, there's nothing that indicates that there are concerns with cardiac arrest.”
Michael was the only child of David and his wife.
Less than 700 metres away from where Michael collapsed was an automated external defibrillator [AED] that could have saved his life. But the 911 caller had no idea the AED was accessible, or where it was located.
“The caller was not directed to go and get the AED. As well, the caller was not directed by medical communications to begin chest compressions,” Fowlie said.

There's a sign campaign underway in the region informing people that 911 won't direct you to the nearest location of an AED.
There is a provincial AED registry that currently has 504 AEDs registered, according to Emergency Health Services [EHS], but the organization believes there are at least 1,000 throughout the province.
According to EHS, dispatch isn't able to tell callers the location of the nearest AED.
The organization says there are plans to eventually change that.
“Full integration including telling callers the location of the nearest AED, will be possible when the next phase of the EHS AED registry is launched. Although we don't have an exact timeline, we hope this to be available in the coming months,” says Jeff Fraser, director of provincial operations.
The response from EHS was attributed to Fraser in an email statement. The organization declined an on-camera interview.
Meanwhile, Fowlie is left waiting for the system to change.
“When there's a cardiac arrest, an AED is essential,” he said.
“Through either, you're going to get it yourself being the 911 caller or sending a bystander to retrieve that AED.”

CAIRO:- Egypt's plan to hand over two uninhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia under an agreement that has attracted widespread criticism moved closer to fruition with parliament set to vote on the measure on Wednesday. A key parliamentary committee unanimously backed the plan and referred it to parliament for a final vote before it can be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, its chairman told journalists. Sisi's government last year announced a maritime demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt, ceding control of the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to the Gulf kingdom. –Reuters
"We have unanimously approved the maritime demarcation accord with Saudi Arabia and it will be voted on in the general session today," said House of Representatives Committee on Defense and National Security Chairman Kamal Amer.
VICTORIA — A former Olympic rower who mysteriously disappeared for nearly 18 months has pleaded guilty to fraud.
Harold Backer changed his plea Wednesday in Victoria provincial court on a single charge of fraud over $5,000.
The three-time Olympian was previously facing two charges of fraud over $5,000 and had pleaded not guilty on both counts.
Backer disappeared on Nov. 3, 2015, when he failed to return home after telling his family he was going out for a bike ride.
The investment dealer surrendered to police in April 2017 and his whereabouts during that period of time hasn't been explained.
Soon after he disappeared, financial crime investigators began looking into Backer and the company My Financial Backer Corp. after his investors received letters that concerned them.
The 55-year-old was on the Canadian rowing team in the 1984, 1988 and 1992 Olympic Games.
After his disappearance, police in Port Angeles, Wash., said an officer who viewed video from a street security camera noted a man fitting Backer's description was aboard a ferry from Victoria, a 90-minute trip away.
The guilty plea was entered by defence lawyer Joven Narwal on behalf of Backer, a thin, bearded man who was dressed in a grey pinstripe suit.
Crown attorney John Neal told Judge Carmen Rogers he is seeking a 13-month jail sentence and three years of probation for Backer. He also wants a no-contact order for five people who lost money as a result of Backer's fraud.
As the nation recovers from yesterday's tragic violence caused by pro-nazi and white supremacist rallies that took place in Charlottesville, Va., Twitter users have been mobilizing to identify the participants in the weekend's events.
Since early Sunday morning, the @YesYoureRacist account has been calling on Twitter users to identify participants in the rally.
If you recognize any of the Nazis marching in #Charlottesville, send me their names/profiles and I'll make them famous #GoodNightAltRight pic.twitter.com/2tA9xliFVU — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017
Other accounts (like @shaunking of the NY Daily News) quickly took up the cause and within several hours one of the participants in the rallies had been fired by his employer.
Identifying participants in a public rally by name does not violate Twitter's terms of service (something Jason Del Rey noted in a Recode article earlier today) . Twitter only suspends accounts if the poster includes private information like a phone number, social security number, or home address.
The rallies in Charlottesville, which brought together an assortment of neo-nazi, white supremacist, and “alt-right” organizations to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee ended in tragedy late Saturday afternoon when Heather Heyer, a resident of Charlottesville, Va., was struck and killed by a car driven by a participant in the white nationalist marches.
The police arrested James Alex Fields Jr., a resident of Maumee, Ohio, and charted him with second-degree murder for the attack.
The identification of participants in the white nationalist demonstrations have brought up the specter of doxing — when private information is released online to harass (or encourage the harassment of) a private citizen.
But, as Dave Weigel noted earlier today, the identification of participants in a public rally isn't doxing.
Attn trolls: It's not "doxxing" to identify people who appeared in public at a rally and have given media interviews about their beliefs. — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) August 13, 2017
Weigel was referring to the identification of Peter Cvjetanovic, a University of Nevada, Reno, student who was identified by @YesYoureRacist and subsequently gave an interview to a local Reno television station.
This angry young man is Peter Cvjetanovic, a student at @unevadareno pic.twitter.com/7rLGJkcT3o — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017
Cvetjnanovic participated in the protests, he said, because the removal of the statue was a symbol for “the slow replacement of white heritage within the United States and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland.”
Cvetjanovic also wanted people to know, “I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo.”
As the firing of Cole White indicates, the identification of participants in these protests has implications and not everyone online is comfortable with the outing of protestors (on both the right and the left).
It's also true that the Twitterati can make mistakes — which was the case when the conservative YouTube celebrity Joey Salads was accused of attending the rallies. Salads (not his real name) was actually vacationing in Jamaica.
Companies are well within their rights to fire people for their political beliefs, as this New York Times piece from 2015 outlines.
For private employees, who account for about 85 percent of the work force, the First Amendment's guarantee offers no protection from being fired for something you've said, either in the workplace or outside of it, as on social media. That's because the amendment addresses actions by the government to impede free speech, not by the private sector. And while federal laws bar employers from firing workers because of such variables as their race, religion and gender, there is no such protection for political affiliation or activity.
Even in states like New York and California, which have adopted laws that provide the most cover for political speech, people can be fired for expressing their views (in or out of the workplace).
As Times reporter Alina Tugend writes:
The broadest-based laws, such as those in California and New York, make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of an employees' political activity or beliefs in or out of work, Ms. Brantner said, unless such activity interferes with the functioning of the business.
Businesses can take a broad view on what kinds of activities interfere with the functioning of a business, and the law offers little protection.
It's that kind of legal backdrop that has made some commenters question the outing of the neo-nazi and white nationalist participants in the rallies in Charlotte.
The question seems to revolve around something that my colleague, Brian Heater, brought up earlier today.
The new generation of white nationalism seemingly does not see the need to hide behind hoods as their intellectual forebears may have done, because they do not think they will be held accountable for their views.
But there's no anonymity online these days, and anyone who acts in public can potentially face public scrutiny. The question is whether the people marching on a weekend are willing to have their views circulated in an office on Monday morning.

Calgary police are thanking the public for their “overwhelming help” in identifying a suspect in the high-profile “CanadaCreep” Twitter account investigation.
The account featured photos of unsuspecting women at CTrain stations, Plus-15s and other places around Calgary.
It was open for about a year, with about 17,000 followers, before it was shut down for being inappropriate.

Calgary police opened up an investigation leading to the arrest of a 42-year-old man late Tuesday afternoon.
WATCH BELOW: Calgary police are on the hunt for a predator who's been taking sexual photos of innocent women. He goes by the handle Canada Creep and posted the images on social media. It's people online who first sounded the alarm. Jill Croteau reports.
A search warrant was carried out on a home in the southeast community of Prestwick, where computers and other electronic devices were seized.
“Investigators are currently examining multiple terabytes of data, including hundreds of thousands of images,” police said in a release Wednesday. “Officers are in the process of identifying victims and determining what electronic evidence is relevant to this case.”
WATCH BELOW: Staff Sergeant Cory Dayley of the Calgary Police Service Cyber/Forensics Unit calls the actions of the Canada Creep Twitter account “clearly disturbing.”
The suspect's name hasn't been released yet as his case has yet to go before a judge. But investigators say he is facing voyeurism-related charges in relation to three incidents.
They add more charges are expected.

Islamabad - Things were not easier for those desiring to celebrate Valentine's Day in Islamabad on Tuesday, as police spring into action against the vendors selling greeting cards, flowers and gifts.
The celebrations were cut short as the police cut the strings of heart balloons of the vendors at Jinnah Super Market, a hub of social activities thus leaving the latter to watch them going in the air helplessly. The vendors were selling heart balloons to those willing to celebrate the day, on their bicycles.
The officials of enforcement directorate of CDA visited all major markets of the city to enforce the ban imposed on the celebrations at public places by the Islamabad High Court, a day earlier.
The florists were expecting to sell a great amount of flowers, especially red roses but found no relaxation from the city administration throughout the day.
Enforcement department officials visited all major markets of the city and enforced the ban on the orders issued by Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Muhammad Ibrahim, an owner of a flower shop at F-6 told The Nation that enforcement department officials started visiting the place in the morning and ordered them to keep flowers and bouquets inside the shop only.
“Today we were expecting more than normal sale but the officials did ask us to limit the display of flowers,” he said. He said that though customers' flow gradually increased but the enforcement department kept them disturbed. He was however, happy that families, couples and individuals visited the shop in the day and took different kinds of flowers including rose, lily and gland.
A vendor selling heart balloons on his bicycle at Jinnah Super Market told The Nation that city administration has ordered them to stay away from the market. Muhammad Babar said that enforcement officials asked to refrain from selling balloons in the market. He said the officials kept on cutting the strings of valentine balloons. “More than 100 balloons were set free in the air from my bicycle and similarly four other vendors became victim of the city administration's action,” said Babar. “We were expecting some good income today, but faced loss instead,” he added.
Similarly, administration of major shopping malls of the city distanced themselves from the celebrations. Junaid Ahmed, Manager Activation and Promotions at Safa Gold Mall told The Nation that the mall management, in the face of IHC orders, have had to revise its original plan of making special arrangements for the day.
“Though we have not received official orders from city administration but we respect the court orders and decided not to celebrate the day at the level of management,” he said.
“After the management come to know about court decision, it dropped the promotion and decoration arrangements”, he said. However, he said few shops have been decorated by the owners in their own capacity.
Similarly, Centaurus Mall management, following the court orders, suspended promotional activities. “Special photograph corner and some other arrangements along with decoration were planned by the management but we decided to abide by the official orders,” said marketing manager, Zaeema.
Meanwhile, dozens of shops, brands, restaurants and fast food outlets in the mall announced special offers for the day.
Rizwan Ali and Maham, a couple who opted to wear red on the day said that they waited for this day and celebrating it freely. “The day is specifically for expressing love and we don't follow controversies and enjoy this day,” said the couple. Sumaira, a customer at a bouquet stall viewed the ban on this day as ‘unfair'.
“It is not going to work because people will celebrate it on individual level and it is not possible to stop them,” she maintained. However, Sabahat Khan who was asked by her office to bring flowers argued that government orders must be followed in letter and spirit. “It could be dangerous also as some elements can raise security problem for general people,” she said.
Despite criticism from conservative circles, the celebrations were becoming popular among urban youth. In 2016, local governing body of Peshawar had officially banned the celebration of Valentine's Day in the city of Peshawar.
Meanwhile, the local police was on high alert in the capital in aftermath of Lahore blast a day earlier. Security was beefed up at important installations in the city especially the Red Zone housing parliament house and Supreme Court building. Special arrangements were in place for the security of shopping markets, malls and public places so that no untoward incident takes place.

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. – The trapeze-artist wife of daredevil Nik Wallenda says she'll be tethered to a helicopter when she hangs from the aircraft by her teeth as it flies over Niagara Falls.
Erendira Wallenda discussed her plans for the stunt during a news conference Wednesday morning on the American side of the Falls.

Wallenda's stunt is planned for Thursday, the fifth anniversary of her husband's televised tightrope walk from the New York side of Niagara Falls into Canada.
Wallenda says she plans to hold on by her teeth and her toes while on a Hula Hoop-type device suspended from the helicopter as it flies above the Falls.
Five members of the famed Wallenda circus troupe fell from a high-wire in Sarasota, Fla., in February while practicing an eight-person pyramid. Everyone survived.
Live Oak, California, resident Patrick Dustin and his family heard the evacuation notices for Sutter and Butte counties and wasted no time. The Dustin family packed up some of their personal belongings, warm clothes, checked inventory on the near month worth of food Patrick had stockpiled in the camping trailer for just such an emergency, then headed to a local high school, the same place they went nearly 10 year ago under the same threat of flooding.
Re: Debate on Queen St. buses goes off the rails, Keenan, June 11
Debate on Queen St. buses goes off the rails, Keenan, June 11
Interesting that Councillor Michael Ford supports an expensive comparative study of buses versus streetcars on Queen St.
Interesting, and also hypocritical, because Ford had previously voted against a study that would have compared the one-stop subway extension to Scarborough Town Centre (at a cost of $3.6 billion and rising) with the proposed Scarborough LRT, which would replace the Scarborough RT in the same grade-separated right-of-way, would be completed much sooner than the subway extension, and would serve far more passengers with a lower capital cost and less environmental impact.
But Edward Keenan's analysis of the motorist's perspective is spot-on and worth repeating: “If Michael Ford could learn anything from his uncles' example, it is that there are reliable political points to be scored in catering to the road rage of car drivers.”

TORONTO — Ontario's fiscal watchdog says the Liberal government will run a deficit this fiscal year, despite claims it has balanced the budget.
In a new report Monday, the Financial Accountability Office said the Liberals will run a $4 billion deficit in 2017-2018, and will continue to be in the red over the next few years.
More moderate growth in revenues and the increasing fiscal impact of the province's Fair Hydro Plan, which cuts electricity rates by 25 per cent, will take their toll on Ontario's books the report notes. It also says a long-simmering accounting dispute between the Liberal government and Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk over how to count two public sector pension plans on the ledger is contributing to uncertainty.
“We've been very consistent that because of a number of factors we think the deficit will re-emerge,” said FAO chief economist David West. “Now, with this accounting debate it will become more significant.”
The Liberals presented a balanced budget in the spring, a year ahead of the provincial election, and have promised to keep the books in balance through the next couple of years.The FAO, however, projects the government's budget deficit will grow to $9.8 billion in 2021-2022.
“The government is out borrowing this money,” West said. “This current year they're going to borrow $23 billion in the markets. That's going to rise to $45 billion in the coming years.”
The FAO also said the government's new hydro plan will add $3.2 billion to the budget deficit by 2021-2022.
Last year Lysyk questioned the province's decision to include a pair of public pensions — the Ontario Public Service Employee's Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan — as assets on its balance sheet.
The FAO said in its report that since the government has not adopted the auditor's recommended accounting for both the pension assets, and with the addition of the Fair Hydro Plan, it is becoming more difficult for legislators and the public to assess the government's fiscal projections.
A Scunthorpe landlord believes he has the luckiest pub in the country after scooping a £1 million lottery prize.
EuroMillions organisers have today (Monday, August 14) confirmed the landlord won the money on the UK Millionaire Maker part of the game on Friday, July 28.
And his good fortune came after one of his regulars, David Long, scooped the £1 million UK Millionaire Maker prize twice in recent years.
The landlord will make himself known at a press reception in Scunthorpe tomorrow (Tuesday, August 15).
He will tell how he believes his pub is the luckiest in the country following the incredible third UK Millionaire Maker success.
And he will also reveal how two of his best friends are now set to bank £125,000 each after he made a promise to share his winnings with them if he ever won the National Lottery.
The UK Millionaire Maker part of the EuroMillions game gives ticket-holders a chance to win big money even if their numbers do not come up on the main draw.
A code is printed on each ticket, with two guaranteed UK winners of £1 million in each draw on Tuesdays and Fridays.
The latest win continues the Scunthorpe area's amazing run of fortune on the UK Millionaire Maker game, with Mr Long's double win being added to earlier this year by Annie and John Showell, who also became millionaires through it.
* Arrested in 2011 protests, activist lives in London
* Says relatives are harassed in effort to silence him
* Gulf monarchy is ally of the United States and Britain
By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Noah Browning
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Stripped of his Bahraini citizenship and living in London exile, rights activist Sayed Ahmed AlWadaei says he speaks for the hundreds of opposition figures made voiceless by imprisonment back home.
Drawing on a network of activists, contacts, relatives of detainees and legal records, he publishes prolifically on developments in the Gulf island monarchy, an ally of the United States and Britain.
Scores of Bahraini exiles and dissidents live in London, but none campaigns more energetically against their native country's crackdown on its critics.
Authorities in Bahrain tend to call such people - including AlWadaei himself - terrorists.
He says members of his own family have been detained and tortured in Bahrain in a bid to pressure him into silence.
“It's crystal clear in my mind that the moment I stop my work, the reprisals against my family will stop,” AlWadaei, 31, told Reuters in an interview from the offices of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) in central London.
“It's a matter of, will I allow them to break my will, will I allow them to break me by using those harsh tactics? Or will I make it costly for them, for their reputation and their partners to be associated with corrupt human rights abusers?” he said.
BIRD, which employs several British campaigners, receives funding from the U.S.-based National Endowment for Democracy and a UK foundation, the Sigrid Rausing Trust.
He seeks to shine a light on prison conditions and trials of detainees, such as the case of a mass sentencing on weapons charges this week of 58 people to penalties ranging from death to loss of citizenship. He decried it as a “travesty of justice”.
Bahrain, whose ruling family is Sunni Muslim, has seen sporadic unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests, mainly by the Shi‘ite majority, demanding a bigger role in running the country.
AlWadaei was detained for taking part in the 2011 rallies. He accuses police of beating him and his jailers of torture and sexual harassment. He points to a large scar on his forehead.
Authorities accuse him of incitement to terrorism aimed at overthrowing Bahrain's monarchy.
“DEMOCRACY VERSUS DICTATORSHIP”
In a response to a Reuters request for comment on AlWadaei's accusations, a government spokesman said any allegations of abuses by security forces could be referred to an ombudsman and independently investigated.
The government says his mother-in-law and brother-in-law were sentenced in a fair trial to three years in jail in October for planting a “fake bomb” meant to taunt police.
“No one can be charged or prosecuted solely because of their family relations,” the government added.
AlWadaei believes the case against his relatives was motivated by his human rights work and especially a protest in which he took part in 2016 against the attendance of Bahrain's king at a royal horse show in Britain.
A tiny country lying between regional arch-rivals Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran, Bahrain is a key ally of Riyadh and the West.
It hosts the U.S.'s Fifth Fleet and soon also a new British naval base, its first permanent military presence in the Middle East since it withdrew from Bahrain and the rest of the Gulf region in 1971.
The government, citing years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks against its security forces, says it faces a militant threat backed by Tehran.
“They blame the situation on Iran to make it seem more of a sectarian problem rather than democracy versus dictatorship, which is the main context in Bahrain,” AlWadaei said.
He says his wife was detained and interrogated about his activities and movements as she and their young son were departing Bahrain's airport to join AlWadaei in London.
The Bahraini government said she was not mistreated and dismissed AlWadaei's accusations as “unsubstantiated.”
Because AlWadaei's application process for “indefinite leave to remain” in Britain had not been decided by the time of his daughter's birth last year, she has been rendered stateless like him for the time being.
Despite such challenges, he vows not to relent.
“I ... feel more determined that this injustice should stop, and no one, no human on earth, should be tortured or have his family go through reprisals simply because they stood up for human rights.” (Editing by Andrew Roche)
HONOLULU (AP)  The Latest on Hawaii's ongoing legal challenge to the Trump administration's travel ban (all times local):
3 p.m.
A federal judge is giving Hawaii an opportunity to make its case that it should be allowed to challenge the Trump administration's latest travel ban.
U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson said Friday that Hawaii would have until Tuesday morning to file a new motion. The government will have until Saturday, Oct. 14, to respond.

The latest travel ban removes Sudan from the list of affected countries and adds Chad and North Korea, along with several officials from Venezuela's government. It's scheduled to take effect Oct. 18.
State Attorney General Doug Chin said the new ban still discriminates on the basis of nationality, exceeds the president's legal authority, and seeks to implement his Muslim ban.
Chin has been challenging President Donald Trump on travel bans since February, after Trump sought to bar new visas for people from seven mostly Muslim countries.

Lawyers representing Hawaii in the state's long-running fight against Trump administration travel bans have filed a motion seeking to challenge the latest version of the policy.
Hawaii filed a motion Friday asking a federal judge to lift his order halting the state's previous lawsuit.
Hawaii says it wants to file an amended lawsuit targeting the third travel ban.

The Alberta economy has claimed another established Calgary business.
The Out There Adventure Centre at 151 8 Avenue S.W. downtown has shut after 14 years in business.
READ MORE: Calgary customers fuming after Fitz Flooring, Ben Moss store closures
A letter on the company website and posted on the store windows says:
“It is with great regret and sadness that we have been forced to permanently close our doors at the Out There Adventure Centre. In short, we were unable to survive the current economy in downtown Calgary.”
One of the business co-founders is Calgary mountaineer Jamie Clarke, who climbed Mount Everest twice.
Reached by phone in Mexico by Global News, he said the store's customer base in the downtown collapsed.
“Unfortunately we just couldn't handle the economic challenges of downtown Calgary. So many of our great customers over the years no longer work downtown and we could no longer sustain it.”

Clarke also said the trend of online shopping has changed retail.
“The digitization of retail has shifted. So our store, bricks and mortar, really, in many ways was a dinosaur. Its days were numbered. This was compounded by the difficulties of downtown Calgary.”
Clarke said staff will hold a pop-up sale in a few weeks to sell off inventory.
He said he will now focus on his e-commerce site outdoor.com.
MULTAN-Veteran politician Javed Hashmi on Sunday reiterated his claim about PTI chairman Imran Khan prophesying the imposition of ‘judicial martial law' in 2014.
“The PTI chairman had predicted during the 2014 sit-in that Justice Nasirul Mulk would replace Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jilani and dissolve assemblies under the Supreme Court,” Hashmi told journalists. “Imran said a new government would then ascend to power with the PTI emerging victorious in elections,” he added.
Hashmi went on to add that some disgruntled elements in the military wanted to get rid of Gen Raheel Sharif and use Imran to destroy democracy. The veteran politician also claimed that PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi had told those present at a party meeting that there had been no rigging in Punjab with the exception of a few isolated incidents.
Hashmi urged Imran to undergo a dope test, saying he would do the same and the result would determine who is sane. “I will pass the test but if Imran doesn't, the nation will finally be rid of him.”
He also challenged the PTI chairman to a verbal duel to ascertain who had been lying. Earlier on Sunday, Imran insinuated that the veteran politician had ‘gone senile' in the wake of his December 30 claims.
Earlier, the PTI chairman resumed his war of words with his ex-party president Javed Hashmi, calling him ‘insane'.
“Javed Hashmi is in that age where he does not even know himself and even what he is saying. Hashmi has gone insane,” Khan said, while replying a question about Javed Hashmi during his media talk in Karachi.
Javed Hashmi had resigned from PTI after differences with Imran Khan following 2014 protest sit-in at Islamabad.
Q. Probate fees are going up soon I have heard. What exactly is happening?
A. When someone dies somebody else needs to deal with anything the deceased leaves. What is left by the deceased is called “the estate”. Often in order to do this you need to take out a grant of probate in the estate – the current level below which you do NOT need the grant is £5000.
If you need a grant and are a relative or friend of the deceased it costs £215.
This is scheduled to change soon. There will be a sliding scale of fees based on estate value. If less than £50,000 the cost will be zero. The government says that applies to 58% of all estates in England and Wales. Other fees include:-
Estate value £50,000 to £300,000 – fee of £300
Estate £1 million to £1.6 million – fee of £8000
So the new fees will affect large value estates much more than low value estates. And government figures show that apart from the 58% of estates worth less than £50,000 23% are worth £50,000 to £300,000 meaning 81% of all estates will be paying either nothing or £85 more than the £215 current fee.
Liz Truss the Lord Chancellor is in charge of our legal system. The new law will come in on her say-so. The joint committee on statutory instruments is made up of MPs and looks at whether or not some laws are being made correctly. It has published a report saying there is doubt in this case.
The feeling is that an increase from £215 to £8000 or more (the highest fee will in fact be £20,000) is not really a “fee” (a word meaning a charge for the provision of a service) but more like a tax considering fees charged for these grants go to the Government. Taxes are not supposed to come in on the say-so alone of the Lord Chancellor or any other single person; Parliament is meant to look at them. And normally proposed new taxes are campaigned for by the relevant political party in the run-up to a general election – which did not happen here.
Many may say: “well – I am not leaving a million quid when I die so I'm not bothered”. But what if the committee is right and Ms Truss is acting beyond her powers? Maybe next time a politician does that perhaps in relation to some other law it WILL affect you.
Presently there is no sign the Government will change its mind so these new fees look good to go.

The Taliban insurgents have executed a child and three women after charging them with the alleged cooperation with the government in northern Sar-e-Pul province.
According to the local government officials, the incident took place late on Sunday night in the vicinity of Sayad district.
Provincial governor's spokesman Zabiullah Amani confirmed the incident and said the women and the child were shot dead by the insurgents accusing them of helping the government.
In the meantime, the Taliban insurgents in a statement claimed that a mortar round landed on a residential house in Sayad, leaving three civilians dead.
The execution of the civilians by the Taliban insurgents comes as the group is accused of two thirds of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan.
The UN mission said it documented 11,418 civilian casualties from 1st January 2016 to 31st December, 2016.
According to the report, 61 per cent of all civilian casualties were incurred through attacks by the anti-government elements which includes a total of 6,994 civilian casualties (2,131 deaths and 4,863 injured).

From reading books, newspapers, comics, novels and stories you gain different information about different things. Reading gives you a picture of new cultures, people and place all over the world. It is habit that must be maintained. It also increases your vocabulary which is important for verbal and written communication. It gives you the power of knowledge which can help you in studies, broadens your mind and you can face every difficult test in your life bravely. In fact, reading is such a healthy activity that it not only nourishes and grooms your mind and personality, it increases your curiosity to learn more.
Reading the Holy Quran is also necessary for Muslims. We should read Quran on a daily basis. This will give us insight in to Almighty Allah's teachings. It will keep our faith strong and make us pious. The Quran can be read collectively as well, with family members and friends. The experience is not only enjoyable but mentally relaxing as well.
Reading newspaper is an especially good habit, as you get to know firsthand information about what is happening around the world.
To develop a reading habit you must read small books, short stories and magazines. Children who do not have this habit get inspired by smaller stories or books and develop an interest in reading thicker books, novels and comics later as they grow older.
Reading is something that you can do everywhere. Some people get bored while travelling, at that time, they can read small books. Even on the internet, there are many websites from where one can find books to read.
Book reading makes a person disciplined because reading reduces stress and calms down the mind, unlike watching TV which can often make a person hyper and stressed.
Reading before bedtime can be fun. It's a good time because there is peace and can read with concentration. Then, you have good sleep. If we do not have time the whole day, we can put our favourite books beside the bed.
People used to read a lot (voraciously) years ago, but now they focus more on screens rather than paper and books. We the new generation, to change this. We should read books and visit wonderful minds and places around the world through its pages! Happy Reading!

The Department of Music at Saddleback College is pleased to present Moller-Fraticelli Guitar Duo on Tuesday, Sept. 26 at 7:30 p.m. in the McKinney Theatre. Johannes Möller's close collaboration with the Argentinean guitarist Laura Fraticelli have resulted in a unique fusion of the Swedish perfection and the Argentinian passion. Their emotional playing style as well as their strong connection and stage presence make their performances unforgettable events.
Tickets are $15 general; $12 students; seniors (presale only); children free with paying adult. Call 949-582-4656 (Tues-Fri, noon to 4:00 p.m.) or online at www.saddleback.edu/arts.
The European guitarist and composer Johannes Möller has captivated audiences throughout the world with charismatic and soulful performances. In 2010 he was awarded first prize in the GFA Concert Artist Competition, considered by many to be the most prestigious guitar competition in the world. As a performer, Johannes's artistry has reached well beyond the usual guitar circles. This was confirmed in March 2008 when he won the Dutch Vriendenkrans Concours while competing against performers in all instrumental categories. As a part of this award his name has been engraved on a metal plate that can be seen in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. He also became the first guitarist ever to win the Ljunggrenska Competition (Sweden) in 2007, and the conclusion issued by the jury was: “With the help of a breathtaking technique and all the colors of the rainbow he opens a door to a world of subtle expressions which strikes us with great power and intensity.”
Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Laura Fraticelli studied with Tzvetan Sabev, Walter Ujaldón and Eduardo Fernández. A love for music gave her the courage to emigrate to Europe where she continued her studies at the Royal College of Music in London with Carlos Bonell and then later at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague where she was accepted in the class of the renowned guitarist Zoran Dukic.

The New England Patriots were prepared for the possibility of Rob Gronkowski not playing but didn't have much time to put together an alternate game plan.
Gronk was downgraded to limited in practice on Wednesday, and on Thursday reports emerged he would not play. That came as a major surprise — at least outside the organization — after he practiced fully on Monday and Tuesday.
Still, in Week 5 Tom Brady threw for 303 yards and a touchdown with an interception. The Patriots generated 402 yards of offense and won, 19-14.
“I think Josh (McDaniels) did a great job on that, as he always does,” Belichick said during a postgame press conference. “Josh had the game plan today ready with or without him. We played a lot of four wide receivers and some other personnel groups probably more than we would have played if Rob had been in the game. It's one of the things Josh does a great job of is having some breadth to the offense with different personnel groups and different people and utilizing different combination so that if he needs to move from one to another he can do that pretty easily. I thought he did a great job of that. I thought Josh called a great game and did a great job of handling the change of personnel as it evolved this week.”
McDaniels said on a conference call Friday that the other tight ends, the receivers and the running backs helped the Patriots acclimate without Gronkowski. While the team was productive from a yardage standpoint, it struggled in the red zone. It was just 1-of-3 in terms of red zone scoring. They managed just one passing touchdown.
“I think we were working the game plan all the way until this morning,” Brady said. “But, Josh [McDaniels] always does a great job. He is such a great coach, he always finds a way to help us create some space. We made some really good plays tonight, some really good plays, but we just made a couple that we wish we would've had back.”
McDaniels elected to make heavy use of three-receiver sets, which included Chris Hogan, Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola. Brady managed to get all three of those receivers over 70 yards, and Hogan had the only receiving touchdown. Dwayne Allen helped make up for Gronkowski's abilities as a blocker, and the running backs chipped in in pass protection.

The offense wasn't a well-oiled machine, but it put enough points on the board to eke out a win.
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP)  Officers from the U.S. Capitol Police and Alexandria police department fired more than 40 rounds to subdue and eventually kill the man who shot and wounded Congressman Steve Scalise and others on a northern Virginia ballfield, a prosecutor's report has found.
The report released Friday by Alexandria Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter concluded officers were justified in using lethal force to confront James Hodgkinson, 66, who wounded Scalise and four others, including a police officer, in June during a practice for a charity baseball game.
"This case did not present a close call," Porter wrote. "To the contrary, not only were the actions of the agents and officers reasonable, they were obligatory in light of the overwhelming and determined force employed by the suspect."
Hodgkinson fired at least 70 rounds, according to the report, including 62 from an SKS-style semi-automatic assault rifle. After Hodgkinson was first struck in the hip by an officer's bullet, he dropped the rifle and fired another eight rounds from a handgun.

The report states that an Alexandria officer and a Capitol Police officer each fired shots that struck Hodgkinson. The report credits the officers for pinning Hodgkinson down and placing him in custody within 10 minutes of the initial shots.
Hodgkinson later died from his injuries.
According to the report, Hodgkinson first opened fire from outside the third-base dugout of the field at 7:06 a.m. Capitol Police Special Agent David Bailey, who was at the field with partner Crystal Griner to provide routine security for Scalise, returned fire from an area near the first-base dugout.
After Bailey fired about 10 rounds, Hodgkinson was forced to take cover behind a press box behind home plate. It was there he exchanged fire with Griner, who was shot in the ankle.
Alexandria officers then began arriving at the scene. Kevin Jobe was the first to arrive, at 7:12 a.m., three minutes after the first 911 call. Alexander Jensen and Nicole Battaglia arrived shortly thereafter.
Jensen, using a police-issued Bushmaster rifle, fired the first shot that hit Hodgkinson, striking him in the right hip. In all, Jensen fired three rifle shots at Jensen, striking him twice.
Bailey and Jobe, confronting Hodgkinson from a different angle than Jensen, also fired at the suspect. The report concludes that one of Bailey's rounds struck Hodgkinson in the chest.
Jobe placed Hodgkinson in handcuffs at 7:15 a.m., and officers began efforts to resuscitate him.
The report does not delve into Hodgkinson's motive, but notes that he was angered by the election of President Donald Trump and was a supporter of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Before opening fire at the ballfield, he asked whether the congressional team that was practicing was Democratic or Republican.
It was Republican.
Porter acknowledged in his report that the legitimacy of the officers' use of lethal force was never really in doubt, but said it was still his duty to conduct a thorough investigation. He praised the officers' response and said the two police agencies worked well in tandem.
"The agents and officers are the paradigm of what law-enforcement officers should be and are true stewards of the public trust," he wrote.

Coachella is better known for its #corporate #sponsorships than its barrier-breaking celebrity fashion, but this year the relentless boho vibe seems to have been shaken off somewhat and replaced by something... not bad, overall? Like, some of it was cute. In my opinion.

First, let's get it over with—here are some Victoria's Secret models who will be dressing exactly like this at music festivals until they are dead. As a side note, I would like to announce that I'm really not into this “hi neck” top trend, currently seen on every other bikini top. Who does this look good on? I would argue that it does not even look good on our friend on the far-right.

Moving along! On the left, Jaden Smith has a nice pink and blue color scheme going on while his new girlfriend Odessa Adlon does an exaggerated ‘90s thing that seems like it must have been difficult to drag around. On the right, Shaun Ross is both neon and understated. And in the middle, my friends, I give you Vanessa Hudgens, crown princess of Coachella. I have no idea what she is doing here! Do you? Can someone explain?
Halsey wears a see-thru bikini top, pink hair, futuristic sneaks, and pants that are either stupid or very cool, I can't decide. Amber Rose rocks a form-fitting two-piece covered in paper doll accessories, while Sofia Richie—who is a regular at these sorts of things, and a teen, and Justin Bieber's ex, in case you aren't in the loop—continues the bikini top trend, pairing a ski bunny look with a Louis Vuitton fanny pack.
There she is again—my Vanessa! Her serene yet rigid commitment to wearing bad outfits is legitimately inspiring. Selena Gomez looks cute, while her new boyfriend The Weeknd follows close behind in matching sunglasses that are very Britney Spears circa 2001. Jhené Aiko is also doing a bralette, this one paired with oversized comfy pants and a yellow top.
And Rihanna did it again:
Nobody does the “undone” look better than Rihanna, who always seems to be sort of half-draped in something incredible and unimaginably expensive. And look at those toes!!

ISTANBUL — The Islamic State group on Monday claimed responsibility for the New Year's attack at a popular Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, including one Canadian, and wounded scores of others.
Turkish police meanwhile detained eight people in connection to the attack but were still hunting for the gunman who disappeared amid the chaos of the attack.
The IS-linked Aamaq News Agency said the attack was carried out by a “heroic soldier of the caliphate” who attacked the nightclub “where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.”

It said the man fired an automatic rifle and also detonated hand grenades in “revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders” of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The group described Turkey as “the servant of the cross” and also suggested it was in retaliation for Turkish military offensives against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.
“We let infidel Turkey know that the blood of Muslims that is being shed by its airstrikes and artillery shelling will turn into fire on its territories,” the statement said.

Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said eight people were taken into custody by Istanbul anti-terrorism squads and they are being questioned at Istanbul's main police headquarters. It did not provide further information on the suspects.
Earlier, Turkish media reports had said that Turkish authorities believed the IS group was behind the attack and that the gunman, who is still at large, is likely to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
According to the Hurriyet and Karar newspapers, police had also established similarities with the high-casualty suicide bomb and gun attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same IS cell could have carried out both attacks.
The gunman killed a policeman and another man outside the Reina club in the early hours of 2017 before entering and firing with an automatic rifle at an estimated 600 people partying inside.
Nearly two-thirds of the dead in the upscale club, which is frequented by local celebrities, were foreigners, Turkey's Anadolu Agency said. Many of them hailed from the Middle East.

Citing Justice Ministry officials, Anadolu reported that 38 of the 39 dead have been identified. The report said 11 of them were Turkish nationals, and one was a Turkish-Belgian dual citizen.
The report says seven victims were from Saudi Arabia; three each were from Lebanon and Iraq; two each were from Tunisia, India, Morocco and Jordan. Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Syria and Russia each lost one citizen.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Sunday that a Canadian citizen was among the victims.
“It is with deep sadness that I learned of the deadly terrorist attack on a nightclub in Istanbul that killed and injured innocent people celebrating the New Year and claimed the life of a Canadian citizen,” Trudeau said in a statement.
Please read my full statement on the terrorist attack that claimed the life of a Canadian citizen in Istanbul: https://t.co/48jUlBH8lA — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 2, 2017
Relatives of the victims and embassy personal were seen walking into an Istanbul morgue to claim the bodies.
Turkish officials haven't released the names of those identified.
The mass shooting followed more than 30 violent acts over the past year in Turkey, which is a member of the NATO alliance and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.
The country suffered multiple bombings in 2016, including three in Istanbul that authorities blamed on IS, a failed coup attempt in July and renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast.
The Islamic State group claims to have cells in the country. Analysts think it was behind suicide bombings last January and March that targeted tourists on Istanbul's iconic Istiklal Street as well as the attack at Ataturk Airport in June, which killed 45 people. Authorities have said the three suicide bombers in the airport attack were Russia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and there has been speculation that Akhmed Chatayev, a Chechen extremist known to be a top lieutenant in the IS militant group, may have directed the attack.
In August, Turkey sent troops and tanks into northern Syria, to clear a border area from the IS and also curb the territorial advances of Syrian Kurdish forces in the region. The incursion followed an IS suicide attack on an outdoor wedding party in the city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, that killed more than 50 people.
In December, IS released a video purportedly showing the killing of two Turkish soldiers and urged its supporters to “conquer” Istanbul. Turkey's jets regularly bomb the group in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab. Turkish authorities haven't confirmed the authenticity of the video.
Last week, Turkey and Russia brokered a cease-fire for Syria that excludes the IS and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations.
On Monday, Anadolu said more than 100 Islamic State targets in Syria have been hit by Turkey and Russia in separate operations.
Citing the Turkish Chief of General Staff's office, Anadolu said Turkish jets struck eight IS group targets while tanks and artillery fired upon 103 targets near Al Bab, killing 22 extremists while destroying many structures. The Russian jets also attacked IS targets in Dayr Kak, eight kilometers (five miles) to the southwest of Al Bab.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the attacker left a gun at the club and escaped by “taking advantage of the chaos” that ensued. Some customers reportedly jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack.

More than 1,000 people have drowned this year attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea, while 200 hundred of those have died in the past three days, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
According to IOM, three babies were among 103 people who died in shipwreck as a result of smugglers packing migrants into unsafe vessels.

On Sunday, the Libyan Coast Guard reported 100 people were missing after a small rubber boat capsized off the coast of Tripoli. According to IOM, 41 people survived the rescue.
IOM director general William Swing said he was en route to the Libyan city following the latest string of causalities.

“IOM is determined to ensure that the human rights of all migrants are respected as together we all make efforts to stop the people smuggling trade, which is so exploitative of migrants,” Swing said in a statement.
Another rubber dingy capsized Friday, just north of Tripoli, where only 16 people were rescued while an estimated 103 people died at sea.
“Adding to grim and tragic scene, the bodies of three babies were taken from the sea by the Libyan Coast Guard,” IOM said.

Between Friday and Sunday, close to 1,000 migrants were returned to the Libyan shore by the coast guard. So far this year, the coast guard has returned about 10,000 to shore, where Libyan authorities transfer them to detention centres.

“There is an alarming increase in deaths at sea off Libya Coast,” IOM Libya chief of mission Othman Belbeisi said in a statement. “Smugglers are exploiting the desperation of migrants to leave before there are further crackdowns on Mediterranean crossings by Europe.
“Migrants returned by the coast guard should not automatically be transferred to detention and we are deeply concerned that the detention centres will yet again be overcrowded and that living conditions will deteriorate with the recent influx of migrants,” Belbeisi said.
IOM statistics show that prior to the latest shipwrecks, 972 people were reported dead or missing as of June 27, while almost 45,000 migrants entered Europe by sea, compared to the roughly 95,000 who crossed during the same time period last year and the and 230,000 in 2016. In 2017, 2,172 people were reported dead or missing.
Soccer Football - Paris St Germain Training - Ooredoo training camp, Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, France - August 11, 2017 PSG's Neymar and Dani Alves during training
PARIS (Reuters) - Brazil forward Neymar will make his Ligue 1 debut on Sunday after being named in Paris St Germain's line-up at En Avant Guingamp.
Neymar was transferred from Barcelona this month after PSG triggered his 222-million-euro ($262.32-million) release clause.
PSG tweeted a picture of Neymar's shirt and shorts from the dressing room, saying "Everything is in place #neymarJrpremiere".
Neymar was not allowed to play at home against Amiens last weekend because the French federation had not received his transfer certificate from their Spanish counterparts.

OS ANGELES-Fourth-seeded American Steve Johnson shook off cramps and fought his way to a 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7/5) over Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci in the Houston ATP final on Sunday.
Johnson, who arrived in Houston after a US Davis Cup tie in Australia, won his second career ATP title, and his first on home soil. "To win on US soil and win when you're not feeling great is a testament to my willpower and competitiveness," he said. "My body has just physically run out of gas after this week. Coming in from Australia kind of put me behind the eight ball and then the nerves of trying to close out the final, a lot of factors go into cramping. I was very fortunate to get out of that."
Eighth-seeded Bellucci was vying to become the first player since 2004 to win five three-set matches en route to an ATP singles title. "I wasn't cramping, but I was so tired that I couldn't think to win the match," he said. "He was a little bit worse than me (physically), but he was playing unbelievably."
But Johnson was quickly down in the third set, surrendering an opening service game that included back-to-back double faults. As Johnson's legs began to cramp as he trailed 4-2, it appeared the American was on his way out. In a bid to keep the points short Johnson loaded up his forehands. He gave himself a break chance with a passing winner and broke Bellucci on his way to levelling the set at 4-4.
Although the cramps intensified, Johnson held on to force the tiebreaker in which he built a 6/3 lead. Bellucci saved two match points before Johnson sealed the win. "I'm a little bit sad because I think I could have won," Bellucci said. "But I'm happy to make another final."
Health startups are pulling in money in Southeast Asia. A week after wellness-focused insurance brokerage CXA drew $25 million from investors, fellow Singapore-based startup mClinica has announced a $6.3 million Series A raise.
mClinica was founded in 2012 and its mission is to provide healthcare data in Southeast Asia, much like Nielsen and other traditional analyst houses, through an alliance with pharmaceutical stores on the ground.
Founder and CEO Farouk Meralli explained in an interview that the region's currently lacks data because it is dominated by small ‘mom and pop' style stores. That, he said, leaves pharma companies wanting to know more about their business, supply chain and the competitive landscape, while governments and NGOs are deprived of important data that can shape policy or detect outbreaks.
“In U.S. or UK, the consumer healthcare space is dominated by chains like Walgreens or Boots, but here it is thousands of independent pharmacies, it's crazy,” Meralli told TechCrunch, explaining that this severely inhibits market understanding.
Mobile devices and the internet present an opportunity to change things. Meralli is aiming to make a difference by helping track how medicines are being used in Southeast Asia with more clarity than ever. Today, the mClinica service is present in three countries — the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam — where it offers a platform for local pharmacies to help them make sense of their business. In that respect, it feels a lot like blend between Practo, the Indian startup that connects doctors with patients and is backed by Tencent, and shopping loyalty service Snapcart in Indonesia.
First and foremost, mClinica tracks what medicines are being prescribed, dispensed and bought in small stories, which Meralli said account for 97 percent of all pharmacies in Indonesia, for example. The company's app is for pharmacy stores, not consumers, and it provides them with a loyalty/discount program for customers, news from the industry and other tools to manage their business.
There's no consumer app, customers simply provide their mobile number once (to register) and again at the counter for future purchases to claim loyalty points and discounts. Details are collected by the pharmacy and the system means that it doesn't matter which store a customer shops at, so long as it is on the mClinica platform, they get their discount and the data is captured, too. (Meralli said data is “desensitized” appropriately to protect individuals privacy.)
By providing incentives and an easy way to authenticate customers, mClinica has a pretty efficient data capture system that's built for a region where hundreds of millions remain offline and unbanked, despite smartphone sales growing on at a higher-than-global rate.
The data is then used to compile reports that can be sold to pharma companies wanting to learn the lay of the land in Southeast Asia, or provided to public sector players like governments and NGOs.

On the business side of things, Meralli is fairly coy with numbers at this point. He didn't say how many users it has authenticated, instead stating that his firm has a “potential reach” of 70 million patients through the more than 5,000 pharmacies it works with. Scale is the key to accurate and informative data and reports. The company plans to use its new funds to grow its reach using offline methods — advertising and feet on the street sales — alongside digital means such as Facebook to reach pharmacies.
Even at this point, though, some data is better than relative guesswork. That's very much the sales pitch for expansion. Meralli said he is aiming to expand to cover Malaysia and Thailand before the end of the year, while Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar are also on the radar.
“We can make a massive leap forward [and create] a national infrastructure in just a few months,” he said.
That's the idea to encourage governments to get on board, plus, he added, mClinica “tends to give a lot of this data for free” to public sector organizations to help shape policy and paint a picture of the here and now of a nation's health. Many emerging markets right now rely on censor data which can be patchy and up to seven years old in some cases.
“Currently, we lose visibility though the entire supply chain, so we're going to the last mile and filling in that data gap,” Meralli added.
Initially, the idea was conceived for massive markets like Brazil and India, but the Philippines was selected for an initial pilot following a request from a prospective customer. Meralli said his team is heads-down focused on Southeast Asia right now, but he did concede that there is interest from other parties keen to explore expansion to other parts of the world. He didn't indicate whether the company would pursue this in 2017.
mClinica certainly has a global feel to the investor side of its business. This new round was led by Unitus Impact in Silicon Valley with participation from London-based Global Innovation Fund, Indonesia's MDI Ventures and Endeavor. Previous investors 500 Startups, IMJ Investment Partners and Kickstart Ventures — which raised a 2014 seed round for the startup — also took part.
