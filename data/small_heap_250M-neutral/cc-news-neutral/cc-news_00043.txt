CLEVELAND (AP) — The suspect in the random killing of a retiree posted on Facebook made their living mentoring teens in Cleveland, but their life appeared to be unraveling under the weight of gambling debts and trouble with their girlfriend.
Rambling videos they shared showed their despair, saying they were out of options and wanted to kill as many innocent people as they could.
While authorities have not found any evidence that they killed anyone else, the manhunt for Steve Stephens stretched into a third day on Tuesday and far beyond the neighborhood where police said they shot a 74-year-old man who was picking up aluminum cans on Sunday after spending Easter with some of their children.
Stephens, 37, could be anywhere, authorities said, calling it a nationwide search. A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to their capture and prosecution.
Stephens posted a video of themselves killing Robert Godwin Sr., a former foundry worker who had 10 children, police said. In it, they said, “I snapped, I just snapped.” But police would not speculate on what was behind it.
“Only Steve knows that,” Williams said.
In the video, Stephens told Godwin a woman's name and said, “She's the reason that this is about to happen to you.” Godwin did not seem to recognize the name.
The woman Stephens spoke of, Joy Lane, said in a text message to CBS that “we had been in a relationship for several years. I am sorry that all of this has happened.”
They also said Stephens was “a nice guy” who was good to them and their children.
Stephens filed for bankruptcy two years ago despite holding down a job as a counselor helping young people develop job skills and find employment. The behavioral health agency where they worked said an extensive background check before they were hired turned up nothing worrisome.
In one video posted on Facebook, Stephens said that they gambled away everything and that they and their girlfriend had planned to marry but did not, without saying why. They blamed them for what was about to happen.
Some friends said they knew about their gambling. But the videos showed a man they did not recognize.
Alexis Lee, who saw Stephens last week, said their childhood friend always seemed respectful and got along with everybody.
“He never ever told me they had problems or issues. It was always good things,” Lee said. “He was always just so happy and cool, calm, collected, like, that's why it's so shocking.”
Other neighbors said they were quiet as a kid and intelligent, recalling how they went to college and got a master's degree.
“He was just a no problem person at all, compared to a lot of people,” said Cynthia Coley, a former neighbor.
In one video in which they blamed their girlfriend, Stephens said they woke up last week and “couldn't take it anymore.”
Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite their claim on Facebook that they killed over a dozen people.
On Monday evening, Facebook announced that it was launching a review for reporting harmful content following the killing. The company said that Stephens posted a video of themselves announcing their intent to commit murder, then two minutes later posted another video of themselves shooting and killing Godwin. A few minutes after that, they went live and confessed.
The company said it disabled Stephen's account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the video of the fatal shooting and two hours after receiving any report.
“In this case we did not receive a report about the first video, and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted,” said Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice president of global operations. “We received reports about the third video, containing the man's live confession, only after it had ended.”
Officers searched dozens of places around Cleveland without finding Stephens or any other victims before expanding the manhunt. Detectives spoke with the suspect on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade them to surrender, police said.
Law enforcement officials said their cellphone was last tracked Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Cleveland. Police in Philadelphia said eight elementary schools and a high school were locked down Monday while they investigated reported sightings but found nothing.

Now this is more like it. The final judge for Let It Shine has been announced, and it's only Robbie Williams.
Not only that, but we'll also be seeing an (almost) complete Take That line-up, as Robbie joins Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald for a reunion performance on the final of the BBC1 show.
Although the BBC are so far staying tight-lipped about what song they will be singing, we are promised it will be "of one of the band's biggest hits". That doesn't really narrow it down, mind.
Sadly there's still no Jason Orange to make it a full set. Orange quit the band in 2014 - despite insisting that there had been "no fallings out" with their bandmates.
Of being on the show for one week only, Williams said: "I'm looking forward to being back with Gary, Mark and Howard on Let It Shine and am excited to be a guest judge for the very special final.” What a shame Robbie tribe act Dan Budd didn't make it this far through the competition, eh?
There have been three permanent judges throughout Let It Shine: Gary Barlow, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp.
The fourth chair has been something of a hotseat, with Glee and West End star Amber Riley on the panel for round one, Lulu taking to the desk for the second round and US chat show host Ricki Lake and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts booked for the first and second live shows respectively.
Three bands will make it through to the final and they will each perform twice in front of the judges but it's the viewers at home who will ultimately decide the winners.
The five boys who eventually win will take their a place in The Band - Gary Barlow's touring theatre production that will feature the music of Take That.

Mississippi legislators have advanced one bill to strengthen the state's constitutionally weak governor but killed another.
Senators on Monday reconsidered and killed a bill to let the governor, rather than a board, appoint the director of the state Department of Mental Health.
Senate Bill 2567 passed the Senate last week but was put on hold. Senators voted not to release the bill to the House before a Monday deadline, and that killed it.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, said physicians' and psychiatrists' groups supported the proposed change.
“This bill is about fiscal management, increased accountability,” Clarke said.
But Democratic Sen. Hob Bryan of Amory argued that the bill had not been fully examined.
“Once again, there's just a rabbit pulled out of a hat, and we are told it's our duty to go vote,” Bryan said.
The House on Monday sent the Senate a bill that says dozens of occupational licensing boards would have to send proposed regulations to the governor, who could approve, modify or veto them. These boards regulate dentists, architects, barbers and people in many other occupations or professions.
House Bill 1425 passed last week and was put on hold. Representatives voted by a wide margin Friday to keep the bill in limbo after Republican Rep. Toby Barker of Hattiesburg implored their colleagues to kill it. Barker made a second appeal Monday, saying the change could give special interests undue influence and could even lead to corruption through campaign contributions.
“It's not about this governor, who I think we all kind of like,” Barker said. “It's about the next governor and the governor after that.”
Despite Barker's speech, the House voted 63-55 Monday to release the bill to the Senate for more debate.
House Bill 1425 was written in response to a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling dealing with the power of the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners. The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint saying the board, made up mostly of dentists, had violated antitrust law by blocking non-dentists from offering teeth whitening services. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court's ruling that sided with the commission.
Why has the casting of David Gyasi and Hakeem Kae-Kazim as Achilles and Zeus proved so controversial?
Picture this: to celebrate a hundred years since the birth of Nelson Mandela this July, the BBC commissions an eight-part biopic to celebrate the life and times of the beloved anti-apartheid revolutionary. Its choice of lead? Colin Firth.

That isn't happening. However, you can see its equivalent on Troy: Fall of a City – well, at least according to furious Twitter commenters berating the BBC for casting black actors to play Achilles and Zeus.
“Ridiculous [that] Zeus, Achilles and Patriculus [are] all of African descent,” read one message. “Imagine the reaction if they [had] done a doc about Nelson Mandela and cast Colin Firth”. Another Twitter message replying to star David Gyasi said they were part of “the racist rewriting of the Greek culture and mythology”.
Meanwhile in a video posted on YouTube, a user claimed that the BBC was “blackwashing” Greek myth to “deprive Europeans of their culture and history to make them more susceptible to their globalist aims”.
This is just a taste of the comments surrounding the BBC drama following the debuts of David Gyasi and Hakeem Kae-Kazim.
Why are people so angry about the BBC's decision? Is there any basis to the ‘blackwashing' conspiracy?
In short: absolutely not. In a bit longer: we chatted with Tim Whitmarsh, Professor of Greek Culture at the University of Cambridge, to answer any questions you might have on the ethnicity of Troy – starting with the big one…
Were some ancient Greeks black?
“Our best estimate is that the Greeks would be a spectrum of hair colours and skin types in antiquity. I don't think there's any reason to doubt they were Mediterranean in skin type (lighter than some and darker than other Europeans), with a fair amount of inter-mixing,” says Whitmarsh.
Not only were the historical Greeks unlikely to be uniformly pale-skinned, but their world was also home to ‘Ethiopians', a vague term for dark-skinned North Africans. They are mentioned in Aethiopis, the story after Homer's Iliad (the epic poems retelling the battle of Troy), where Memnon of Ethiopia joins the fighting.
Love. Rage. War. Gods.
Get ready for the epic eight-part tale of #Troy: Fall of a City. Starts Saturday 17th February at 9.10pm on @BBCOne. pic.twitter.com/04Ff2S6Xiv — BBC One (@BBCOne) February 16, 2018
But here's the thing: the question of whether ‘black people' lived in Ancient Greece is itself flawed. The Greek world – one they saw as a circular disk surrounded by a constantly moving stream of ocean – was far more ‘fluid' than our own.
“There was a lot of travel in that period – people were moving from Egypt to Greece, east to west. It was a world without borders, without national states. It was all interconnected,” says Whitmarsh.
This flux was ethnic as well as geographic, according to Whitmarsh: “The Greeks didn't carve up the world into black and white. They didn't see themselves in those terms. All of our categories – black and white, for instance – are formed by a very modern set of historical circumstance.”
Whitmarsh isn't alone in this argument, either. Here's what Dr Rachel Mairs, Associate Professor of Classical and Near Eastern Studies at the University of Reading, said when we put the question to her: “I'm delighted that the BBC have gone for a more diverse cast. Modern racial categories aren't always helpful in looking at the ancient world, but there were certainly people we today might think of as both ‘black' and ‘white' in the ancient Mediterranean, and many variations of colour and identity in between”
In Troy: Fall of a City, this spectrum of skin colours isn't really portrayed. From Bella Dayne's Helen of Troy to Jonas Armstrong's Menelaus, the majority of the cast is pale-skinned.
“We don't definitely know what ancient Greeks would look like, but they sure as hell wouldn't look like the ‘white' actors we normally see either,” says Whitmarsh. “And that's the real issue here: anyone who says it's inauthentic to cast Achilles as black has to explain why it's authentic to use an Australian actor [Louis Hunter, who plays Paris] speaking in English to represent an ancient Greek hero. That seems, to me, another powerful form of appropriation and an equally misleading depiction.”
But doesn't Homer say Achilles is white in the Iliad?
No offense to David Gyasi. Good actor… but… This is Achilles? The blonde haired Achilles as described by homer? Are you serious @netflix @BBC ?? Have you even read the iliad? No wonder your imdb rating in 1.2/10.#TroyFallOfACity #Αχιλλέας #hellas #achilles #DoubleStandards pic.twitter.com/PPESSnfey2 — Phillip P (@fghtrpltf16) January 4, 2018
Not exactly. In the Iliad, Homer describes Achilles as having blonde hair – and that's only a rough translation. The actual term they use, xanthē, could mean ‘golden' or a variety of words – “Greek colour terms are quite strange and don't map out well on ours,” says Whitmarsh.
Difficult translations aside, Homer's work don't give us the full story of Troy. The Iliad only covers a few days in the last weeks of the war and the Odyssey deals with the aftermath of the fighting.
The definitive source on the battle? Doesn't exist. If you want to tell the story you have to rely on scraps of poems, oral history or vase paintings – the myth is malleable.
“Homer's poems are merely one version and the Greeks themselves understood the story could change,” explains Whitmarsh. “There's never been an authentic retelling of the Iliad and the Odyssey – they've always been fluid texts. They're not designed to be set in stone and it's not blasphemous to change them.
“All the way through antiquity people updated it, changed the angle and brought in people that weren't in Homer's original. For instance, the Romans got interested in the story because they thought they were the descendants of the Trojans. And in their version, [spoilers ahead] the Trojans win the war instead of losing.”
Even if you ignore the ever-changing nature of myth and still think it would be inaccurate for Gyasi to play Achilles, then how about this: at one point Homer describes Odysseus – played by Joseph Mawle in Fall of a City and Sean Bean in the 2004 Troy film – as dark-skinned.
“In the Odyssey, Odysseus is said to be ‘black-skinned and woolly-haired' – at one point we're told that Athena makes them beautiful by restoring their natural black skin colour [see, Odyssey 16.175],” says Whitmarsh.
“Modern readers will think, ‘Is they black or not?' It's an interesting question, but it's probably the wrong one. Homer isn't trying to put Odysseus in a black or white category. It's not a race thing. He's not saying that Odysseus is in a group of people that are all united by a skin colour.”
Like Achilles' ‘blonde' hair, it's difficult for modern readers to understand exactly what Homer meant by Odysseus's ‘black' skin. However, it's telling that while some viewers have been quick to argue that a black actor could never play a blonde Achilles, nothing has been said about a white actor playing a ‘black-skinned' Odysseus. In the month before Fall of a City was released there were a number of tweets and YouTube comments expressing outrage at Gyasi's casting. Odysseus? Not a single person raised the issue.
What about Zeus?
Zeus, King of the Gods, is… well… a God. “And the thing about the Gods,” explains Whitmarsh, “is that when they reveal themselves to people they have to take on a different form.”
This form could be anything: a swan, a bull, an eagle, a shower of horny gold rain, or even that of actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim, as seen in Fall of a City.
So, why couldn't the show portray the Gods in their ‘true' form? Slightly problematic: Zeus's is a lightning bolt. And, as Semele – one of the few characters in Greek mythology to witness this form – found out, it's not too friendly: “She was immediately consumed by flames and was incinerated,” says Whitmarsh.
As Whitmarsh says: “Asking if a thunderbolt is a white thunderbolt or a black thunderbolt might be taking this too far.”
Why are the Greeks white in art then?
For a few reasons. Firstly, the ‘white' Greek marble statues that fill up our museums were actually originally painted different colours. The paint didn't survive the test of time: the marble did.
The second reason? That's much more interesting: it's the same reason that can explain why Jesus tends to be a European in Western people's minds, and why Cleopatra has been played by Elizabeth Taylor and Achilles by Brad Pitt.
“People tend to like the past to look like a mirror image of themselves,” says Whitmarsh. “Since the 18th and 19th century onwards there has been a ‘whitening' of the Greeks and Romans – an appropriation by European powers. For instance, the Germans in the 1800s were adamant that the Greeks were actually Germans who had wandered down the peninsula.”
As for British and American audiences, “The transatlantic slave trade made it so black and white are the categories in which we see people,” argues Whitmarsh. “The Greeks had a concept of people being different skin colours, but they wouldn't put black people on one side and white people on another.”
The slave trade drew a line between slavers and slaves, black and white. And to make sure they were on the ‘right' side of this dividing line, Europeans began to see themselves as ‘whiter'. This also meant depicting the Greeks – perceived as the ancestors of modern European civilisation – as white too.
To put it another way, we see the world through certain lenses. And that's not necessarily a bad thing: they help to focus and make sense of everything. But occasionally we need to encounter something that makes us realise there's another way of seeing.

“At least the representation of Achilles and Zeus as ‘black' is going to shake up people a bit,” says Whitmarsh. “There's value disrupting the narrative in this way and making us think again what people would look like.”
COPENHAGEN — Fire authorities in Denmark have banned the use of open fires across the country because of dry forests and grass as Scandinavia sees an unusual long stretch of very warm weather.
The ban, which entered into force Wednesday, came after weeks with little rain. Denmark's Meteorological Institute has said this year saw the warmest June in 26 years. Institute spokesperson Mikael Scharling said no precipitation was in sight.
The institute recorded an average of 15 degrees Celcius (59 F) for May, breaking a previous record of 13.8 C (56.8 F) for May from 1889.
Similar fire risk warnings have been made in southern parts of Sweden and Norway.
The Amazon Effect: Aetna-CVS Deal Shows Retail Giant's Might
The Amazon effect has rocked bricks-and-mortar retail. Now it's moving in on the health care market.
Analysts say CVS Health Corp.'s $69 billion bid for Aetna Inc., marking the first time a large pharmacy chain has merged with a major health insurer, is a direct result of Amazon's plan to enter the prescription drug market.
"Everything Amazon does is disruptive; sometimes it's just not clear how," said Jason Bloomberg, CEO of Intellyx, a digital transformation consultant business.
The online retail giant made pharmacy chains nervous in October when it was revealed that Amazon had secured licenses to distribute prescription medicines in 12 states. CVS is believed to be making the Aetna deal to withstand a potential challenge from Amazon by creating a "one-stop shop" where consumers can get prescriptions, insurance coverage and treatment in one location.
By forcing CVS into the largest merger announced this year, Amazon is showing its might, analysts said. But they are unsure how Amazon will disrupt the health care sector -- perhaps by acquiring a pharmaceutical manufacturer or by launching its own pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM.
Mr. Bloomberg said they wouldn't be surprised if patients one day are treated at Amazon hospitals.
"Amazon could tackle this from a couple of different ways," said Mark Coker, CEO of e-book distributor Smashwords, who has studied Amazon's business practices for many years.
Amazon has a penchant for upending even the most static industries, and unwary competitors have paid the price. About a decade ago, there were 37,500 bookstores in the U.S. Today, that number is about 22,000. When reports of Amazon launching an online real estate service surfaced this summer, online real estate giant Zillow's stock fell by 5 percent.
Now Amazon appears to have its sights directly on the $3.2 trillion health care market, which accounts for 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Amazon's health care dreams appear to extend beyond selling prescription medicines. The Seattle-based company has invested heavily in much health care markets, such as medical device sales and cloud information storage services.
Health care would be the next logical move for the retail behemoth, analysts said. Amazon broke into the grocery industry in July with the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods.
Mr. Coker said they believe Amazon's most likely move would be acquiring a drugmaker. Reports surfaced last week that Amazon had "high level" meetings with Mylan and Sandoz, two generic drug manufacturers, but it is not clear what those talks were about.
"By acquiring a drug company, they can eliminate the middleman and sell those drugs directly with the licenses they are getting," Mr. Coker said. "Amazon will look at the entire industry supply chain and every single cost and ask how it can do it more efficiently."
On Sunday, CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain, announced it was making a $69 billion offer for Aetna, the third-largest health insurer. The mammoth acquisition would pair a company that runs more than 9,700 drugstores and 1,100 walk-in clinics with an insurer covering about 22 million people.
CVS Health Corp. is also one of the nation's biggest pharmacy benefit managers, processing more than 1 billion prescriptions a year for insurance companies, including Aetna.
Buyer's Remorse?
If Amazon does acquire a pharmaceutical company, it could cause buyer's remorse for CVS, Mr. Coker said. The retail pharmacy chain intends to finance the transaction with $45 billion in debt.
"This Aetna deal could be boneheaded if CVS's goal is to shore up its defenses against an inevitable entry against Amazon into the market," they said. "Health insurers are part of why drugs are so expensive. Amazon approaches markets by eliminating the middleman. It seems that CVS is making a bet that health insurers are going to continue to be to dominate intermediary between a consumer and drugmaker."
Investors also appear to have doubts about how much the drugstore chain was willing to pay for Aetna: CVS Health Corp.'s stock fell $3.41, or nearly 5 percent, to $71.69 on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Dow Jones index was up strongly for most of the day.
Joel Espelien, a senior research analyst at The Diffusion Group, agreed that Amazon will put pressure on CVS and Aetna after the deal is completed.
"CVS didn't want to just be a distributor, so it bought a health plan," they said. "But disruption can change how business is done in that industry. Amazon will force CVS and Aetna to dramatically up their game."
Even if Amazon's first step in the health care industry is offering prescriptions through its website, Mr. Espelien said, that could create fierce competition in the sector. They predict prescriptions will be delivered via drones within minutes along with other supply advantages that only Amazon can offer.
"It doesn't mean CVS can't compete with Amazon, but if they can't match what Amazon is doing, they will be in serious trouble," they said.
The time is right for Amazon to enter the health care industry because of its proven ability to reduce costs in an industry that has long struggled to keep expenses down and prices competitive.
"When I look at a retail pharmacy, it strikes me as fairly inefficient," Mr. Coker said. "They have to maintain that expensive floor space, expensive pharmacist, cash register. Maybe you can achieve greater economies of scale by moving that to a call center in India like Amazon did with the book industry."

Hover and Drop: Amazon Drones May Deliver Your Box from 25 Feet
It's not that drones get tired. It's just that if they're delivering your box of cat food and low-rise socks, dropping down to put them on your patio, and then flying back up for the next delivery takes power they need to conserve.
Better to just hover over your home and drop the box, a new patent from Amazon proposes.
No need to cover your head: the Seattle e-commerce giant has that -- and the delivery box full of your precious items -- covered, at least in theory.
Amazon on Tuesday received a patent for cushioning packages with inflatable airbags so they can be dropped from as high as 25 feet.
The drone could inflate the "airlift package protection airbag" with a gas canister or even just from the downdraft from the aircraft's propellers while in transit or "near a drop location, such as a backyard or patio of a residential dwelling," the patent said.
This patent, like at least two others Amazon has received, also envisions the possibility of catastrophic mid-air failure. To minimize damage to the drone and anything or anyone on the ground, the airbag for the package could also wrap around part of the drone, and be inflated automatically if the aircraft loses power or flies out of control, according to the patent.
Should you be, say, barbecuing on your patio when your delivery drone appears, there's no reason to worry, but if you want your package, you'll need to get out of the way -- and take your bottles of beer with you -- so it can fall from the sky. The drone could use cameras and other sensors to make sure the "drop zone" is empty of people, animals and "fragile objects," and then decline to make the delivery till all is clear, according to the patent.
A drone could even be constructed in such a way that it could let loose a package that would travel "partially horizontally" to land on "an elevated balcony of a tall building."
The airbag Amazon envisions would deflate slightly upon impact when a package hits the ground to cushion the landing and protect a package's contents.
Energy consumption is an important consideration for drones, which "may conserve energy if they minimize changes in altitude," the patent application says in explaining why dropping packages from the sky makes sense.
Height range for the release of packages from a drone would range from five to 25 feet, "depending on the size and weight of the package."
Amazon, keenly focused on automation and cheap, efficient delivery of products, has obtained dozens of drone-related patents in recent years. But it remains to be seen whether this latest one, or any of the others, will lead to technology used in drone deliveries.

Court rules against Tele on Rush case. Actor Geoffrey Rush has had a win in their defamation case against the Daily Telegraph over a front page story alleging inappropriate behaviour during their stint in the Sydney Theatre Company's production of King Lear. In a judgement delivered this morning, Federal Court Justice Michael Wigney ruled that Nationwide News, the Tele's parent company, could not argue the truth defence because there was insufficient detail in its defence, and they also ruled out a significant part of its qualified privilege argument. Nationwide News' subpoena for the Sydney Theatre Company was set aside, with the judgement calling it a “fishing” expedition.

3 dead, 1 injured as 4-storey building collapses in Anambra
By Vincent Ujumadu
Awka—THREE persons were feared dead and one injured when a four-storey building, nearing completion, collapsed at Oko in Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State in the early hours of yesterday.
The bodies have been deposited in a mortuary, while the injured person, said to be a student of the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, is currently receiving treatment in a private hospital in the area.
The collapsed building was said to be serving as a private hostel accommodation for the students of the polytechnic.
It was gathered that the rear end of the building had had collapsed earlier in the afternoon of Tuesday, shortly after a downpour. But despite that, the victims still went to sleep in the house.
An eyewitness said: “I heard one of the workers warning others not to sleep in the building since a section of it collapsed. But they refused. They told them that nothing would happen.
“They even tried to persuade them to go in with them which they initially did, but later came out of the building.”
The cause of the building collapse could not be ascertained at press time, but some people said it might not be unconnected to the use of inferior building materials.
The owner of the building and the contractor could not be reached, as residents of the area denied knowledge of their identities.

BOOM! Gene Simmons SLAMS Trump Haters – Gives Them The Perfect Advice!
There are a lot of celebrities wailing and gnashing their teeth over Donald Trump's upcoming inauguration. They've refused to perform at the ceremony, are outspoken in their animosity towards him, and have continued to mourn Hillary Clinton's loser of a campaign. But Gene Simmons, notorious frontman of rock band KISS, has a brutal message for the liberal whiners out there.
Simmons appeared on “Fox & Friends” and told people that they need to get over their hatred for Trump. “Let's not talk politics — let's talk the real important issue,” they said. “He's a good father. There are no drugs, there's no booze, there's no craziness going on.”
“We should all just take a deep breath and get on with our lives. We should be blessing this hallowed ground called America everyday. It's going to be great. It's going to be fine.” Trump is a notorious teetotaler, having allegedly never drunk alcohol or done any drugs… whereas Obama was an open drug user, including marijuana and cocaine.
In addition to telling everyone to calm down about Trump's presidency, Simmons set a few rumors straight. It has been claimed that KISS was asked to perform at Trump's inauguration, but declined, like so many other celebrities did. Simmons clarified that, in actuality, KISS was not asked to perform… and it doesn't bother him, either. “Why does anybody give a squat what a guy in a band thinks about or anything like that?” they asked. “The last thing I want to do is ask President Obama what they think about Led Zeppelin.”
Watch the full interview below:
More celebrities really should follow Simmons' lead here. It's one thing to have and express political opinions, but at some point, they really need to just shut their mouths and let it go. All they're doing is making themselves look ignorant and furthering divisions in the country. As others have said before, these people really need to learn how to just shut up and sing.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers are easing linebacker Reuben Foster back into the system after they missed the start of the off-season program while dealing with a domestic violence case that was eventually dropped.
Foster was not allowed to participate in the off-season program until a judge ruled last week that they wouldn't have to stand trial on domestic violence charges. The judge determined there was no evidence that Foster ever hit their ex-girlfriend.
Foster rejoined the Niners last Thursday but has been held out of team drills as they get back up to speed. They took part in individual drills during organized team activities but spent the time during team drills doing conditioning or watching teammates.
Defensive co-ordinator Robert Salah said there's no rush to get Foster back into team drills but added it won't take long for Foster to get back up to speed.

Yesterday morning, chairperson of the American Samoa chapter of the Red Cross, Vaito'a Hans Langkilde was presented a check of $1,898 by members of the National Honor Society at Manumalo Academy, to help with relief efforts for the victims of Hurricane Irma, the strongest hurricane worldwide in 2017 — in terms of wind speed.
The money was collected from students who gave — on their own — their lunch money and allowance.
NHS president Aitulagi Alofa, in their brief remarks, explained how the funds were collected and the reason behind the donation. They said it was a collaborative effort that was spearheaded by the NHS members and it is their hope the money will be put to good use, by those who need it.
Vaito'a expressed their gratitude for the gift, thanking the student body, the faculty and staff, the National Honor Society, as well as school director Papalii Laulii Alofa for the generous donation.
The Red Cross chair told Samoa News yesterday that the money will be added to the funds collected from other Disaster Relief fundraisers — a radiothon and telethon set for Oct. 28th — as well as whatever is received from solicitation letters already sent out to various government departments and agencies, the private sector, and community organizations.
All monies raised will be forwarded to the National Red Cross who will determine where and how the money will be disbursed.
Referring to Manumalo's donation, Vaito'a said they are 'shocked' and 'amazed' at how generous the students were, how they were able to raise such a huge amount of money in such a short time.
"It's just unbelievable how these kids have responded," they said.
As of September 30, 2017, at least 132 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Irma.

Russell Lewis, who created the series and has written every episode, will return for screenwriting duties, with stars Shaun Evans and Roger Allam also reprising their roles of DS Endeavour Morse and DCI Fred Thursday. The series will film later this year for broadcast in 2019.
However, a couple of familiar faces won't be returning for the new episodes, with actors Lewis Peek (who played DC George Fancy) and Dakota Blue Richards (WPC Trewlove) both bowing out after the series five finale.
“This is the end of Trewlove for now – Dakota told us they wanted to leave at the beginning of last year, so we planned series five to give them the arc with Fancy and build to their demise and their leaving,” executive producer Damien Timmer told RadioTimes.com, also confirming that “the very talented” Peek's role was only ever supposed to last one year.
“But the door is always open for return appearances!” Timmer added.
When I first started on @EndeavourTV three years ago, I couldn't have anticipated the immense love I would feel for everybody involved. Thank you for being talented colleagues, wonderful friends and a beautiful family, you are all wonderful. Goodbye Trewlove 💋 pic.twitter.com/qPCwsGTMLB — Dakota Blue Richards (@DakotaBlueR) March 11, 2018
Endeavour is produced by Mammoth Screen for ITV, and also stars Anton Lesser, Sean Rigby, Abigail Thaw, James Bradshaw, Sara Vickers and Caroline O'Neill.

Saraki: CCT judgment victory for democracy – Senators
Abuja – Deputy Leader of the Senate, Sen. Bala Ibn N'Allah, said victory of President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, at the Code of Conduct Tribunal(CCT) was victory for democracy.
They said Abuja it was obvious that the case against Saraki was only a distraction to governance.
The CCT on Wednesday ruled that Saraki had no case to answer in the 18-count charge against them over allegations of false declaration of assets.
“The case was diversionary and unhelpful to the government of the day and now, they have been vindicated.
“Those who erroneously believed that they can mislead the government into doing a wrong thing should know that they have not been helpful to the government,'' they said.
Similarly, Chief Whip of the Senate, Sen. Olusola Adeyeye, said that the judgement indicated that the judiciary was independent.
According to him, what this portends for democracy is that there is rule of law and that the judiciary is independent.
“It shows that the judiciary does not act based on what the executive wants or based on what the legislature wants.
“Everybody goes to court to make a case. If you make your case, you win; if you don't, you lose.
“In this case the Federal Government failed to make its case and it has lost.
“The case went to court. If they had been found guilty, the moral burden will be on them to go to the Court of Appeal or to resign from the office, but now they have won and the case is closed,'' Adeyeye said.
The lawmaker said that with the judgement, Saraki would settle fully to legislative activities, observing that the case exerted much pressure on him.
Sen. Bukar Ibrahim (APC-Yobe) congratulated th senate president for the victory, and said that it was success for the justice system in the country.
“It's my pleasure as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and an admirer of the President of the Senate to congratulate them over their success in the CCT case.
“It is success for justice and rule. It is not about Saraki, but it is about justice for rule of law.
“Judgment has now been passed for future cases,'' they said.

MANASSAS, Va. AXXUME LLC developed a new cable management box that will take your cable management to a new level. With a built-in wall mountable surge protector, the Pluggable Cable Management Box was engineered to be plugged into a standard wall outlet without drilling holes.
Founder Xung Ngo came up with the idea when they were renovating their home office. With two babies, it was important to tidy up the cables and adapters that were on the floor. They and their wife started shopping for a cable management box and a surge protector for the box. All they found were the typical boxes that sit on the floor. Furthermore, the surge protector doubled the cost and added one more cable to deal with. That became their "AHA! moment".
The Pluggable Cable Management Box was engineered to easily mount onto a wall with only a single screwdriver. Just plug it into a standard American (Type B) wall outlet and tighten the included 2-inch screw. The ETL certified surge protector with an excellent protection rating of 1080 Joules will turn on.
The Pluggable Cable Management Box was designed to look cool and stay cool. Ventilation holes fill the back of the box with a stylish herringbone pattern. There are large cable holes in all sides of the box. The cover consists of a transparent lightning bolt with 4 different colors to choose from; black, blue, red, and green.
The box also has plenty of space to contain up to six cables/adapters. It is large enough to hold a couple of those big laptop adapters.
Cable management is about being neat and safe. Ngo concluded: "The Pluggable Cable Management Box went beyond that and made it stylish, space efficient, and easy to use. Ultimately, the total cost ($22 at kickstarter!) will be cheaper than the competition. This is the best way to organize home office cables."

PITTSBURGH — It was a familiar feeling for Terrell Suggs and the Baltimore Ravens.
The Pittsburgh Steelers, in dramatic fashion, clinched the AFC North title for the second consecutive season at home against their rivals. This time, Chris Boswell kicked a 46-yard field goal with 42 seconds to play for a 39-38 comeback win against the Ravens on Sunday night.
The result was similar to a prime-time game played last Christmas when Antonio Brown's game-winning touchdown with nine seconds left carried the Steelers to victory.
“This one hurts,” Suggs said. “We lose to them the same way we did last year. … We've got to get over it.”
Baltimore has won four of the last six games in Pittsburgh, but the lone losses have come in the last two years. The Steelers, who have won eight straight since a 3-2 start, clinched their third AFC North championship in four years.
Meanwhile, the Ravens (7-6), still in the thick of the AFC playoff race, entered playing their best football of the season. They were riding a three-game winning streak and had won four of five. They scored a season-high 44 points a week earlier and put up 38 more on Sunday, but it wasn't enough against Ben Roethlisberger, Brown and the Steelers.
“We like for it to be on us instead of the offence, and defensively we feel like we let the offence down,” Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey said.
Baltimore led 38-36 when Pittsburgh started its final possession on its own 17-yard line with 2:25 to play. Suggs and safety Tony Jefferson combined for a sack on first down, but Pittsburgh later converted a third-and-13 when Roethlisberger found tight end Jesse James for 16 yards.
Roethlisberger later connected with Brown for 34 yards, eventually setting up Boswell's winning kick for the emotional Steelers, playing in honour of injured teammate Ryan Shazier, who sustained a serious spinal cord injury last week at Cincinnati.
Brown finished with 11 receptions for 213 yards, while Roethlisberger was 44 of 66 for 506 yards with touchdown passes to Le'Veon Bell and Roosevelt Nix.
“(Roethlisberger) won the Super Bowl two times and played in three, so he's definitely a premier quarterback,” Suggs said. “We've got to be better.”
Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco went 20 of 35 for 269 yards with touchdown tosses to Chris Moore and Patrick Ricard, along with an interception. Alex Collins rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown, and Javorius Allen also scored twice for the Ravens, who are vying for their seventh playoff berth in 10 seasons.
“We just have to swallow this one, let it go and wait for the next three games,” linebacker C.J. Mosley said. “We're still in it. We just have to make sure that we handle our business so we can try to get back ultimately for the playoffs.”
The Steelers accumulated 144 yards of total offence and scored a pair of touchdowns on their first two series, racing to an early 14-0 lead. But the Ravens recovered, outscoring Pittsburgh 31-6 — including 17-0 in the third quarter to build a 31-20 lead heading into the fourth.
The Steelers didn't punt once in the first half, but their first three drives of the second half totalled 21 yards and all ended with punts.
“We know that you can never take your foot off the gas when you're playing this team,” Baltimore safety Eric Weddle said. “We played outstanding in the third quarter, and then they just get on these runs that we can't dig ourselves out of. You can't do that against any team, let alone one of the best quarterbacks to ever do it.”
Roethlisberger led the Steelers to points on their last four possessions.
“We just didn't execute in the fourth quarter,” Suggs said. “This team is built to finish in the fourth quarter. We can't let it put a damper on our season.”

This story has been corrected with time left on the winning field goal.
BlackBerry Ltd. filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Nokia Oyj, demanding royalties on the Finnish company's mobile network products that use an industrywide technology standard.
Nokia's products including its Flexi Multiradio base stations, radio network controllers and Liquid Radio software are using technology covered by as many as 11 patents, BlackBerry said in a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.
The mobile network products and services are provided to companies including T-Mobile US Inc. and AT&T Inc. for their LTE networks, BlackBerry said in the complaint. “Nokia has persisted in encouraging the use” of the standard- compliant products without a license from BlackBerry, it said.
“BlackBerry seeks to obtain recompense for Nokia's unauthorized use of BlackBerry's patented technology,” the Waterloo, Canada-based company said in the complaint. BlackBerry didn't specify how much it's seeking.
Chief Executive Officer John Chen is working to find new ways to pull revenue out of BlackBerry's technology as smartphone sales head to zero. He's used acquisitions to add a suite of software products and negotiated licensing agreements to take advantage of the company's thick book of wireless technology patents.
Nokia is aware of the inventions because the company has cited some of the patents in some of its own patent applications, BlackBerry said.
Some of the patents in the case were previously owned by former telecommunications giant Nortel Networks Corp., and Nokia had at one point tried to buy them as part of a failed bid for Nortel's business in 2009, according to BlackBerry.
BlackBerry was part of a group called Rockstar Consortium that bought Nortel's patents out of bankruptcy for $4.5 billion in 2011. The patents were split up between the members of the group, which included Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
Since BlackBerry contends that patents cover essential elements of a mobile telecommunications standard known as 3GPP, it has pledged to license them on fair and reasonable terms. It doesn't seek any court order that would block use of the inventions.
The case is BlackBerry Ltd. v. Nokia Corp., 17-155, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington).
NEWARK, N.J. — Angel Delgado had 14 points and 13 rebounds, and No. 19 Seton Hall continued its impressive start to the season with a 90-67 victory over Virginia Commonwealth in the Never Forget Tribute Classic at the Prudential Center on Saturday.
Myles Powell added five of their 17 points in a game-breaking 13-1 first-half run, Desi Rodriguez had 17 and Khadeen Carrington scored 13 for the Pirates (8-1), who have won four straight since being beaten at the buzzer by Rhode Island on Thanksgiving. Michael Nzei added 14 points, 10 of them in garbage time in the second half.
The Pirates' run includes wins over current Texas Tech and Louisville, which was nationally ranked at the time.
Justin Tillman had 14 of their 20 points in the second half to lead VCU (5-5), which suffered its biggest loss of the season. Marcus Santos-Silva added 10 points for the Rams in their first meeting with the Pirates.
Seton Hall took control of the game shortly after Santos-Silva scored to cut the Pirates' lead to 16-12 with 12:20 left in the half.
The Pirates scored 13 of the next 14 points and totally shut down the Rams' offence. They would miss their next 11 shots and turn the ball over three times in falling behind 29-13. Powell started the run with a layup and added a 3-pointer after Carrington made two free throws. Delgado added a free throw, Carrington made two more and Rodriguez ended the spurt with a 3-pointer.
Seton Hall led 43-30 at halftime and was never challenged in the second half.
BIG PICTURE
VCU: Tillman has been carrying the Rams in recent games, and Seton Hall neutralized them in the first half, using power forwards Nzei and Ismael Sanogo to move them off the blocks.
Seton Hall: The Pirates are deep and talented. Their seniors — Delgado, Rodriguez and Carrington — are tough to stop and their defence makes them more impressive. VCU shot 38.5 per cent for the game, a season low. The Pirates shot 54.7 per cent.
UP NEXT
VCU hosts Bucknell next Saturday.
Seton Hall hosts St. Peter's at Walsh Gymnasium on campus in South Orange, N.J., on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve policymakers begin a two-day meeting to set interest rates.
FedEx Corp. reports quarterly results after the market closes.
Mr. Ruffin told them personally that they were going to get the job, showing up at their house very early in the morning, Mr. Edwards said. “I thought they were kidding,” they said.
But at their first show with the Temptations, and some later ones, they recalled, Mr. Ruffin showed up, leapt onstage and took the microphone from them to sing some of their older hits. In time they left Mr. Edwards alone.

Mr. Edwards joined the Temptations just as the group, under the direction of the producer and songwriter Norman Whitfield, was developing a grittier sound, one largely influenced by the psychedelic soul of Sly & the Family Stone and very different from their earlier songs, like “My Girl” and “Ain't Too Proud to Beg.”
The other members of the group — Eddie Kendricks, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin and Paul Williams — also sang lead, notably Mr. Kendricks. But Mr. Edwards was an essential part of the group's new sound on songs like “I Can't Get Next to You,” “Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)” and “Shakey Ground.”

Shortly after Mr. Edwards joined the group, the Temptations won their first Grammy, for the propulsive, upbeat “Cloud Nine” (1968); they won another for the funk anthem “Papa Was a Rollin' Stone” (1971). That song, like two other Temptations hits from that period — “I Can't Get Next to You” and “Just My Imagination” (on which Mr. Kendricks sang lead) — reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop singles chart.
The group received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2013.
Mr. Edwards left the Temptations in 1977 to pursue a solo career but rejoined them some years later. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, along with the five members from the Temptations' mid-1960s heyday.
Dennis Edwards was born to a preacher in Fairfield, Ala., on Feb. 3, 1943, and grew up in Detroit. As a teenager they sang in a gospel group and studied music at the Detroit Conservatory of Music before signing with Motown in the late 1960s.
After parting ways with the Temptations, Mr. Edwards remained with Motown as a solo artist. In 1984 they had an R&B hit with “Don't Look Any Further,” a duet with Siedah Garrett, which was later sampled for records featuring rappers like Rakim and Tupac Shakur.
In the 1990s, they toured with a group billed as Dennis Edwards and the Temptations, which led to a legal battle with Otis Williams about the use of the Temptations name. They settled by touring as the Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards.
Mr. Edwards's marriage to Ruth Pointer, one of the Pointer Sisters, ended in divorce. Their survivors include their wife, Brenda, with whom they lived in St. Louis; five daughters, Issa Pointer, Maya Peacock, Denise Edwards, Alison Turner and Erika Thomas; a son, Bernard Hubbard; and grandchildren.
A man will appear in court in connection with a letter sent to a force's most senior officer which caused concern for the safety of councillors and election candidates.

It follows letter which was sent to the Chief Constable of Durham, Mike Barton, which arrived at the force's HQ in Aykley Heads on February 28.
The force has said that within the letter, there were the names of 57 Labour Durham County Councillors.
The letter stated that “contracts” involving varying sums of money had been taken out on each of them, this also applied to any other prospective candidate standing for the Labour Party at the forthcoming May elections.
In the aftermath of the letter's arrival, Durham Constabulary said: "Inquiries are taking place to trace the person responsible for the letter and we are liaising with Durham County Council to offer reassurance to those named."
The man, who has not been named, has been bailed to attend Peterlee Magistrates' Court at 2pm on May 16.
Glo signs deal with Huawei for another submarine cable
Mobile giant Globacom is to build another multi-billion naira optic fibre submarine cable, which is expected to boost telecom services in Nigeria and the West African sub-region.
The contract for Glo 2 was signed yesterday between Globacom and Huawei at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.
Globacom's Regional Director, Technical, Mr. Sanjib Roy said the submarine cable would be built from Glo 1 landing station, Alpha Beach in Lagos. It will run along the coast to the southern part of Nigeria, they said, adding that it will provide capacity to offshore oil platforms and the communities as well as facilitate ultra-high capacity connection to the Southsouth and provide capacity to offshore oil platforms and the communities.
“Glo2 will be the first submarine cable in Nigeria to land outside Lagos as the five existing submarine cables only landed in Lagos. Glo 2 will have capacity of 12Terabit per second and will provide ultra-high speed connection to oil platforms and communities to empower data coverage and support Enterprise market growth in this part of Nigeria,” Mr. Roy said.
Glo 2 is expected to provide high speed internet connectivity, thus supporting the oil platforms to improve productivity by uploading data to remote oil platforms at the speed of light. Besides, it will provide economic as well as social empowerment for the communities in oil producing regions through a unique telecommunication service delivery.
According to him, Glo 2 is coming on board to support the growth of “Nigerian economy and allow oil communities reduce their operational expenditure by providing the first submarine optical fiber dedicated to oil platforms. “It is also designed for further expansion southwards to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, among others,” Roy added.
“The New submarine cable will be approximately 850 kilometres long and will be named Glo2. The cable will be integrated to Globacom's existing terrestrial Backbone Network to provide additional service redundancy, especially Abuja and other parts of the country.”
The cable will be divided into three pairs, with the first pair connecting Lagos directly to the Southern part of Nigeria while for redundancy and maintenance purposes it will also be connected to other parts of the country. The second pair will deliver high capacity to offshore oil stations and communities connected directly to Bus and will be equipped with eight switchable Branching Units. The third pair will deliver high capacity to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea and will be equipped with two switchable Branching Units.
Glo2 will support the Glo 1 international submarine cable built by Globacom in 2010. Glo 1, managed exclusively from Lagos to London, provides sufficient bandwidth for the West Africa sub-region. It is the only international submarine cable in Nigeria.
Huawei Nigeria Managing Director Mr. Li Beifang said: “Huawei is proud to partner with Globacom to build a revolutionary submarine cable, using innovative and leading technology. We believe the cable would bring a new era of digitalisation to Nigerian economy.”

George Papadopoulos, the young adviser who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the F.B.I., spent their time on the campaign trying to make overtures to Russia. In May 2016 they blabbed to an Australian diplomat that Moscow had political dirt on Hillary Clinton — information that proved true and was passed on to U.S. intelligence. This was the genesis of an F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation, as the Nunes memo itself admits.
And then there's Carter Page, the man at the center of the Nunes memo. By turns stupid (his Ph.D. thesis was twice rejected), self-important (he has compared themselves to Martin Luther King Jr.), and money-hungry (a suspected Russian agent who tried to recruit them in 2013 was recorded saying they “got hooked on Gazprom”), Page happens also to be highly sympathetic to the Putin regime. The Russian phrase for such characters is polezni durak — useful idiot. No wonder they were invited to give a commencement speech at a Russian university in the summer of 2016. That's how assets are cultivated in the world of intelligence.

Given the profile and their relative proximity to team Trump, it would have been professionally negligent of the F.B.I. not to keep tabs on him. Yet the bureau only obtained a surveillance warrant after Page had left the campaign and shortly before the election, and it insisted throughout the campaign that Trump was not a target of investigation. How that represents an affront to American democracy is anyone's guess.
The memo does seem to have uncovered conflicts of interest at the Justice Department, most seriously by then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, whose wife was working for Fusion GPS (and thus, by extension, the Clinton campaign) on opposition research on Trump. The memo also claims this relationship was not disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when the Justice Department applied for a surveillance warrant on Page.
That's a significant omission that already seems to have led to Ohr's demotion, according to Fox News. Then again, the Nunes memo has its own “material omissions,” according to an adamant and enraged F.B.I. Who do you find more credible: Nunes or F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray?
Nor does the Nunes memo claim that the information provided by the F.B.I. to the foreign intelligence court was, in fact, false. The closest it gets is a quote from ex-F.B.I. Director James Comey saying the Steele dossier was “salacious and unverified,” and then noting the anti-Trump bias of various officials involved in the case.
Come again? The Stormy Daniels story is also salacious and almost certainly accurate. “Unverified” is not a synonym for “untrue.” And since when do pundits who make a living from their opinions automatically equate “bias” with dishonesty?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The larger inanity here is the notion that the F.B.I. tried to throw the election to Clinton, when it was the Democrats who complained bitterly at the time that the opposite was true.
“It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, their top advisers and the Russian government,” then Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid angrily wrote James Comey in late October 2016. “The public has a right to know this information.”
Maybe so. But the G-Men kept quiet about their investigations, and Trump won the election. How that represents evidence of a sinister deep-state conspiracy is a question for morons to ponder. As for Devin Nunes, they have, to adapt an old line, produced evidence of a conspiracy so small. In modern parlance we'd call it a nothingburger, but the bun is missing, too.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) - A self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a pedestrian in suburban Phoenix in the first death involving a fully autonomous test vehicle - an accident that could have far-reaching consequences for the new technology.
The crash Sunday night in Tempe was the event many in the auto and technology industries were dreading but knew was inevitable.
Uber immediately suspended all road-testing of such autos in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. The testing has been going on for months as automakers and technology companies like the ride-hailing service compete to be the first with cars that operate on their own.
The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it hit 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as they were walking a bicycle outside the lines of a crosswalk, police said. They died at a hospital.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on their Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which makes recommendations for preventing crashes, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which can enact regulations, sent investigators.
Tempe police Sgt. Ronald Elcock said local authorities haven't drawn any conclusions about who is at fault but urged people to use crosswalks. They told reporters at a news conference Monday the Uber vehicle was traveling around 40 mph when it hit Helzberg immediately as they stepped on to the street.
Neither they nor the backup driver showed signs of impairment, they said.
The public's image of the vehicles will be defined by stories like the crash in Tempe, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies self-driving vehicles.
Although the Uber vehicle and its human backup could be at fault, it may turn out that there was nothing either could have done to stop the crash, they said.
Either way, the fatality could hurt the technology's image and lead to a push for more regulations at the state and federal levels, Smith said.
Autonomous vehicles with laser, radar and camera sensors and sophisticated computers have been billed as the way to reduce the more than 40,000 traffic deaths a year in the U.S. alone. Ninety-four percent of crashes are caused by human error, the government says.
Autonomous vehicles don't drive drunk, don't get sleepy and aren't easily distracted. But they do have faults.
"We should be concerned about automated driving," Smith said. "We should be terrified about human driving."
In 2016, the latest year available, more than 6,000 U.S. pedestrians were killed by vehicles.
The federal government has voluntary guidelines for companies that want to test autonomous vehicles, leaving much of the regulation up to states.
Many states, including Michigan and Arizona, have taken a largely hands-off approach, hoping to gain jobs from the new technology, while California and others have taken a harder line.
California is among states that require manufacturers to report any incidents during the testing phase. As of early March, the state's motor vehicle agency had received 59 such reports.
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey used light regulations to entice Uber to the state after the company had a shaky rollout of test cars in San Francisco. Arizona has no reporting requirements.
Hundreds of vehicles with automated driving systems have been on Arizona's roads.
Ducey's office expressed sympathy for Herzberg's family and said safety is the top priority.
The crash in Arizona isn't the first involving an Uber autonomous test vehicle. In March 2017, an Uber SUV flipped onto its side, also in Tempe. No serious injuries were reported, and the driver of the other car was cited for a violation.
Herzberg's death is the first involving an autonomous test vehicle but not the first in a car with some self-driving features. The driver of a Tesla Model S was killed in 2016 when their car, operating on its Autopilot system, crashed into a tractor-trailer in Florida.
The NTSB said that driver inattention was to blame but that design limitations with the system played a major role in the crash.
The U.S. Transportation Department is considering further voluntary guidelines that it says would help foster innovation. Proposals also are pending in Congress, including one that would stop states from regulating autonomous vehicles, Smith said.
Peter Kurdock, director of regulatory affairs for Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety in Washington, said the group sent a letter Monday to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao saying it is concerned about a lack of action and oversight by the department as autonomous vehicles are developed. That letter was planned before the crash.
Kurdock said the deadly accident should serve as a "startling reminder" to members of Congress that they need to "think through all the issues to put together the best bill they can to hopefully prevent more of these tragedies from occurring."

A spokesperson for a hospital in Virginia says 10 patients treated there after a car ran into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally have been released. Nine others are in good condition.
UVA Health System spokesperson Angela Taylor gave the update Monday.
Twenty people were taken to UVA Medical Center after the car ran into the crowd Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia. One, Heather Heyer, died. Five were initially in critical condition.
The hospital has said it treated additional patients related to Saturday's events beyond those 20, but that it can't give an exact number.

A former classmate of the man accused of plowing their car into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally says the suspect once said they went on a school trip to Germany so they could “get to the Fatherland.”
Keegan McGrath told The Associated Press on Monday that they were roommates with James Alex Fields Jr. on that trip in 2015.
McGrath says they challenged Fields on their beliefs and went home early because they couldn't handle being in a room with Fields.
They say Fields seemed fairly normal before that at their school in Union, Kentucky.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder after authorities say they drove into a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
A judge said Monday he'll appoint an attorney to represent Fields.

A judge has denied bond for an Ohio man accused of plowing their car into a crowd at a white nationalist rally.
Judge Robert Downer said during a bond hearing Monday they would appoint a lawyer for James Alex Fields Jr.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say they drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
The rally was held by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
Fields has been in custody since Saturday.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for their “deeply held, radical” convictions on race.

A group that hosts a ceremony every year to re-dedicate an Atlanta monument depicting a Confederate soldier vows that it will be repaired after protesters spray-painted it and broke a chunk from it.
John Green, past commandant of the Old Guard of the Gate City Guard, said Monday it appears their group must now raise money to repair the 105-year-old statue damaged during a Sunday protest after the deadly weekend violence in Virginia.
City officials haven't commented on any plans for repairs or whether city funds would be used for that.
Green said removing the statue from Piedmont Park, a city park, is not an option.
They said the angel standing over the soldier represents peace, and it was created to help bring the nation back together after the Civil War.

A prominent white nationalist website that promoted a Virginia rally that ended in deadly violence Saturday is losing its internet domain host.
GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it has given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated GoDaddy's terms of service.
GoDaddy spokesperson Dan Race tells the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by labeling a woman killed in an attack at the event in Charlottesville “fat” and “childless.” Heather Heyer was killed Saturday when police say a man plowed their car into a group of demonstrators protesting the white nationalist rally.
Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down.

Protesters spray-painted and broke a chunk off a statue depicting a Confederate soldier at an Atlanta park after they marched through the city to protest the weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that a lone police officer at Piedmont Park on Sunday night was surrounded by black-clad protesters shouting “pig” as demonstrators used chains to try and destroy the Peace Monument.
The statue depicts a winged angel standing over a Confederate soldier.
Video from local news outlets showed red spray paint covering much of the monument following the demonstration.
The Atlanta protest was among several around the nation over the weekend that were organized after a chaotic white supremacist rally in Virginia ended with deadly violence.

7:30 a.m.
The German government is condemning the white nationalist rally in Virginia that turned violent Saturday, expressing solidarity with peaceful counter-protesters.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesperson Steffen Seibert told reporters Monday that it was an “absolutely repulsive scene at this extreme-right march.”
They said “there was outrageous racism, anti-Semitism and hate in its most despicable form to be seen, and whenever it comes to such speech or such images it is repugnant.”
They added that it's “completely contrary to what the chancellor and the German government works for politically, and we are in solidarity with those who stand peacefully against such aggressive extreme-right opinions.”
Seibert says Merkel also regrets the death of a counter-protester and sent their sympathies to those injured.

An Ohio man accused of plowing their car into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia is set to make their first court appearance.
Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, says 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. has a bond hearing Monday morning.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say they drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
Fields has been in custody since Saturday. Jail officials told The Associated Press they don't know if he's obtained an attorney.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for their “deeply held, radical” convictions on race.

Scientists say they're several steps closer to perfecting a method for saving the northern white rhino from extinction.
Writing in the journal Nature Communications, researchers said Wednesday they've succeeded in creating embryos using frozen northern white rhino sperm and eggs from a southern white rhino.
It's the first time such hybrid embryos have been created, and the scientists from Europe and the United States hope it will provide a pathway to saving the northern white rhino sub-species, of which only two females remain.
They plan to harvest the females' egg cells soon and produce "pure" northern white rhinos to be borne by a southern white surrogate in three years. They're also working on a second method that would see sperm and eggs produced from preserved cells of northern white rhinos.
Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has slammed the media reports which were tarnishing their image by claiming the Portuguese captain has evaded €14.7million in taxes last year. Condemning the fake allegations, Ronaldo addressed the reports by calling them as ‘fake news' which are spreading like wildfire in relation to their tax fraud case. The highest paid athlete of 2017 in sports industry was summoned for tax evasion in connection with their image rights from 2011 to 2014.
Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has slammed the media reports which were tarnishing their image by claiming the Portuguese captain has evaded €14.7million in taxes last year. Condemning the fake allegations, Ronaldo addressed the reports by calling them as ‘fake news' which are spreading like wildfire in relation to their tax fraud case. The highest paid athlete of 2017 in sports industry was summoned for tax evasion in connection with their image rights from 2011 to 2014. Ronaldo, made approximate $93 million in season 2016-17 where they received accusations of refusing to pay €14.7million in taxes.
As per reports in the Spanish media, Cristiano Ronaldo's attorney failed to reach a settlement with the nation's tax authorities after an offer around €3.8m was rejected by the officials. Ronaldo, who is famous for playing complete matches from start to end, was forced to perform the same traits as the Portuguese captain spent 90 minutes in Madrid court last year. Ronaldo was allegedly accused of concealing their income from the sale of image rights. In their defence, Ronaldo refuted the allegations and pledged that they are doing things the right way and denied any wrongdoing.
“I always pay what I have to pay; I do things the right way and I will continue to do so.” Ronaldo was quoted as saying. Ronaldo bounced back from their dreadful form in 2018 and took their tally to 21 goals in just 13 appearances. The Sultan of stopovers was instrumental in Real Madrid's 6-3 thrashing of seventh placed Girona in Spanish League (La Liga) on Sunday. The Portuguese talisman then took to Instagram the very next day and slammed their critics who are spoiling their comeback by spreading fake news. “Don't try to spoil the beautiful moment I'm living through with fake news,” Ronaldo wrote in Portuguese. “Life is good. Blessed,” they added.

Meek Mill Released From Prison, Kevin Hart Meets Him At The Door
This just in….
After months of incarceration, Meek Mill is now a free man. TMZ released an image of Kevin Hart going to the prison to meet them at their release.
However, the best account of their release is from the Philadelphia rapper himself.
I'd like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) April 24, 2018
To the Philly District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) April 24, 2018

Welcome home… just in time to see their team, The Sixers kill the Heat in the playoffs. Can't wait to see them court side! What a celebration
EDMONTON — Parker is not yet five years old and has been giving blood regularly for nearly three of them.
“He just gave their 12th donation,” said Hans Granholm of Edmonton.
What makes Parker's altruism unusual is that he's a happy-go-lucky giant schnauzer mix. The rescue dog, which had to go through a series of tests to make sure they were eligible to donate, doesn't seem to mind the donor sessions at all.
“He's quite a clown,” owner Granholm said with a laugh. “He's the only dog I've ever met that actually smiles.
“When we go in there, they just goes around and smiles to all of the girls and all of the technicians. He's just quite a clown.”
Parker, who is 4 1/2, is one of the regular donors at Edmonton's NAIT clinic, which recently put out a call for more dogs.
“Our donor pool depleted quite dramatically,” said Beth Knight, laboratory director at the Canadian Animal Blood Bank in Winnipeg. “It's one of those challenges.”
Any dog blood donated at clinics across Canada goes into the bank for use by veterinarians when a dog is recovering after surgery or from diseases such as cancer. Cats and other pets can also donate blood, but it's a much more complicated procedure and they aren't part of the same program.
Canine donors must meet several requirements, but the clinics are always on the lookout for “sweet-natured” dogs.
Knight said the clinics don't ask too many personal questions.
“We do ask about bites and fights,” they said.
They also need to know about any health problems, so they take a small blood sample, they added.
“Once the donor has passed these little hurdles, we give them a great big hug and ask them to lie down on the table.”
A total of 450 millilitres of blood, the same volume that would be taken from a human, is drawn with a needle from the dog's jugular vein after the area is shaved and prepared.
“It takes two to three minutes,” Knight said.
Each dog is different.
“We have both the yin and yang of donors,” said Knight. “Some love coming; some are glad to leave. Others think they are going to get their nails trimmed, so they panic until they have this big needle in their jugular and then they totally relax.
“It's like, ‘Oh, this is what we're doing.”‘
They said dogs typically recover more quickly than people after giving blood.
“Every lab owner wants the dog to be slower and that will never happen,” they said. “Their head and their heart are at the same level, and their ability to recover from a blood loss is managed more easily than you and me.”
There are seven major blood groups in dogs. Greyhounds, German shepherds, pit bulls and Weimaraners are more likely to have the type that's considered universal.
Each donation helps up to three dogs.
Doggie donors must be between one and eight years old, weigh at least 25 kilograms and be up to date on their vaccinations.
They receive free blood products — if ever required — a tag, a bandana and a free microchip after the second donation.
Granholm, who has been bringing in their dogs to donate since 2004, said they regularly urge other owners to take their dogs to give blood.
“It's the same as a human giving blood,” they said. “You're doing a service to others.”
Parker gets an added bonus after they donate.
“Oh yeah, they get a treat afterward.”

Free pickin' at Ross's Landing this weekend
Bluegrass is one of those timeless American pastimes that needs no introduction. Located a little south of Appalachia and slightly north of Northern Georgia, Chattanooga is geographically situated in the precise location for optimum bluegrass efficiency. It's in our blood, so to speak, woven deep within our history.
For the 11th consecutive year, The 3 Sisters Bluegrass Festival will be delivering a collection of talented pickers, fiddlers, and mandolin players to Ross's Landing for free. It's no surprise the festival has been dubbed one of the top-five bluegrass festivals in the country, offering over twelve total hours of toe-tapping melodies in the heart of downtown.
Rain or shine, the festival includes big names like the Del McCoury Band, Bryan Sutton, and Sam Bush. It's recommended to bring lawn chairs and blankets to get comfy as you absorb these performances, and beer and food will be available for sale to any interested patrons who don't want to miss even a second.
Even if you don't decide stop in and catch a few tunes, expect bluegrass pickin' to ring throughout downtown for a few days. It will surely add a melodic backdrop to the monotonous hustle and bustle of the urban vista, and I'm expecting at least one rendition of “Dueling Banjos” to draw in curious listeners regardless of music preference.
3 Sisters Music Festival
Friday, 6 p.m. & Saturday, Noon

Naira Watch: External reserves down to 3-month low
…Naira stable at N364/$
By Babajide Komolafe
The nation's external reserved has dropped to $30.22 billion, the lowest level in three months.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disclosed this Wednesday on its website.
The apex bank revealed that the external reserve dropped to $30.222 billion on Tuesday June 13th, representing a weekly decline of $68 million when compared with the $30.290 billion achieved the previous Tuesday of June 6th.
Vanguard analysis revealed that the new level of $30.22 billion represents the lowest level since March 14th, or 13 weeks ago, when the reserve was $30.23 billion. The reserve has been on the downward trend since May 4th when it reached a peak of $30.99 billion. Since then, the reserve has dropped by $770 million.
Meanwhile, the naira Wednesday remained stable at N364 per dollar in the parallel market due to weak demand for dollars.
Vanguard survey revealed that the parallel market exchange rate, which dropped to N364 per dollar on Tuesday, rose to N365 per dollar yesterday morning, but dropped to N364 per dollar at the close of business.
A bureau de change (BDC) executive who spoke to Vanguard on condition of anonymity said the stability of the naira was due to low patronage and expected dollar sales to BDCs today. The CBN sells $20,000 to each of the 3,145 BDCs across the country twice in a week specifically on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The post Naira Watch: External reserves down to 3-month low appeared first on Vanguard News.

By CURT ANDERSON
AP Legal Affairs Writer
MIAMI (AP) - The families of six Americans kidnapped and killed in Colombia during the 1990s by the terrorist organization known as FARC are seeking potentially tens of millions of dollars in damages from banana giant Chiquita Brands International because of payments the company made to the group.
Trial is scheduled to begin with jury selection Monday in West Palm Beach federal court in lawsuits that accuse Chiquita of violating the Anti-Terrorism Act. Chiquita has admitted paying FARC - a Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - about $220,000 but insists it did so only to protect its employees and interests from violence.
One $10,000 payment to the guerrillas was hidden in a spare tire on the back of a Jeep, according to court documents.
The families claim Chiquita's financial support of FARC, as a known terrorist group, means it should be held responsible for the Americans' deaths and pay damages. The families must prove that Chiquita executives knew FARC was engaged in violent terror acts that could affect Americans and that the deaths of their loved ones were foreseeable when the payments were made, said plaintiffs' attorney Gary Osen.
"These are folks who have been through an enormous amount in their lives. They've waited 10 years for their day in court," Osen said.
In a statement issued in January, Switzerland-based Chiquita said its only motivation in paying FARC was protecting its own employees from violence.
"We have been clear that, at all times, the company prioritized the safety of its employees and their families, and acted accordingly," the statement said.
FARC and other paramilitary groups were engaged in a decades-long civil war in Colombia that took thousands of lives. The bloodshed finally ended in 2016 when a peace accord was signed. Chiquita also admitted paying $1.7 million to a right-wing group opposed to FARC, eventually pleading guilty in 2007 to a U.S. crime and paying a $25 million fine.
It was only after that case became public that family members of the six Americans slain by FARC learned that Chiquita had also paid FARC, leading to the lawsuits.
Five of the Americans killed by FARC were members of a missionary group based in Sanford, Florida, called New Tribes Mission: David Mankins, Rich Tenenoff, Mark Rich, Stephen Welsh and Timothy Van Dyke. The sixth, Frank Pescatore Jr., was a geologist for an Alabama company working on a project in Colombia who was shot trying to escape their kidnappers, according to court documents.
Tania Julin of Winter Springs, Florida, was married to Rich the night they were kidnapped on Jan. 31, 1993 in the village of Pucuro, Panama, about 15 miles from the Colombian border. They said armed men burst into their home - where their two young daughters were sleeping - tied Rich up and ordered he, Mankins and Tenenoff to march into the jungle.
They never saw their husband again.
"It was so terrifying. I just never imagined. It was so out of the blue and unexpected. I was only 23 years old, with two little kids," said Julin, who now teaches kindergarten. "I was just terrified of what might happen and so confused about why anyone would do this to us. We were only there to help people."
"I have never been so afraid in all of my life."
Later, FARC demanded a $5 million ransom for the three, but it soon became apparent the men had likely been killed, Julin said. It took years for the families to find out for sure, and they never received any remains.
"The years of not knowing were so difficult. Christmases would go by and the one thing the girls wanted for Christmas was for their dad to come home. It was lots of years of disappointing heartaches and hard to watch to girls grow up without their dad," they said.
Well before their deaths in the 1990s, Chiquita had established about 35 banana farms in the Uraba region of Colombia that employed about 3,000 people. It was well known that FARC was active in the area and routinely used extortion and threats to obtain payments from people and businesses - a practice called "vacuna," which is Spanish for "vaccine."
FARC's initial payment demand from Chiquita came in 1989, when the group sought $10,000. Court papers show Chiquita executives decided to make the payment, the first of 57 it would give to FARC over the next decade.
A consulting company called Control Risks that worked with Chiquita outlined the dire nature of the issue in a memo at the time, court documents show:
"You have to pay. These people are serious. The military is not able to control them," the memo said. "You can't just turn them in, give their names to someone. Because they will take retribution for that, and you can expect violence."
Ultimately, a Chiquita executive traveled to Colombia with $10,000 in cash, exchanged it for Colombian pesos and arranged to deliver the money hidden in the Jeep spare tire to a FARC guerrilla, court documents show.
Despite their insistence the money was paid to protect employees, Chiquita executives at the time discussed it in terms of a cost of doing business - and the company had no intention then of ending its banana operations in Colombia, the documents show.
"We're not going to stop doing business in Colombia because, you know, we're going to have to spend an extra $25,000. That's not realistic. Right?" one executive was quoted as saying.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra, who will preside over the estimated four-week trial, ruled in January that Chiquita cannot use a defense that the payments were made solely under duress.
"There is no evidence of a specific ultimatum or threat from a FARC commander at any time during the nine-year continuum in which it paid money to the FARC," Marra wrote. "Chiquita had reasonable, legal alternatives to maintaining and expanding its fruit operations in Colombia. It could have withdrawn and could have sought government intervention in Colombia or the United States."
Although the lawsuit asks for no specific damages, plaintiffs' attorney Osen says other similar cases have resulted in verdicts in the tens of millions of dollars - in part because any damages awarded are automatically tripled.
"Family members of terror victims suffer uniquely because of the shocking and unexpected nature and the malice and cruelty involved," Osen said.
Julin said after all this time they are anxious but also optimistic now that the case is heading for trial.
"I finally am going to get my day in court," they said. "There's a sense of a little bit of nerves but a sense of some wrongs being made amends for."

The skies above Blackpool were filled with noise, smoke and colour as daredevil aerial experts wowed the crowds at the resort's air show.
For the first time the event was staged across a weekend with the Red Arrows the star attraction on both Saturday and Sunday.
The RAF's elite display team based themselves at Blackpool Airport over the weekend putting on two spectacular displays for crowds packed onto the Promenade.
And although the Reds were the main attraction there was plenty more on show to amaze and excite the bumper audience, enjoying the seaside sunshine as well as the aerobatic displays.
The show was opened by the Fylde-coast built Typhoon, the RAF's most advanced fighter aircraft with the team's pilots showing just how capable a 21st century aircraft can be with a series of physics defying manoevres.
With afterburners lit the jet provided an ear-splitting soundtrack to whet the appetite of those gathered on the Prom.

Other highlights included the daring Breitling Wing Walkers, on their World War Two Boeing Stearman biplanes and the magnificent Battle of Britain Memorial Flight featuring a Spitfire and Lancaster bomber, the sound of Rolls-Royce Merlin engines an evocative reminder of the vital role the aircraft played.
And the displays were certainly a big hit with locals and tourists alike.
Alison Jones said: “I had a lovely afternoon on the Prom with friends watching the air show. Red Arrows were superb as always.”
Sheila Newall said: “What a fantastic show, breathtaking as always.”
JEFFERSON HILLS, Pa. — Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tyler Boyd was charged Thursday with owning a vape pen containing the active ingredient in marijuana that police say was found when their friend crashed the NFL player's car near Pittsburgh in July.
Jefferson Hills police say Boyd, a former star at the University of Pittsburgh, lent their car to a friend who crashed it about 3 a.m. on July 12. Boyd wasn't in the car.
But police say they found an open bottle of cognac, an unopened bottle of peach vodka, and two vape pens and several unopened vape cartridges containing THC.
Boyd's attorney, Daniel Konieczka (koh-NETCH'-kah) says there “might be some factual confusion” over who owned the vape items. But police say Boyd acknowledged owning one of the vape pens.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A Texas youth prison guard asked a teenage inmate if they were "ready to go to sleep" as they and another guard choked them until they lost consciousness, according to prosecutors.
Authorities on Thursday arrested four guards at state-run juvenile lockups on charges of official oppression, including one who works at a Brown County facility and three who work at one in Gainsville, including the two accused of allegedly choking out a teen and a third accused of allegedly punching one in the face, tackling them and then pummeling their head and body.
The arrests are part of a state investigation into the troubled Texas Juvenile Justice Department. Since last year, at least nine state juvenile correctional officers have been arrested on abuse or misconduct charges and another was convicted in July on charges of having sex with youth in custody.
The unfolding crisis led Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to replace the agency's top leaders and independent ombudsman. They also launched a state investigation into the juvenile system that houses about 1,400 youth offenders, which was drastically downsized and overhauled in 2007 following a sex abuse scandal involving guards and teenagers.
"There is no room among us for those who dishonor themselves and violate the public trust. These arrests improve the safety of the youth we serve," said Camille Cain, the new executive director over the Texas juvenile detention system.
Court documents filed in Cooke County on Friday accuse correctional officers Shannon Hoaglen, 41, and Derrick Day, 39, of moving to restrain a teenager due to a "rule violation" and holding them to the ground until they could "not talk, breath or move until they became unconscious; waking up dazed, confused." The documents do not give the teen's age or specify what rule they had broken. Youths in the Texas system age out at 19.
Another correctional officer allegedly told investigators that Day lay down on the teenager and asked them "Are you ready to go sleep?" They then counted until the teen stopped moving.
"In the surveillance video, it is obvious, based on the sudden stop in movement by the Youth, that the Youth had lost consciousness during this restraint," according to an affidavit signed by Sgt. Jacob Richardson, who works in the agency's inspector general office.
Cooke County Jail records on Friday did not list Hoaglen and Day as still in custody, and a court clerk did not know whether they had been arraigned or entered pleas. It was not clear whether either had an attorney, and no working phone numbers could be found for Hoaglen or Day.
Derrick Goodman, 56, who allegedly punched the other juvenile in custody, said they had no comment when reached by phone Friday.
According to court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday, Morsello Hooker, 31, was arrested in Brown County and charged with official oppression related to allegations they picked up a 15-year-old who was lying on their back and slammed them on the ground. The Department of Public Safety said a fifth department employee was facing criminal charges in the investigation, but was at large.
In 2007, Texas lawmakers shuttered lockups across the state after authorities believed at least 13 boys in custody had been sexually abused. Five juvenile lockups remain today but are spread out in rural areas, which juvenile advocates say has made finding and retaining qualified officers difficult.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Carsen Edwards helped Matt Painter reach a coaching milestone.
The sophomore guard scored a career-high 27 points and No. 21 Purdue beat IUPUI 86-61 on Sunday night for Painter's 300th victory.
“When you can't make a jumper, just go to the basket,” Edwards said. “That's what I was trying to do because I couldn't get a jumper to fall so I thought if I'd attack the basket, I'd get fouled and make some lay-ups, so I just tried to keep attacking.”
Isaac Haas added 14 points and six rebounds, and Vincent Edwards had 12 points and 12 rebounds to help the Boilermakers (10-2) win their sixth straight game.
Maurice Kirby had 16 points for IUPUI (2-6), and Jaylen Minnett added 12 points. The Jaguars who have lost four straight.
Purdue closed out the first half on a 6-0 spurt, capped by P.J. Thompson's 3-pointer just before the buzzer that made it 40-31. The Boilermakers opened the second with a 14-0 run, including seven straight points by Carsen Edwards.
Haas' layup with 16:31 to play put Purdue ahead 54-31 — before IUPUI finally scored again on a lay-up by Kirby.
The Jaguars got off to a good start, though, and took an early lead. Nick Rogers made a 3-pointer and D.J. McCall scored a lay-up — both off Purdue turnovers — and by halftime, IUPUI had 13 points off eight turnovers.
“Tonight we made a couple poor decisions to start the game and it kind of set the tone for them,” Painter said. “They made a couple nice plays.”
CLINE FROM BEHIND THE LINE
Ryan Cline is starting to get in a little bit of a rhythm. After a slow start to the season, the junior guard is a combined 10-of-16 from the field and 8-of-12 from 3-point range. They finished with nine points on 3-of-5 shooting, all from 3-point range, with two big 3s coming late in the first half when the Boilermakers pulled away.
‘TIS THE SEASON FOR WINNING
The Boilermakers have won 13 straight games in the month of December. The last loss in December came against Butler in the annual Crossroads Classic on Dec. 19, 2015.
BIG PICTURE
IUPUI: They're 0-3 in the short series with Purdue. Against Big Ten opponents, the Jaguars' last win came against Northwestern, 56-53 on Nov. 27, 2002.
Purdue: After Thursday's win over Valparaiso, IUPUI was the second of a three-game stretch against in-state opponents. The Boilermakers have won five straight against teams from Indiana and hasn't lost to an in-state team since Feb. 20, 2016.
UP NEXT
IUPUI is off this week before heading to Washington State on Saturday for the second game three straight games on the road.
Purdue is off this week until a matchup with Butler in the Crossroads Classic at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.
SAN DIEGO, Calif., (KGTV) — Max, a police dog, is resting at home after getting stabbed multiple times.
Police said they and their partner, Officer Carvajal, were responding to a man in the middle of the street on 30th and Lincoln Avenue Wednesday night. Police say the man was ‘acting like a bull,' had a knife and started running. Max went after them and was stabbed twice.
RELATED: Man 'acting like a bull' in middle of street stabs San Diego police dog during chase
“He's going to be looked at for their injuries,” said Officer Larry Adair.
Officer Adair said when they heard Max got hurt, it reminded them of a similar experience they had nearly ten years ago. Their K9 partner Jake was stabbed 15 times in 2008.
“It's truly awful to see my partner get stabbed repeatedly,” said Officer Adair.
They said Jake ended up serving with them for seven years but has since passed. They now have a new K9 named, Ari.
“We trust them with our lives," they said. "That level of trust is immeasurable."
Officer Adair said Max is expected to recover and will be resting at home for seven to 10 days.
The suspect was transported to the hospital and then to County Jail.
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine government forces have foiled an attempt by a few dozen Muslim militants aligned with the Islamic State group to attack a small southern town in fighting that left four gunmen dead, an army official said Wednesday.
Army Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc said troops clashed with 30-40 militants Tuesday and drove them away from the small farming community of Mopac where they planned to launch an attack on the town centre of Datu Paglas about a half kilometre (quarter mile) away.
The militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters led by Solaiman Tudon occupied several abandoned houses in Mopac, where they used to live, over the weekend but their family and other villagers asked the gunmen to leave.
“They took sniper positions and placed some bombs in the community and that alarmed the villagers,” Cabunoc said.
Troops backed by artillery fire later arrived and clashed with the militants, who fled and were being pursued by government forces, Cabunoc said, adding that villagers started returning to their homes in Mopac on Wednesday.
Tudon's group is one of several small armed militant factions that have expressed support to the Islamic State group.
Clashes have erupted this week in a number of rural villages in Maguindanao province, where Datu Paglas is located, as troops pressed sporadic offensives to prevent a repeat of last year's siege of southern Marawi city by hundreds of Islamic State group-aligned militants. The five-month fighting in Marawi left more than 1,000 combatants and civilians dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of villagers.
NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Police Department says it is responding to a report of an explosion near Times Square.
The response is centered in the area of the Port Authority bus terminal.
It's led to delays along some of the subway lines that pass beneath the bus terminal.
Some passengers have been evacuated as a precaution.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.

There are many things to be thankful for right now in pro wrestling. You can be thankful for Bray Wyatt and Kevin Owens: world champions. You can be thankful for Lucha Underground. You can be thankful for John Cena finally embracing their inner asshole and becoming an in-canon outer asshole. And as always, you can be thankful that Mick Foley will never have any reservations about dishing the backstage dirt on Vince McMahon‘s proclivities.
Mick was a guest on this week's Making Their Way To The Ring with Lilian Garcia, and they gave a perfect encapsulation of how hands-on Vince is, and how specifically they want their chosen terms and buzzwords to be handled. And he's not even going to let an enormous hillbilly bitten by a radioactive swamp monster like Braun Strowman get away with tossing around a stray word.
“I was about to go out there a couple weeks ago, and I heard Braun Strowman say, I want a title shot. Mr. McMahon's behind the curtain, at the board watching the monitor, and they go, oh god, it's not a title shot. I was thinking to myself, then what is it? That's exactly what I would go to call it when I would go out there. You want a title shot? He's like, it's a title match. It's a match! So if you ever wonder what it's like to see a six-foot-eight, three hundred pounds behemoth get chewed out, you should've been there.”
So let this be a lesson to all prospective WWE employees: make sure you know the terms, and don't you dare use the wrong ones around Vincent K. McMahon, or he'll be up in your grill like their name was George Foreman. NO SHOTS; MATCHES. NO BELTS; CHAMPIONSHIPS. NO “CHANGING HANDS”; WINNING. HE'S GONNA HE'S GONNA HE'S GONNA PYUUUUUUUKE.

An editorial from the Summerside Journal Pioneer, published May 29:
It is both good and essential that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is imposing drastic measures to protect the endangered North Atlantic right whales that are teetering on the brink of extinction.
Those whales need to be protected. Mankind owes the species that much.
They were easy prey and they were overfished decades ago and, because of ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear, the population never had a chance to recover.
Protective measures impact fisheries and also shipping companies, as container ships must slow down while travelling through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, thereby reducing the risk of colliding with one of those large whales. And time is money.
It becomes collateral damage that those measures are negatively impacting on the livelihoods of East Coast fishermen and shipping companies.
Those measures, however, just might be what are necessary to protect the fishery from financial ruin. If such drastic measures weren't imposed and right whales perished at or near last year's unprecedented rate, then ramifications to the fishing industry would be immense. Seafood from a country that does not take drastic steps to protect the endangered right whales would suddenly seem less appetizing.
The fishing industry, the snow crab industry in particular, has made several gear modifications to reduce the risk of whale entanglements, and DFO is closing areas to fishing activity when whales are known to be present.
So, when one or more grids are closed to fishing, the boats that would normally be fishing there, are forced to move somewhere else, piling gear in among other fishermen's gear. It puts the fishing industry under increased pressure but, at least, the industry is demonstrating to a watching world that sacrifices are being made, willingly or otherwise, to give the remaining whales a fighting chance.
The snow crab fishery did, however, get unnecessarily hampered by a closure that went into force before any whales were known to be back in the gulf. As well, some fishermen, including those in P.E.I. and parts of New Brunswick, were unnecessarily held back this spring because of ice that was keeping fishermen from northern New Brunswick in port.
The fishery is controlled by boat quotas. Island boats might have had their quota almost caught before the whales arrived if they did not have to wait for northern New Brunswick. It would have helped spread the fishery out.
P.E.I. fishermen are less impacted by current closures than their counterparts in New Brunswick and Quebec, but it is likely just a matter of time before the whales move onto their fishing grounds, too. If the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can close certain areas when whales are present, then it should be able to open certain areas early in the spring when ice conditions permit. Even that would have proved beneficial for the endangered whales.
Some fishermen might have been watching from shore, but only for a while and they'd have more room to maneuver once they got out and early boats were off the water.
TORONTO — Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne says they would welcome U.S. President Donald Trump's education secretary to visit the province's public schools if they choose to reschedule a cancelled visit.
Wynne says they were looking forward to an opportunity to show Betsy DeVos a strong, publicly funded education system — even though they don't agree with some of their positions.
DeVos advocates for school choice, including vouchers that allow kids to attend charter schools — which are publicly funded but privately operated — or private schools on the public dime
DeVos has also attracted protests recently for revoking a guidance that instructed colleges on how to handle sexual assault cases, saying the previous policy was unfairly skewed against those accused of assault, and for the department of education rolling back rules allowing transgender students to use school restrooms of their choice.
Ontario teachers' unions expressed concerns about DeVos' planned visit, which they cancelled this week the day before it was set to begin, citing scheduling issues.
The NDP called on the government to not allow DeVos to tour schools in the province — a position Wynne says they don't understand.
“I don't agree with the positions that Secretary DeVos has taken in the past, that's true, but I think that's all the more reason to have an opportunity to showcase what we do in our schools and how strong a publicly funded education system can be,” Wynne said Friday.
“So I honestly don't understand why we would want to hide that under a bushel. I would think we'd want to celebrate the success of our publicly funded education system.”
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Dan Dawson had three goals and three assists and Joe Resetarits struck twice and added four helpers as the Rochester Knighthawks toppled the Calgary Roughnecks 17-6 on Saturday in the National Lacrosse League season opener for both teams.

Bored hackers who aren't getting paid tend to get restless. And so, on Sunday, the cyber thieves behind the recent HBO breach leaked several unreleased episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm, which was scheduled to return in October after six years off the air. HBO, understandably, seems annoyed.
We're now in week three of the standoff between HBO and the hackers, and the network sounds like it's at the end of its rope. Following the Curb Your Enthusiasm leak, HBO effectively issued a “no comment” statement to the press:
We are not in communication with the hacker and we're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released.
Sounds annoyed, right? The statement gets even more annoyed-sounding:
It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO. The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. That's a game we're not going to participate in. Obviously, no company wants their proprietary information stolen and released on the internet. Transparency with our employees, partners, and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward. This incident has not deterred us from ensuring HBO continues to do what we do best.
To sum things up, HBO is really weary of this hacker business. The hackers aren't getting shit from HBO in this cyber extortion scheme. And, in conclusion, HBO is generally sick of this shit.
And who could blame them? Here's this network, HBO, and all it wants to do is make premium content for paying customers. Then, along comes this hacker group that steals that premium content and starts leaking it on the internet, where any dumb bum with a torrent client can download and watch it for free. To date, the hackers have released episodes of Ballers, Room 104, Insecure, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Barry, and The Deuce. Those last two series aren't even out yet.
Meanwhile, the hackers have billed this big cyber heist as a Game of Thrones breach, even though they don't appear to have any unreleased episodes of the popular murder not-a-mystery show. A couple of unreleased episode outlines have showed up on the internet, but unless they're holding ou, that appears to be the extent of the Game of Thrones information the hackers have stolen. Episode four of season seven did leak before it was aired on HBO, but that was allegedly the work of two employees of an India-based distribution company who have since been charged, not the hackers.
So yeah, HBO is sick of this. The network apparently offered a $250,000 “bug bounty” (which may have been a ruse) for the hackers to delay the release of its stolen data, and the hackers refused, instead demanding $6 million or more. Now, HBO has to deal with what appears to be a semi-weekly leak of that stolen data and lord knows how many lawyers' bills. All because the network creates premium content that's fun to watch.

In a live interview between actor and author Rose McGowan and journalist Ronan Farrow in Manhattan last night, the Charmed star — who previously accused Harvey Weinstein of raping them in 1997 — said that they were preyed on by another “very famous” in Hollywood when they were 15, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Over the course of the conversation, Farrow asked McGowan about another alleged predator they mentioned while Farrow was interviewing them for their New Yorker articles on Weinstein's alleged widespread sexual misconduct. McGowan said that they aren't ready to go on record and out the “prominent” director by name, but they did disclose that they “won Oscars” and “worked for my rapist [Weinstein].”
“This man picked me up when I was 15 years old,” McGowan said. “He took me home after they met me and they showed me a soft porn movie they had made for Showtime, under a different name. And then they had sex with me.”
McGowan said that after the encounter was over, they left their “standing on a street corner” in Silver Lake.
The actor told Farrow that they aren't ready to name their alleged abuser because they had only come to terms with that had happened recently. From THR:
“In my mind, playing it back, I had been attracted to him, so I always filed it away as a sexual experience.” They then said to Farrow, “I don't have a normal trajectory, I don't know if you do either.” The son of Woody Allen related to her, saying, “I do not.” McGowan said that until they started processing what had happened last fall, they always thought of the situation as, “That creep did this to a 15-year-old.” Adding, “It was not until two weeks after your story broke — our story, our world's story — that I was in bed and I started saying, ‘Oh my god. I think that's molestation.'”
Farrow said that McGowan disclosed the name of this director to them in off the record conversations in the course of reporting the Weinstein story, but would leave it to them to name them when she's ready.
On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers issued a statement refuting McGowan's accusations, which can be read here.
As Gambia's new president Adama Barrow settles into their new role, they are also taking steps to resuscitate international ties cut off by their predecessor Yahya Jammeh, including membership to the International Criminal Court and the Commonwealth of Nations.
The tiny West African nation has now formally informed the United Nations that it is reversing its request to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, made by Jammeh last October.
The new government issued a statement announcing its reversal on state television, Reuters reported. "As a new government that has committed itself to the promotion of human rights ... we reaffirm The Gambia's commitment to the principles enshrined in the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court," the government said.
Jammeh's withdrawal from the ICC had not yet taken hold — according to the terms of the Rome Statute, a state's withdrawal goes into effect a year after initial notification.
At the time, Gambia had accused the court of being biased against Africans, with one government minister going so far as to describe it as the "International Caucasian Court," as The Two-Way reported. Gambia, like South Africa and Burundi, accused the court of ignoring crimes of non-African nations and took steps to withdraw late last year. Here's more from our previous reporting:
"Every person tried by the ICC since the treaty creating it was adopted in 1998 has been African. "Other war crimes trials have been carried out by ad hoc tribunals created after a specific conflict, such as those created for Yugoslavia and Cambodia, or for the Nuremberg trials conducted after World War II."
Clément Capo-Chichi, Africa regional coordinator with the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, told The Associated Press that the move is a "crucial victory for victims of grave crimes and the rule of law."
Barrow's road to the presidency was extremely tumultuous. In December's presidential election they defeated Jammeh, the leader of the Gambia for 22 years. But then Jammeh refused to step down, eventually resulting in West African military troops crossing Gambia's borders. After Barrow was sworn into office in neighboring Senegal, Jammeh eventually succumbed to massive international pressure and left the country.
They fled to Equatorial Guinea – incidentally, a country that is not a member state of the ICC.
Now, the new Gambian government is also receiving high-profile diplomatic visits and pledges of international support.
U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson paid Barrow a visit Tuesday, which the BBC describes as "the first to the Gambia by a British foreign secretary." On the agenda: Gambia's request to rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, an international organization comprised of 52 nations that were once British colonies.
The former leader pulled Gambia out of the Commonwealth in 2013, according to a statement from the organization. Now, a Commonwealth spokesperson said it welcomed the move: "We looked forward to the country's eventual return because it was part of our very close knit family and our doors have always remained open."
The European Union has also declared a "new chapter of relations with The Gambia." It froze assistance nearly three years ago, according to the BBC. But last week, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica traveled to the Gambia and announced a $79 million package of immediate support.
Jammeh had a dismal human rights record. Barrow appears to be taking steps to change that pattern. As Reuters reported, "police opened their first investigation on Monday into unresolved deaths and disappearances under Jammeh."
In a recent press conference, Barrow also stated that they intend to convene a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address human rights violations of their predecessor.
They were also candid about the scope of obstacles they face: "There was a government here for 22 years. 22 years is a long time. And we are able to change the government after 22 years, so obviously there will be a lot of challenges. To look at all the system, and make a complete overhaul. I think that is a big challenge to my new government."

NEW YORK — The Latest on the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest. (all times local):
1 p.m.
Defending champion Joey “Jaws” Chestnut chomped down a record 74 franks and buns to take home their 11th title at the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest.
The renowned competitive eater from San Jose, California, takes home the coveted Mustard Belt and surpassed the previous mark of 72 dogs and buns they downed last year.
The heat wasn't a factor; the National Weather Service put the temperature at 83 degrees with a heat index of 91 degrees.
Miki Sudo said after eating 37 dogs and buns that the heat may have slowed them down in winning the women's competition.
That didn't stop the Las Vegas eater from easily beating out second-place finisher Mischelle Lesco of Tuscon, Arizona, who chowed down 28 wieners and buns.

11 a.m.
Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) downed 37 franks to win their fifth straight title in the women's competition of the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest.
The Las Vegas competitor fell short of the 41 hot dogs they consumed last year but still beat out second-place finisher Michelle Lesco, of Tucson, Arizona. Lesco chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees braved 83-degree temperatures and a heat index of 91 degrees to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.
Ten-time winner Joey “Jaws” Chestnut will confront 20 other men during the men's competition later Wednesday for the coveted Mustard Belt.
Sudo was a fan favourite, drawing big cheers from the crowd during their performance, which was slightly delayed after they requested new water to soak them buns.

12:05 a.m.
It's frankly amazing.
Chowdown champions will face off Wednesday at Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest, where the men's record stands at 72 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes.
Ten-time winner Joey “Jaws” Chestnut will confront 20 other men on New York's Coney Island boardwalk. They set the record last year.
Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) is seeking a fifth women's title in a row. The 19-woman field includes record-holder Sonya “The Black Widow” Thomas.
Sudo downed 41 franks and buns last year. Thomas' record is 45, but they managed 30 last year.
The event attracts thousands of in-person spectators and is televised on ESPN.
Last year, animal rights activists tried to unfold a banner amid the crowd. Five protesters were taken into custody for questioning and released.

The firm that commissioned the popular “Fearless Girl” statue in New York's financial district has agreed to pay $5 million, mostly to settle claims that it discriminated against 305 top female employees by paying them less than men in the same positions.
In the agreement, officials at the United States Department of Labor also allege that the firm, State Street Corporation, discriminated against 15 of its black vice presidents by paying them less than white employees in the same positions.
State Street, a financial services firm, denies the allegations, according to the agreement. Still, the filing says that the firm has agreed to pay about $4.5 million in back pay and about $500,000 in interest into a settlement fund for the affected employees.
In a statement on Thursday, the company said that it “is committed to equal pay practices and evaluates on an ongoing basis our internal processes to be sure our compensation, hiring and promotions programs are nondiscriminatory,” according to The Associated Press.

Federal officials began their “evaluation” of State Street in late 2012, according to the agreement. They contend that the compensation discrimination dates back to December 2010.
Mother of Evans the kidnapper, goes into hiding
…We don't know them — UMUDIM monarch
By Ifeanyi Okolie & Chimaobi Nwaiwu
The mother of notorious kidnap kingpin, Chukwudubem Onwuamadike, a.k.a Evans, who was recently arrested in Lagos, has reportedly gone into hiding to avoid the crowd that besiege their Umudim, Nnewi home in Anambra state after news of the arrest of their son filtered in.
Them disappearance coincided with the disclosure by the Obi of Umudim, their village, Chief Benneth Okafor, that the arrested kidnap kingpin was not known in their community as they hardly visited home, neither did they have any investment in the community.
Lady Nwosu (Evans'mother) on the run
Lady Nwosu, as Evan's mother is popularly called, was described as a no nonsense woman. Contrary to insinuations from some quarters that their son bought them a car from to proceed of kidnapping; Vanguard gathered that they ride a lady motorcycle popularly called Nwanyi Nnewi. They were also said to be assisting vendors sell their wares after which they pay their commission weekly. But when Vanguard arrived the canteen where they sell, they were said to have gone into hiding since Tuesday.
A woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: “she went into hiding because people were trooping in to sympathise with them over the arrest of their son. Some came for different purpose; to make mockery of them and to see the face of the mother of the arrested kidnapper. Even you newsmen were troubling them They have been crying since news of the arrest reached them I do not know where they have gone to but I think it is good for her.”
Vanguard also visited Emmanuel Anglican Church Primary School, Akamili Umudim Nnewi, the primary school Evans attended. Headmaster of the school was, however, not on seat. A teacher that was accosted said they were not competent to speak on the matter.
Evans cries in cell – Police source
Also, police sources told Vanguard yesterday, that the suspect has been shedding tears since they were thrown into the cell lamenting that; “After making billions and living in mansions, I am in the cell with common criminals.” They were said to have been keeping to themselves in the cell and avoids other detained persons.
We don't know them — Nnewi monarch
When Vanguard visited Nnewi, the industrial city of Anambra state, yesterday, Evans' arrest was the topic on everyone's lips. Most of them, particularly traders, described their action as an embarrassment to the city, describing their indigenes as hard-working.
At their palace, the Obi of Umudim, Chief Okafor, stated; “I was told that they hardly came home. It is only the Akamili kindred where they come from that will be able to give a little account of the young man. It is unfortunate that many people in this village do not know them because they do not have any investment in Nnewi like an average Nnewi man, neither do they own any house here.”
More facts emerge about the arrest
More facts emerged, yesterday, about the circumstances that led to the location of the residence of the kidnap kingpin leading to their arrest, last Saturday. Sources attributed it to an informant residing in Magodo and intelligence reports that revealed identities of their three girlfriends.
It was gathered that after the Inspector-General of police deployed their Intelligence Response Team to track the notorious kingpin, they made huge progress from the documents recovered from their hideout in Igando, Lagos after the miraculous disappearance of their last victim.
The documents reportedly aided them in identifying occupants of that apartment and opened an avalanche of information leading to Evans movement. That was how they discovered that they live at Magodo area of Lagos State, while other members were also residing in Lagos, Rivers, Abuja, Edo and Anambara States.
N30m IGP reward as a boost
A source who spoke with Vanguard disclosed that the leader of IGP's team, Abba Kyari, who was tracking their locations had planned to round-up all the suspects, in one swoop, but their plans failed as Evans was always changing locations, making it difficult to get their exact location.
The source who spoke with Vanguard on the condition of anonymity disclosed that, while Kyari was searching for Evans, and has also mobilized some residents of Magodo Estate, giving them clear descriptions of Evans, their vehicles and the name of their security man, IGP, Ibrahim Idris, also announced a bounty of N30million on information that could lead to the arrest of Evans.
This led to the rounding up of three women believed to be Evans girlfriends, and they were identified as Amaka, Ijeoma and Ngozi. The operatives were said to have discovered that Evans was very close to Amaka and they rented an apartment for them in Okota area of Lagos State. Sources explained that Evans was fond of sleeping in Amaka's house on a regular basis and they decided to use Amaka to lure him.
Their plan to evade arrest
It was further gathered that fearing that Amaka may have been picked by the police, they avoided them as much as they could. However, one of the police informants in Magodo made a breakthrough as the IRT were banking on Amaka, and they called and informed the police that they have located Evans apartment. They also disclosed that Evans has not been seen around their house for a long time and they were believed to have moved out of their house.
Our source revealed that, Evans was highly elusive at this time and they were quite aware that the police were closing in on them and they moved away from their home and relocated to a hotel in Agidigingbi area of Ikeja adding that they also moved their wife and children to Ghana and was trying to dispose some of their properties at the time they were arrested.
The final straw
On the day they were arrested, according to sources, they were said to be unaware that operatives
had located their apartment in Magodo, when they contacted Ama ka on Saturday morning. “He was said to have called them on the phone around 4:15am, without knowing that some police officers were with them and asked them to wait outside their compound to meet him. They reportedly joined them later at the spot and as soon as they got into the car, they attacked her, threatening to kill them for not informing them about the police presence in their house. Evans was said to have gotten angry and drove away with them in their Grand Cherokee SUV and they had an accident at Iyana-Ipaja area where they abandoned the vehicle, seized Amaka's phone and asked them to go home. It was from there that they picked a cab to their residence at Magodo to pick some few things towards travelling out of the country. After then, we swooped on them and arrested them inside their bedroom.”

J. Tyler Haahr, Chairman and CEO, Reveals the Secrets of their High Flying MetaBank (NASDAQ:CASH)
J. Tyler Haahr is Chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer of Meta Financial Group, Inc. — “Meta Financial” — and MetaBank (NASDAQ:CASH). In this exclusive interview with the Wall Street Transcript, Tyler Haahr details the competitive advantage for their financial institution.
The company includes some interesting financial technology businesses: “…in 2004, we started our payments division, with the biggest part of the division being prepaid, but we also sponsor roughly two-thirds of the white-label ATMs in the country, meaning nonbank locations. So for convenience stores, restaurants, hotels, those kinds of locations, we sponsor roughly two-thirds of those and work with Visa, Mastercard and other banks moving the money. Then, we expanded again in December 2014 when we bought AFS/IBEX, our premium finance division. In 2015 and 2016, we bought our tax processing companies.”
The growth rate for this bank is amazing: “…all of our businesses really have been growing 20%-plus. The retail bank, the premium finance business, the payments business and the tax business have all been growing at well over 20%. ”
A company philosophy supports a lofty goal: “…our goal is financial inclusion for everyone. So since a lot of people don't qualify for a checking account at a traditional bank, roughly 28% of the population is either unbanked or underbanked, according to a Wall Street Journal article. For products, the traditional prepaid card started with the gift card, but there are also rebate and loyalty cards. And the majority of our prepaid business and the fastest-growing part of the prepaid business is really general purpose reloadable and payroll cards. So for people that otherwise would have to take their check to a check cashier, a payroll card is a great solution…”
The competition is fierce but CEO Tyler Haahr has a lot of confidence in their company's ability to excel in their space. “A lot of people would look at Bank of Internet, Green Dot or The Bancorp particularly in the payment space. With respect to the retail banking segment, there are many small, medium, large and money center banks in our markets. And we partner with and compete with a number of companies in the fintech space as well. So there's a variety of competitors both big and small in all of our divisions. And we just try to make sure we're disciplined on what we do, providing the best products and services and continuing to be innovative. That's how we're planning to compete.”
To get the complete details on J. Tyler Haahr, Chairman and CEO of MetaBank (NASDAQ:CASH) read the entire interview in the Wall Street Transcript.
Series eight and nine have already been commissioned, but will there be more Call the Midwife after that?
Treasure the next couple of series, Call the Midwife fans – because they could be the last.

The BBC1 drama is now on its seventh series, and its creator and writer Heidi Thomas has already signed up to make eight and nine (Christmas specials and all). But after this we may have to say goodbye to the nuns and midwives of Nonnatus House.
Thomas told RadioTimes.com: “We definitely know we're making series eight this year, and series nine next year. That may be the last, I don't know. Ultimately it's up to the BBC and to our audience as well.
“So I think we've got a few years left in us, but nothing lasts forever. So I'm always determined to enjoy every series as much as I can.”
If Call the Midwife does come to an end, keep an eye out for an unfamiliar nun in the final episode – because you might just catch a glimpse of Thomas themselves in a nun's habit.
“Dame Pippa Harris, who is my co executive producer, and I have occasionally joked that we might turn up in the very very last episode of Call the Midwife, probably dressed as nuns,” they said. “But it's not something – I don't think I'd be any good, to be honest.”

Our Girl‘s Captain James has been through quite an ordeal. 2 Section's “boss” suffered a gruesome leg injury as they trekked through Belizean jungle, developing sepsis and slipping in and out of consciousness in this week's instalment, all while frantically dodging the ruthless drug bandits who fiercely patrol their patch of rainforest.
Advertisement
The episode's denouement saw them helicoptered to hospital, their life hanging in the balance, after Bones (played by Olly Rix) and their Special Forces team arrived on the scene to save them and Georgie (Michelle Keegan) with moments to spare. We later learned that the Captain faces a “long road” to recovery, so Our Girl viewers could be forgiven for thinking they won't return to duty anytime soon – or perhaps ever…
Which poses the question: has Ben Aldridge left the drama for good? Or will Captain James lead 2 Sections once more?
“He comes back. Yes, yes, yes,” Aldridge tells RadioTimes.com. “I'm in all the rest of the episodes. There is a future for them with 2 Sections.”
Which may come as a relief to viewers but is also no doubt music to the ears of the soldiers themselves who last we saw were faced with the prospect of serving under their new commanding officer Bones who have made no secret of their contempt for them.
“There continues to be tension between Captain James and Bones, and also tension between them and Georgie,” teases Aldridge
Yes, Georgie. Our Girl fans were up in arms during last week's episode when Captain James suggested to their medic that their feelings towards them went beyond friendship, despite their marriage to Molly Dawes (Lacey Turner) – a romance viewers watched play out in series one.. “Elvis has bonded us, Lane. Me and you,” they told Georgie, although they brushed off their overtures.
Yet with their life in the balance in the following instalment, Captain James offloads their feelings again, telling their friend: “Maybe if circumstances had been different… You don't have Elvis anymore.”
Aldridge is well aware of the reaction their character's actions has elicited among viewers. “I heard that Twitter sort of went mental over it,” they joke, adding: “I think people feel very, very protective over James and Molly's relationship and it would seem that's what some people are still interested in seeing.
“We all feel very loyal to them as a couple, but then some people said, ‘Of course this was going to happen, I can't wait for [Captain James and Georgie] to get together'. Whether they do or not, it seems pretty divisive.”
Still, with Molly regularly mentioned throughout the series – despite actor Lacey Turner's absence from screens – Aldridge acknowledges that “people think they're a happily ever after couple, which hardly ever happens in TV drama because there's no conflict, no drama. I think people do like the idea of them lasting and making it work, and who's to say, they might? But there are struggles along the way.”
Aldridge isn't convinced that Turner – who left the drama after one series to return to EastEnders – will ever reappear as Molly on screen. “I don't think you'll see their face but she's definitely very, very present in future episodes.”
As for Georgie, they “is very unclear from the moment that they put them in the helicopter on a stretcher, they don't know whether they meant what they said in the jungle and I think, when they next speak, they find out sort of what their true intentions are and where their head's at.”
But as we've seen in recent weeks, it's not just feelings for Georgie that are affecting Captain James; he's still reeling from the fallout to Elvis's death and the decisions that led to it. “He's got major doubts about their career in the army and, because of their PTSD, Molly and them are on the rocks as well.”
Their worries culminate in “these big, almost death bed-like confessions”. But Aldridge insists their character does have a future in the army. “He actually wouldn't know what to do with their life and as long as he's in [the army], he's got structure and purpose and I think part of the reason that they might even stay in, beyond their leg injury, is to do with 2 Sections and to do with Georgie and to do with the kind of family they have and that he's responsible for.”
The past two episodes have upped the stakes – and with Elvis's death at the end of last year, creator Tony Grounds has proven they have no qualms killing off major characters. But if Our Girl viewers think they've earned a breather, they shouldn't, er, hold their breath. “Fans are going to have to weather even more of a rollercoaster to come over the next four episodes because it stays high octane, it stays high drama. Hopefully they stick with us.”
And when they do return to screens, there is – in Aldridge's words – a “very , very unexpected” situation involving Bones which means Captain James has to come to the rescue…
Our Girl has four remaining episodes still to air as 2 Section moves on to work on a Rohingya refugee project on the Bangladesh/Myanmar border – and the asupervisorstioned “high octane” drama ensues.
These will be the last of the 12 instalments that were filmed back-to-back during an epic shoot last year in South Africa and Indonesia. Does Aldridge hope there will be more Our Girl beyond that? “I know that the BBC love it but it just depends on lots of factors – like getting to recommission, then getting the actors back to do it, with Michelle's availability and my availability.
“I know they are hopeful that it could [return] but I don't know anything more than that.”

Our Girl continues next Tuesday on BBC1 with timings dependent on World Cup football
Bill Hader made their hilarious return to Saturday Night Live this weekend, not only reprising their beloved Stefon character, but also finding a new role to play, that of fictional producer Thomas Logan, a.k.a. “Canadian Harvey Weinstein.”
The skit takes on a faux sexual harassment scandal in Canada, and in this scenario, everyone apologizes and resigns the moment they're accused of doing such harmless things as commenting “nice sweater” or asking “Where'd you get those sunglasses?” How novel!
Hader's Logan is interviewed by CBC News in the sketch, replete with stock photos of the Toronto skyline, Drake and Ryan Gosling (photoshopped standing next to Logan, obviously).
Logan is noted as having produced such cinematic marvels as Y'Don't Say, It Happened at Tim Horton's and Dave: The Dave Thomas Story.
During the mock interview, Logan says of being accused of misconduct, “Soon as I realized, I said I was sorry. So I go to HR, I say sorry, but I really put my boot in it this time, and the HR lady says, ‘No, I'm sorry, I should've seen this coming,' so I resigned and then they resigned, too.” And then, of course, the accuser resigned, as well.
The skit even features the members of Canadian band Arcade Fire, the night's musical guests, apologizing profusely.

Sweden's new ambassador to Zimbabwe, Sofia Calltorp, has said they would immediately start working to restart stalled investment here and resume exports from the southern African country that plummeted after the controversial land grab programme.
Welcoming pledges from President Robert Mugabe for improved cooperation after presenting their credentials at the State House on February 9, Calltorp — who has great experience from both the political arena and from the humanitarian field — said they also hoped for a “new phase of cooperation”, and that Zimbabwe's exports of clothing and textiles to Sweden, currently averaging a meagre $15 000 per annum, could be raised.
Mugabe struck a conciliatory tone after accepting Calltorp's Letter of Credence from Prime Minister Stefan Löfven — leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party who is also the head of government in Stockholm.
Zimbabwe desperately needs to revive manufacturing output and exports to stave off an economic collapse. The loss of export earnings has caused Zimbabwe's gross domestic product to shrink by almost a third.
“Several big Swedish companies are already present in Zimbabwe and we will continue to encourage Swedish investors to engage with the Zimbabwean market — especially with the increasing opportunities arising within the mining and agricultural sector,” Calltorp said referring to Zimbabwe's top forex earners.
“We will together with Open Trade Gate Sweden (OTGS) similarly continue to assist Zimbabwean producers and manufacturers that are keen to export to Sweden or to partner up with Swedish companies.”
OTGS provides requisite market intelligence to Zimbabwean companies, particularly those with the potential as well as the capacity to export to Sweden and the European Union (EU).
ZimTrade, in collaboration OTGS and the Embassy of Sweden in Zimbabwe, will host a seminar on ‘How to Export to Sweden' at the Holiday Inn in Bulawayo today where participants from the clothing, textiles as well as leather sector are expected to attend.
This session follows a similar seminar held in Harare in September last year.
The mother of two said Sweden's support to the Zimbabwean people dates back to the liberation struggle and was keen to see the continuous development of Zimbabwe.
They said they were “looking forward to sustaining and strengthen the longstanding relationship between Zimbabwe and Sweden.”
Sweden's commitment to Zimbabwe was also reflected in its development cooperation with Zimbabwe.
Each year Sweden provides $20-25 million in development assistance to the country via the United Nations (UN) and civil society.
“Sweden primarily supports initiatives that enhance gender equality, respect for rule of law and human rights, but also efforts that ensure that everyone has access to professional health services.
“Lastly, Sweden will provide more support to climate and environment programmes in the coming years,” they said.
Zimbabwe, led by 92-year-old Mugabe, has been subject to a series of restrictions, including an arms embargo and economic sanctions, imposed by the EU and the United States. But the EU has suspended sanctions against scores of Zimbabweans after the southern African country approved a new Constitution that curbed presidential powers in 2013.
The move underlines the growing belief in Brussels that Zimbabwe is pressing ahead with democratic reforms. Daily News

ALLENTOWN, Pa. — A contractor became trapped underneath a piece of machinery that was being removed from the pressroom of a Pennsylvania newspaper, suffering fatal injuries.
The Lehigh County coroner says the man became trapped at The Morning Call in Allentown on Tuesday afternoon. Crews have been dismantling the printing press after the paper's printing operations moved to Jersey City, New Jersey.
The coroner says the victim is a 32-year-old man from Cape Coral, Florida. Their name wasn't immediately released.
The Morning Call reports that newsroom workers heard a loud boom shortly after 5 p.m. The cause of the accident is under investigation.
Publisher and editor Robert York expressed “heartfelt sympathy” to the man's family and says the company is co-operating with authorities. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been notified of the contractor's death.
Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme apologized for kicking a photographer in the face during the band's performance at Saturday's KROQ Acoustic Christmas concert in Inglewood, California.
In two videos posted to Instagram, they explained the incident and issued their apology after getting blasted for their behaviour on social media: “Last night at a Queens of the Stone Age performance, I kicked the camera of a photographer, and that camera hit the photographer in the face, and the photographer's name was Chelsea Lauren. I'd just like to apologize to Chelsea Lauren. I don't have any excuse or reason to justify what I did … I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, and last night was definitely one of them. And I apologize for that to you. … I'm gonna have to figure out some stuff, I think, 'cause rock & roll is a wonderful thing. It's supposed to save and help people, not mess them up. So Chelsea Lauren: I hope you're OK, and I'm truly sorry. And I understand you have to do whatever you have to do. I just want you to know that I'm sorry.”

While speaking with Variety, Lauren, a Shutterstock photographer, said they felt Homme's behaviour was “obviously very intentional.” In fact, in a photo they posted to them Instagram, they can be seen smiling just before the incident.
They said, “He looked straight at me, swung their leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face. They continued performing, I was startled, I kind of stopped looking at him, I just got down and was holding my face because it hurt so badly.”
They were later taken for treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, and said, at the time of the incident, they planned to file a police report. Left with a bruised eyebrow and sore neck, in an Instagram post, Lauren wrote, “Thanks to Josh Homme, I now get to spend my night in the ER. Seriously, WHO DOES THAT?!?”
But that wasn't Homme's only instance of bizarre behaviour that night. At one point during the show, they also cut their own forehead with a knife, called the audience “retards” and declared “F–k Muse!” — the evening's headliner.
In 2008, they came under fire for similar behaviour on stage, after hurling homophobic comments at a fan during a concert in Norway, threatening to kick them in the face and then throwing a bottle at him.
It's just so hard being a rocker.
Acupuncture is gaining popularity around the world as a harmless, if unproven, alternative method of pain relief. But are some people taking the practice too far by using bee stings instead of needles?
A 55-year-old Spanish woman died after receiving live bee acupuncture, according to a case study published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology. The cause of death was a severe allergic reaction to the venom, though they had previously attended about 24 sessions.  They are believed to be the first person to die from the therapy despite previously showing no signs of an allergic reaction.
Here's everything you need to know about live bee acupuncture, and why some doctors are warning against it.
What is live bee acupuncture?
Apitherapy is the use of substances from honeybees to relieve various medical conditions. Some practices use honey or royal jelly, while live bee acupuncture uses the venom.
This acupuncture treatment, which originated in China, replaces thin metal needles with bee stings and is often practised by nonmedical practitioners. A bee is positioned directly over a relevant point on a patient's body and its head is squeezed repeatedly until the stinger comes out. The stinger is inserted into the skin, the venom is released and the bee dies.
What is it used for?
Like traditional acupuncture, it is often used to promote natural healing and pain relief. It is also touted as a treatment for arthritis, rheumatism, nerve pain, muscle conditions and even multiple sclerosis and asthma.
The Spanish woman used the therapy to improve “muscular contractures and stress,” the paper noted.
Does it work?
“Although some benefits of apitherapy have been reported, published evidence of its effectiveness and safety is limited, scarce, and heterogeneous,” the authors wrote.
Still, some practitioners and patients swear by it, including celebrity lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow, who credits bee venom for getting rid of an old injury.
“I've been stung by bees,” they told The New York Times in 2016. “People use it to get rid of inflammation and scarring. It's actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it's painful.”
Are there side effects?
A 2015 review published in the journal PLOS One examined 145 studies on bee venom treatments and found that potential side effects range from “trivial skin reactions that usually resolve over several days to life-threatening severe immunological responses such as anaphylaxis.”
Can I have an allergic reaction if I'm not allergic to bees?
Yes. Allergic reactions can range from mild, local swelling to anaphylactic shock or death and can develop over time. The Spanish woman was not allergic to bees, but after dozens of treatments, they developed a severe reaction. “Repeated exposure to the allergen was found to carry a greater risk of severe allergic reactions than in the general population,” the paper authors noted.
The woman had no clinical record of any other diseases or risk factors, yet they developed difficulty breathing and suffered from a sudden loss of consciousness immediately after they were stung by a bee. It took 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. They were treated with adrenaline and antihistamines, but they died in hospital several weeks later from multiple organ failures.
So is it safe?
Study authors Paula Vazquez-Revuelta and Ricardo Madrigal-Burgaleta from the Ramon y Cajal University Hospital in Spain recommended that patients should receive an allergy test and be fully informed of all the risks before undergoing live bee acupuncture. Practitioners should be trained to manage severe reactions and be able to guarantee swift access to a hospital in case of a life-threatening event.
However, since it may be impossible to implement these measures, the study authors recommended that people avoid the procedure.
“The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable.”
WINTERBERG, Germany — World champion Johannes Lochner led a German sweep of the podium in 4-man bobsled with their second World Cup win of the season on Sunday.

A farm in Ellesmere Port that provides a therapeutic horticulture environment for people living with mental health issues and learning difficulties has launched a veg box scheme.
Bridge Community Farms' Better Lives project invites individuals and companies to make a £500 cash donation to facilitate weekly fresh veg deliveries to charities across the region.
Many companies have already signed up to donate to the initiative but more are needed to fulfil the demand for the weekly fresh veg.
Charities that have signed up to be recipients of the veg boxes include Richmond Court in Chester, City Mission - The Soul Kitchen in Chester, Trinity Church in Ellesmere Port and The Salvation Army in Chester. Director of Bridge Community Farms Francis Ball said: “Our ‘Better Lives' boxes deliver enormous positive impact, and it is two-fold; these vital donations help fund our users to farm the land and receive the life-changing therapy we offer, and then the produce they farm further benefits other lives in the community.”
Bridge Community Farms also provides outdoor study facilities and work experience for young people.

Benedict Cumberbatch has declared themselves "honoured" after Sherlock topped a survey to find the world's favourite BBC television character.
Almost a third of viewers worldwide opted for the TV detective, with Doctor Who coming second and Idris Elba's Luther in third place.
Cumberbatch commented: "I'm honoured to hear that my portrayal of Sherlock has been internationally recognised as viewers' favourite BBC TV character.
"Who would have thought a high functioning sociopath could be so popular with people all over the world?”
There was more good news for Sherlock, as more than a quarter of respondents said the BBC's most memorable scene was them falling to theirs "death".
More than 7,000 adults from Australia, France, the USA, Germany, India, Japan and Mexico were surveyed, with Mexicans turning out to be the biggest fans of Sherlock.
Sherlock has become a favourite face on TV across the world as the drama is sold to 240 territories by BBC Worldwide (so there's no chance Cumberbatch can get away with going under the radar on their holidays).
The top 10 favourite BBC characters are:
Sherlock (29.7%) Doctor Who (17.6%) Luther (12.4%) Basil Fawlty (11.8%) The Stig (8.2% Patsy Stone (8.1%) Edmund Blackadder (7.4%) Hyacinth Bucket (6.1%) Vicar of Dibley (5.8%) The Daleks (5.6%)
When it comes to the most memorable scene, Sherlock falling to their "death" won by a wide margin - but there was also a lot of love for classic moments, including a Monty Python sketch, some Fawlty Towers and a certain scene from Pride and Prejudice.
HALIFAX — Jean Chretien has ignored a letter from Nova Scotia's lobbyist registrar asking if they lobbied the premier about a port proposal during a recent closed-door session that drew a citizen complaint.
The registrar of lobbyists, Hayley Clarke, asked the former prime minister about a March 21 meeting in Halifax with Premier Stephen McNeil and Transport Minister Geoff MacLellan.
Chretien is an international adviser to Sydney Harbour Investment Partners, which has been seeking investor support for the Cape Breton container port project. Chretien is not a registered lobbyist in Nova Scotia, and both McNeil and MacLellan denied they lobbied them or discussed the port project.
Following a complaint from a retired union activist, Clarke sent Chretien a letter providing information about the province's lobbying act, and asked for a response by the end of April.
“We ask they (Chretien) review their activities to ensure compliance and provide a response advising as to the results of their review within 30 days,” says a March 29 letter to the complainant, John McCracken.
No response came, Clarke's spokesperson told The Canadian Press.
“There has been no response to the Nova Scotia's Registrar of Lobbyists inquiry of the Hon. Jean Chretien following a complaint received from a member of the public,” Marla MacInnis said.
The Canadian Press sent written requests to Chretien and to an associate who often arranges media interviews but received no response.
Duff Conacher, the co-founder of Democracy Watch, said Chretien needs to clear up the issue before they resume conversations with politicians in the province.
“He should be showing and documenting that they have not crossed the line that the law establishes that requires registration. If he's not going to show the registrar, then the police should give them a call,” said Conacher.
McCracken said Chretien's lack of response demonstrates that Nova Scotia's lobbying law is “toothless.”
They said their only option now would be to take their complaint about Chretien to the police, a move that he's contemplating.
“It confirms everything I predicted at the time when I got my response from the registrar, which was that they (the registrar) were going to contact them and they (Chretien) was going to laugh in their face,” they said in an interview.
The day before the meeting, Chretien had attended a conference in Sydney and told reporters about their role as an international adviser to Sydney Harbour Investment Partners.
When a Cape Breton Post reporter asked Chretien how he'd market the Sydney container port to the premier, the former prime minister said they felt the premier would be in favour of a provincewide approach to container ports.
“He (McNeil) said, ‘He's for the development and they want development in Nova Scotia,' and he's the premier of all Nova Scotia. And there always competition between one city and another. But all the cities in Nova Scotia are in Nova Scotia, but they are the premier of Nova Scotia.”
The provincial Liberal government has been cautious about the Sydney proposal, as a 2016 study prepared for the province and the federal Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency recommended against public money for a terminal that would compete against the Halifax port.
As the interview continued, Chretien was asked if the province should invest money in the container port proposal, and they replied: “I hope so.”
When asked about another project along the Strait of Canso trying to develop a port, Chretien replied, “So what? I'm working for Sydney. I'm not working for them.”
Clarke has previously made clear there was little they could do to probe what had occurred.
“The role of the Registrar of Lobbyists is to administer the Registry of Lobbyists. The Registrar is not an enforcement agent,” MacInnis confirmed in an email to The Canadian Press.
A number of other provincial jurisdictions, including Ontario, and the federal commissioner of lobbying can probe citizen complaints and recommend police investigations.
Conacher said in an interview that he'd encourage McCracken to bring the media reports regarding Chretien's actions to the attention of police.
“He can say ‘There's this story, and there's this law, can you please check into what the (former) prime minister's been doing,”‘ they said.
Conacher said in most jurisdictions, commissioners do an investigation and bring the matter to police if it's considered a crime was potentially committed. They said Nova Scotia should set up a similar system.
“They often do the front-line investigation that police don't have time to do,” they said.
Nova Scotia legislation provides for a fine of not more than $25,000 for anyone who lobbies without registering first.
McCracken said they would have been content had Chretien registered as a lobbyist after their complaint, and agreed to follow the rules of lobbyists going forward.
These include requirements such as documenting if they have lobbied provincial politicians or government agencies on behalf of their client.
Nova Scotia's lobbyist registration law says lobbying includes communicating with a public servant “in an attempt to influence” the awarding of a contribution on behalf of government.
One of the definitions of a lobbyist under the Nova Scotia law is “an individual paid to lobby on behalf of a client.”
A person who does this is required to disclose their name, address and the name of the company they're lobbying on behalf of, and the “subject matter” of their lobbying and who they've contacted.
JUNEAU, Alaska — Philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has announced that wreckage of a sunken military ship on which five brothers died in World War II has been discovered in the South Pacific.
A spokesperson for Allen confirms wreckage from the USS Juneau was found Saturday off the coast of the Solomon Islands.
The ship was hit by Japanese torpedoes in 1942, killing hundreds of men, including the five Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa.
Allen has an expedition team that has reported finding wreckage of other ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, also sunk during World War II.
The expedition team says in a statement it first identified the USS Juneau on Saturday using sonar technology and used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to verify the wreckage on Sunday.

NEW YORK — Mike Smith scored 20 points and Columbia kept Dartmouth winless in the Ivy League with a 77-74 victory on Saturday night.
Quinton Adlesh added 18 points on 6 of 10 shooting from distance for the Lions (6-13, 3-3). Lukas Meisner scored 16 points and led with 11 rebounds. Kyle Castlin also scored 16 and Patrick Tape had 10 rebounds.
Adlesh sank three 3-pointers early and Smith and Meisner each added another to help Columbia to a 21-12 lead and the Lions were up 39-27 at intermission.
A hail of 3-pointers by both teams opened the second half and Columbia led 63-54 midway. Dartmouth's Ian Sistare drained a 3-pointer late to give the Big Green a 67-66 edge but it didn't last as Castlin replied with six straight points and Smith added a 3 to put Columbia up 75-72 with 1:06 left.
Adrease Jackson scored 24 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Big Green (4-15, 0-6) who are on a nine-game skid. Miles Wright added 19 points.
A lack of officials has become an issue in recent years, leading the associations which assign referees to games to ask schools to reschedule games from Friday to either Thursday or Saturday.
“The officials asked us,” Commander coach John McNeal said. “(Assistant) Coach (Regan) Ingram's dad is an official. They said the officials were struggling to fill all the games. They were trying to see if anybody would move to Thursday.”
McNeal said their school and Lancaster agreed to move up their game. They said they hope not to have to move up any more, though remaining on Friday runs the risk of having less than a full seven-man crew, which includes the on-field clock operator.
“I hope we did our duty,” McNeal said. “We want a full crew.”
The Commanders wrapped up their preseason last Saturday with a 6-0 jamboree win over visiting Franklin Road Academy.
Running back Ernie Gallatin scored on a 2-yard run with 5:34 left in the 30-minute dress rehearsal.
“We did very well defensively,” McNeal said. “We didn't give up a lot and scored once. I was pleased.”
Friendship also had no new injuries in the game. Senior back Jajuan (Speedy) Foutch, who missed almost all of last season with an injury, completed a healthy presesason.
“Speedy had a nice night,” McNeal said. “He had a couple of long runs and a pick.”
Bucs edge Bears in final seconds
MT. JULIET — Beech scored a touchdown and two-point conversion with 33 seconds to play to leapfrog past Mt. Juliet 15-14 in the third-annual Bears-vs.-Bucs Jamboree.
Lawson Rich's 34-yard touchdown broke a 7-7 tie for the Golden Bears.
Quarterback Cody Glass scored on a keeper to give Mt. Juliet a 7-0 lead.
“We were very fortunate to get into so many situations with our JV two quarters and our varsity two quarters,” Mt. Juliet coach Trey Perry said. “I was really pleased with the way our work went with a good football team in Beech.”
The Bears will open their regular season at 7 p.m. Friday at home against Glencliff.
Jarrod Dicker, CEO of Po.et, talked with Dan Patterson about how their company uses the blockchain to document media assets.
Watch the video, or read the full transcript of their conversation below:
Patterson: The decentralized media economy is here. What the heck is a decentralized media economy? Well, surprise, surprise, it runs on the blockchain. ... You have worked at The Washington Post, as well as RebelMouse and other media companies. First, why a startup? Why a blockchain startup? And, why Po.et?
Dicker: Three of the most frequent questions I get. So why a startup? I think my past three years at The Washington Post have been somewhat startup in a legacy media news organization, and the fact that we were run by Jeff Bezos, who owns the Post. It was an amazing time for news, right, and all news media.
There was a lot of momentum and excitement behind all the work that we were doing. Especially when we took it to the tech side. And one thing that I've always focused on throughout my career was how do we build a better model for the business of media, which is what I found extremely hard to do. It's also extremely hard to do within just one media company.
So over the past few years, I've been building something at The Washington Post called RED, Research Experimentation Development, where we were building new technologies and systems to use on the Post, off the Post, licensed white label to really help build a better media economy. Then I started really understanding not just the technologies behind blockchain, but the philosophies behind them.
The idea of consensus and decentralization. Coincidentally, Po.et approached me in terms of going there, becoming the chief executive officer, and building the team. We could get into how that all went down, but that's how I ended up here now.
Patterson: So the blockchain, this is possibly one of the most hyped technologies in recent memory. But it really is useful when you have to stamp a piece of asset, whatever that asset is. No matter whether it's gold and diamonds, or housing and real estate, or in this case, content. So a lot of us in media on the backend, we have content management systems and you can see a log of activity that is not necessarily for the public, but you can see what happens to a particular asset over time.
Why is a blockchain good for public pieces of media? And when I say assets, in this case we're referring to a post, or a video, or an audio podcast. Why is the blockchain so good at documenting those types of assets?
Dicker: Yeah, I think for one, a quick answer is the idea of immutability, right. The idea that something could be permanent and stored there. Mainly for attribution, being able to check to see who the owner of an idea is, whose authorship of a certain idea, and just make sure that that cannot be manipulated. I think that that's extremely important, but scary for a lot of media companies.
I've had a couple conversations where folks in media have said, "Well, that's terrifying because what if I need to redact a statement?" Right, or what if I need to take something down for advertisements? And where I think we'll see the value of blockchain in media is also like philosophically how we change the way that we think and build content and creative ideas in the media landscape. What I mean by that is right now, we are used to a web, where we can delete, where we can change, and where we can alter.
And what's really happened there is that people throw ideas out there, knowing that if they are wrong, they could change or delete, or things are not immutable, right, per se, which is what's happening on the blockchain. What I really hope beyond just the products of what it can do, is really that it'll change the way that we do things, right. Like in society today, there are consequences for things that you do. You can't just press the delete button or change, right. So you think about this sort of things before you actually act on them.
And I think what we've seen in the media landscape is that people are very quick to send ideas or shoot ideas out there, knowing that they can hide behind something, or knowing that they could change something. And what does it really mean when you need to kind of account for those ideas, and when they are living on a blockchain forever? So one of which, when it comes to media on the blockchain, I think is this idea of security, immutability.
SEE: What is blockchain? Understanding the technology and the revolution (free PDF) (TechRepublic)
This new notion that you are now in control of your ideas and of your assets, both in a public and private, public key, private key manner. And being able to take control of that, right. We at Po.et, really want to focus more on the long tail creators, like we are accessible for everyone. We aim to be a library of the world's creative assets on the blockchain and are building different ways for access and people to do so. Whether that's through, as you mentioned, a content management system, or going directly to Po.et, or within your own domains.
But once you do that, what can you actually do on the domain? And I think there are two major things. One is really being able to own and manage your ideas. So how do you issue a content license? What should that cost? How can you make sure that your ideas are being heard and transacted on? An example that I give often and we see it every single day on Twitter, is that if you put something up on Twitter, which is a piece of media that can go viral beyond just the at replies, there's also Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed, and others saying, "Hey, Dan. I love this. Do you mind if I use this?"
And at that moment, you really have already put it on Twitter and you just assume, "Sure, right. It's already out there." Well, what if you had the opportunity to say, "Oh, there's clearly value in this content I'm creating. Sure, here's my private key with the smart contract and rules that you need to abide by if you want to license and leverage this content."
So that is one thing that I think is extremely important that we'll learn both in terms of changing a behavior about applications of using blockchain for media. The other is this idea of transparency, as you mentioned, and reputation, right. In everything that we do in life, reputation matters. Like if you go to a hotel, you're going to look at the ratings. If you ride in an Uber, you look at ratings. Every single thing is based on that transparency and reputation. Even if you're going to eat something, right.
Truth could be subjective, information could be subjective. Like the same way that you would look at maybe the back of a carton of milk and say, "Okay, there's a lot of fat, but I'm cool with it." Or, you may say, "No, like I don't want all that fat." But when it comes to information and transparency, that doesn't really exist. So I think this idea of building reputation for creators, not just to say, "That this creator tells the truth and this creator doesn't tell the truth." But just give transparency as to the way that they navigate it-
Patterson: Yeah, ownership and the attribution-
Dicker: Exactly.
Patterson: Yeah.
Dicker: Exactly, and be able to see, has it been fact-checked? Right, who has seen it? Has this person published before? They've taken this picture in Sri Lanka, are they actually in Sri Lanka? Right, or are they in New Jersey? So I think that sort of information really is applicable, especially nowadays, when it comes to deep fakes and people putting information out there, to really just get more exposure and transparency to the end consumer, so that they can make decisions on their own based on what they're consuming.
Patterson: Yeah, so the obvious use cases could be said, iStock photo and allowing creators to control the assets that are there. But also social media, as well as news content, or almost any piece of content where an exchange of trust has to happen. And really what you're talking about with transparency, is the exchange of trust equity. And being able to say, "This is the process by which a particular asset exists in an ecosystem, and you can vet and verify it using the blockchain." So you use the Ethereum blockchain.
Dicker: We use the ERC-20.
Patterson: Yeah, so explain to me how that applies to Po.et, not just in terms of content, but you are building a content library. Why did you elect to use Ethereum? What are some of the advantages of that? And, is this the next emerging hot blockchain?
Dicker: So I want to back up and just make it clear. We stamp on the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the most secure blockchain. We leverage Ethereum for ERC-20 tokens because Po.et is a token dynamic-type model. In that, to build reputation, we need to build incentive systems, and that's why the Po.et token exists to help fuel and challenge the marketplace in order to get the best content up and the worst content down.
I think with Ethereum, the most interesting thing that's happening is that they are opening up with these ERC-20 tokens and beyond, the opportunity for people to build their technologies on top of it. And that's where you've kind of seen a huge movement towards that blockchain and the opportunities of that blockchain. There's also companies like ConsenSys out in Bushwick, that are building right on top of this, companies for every single pocket of the industry that could leverage blockchain for proof, right, of value and really what it could really become.
That is definitely happening to answer your question. Like that trend is moving and there's a lot of accessibility there. Now that being said, we're way off, right, from building scalable blockchain solutions when it comes to enterprise and conversations that we would have had three years ago when I was at The Washington Post in talking about technologies built there. So that is somewhat exciting because I don't believe that we are dead set on one blockchain for anything.
SEE: Blockchain: An insider's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)
Po.et's ambitions and the partnerships that we have and others that are building on top of the work that we're doing, are kind of opening up the same opportunity. Look, Po.et is build a protocol that is helping build reputation on the web. And if you want to help leverage that, to help build reputation within your applications, then you should build on Po.et. There's a company called Encrypt that's building on top of Po.et, which is really looking to circumvent censorship when it comes to information delivery.
So if you are posting an article or have a website, and you are concerned that your IP could be blocked, how can you leverage Encrypt to make sure that that information is then spread out in a bunch of different devices and not just one central server? To then be able to come back and have that information delivered, and that's something that's being built on top of Po.et. There are other conversations of people in media that are looking for certain solutions that want to build on top of what we're doing, as well.
So we leverage Bitcoin blockchain just because it's an easy marketing example to say, "Look. If you value your money and you trust Bitcoin blockchain because money is the most important thing to you at this moment, well, your ideas are equally important, right? And if your ideas are important, you want them to be as secure as your money." But there are opportunities for us to port to either. There are opportunities for us to mimic or build our own.
I think it's still early days, but the biggest thing that we're looking to do now is influence a space that could benefit from new thinking, right, the business of media really trying to figure out how to strengthen media companies, how to allow them to evolve, how can get we give power back to creators, right?
How do we give velocity to independent thought and a platform, where people could drive revenue and earn what they should earn, based off their ideas? An analogy ... Or, sorry. I hate sports analogies, but an analogy-
Patterson: I love sports analogies-
Dicker: And hopefully, the audience does, as well. But the way that free agency works in sports, right, does not really exist when it comes to media or content. So each writer is somewhat valued the same. I mean, we look at certain nuances like Twitter followers, or tenure, right, or work that they've completed.
But in sports, you have this opportunity where every single quarterback is rated, right, in front of the public based on their skillset, based on their salaries, based on all these different set of criteria.
In media, that really doesn't exist, right. So what if we can build this sort of valuations and services to set up, so that we can actually pinpoint the value of content and the value of media that everyone is creating, which personally, I believe is extremely undervalued right now.
And I'm sure you agree, as well, and anyone who works in this space constantly is telling people that, "Content cost money. Content is valuable. It costs a lot to create great content. If you want good content, you need to pay for it."
But I think what we need to do is start proving these things, and in order to prove these things, we need to set up dynamics and platforms in order to do so, and that's kind of what we're doing here.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers spend their careers eying coveted committee chairpersonships, angling for the chance at the perks and power that came with the top spot.
Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen is bowing out after one term.
Frelinghuysen's announcement Monday that they would not seek re-election, giving up the chairpersonship of the House Appropriations Committee, punctuated the dwindling prestige and influence of the positions once consider an apex of power on Capitol Hill. Term limits, legislative dysfunction and gridlock-inducing polarization have gradually tarnished the very chairpersonships that are so prized.
"Before the farm bill and my tenure as chairperson, I had neither grey hair nor did I take hypertension medicine. I now have both for the rest of my life," said former House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla. "Right now you have to deal with a situation where you have the extreme demands of the left on one side of the room and the extreme demands of the right on the other side."
Frelinghuysen is the eighth House committee chair to head for the exits, and a striking case study for the dynamics at play.
The New Jersey Republican became chairperson of the Appropriations Committee last year after serving for several years as chairperson of its defense subcommittee.
But Frelinghuysen's year in charge of the panel has been frustrating. In theory, they manage the process of doling out one-third the federal budget. But he's had scant success on that front. Although they helped successfully negotiate a catchall spending bill last spring, the appropriations process for the ongoing budget year has been hamstrung by delays in the Senate and faces the very real danger of running aground completely amid an unrelated months-long battle over immigration.
"Serving as chairperson of the Appropriations Committee is a difficult and sometimes thankless job," said Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, the panel's top Democrat.
There have been fewer thank-yous since a series of GOP reforms changed the rules. In a push to curb corruption in 2010, Republicans officially banned "earmarks," severally limiting lawmakers' capacity to direct tens or even hundreds of millions to one's district or state for "earmarked" pet projects. The earmarks were a prerogative of the chairperson, both to bolster their political standing at home and to court votes with fellow lawmakers of either party.
House GOP rules mean chairpeople cycle through six-year terms, which also counts time as ranking minority member. Chairmen are selected by a leadership panel that takes factors such as fundraising and conservative litmus tests into consideration.
Old-timers such as former Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., say the system centralizes legislative authority with party leaders, who are often less versed in the nuts and bolts of legislation and have little appreciation for the committee's bipartisan traditions.
"I often would laugh, express frustration together with Rosa DeLauro, who's as liberal as they can be," Kingston recalled of one of their Democratic counterparts on Appropriations until they left Congress in 2015. "We said if leadership of both parties would get the heck out of the way, we could get something done."
Other chairpeople, such as Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, of Financial Services and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., of Judiciary are leaving after being forced to yield their gavels next year under term limit rules. They were denied signature wins under President Barack Obama — but they have not managed such wins under President Donald Trump, at least so far. They'd rather leave Congress than return to the rank and file.
A moderate Republican in both their politics and temperament, Frelinghuysen was first elected in the 1994 GOP wave that put Republicans in control of both chambers. They hail from a New Jersey political dynasty that dates to the late 1700s. Their father, Peter Frelinghuysen, served in the House for two decades.
Unlike several other GOP chairpeople to announce their retirements after running up against GOP term limit rules for panel heads, Frelinghuysen had years to go as Appropriations chair — assuming Republicans retain control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections. But they angered some conservative lawmakers over votes against the GOP tax overhaul measure last year and their opposition to an initial version of the party's effort to repeal Obama's health care law.
Trump's sagging popularity is weighing on once-safe Republicans in educated, wealthier suburban districts such as Frelinghuysen's, where some residents could be negatively affected by provisions in the new tax law that went into effect this year.
Still, Frelinghuysen's vote against the GOP's tax law was highly unusual and was seen as a signal of their political vulnerability. And it was unheard of for such a high-ranking chairperson to buck the leadership line on such a major vote.
Among the leading Democrats for Frelinghuysen's seat is former federal prosecutor and former Navy helicopter pilot Mikie Sherrill. They raised more than $1.2 million through Dec. 31 and has the backing of local party leaders.
Republican insiders say Frelinghuysen's decision wasn't entirely a surprise. They say several potential candidates could build viable campaigns quickly.
Among the possible GOP candidates are three state lawmakers: Assemblyman Jay Webber, Assemblyman Anthony M. Bucco and Sen. Joe Pennacchio. Another prominent name mentioned is attorney Rosemary Becchi.
Frelinghuysen's district had long leaned Republican but was carried only narrowly by Trump in 2016. Nonpartisan analysts say Democrats have a good chance to grab it in this year's midterms.
Frelinghuysen took the lead in the House in a difficult 2013 effort to provide about $60 billion to help New Jersey and other northeastern states recovery from Superstorm Sandy.
"Public service is an incredible way to turn your convictions into something that serves the greater good and to do it alongside people from every walk of life and background," Frelinghuysen said.

NEW YORK (AP) — The luxe womenswear brand owned by the estranged wife of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has canceled its show at New York Fashion Week.
The Marchesa show was scheduled to take place on Feb. 14. In a brief statement Wednesday, Marchesa says its collection will be presented in a different format than a traditional runway show or presentation.
The brand has been a mainstay of red carpets for years. But there's been a Marchesa blackout since Weinstein was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.  They are being investigated by police in New York and California for rape.
Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, left them shortly after the allegations arose last year. They firmly condemned Weinstein's alleged actions but has been mum about Marchesa.
JAMB Cancels Results Of 59,698 Candidates, Blacklists 48 CBT Centres, Suspends 24 Others
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has now officially cancelled the results of 59,698 candidates over examination malpractices during the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).
This is even as the Board said it has blacklisted 48 Computer-Based Test (CBT) centres over their involvement in extortion and organised examination malpractices during the 2017 UTME.
JAMB's Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja at a news conference at the end of an enlarged meeting with external examiners and other stakeholders in the conduct of the 2017 UTME.
“The (24 CBT) centres will not participate in the 2018 UTME, but they can be reconsidered for 2019 and above. “The delisting of 48 centres from participating in the board's examination in future is as a result of serious technical deficiencies, extortion, organised examination malpractices and other damaging infractions.”
According to him, 1,386 candidates have their results cancelled over examination malpractice; 57,646 results were also affected as a result of centres-induced malpractices while the results of 666 candidates were cancelled due to multiple examinations.
The cancelled results were fewer than the 76,923 initially withheld by the examination body when the results of the 2017 UTME were announced on 31 May.
Oloyede had said the final figure of annulled results would be announced after a thorough investigation.
They said that JAMB had fixed July 1, 2017 as the date for supplementary examination for candidates who registered late for this year's UTME.
Oloyede added that some of the candidates whose results were cancelled, would also take part in the rescheduled exam.
There may be a second chance for some of the candidates to seat for a supplementary UTME, according to Oloyede, especially for those deemed innocent of centre-induced exam cheating.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — It will be a first for Zimbabwe's voters: the name of Robert Mugabe, 94, won't be on the ballot when elections are held on July 30. But the military-backed system that kept the former leader in power for decades, and then pushed them out, is still in control.
That is the conundrum facing a southern African country anxious to shed its old image as an international pariah, and to draw the foreign aid and investment needed for an economic revival. The government promises a free and fair vote and the military, whose 2017 takeover led to Mugabe's resignation, says it won't stray from the barracks.
Some Zimbabweans, though, wonder how much things have really changed.
They ask whether the ruling ZANU-PF party and military would accept an opposition victory.
Even the town's name was a problem. Originally spelled “Pyongchang” in English, it was often confused with Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. So in 2000, the town added a letter, capitalized another and changed its name to “PyeongChang,” though most foreign news agencies declined to use the capital C.
Despite the rebranding, a Kenyan man registered to attend a United Nations meeting in Pyeongchang in 2014 made headlines after they flew to Pyongyang by mistake.

In time, though, South Korea embraced Pyeongchang's bid for the Games as its own. The nation's leaders were eager to build global prestige and saw the Winter Games as a chance to become one of only a handful of countries that have hosted a “trifecta” of international sports events. (The World Cup took place in South Korea and Japan in 2002, and Seoul hosted the Summer Games in 1988.)
In a country where winter sports never quite caught on, only one other town with ski slopes, Maju, was interested in hosting the Olympics. Pyeongchang edged it out for national support, perhaps because it sits in a province that has been a major electoral battleground.
The government has poured $13 billion into the region, building a new bullet train and highway — and 63 tunnels and 78 bridges — to improve access to Pyeongchang from Seoul, as well as sporting facilities such as ice rinks and ski slopes.
While some residents worried about the impact on local forests, support for the Olympic bid has been almost universal in Pyeongchang: A poll taken at the time of the first bid showed nearly 94 percent support, and it has not wavered.

Many believe the area's future lies in bolstering tourism and are hopeful the Winter Games will help. The service sector already accounts for 70 percent of the local economy, in part because vacationers drawn to the province's scenic coast. But inland Pyeongchang has not really benefited; it's betting that the Olympics will change that.

In lobbying for its bid, South Korea used a potential handicap — Pyeongchang's proximity to the North Korean border, in a region bristling with troops and weaponry — as a selling point. Holding the Games in Pyeongchang, officials argued, would promote peace between two nations still technically at war.
The North did agree to send 22 athletes to the Games, and the two countries agreed to field a joint women's ice hockey team.
A third of South Korea's 600,000 military personnel are based in Gangwon Province. Many who were posted here as conscripts — all men in South Korea are required to serve about two years in the military — say they never want to see it again, so rugged are its hills and cold its winters.

Suspicion of North Korea is deeply etched here, as nowhere else in South Korea. The mountainous border is scarred with barbed wire, tank traps, land mines and guard posts. Hilltop loudspeakers blare K-pop songs daily toward the North, which counters by sending propaganda leaflets floating on balloons into the South.
Dreams of easing tensions and reunifying with the North one day are also more acutely felt here than anywhere else in South Korea. Many older people in the area came from the North as war refugees, settling near the border in hopes of returning quickly once the Koreas were reunified.
”Our dream is to one day take the train to go to North Korea and all the way across Siberia and to Berlin,” said Noh Yeon-su, curator of the DMZ Museum, referring to roads and rail lines that stop at the border, essentially making South Korea an island.
The province is also home to the so-called Peace Dam, a towering structure built on the Han River because of fears that another dam upstream in North Korea might release a killer flood, by accident or on purpose.
And it was in nearby Gangneung, where the ice hockey and speedskating events are scheduled to be held, that a North Korean submarine ran aground in 1996. Twenty-six crewmen and agents spilled out, setting off a huge manhunt in the area.
But Mr. Choi, the governor, shrugs off such concerns.
“Those of us who live here are not afraid of North Korea because the North, despite all its missile tests and bombast, doesn't have an ability to fight a war,” they said. The economic output of their province, the South's poorest, they noted, exceeds that generated by all of North Korea.

They added, “The happiest thing about the Olympics is that when foreigners see the Games taking place here, we can shake off our stigma as a dangerous place.”
As fans of ‘Fast & Furious' will be aware, the series seems to be in a spot of bother at the moment – so who better to steer it back on course than the director who arguably made the series what it is today?
Yes, it seems that Justin Lin is being courted to return to take the helm on ‘Fast & Furious 9,' after the sequel had its original release date pushed back a year to make room for a spin-off movie centred on Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw (which Shane Black is said to be in line to direct).
According to The Hollywood Reporter, sources close to the ‘Fast & Furious' team say that Lin “may be lining up to return to the franchise and is the top man to helm the core entry of ‘Fast 9.‘”
The 45-year old Taiwan-born filmmaker is the most prolific director of the series, having called the shots on four instalments in a row, from 2006's third film ‘The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift' through to 2013's ‘Fast & Furious 6.' They have since directed 2016's ‘Star Trek Beyond.'
2011's ‘Fast Five,' directed by Justin Lin (credit: Universal) More
Much as with JJ Abrams being brought to back to direct the troubled ‘Star Wars Episode IX,' it would be entirely logical for Lin to return to ‘Fast & Furious.' It was under their direction that the series metamorphosed from a series of fairly small scale street racer/crime thrillers, into the megabudget action blockbuster juggernaut we know today.
Series figurehead Vin Diesel has long since voiced their hopes that Lin would eventually return to the series for the intended series finale ‘Fast & Furious 10,' so it hardly seems outside the realms of possibility that the director could return sooner.
No doubt there would be hopes that the presence of the trusted director might ease the troubled waters behind the scenes on ‘Fast & Furious,' a series steadily becoming more famous for its off-camera feuds than its on-camera action.
Dwayne Johnson and Tyrese Gibson in happier times. More
On top of the heavily reported clash between Diesel and Dwayne Johnson on ‘Fast & Furious 8,' tempers are now flaring between Johnson and Tyrese Gibson over the Hobbs/Shaw spin-off movie. Plus we might recall that earlier this year Michelle Rodriguez threatened to quit the series unless “they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise.”
Still, there is no confirmation that Lin will direct ‘Fast & Furious 9' at present; the director is also attached to the in-development ‘Hot Wheels' movie and ‘Space Jam 2.'
‘Fast & Furious 9' is lined up for release on 14 February 2020, whilst Johnson and Statham's spin-off is due 16 July 2019.

On Monday evening, I filed a column predicting Torontonians would take the attack on Yonge Street pedestrians in their stride: process the shock, mourn the dead, heal the injured, support their families, and honour them all by carrying on as normal while the justice system takes care of the accused murderer, or terrorist, or whatever the hell they are.
As the evening wore on, though, my pride overcame my confidence and I found myself genuinely impressed — maybe even a little surprised.
It happened during the Leafs game — the team's most thrilling deserved playoff win since … well, who can remember? Unscientifically, I would say the joint was far more raucous than it would be for your average playoff game (so, medium raucous). But seeing the same throng of fans watching outside, especially, made me think it just as easily might not have happened at all.
Game time was a mere five-and-a-half hours after the attack. Police may have been confident by mid-afternoon that this had been a one-man job, but they can't have been absolutely confident. I don't think anyone would have been surprised or upset had they postponed the game “for safety reasons” or even “out of respect for the victims.” But I didn't hear anyone so much as mention the possibility.
It's not that “the terrorists would have won” otherwise, but there is something to that instinct. There is real value for a city and its people in feeling themselves carrying on, and in being seen carrying on. That's no slight on any other city that's gone into lockdown or a prolonged state of emergency: many recent attacks have ended with unknown numbers of suspects on the run or barricaded in buildings. Many Western countries simply have larger populations of people who wish the greater society ill than does Canada. But I found myself surprised and hugely heartened that Toronto, a cautious place in many respects, had forged ahead.
Then there was Toronto Police Const. Ken Lam, who stared down the suspect and who wouldn't fire their weapon even as the suspect repeatedly mimed drawing a gun. “Kill me,” the man from the van demanded. “No,” Lam calmly replied. They holstered their gun and took the coward alive.
Alek Minassian will have to answer to the allegations against him. Ideally, we'll learn just what is alleged to have turned them to slaughter with no apparent notice, and how dangerous that force might be. Perhaps most valuable for the city's soul, an armed deputy of Toronto society behaved in a profoundly humane way toward someone who had just done the opposite — and was seen doing it around the world.
(Part of me wants to say this is exactly what we should expect from our police officers — and no doubt exactly what we get from them every day, in countless situations that don't make it to YouTube. But fat chance I'd be here criticizing Const. Lam had they pulled the trigger.)
Perhaps part of Toronto's apparent equanimity is that it hasn't all sunk in yet. As I write this, the majority of victims have yet to be identified and their stories told. There's no point pretending it's not somewhat unsettling. We all know that weak, vulnerable, pathetic or otherwise maladjusted young men are susceptible to all manner of radicalization, from street gangs to ISIL to — ugh, really? — an online woman-hating army of “involuntarily celibate” men to which Minassian may have pledged allegiance. But the knowledge is of no use when the white van man picks the sidewalk you happen to be walking on.
Ten people are dead, and scores of lives have been changed forever by a senseless act of violence. There is no silver lining, but mass casualty events can have a galvanizing effect that accumulated individual atrocities cannot. The list of thus-far-identified victims shows that the impact is being felt across cultures, religions and oceans. Remarking on this on Twitter, journalist and McGill professor Andrew Potter said they used to tell students to ride the Bloor-Danforth subway line from end to get the real measure of just how multicultural this place is. It's true. I've lived here most of my life and it still even amazes me.
Of course, what's happening in Toronto happens elsewhere. Toronto isn't the only high-functioning multicultural city. But perhaps nowhere bangs on quite so much about diversity being a societal strength than Canada, and Toronto specifically. Like any patriotic meme, it can become tiresome.
Unlike a good few of them, though, it's actually true. Healthy reactions have been front and centre in the aftermath of Monday's attack; unhealthy ones have been relegated to the dankest depths of Twitter. Whatever may have motivated the attacker to madness on Yonge Street, the response will stand as a powerful rejection of it.

MP Justin Madders is calling on the Government to do ‘everything possible' to protect the future of Vauxhall in Ellesmere Port.
The car-maker and its 4,500 workers across its Ellesmere Port and Luton manufacturing plants were plunged into uncertainty when news emerged that it could be bought by the owner of Peugeot.
French company PSA – which also makes Citreon and DS cars – is currently engaged in talks regarding the ‘potential acquisition' of General Motors' European Opel business, which includes Vauxhall.
While a spokesperson for PSA has insisted there could be ‘no assurance that an agreement will be reached' at this stage, Ellesmere Port and Neston MP Mr Madders and City of Chester MP Chris Matheson have expressed their concern.
Mr Madders told The Chronicle: “These reports are of course of concern to everyone working at the Vauxhall factory although it is important to note nothing has been decided yet.
“I am seeking an urgent meeting with the Business Secretary when Parliament returns next week.
“I will be asking them to give an assurance that the Government will intervene and do everything possible to protect the future of this plant.
“The plant has an excellent production record and the UK remains a hugely important market for new sales.
“Those two facts will hopefully put Ellesmere Port in a strong position for whatever lies ahead.”
A deal between General Motors and PSA would make PSA into Europe's second-largest car-maker, with a 16% share of the European market.
In total, the Vauxhall brand employs around 35,000 people in the UK.

The Ellesmere Port plant – where the Astra model is built – was threatened with closure in 2012, when General Motors restructured its European operations.
It was saved by a deal brokered by trade unions and then business secretary Vince Cable travelling to America to reassure the motor giant about the Government's support for the industry.
Referencing this, Mr Matheson said: “Over the years, unions and management have worked hard to keep the Ellesmere Port plant productive and profitable through many periods of change.
“Any uncertainty like this is never helpful so we wait to hear of further news but I am confident that the workers at Ellesmere Port have demonstrated their skill and dedication, and any owner – General Motors or PSA – would be mad to disregard that.”
Union boss Len McCluskey has vowed that plants in the UK ‘will not be allowed to close'.
The Unite general secretary is also calling upon the Government to step up to secure General Motors' jobs and plants following the ‘out of the blue' news.
“We are absolutely determined of one thing – UK plants will not be allowed to close,” they said.
“I have no intention of allowing GM to walk away from their promises and our plants and workers.
“So my message to the workers at Luton, Ellesmere Port and the tens of thousands in the wider supply chain is this, remain strong and stay united.
“The UK and the EU are among GM's biggest markets globally – if they think that they can walk away from dedicated workers and loyal consumers without a care, they need to think again.”
NEW YORK — John Mellencamp sank to their knees in support of the Black Lives Matter movement after a performance on “Late Show With Stephen Colbert" on Thursday evening.
The musician performed their song "Easy Target" to which was originally released on the eve of President Trump's inauguration in January 2017.
The song addresses racial inequality and Mellencamp references the Black Lives Matter movement with their lyrics such as:
"So Black Lives Matter, who we're tryin' to kid. Here's an easy target. Don't matter, never did."
"All of us are created equal - equally beneath me and you."
At the end of their performance, Mellencamp knelt and lifted their right fist into the air.
The song comes from Mellencamp's album “Sad Clowns & Hillbillies,” which came out late last year.
You can watch their performance below.
The movement was started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last season. They took a knee during the National Anthem to silently protest racial inequality and treatment of black Americans, particularly by police.
The protests prompted President Donald Trump to tweet that NFL owner should "fire or suspend" players that "disrespect" the "flag & country."
“Taking the knee started purely and simply as a protest of racial and social injustice,” Mellencamp told The Associated Press. “Sadly it was politicized by the current administration. The song is simple and the protest is pure.”

OAKLAND — It seemed like if anyone might bite on the Bryan Colangelo question at NBA Finals media day, it would be Draymond Green.
And so the outspoken Warriors forward was asked about the story that was much discussed here, a report on The Ringer website that suggested Colangelo, the Philadelphia 76ers president and general manager who previously did that job in Toronto and Phoenix, could be operating as many as five anonymous Twitter accounts that tended to defend Colangelo while blasting various Sixers players and disclosing sensitive team information.
Alas, no.
“I've had my social media mishaps before, too,” said Green, before saying they were focused on the Cleveland Cavaliers and winning a championship and various other non-juicy sound bites.
And so, it was left to everyone else to wonder what the Colangelo story might mean to an ascendant Sixers franchise and a GM who is a basketball lifer. Colangelo themselves remained quiet on Wednesday, with their only response a team-issued statement that said they were not behind four of the Twitter accounts and only used one, from which no tweets had been posted.
The team said it would launch an independent investigation into the accounts, which as documented by the The Ringer have a number of similarities in both things they have tweeted and in accounts that they follow. Three of them were changed to private accounts shortly after The Ringer contacted the Sixers to inquire about the other two accounts, a coincidence for which there has yet to be an explanation.
***
With about five minutes left in the second quarter of Game 7 between Houston and Golden State on Monday night, James Harden picked off a sloppy pass by Green and raced down the court for a dunk that gave the Rockets a 15-point lead. Warriors coach Steve Kerr called a timeout and, it was admitted on Wednesday, everyone yelled at each other for a while.
“That timeout was a little chaotic. I think we were frustrated,” Kerr said.
Steph Curry said, “It was kind of everybody just getting the anxiety off their chest.” Green said it was “everybody pretty much yelling the same thing.”
Asked specifically what was said in the huddle, no one would provide specifics, possibly to avoid repeating cuss words.
“I think at the end of the day all I said was, ‘We got it off our chest, let's move on and win a basketball game and let's do it together,'” Curry said. “That sounds very Disney Channel-type movies, but that's what we needed, to kind of turn the page and focus on the game and how we were going to win.”
Kevin Durant said the Warriors just “talked it out.”
“We didn't take it personally when guys had stuff to say. We moved past it pretty quickly, and knew what we had to do to get back into the game.” That 15-point lead was the largest that the Rockets would have all night, and the Warriors outscored them 68-44 from that point forward.
“We came out the huddle as one,” Durant said. “We might have walked into it separately, but we came out as one.” Kind of like a line from a Disney Channel movie, really.
***
Although the Warriors have done a lot as a team — the 73-win season, the two titles — and as individuals, they are not above taking some playful umbrage at suggestions that their resumes are not perfect. Asked if their career was defined by some big shots they hit in last year's final, Durant said thought they had done pretty well before those games. Later, asked about learning to have a short memory, they played slightly wounded again: “Well, this is my 11th year in the NBA. I know a lot of people probably didn't watch me play before I got to the Warriors,” they said. “But I was in the league before I got here, and I learned a lot along that time. I actually won an MVP award. I went to the Olympics. Scored a couple points.”
During Curry's turn at the podium they were asked whether the fact that they had never been Finals MVP — they have been the regular-season MVP twice — would likely be a story this time around. “It took to the second question of my first media availability, so I'm pretty sure that narrative's going to take life, as it has since 2015,” they said. “But it doesn't make or break my career or whatever you want to say looking back. If we win this championship and I don't win Finals MVP, I'm going to be smiling just as wide and just as big.”
The Finals MVPs in Curry's three previous trips here were Andre Iguodala, LeBron James and Durant.
***
Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue took a brief leave of absence from their team during the regular season, citing chest pains that were exacerbated by the stress and anxiety of the job. One of the people who contacted them during that time was Kerr, who missed a long stretch of time last season with back problems.
“The main message was, you can't allow what feels like the enormity of the job to interfere with your health and your recovery and whatever you need to do,” Kerr said on Wednesday. “I just told them the team will still be there when you get back.”
“But sometimes I think in this job because there is so much passion from the fan bases and because everybody wants to win so badly, it feels bigger than it really is. So, just kind of reminder that we're playing a sport.”
***
James acknowledged that, at 33 years old, they are at least a couple of seasons beyond what is generally considered to be the prime part of an NBA career. They don't happen to agree.
“I've just never really bought into that,” they said. “I've never bought into a ceiling either. You guys talked about what's your ceiling, and I've always kind of told you guys that I don't really have a ceiling. I want to just try to maximize as much as I can and be as good as I can.”
James said they have worked hard to stay healthy and has been lucky enough to only miss a couple of practices all season.
“I've put in the work,” they said. “It's allowed me to be able to tomorrow suit up for the 101st consecutive time. If I'm fortunate, I can suit up for -— what is it, 108? We'll see what happens.”
It will be a surprise if these Finals gets all the way to Game 108, but point taken.

The second episode of the BBC1 drama had several revealing scenes – some more welcome than others
In an emotionally-charged second episode of Poldark , there was the occasional scene of light relief.

But some were more welcome than others…
After teaching their brother to wrestle, Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) was treated to a bath by Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson) – and viewers were here for it:
What happened in Poldark this week? I passed out at seeing Ross in the bath. Lucky Demelza #Poldark — Amanda Hepburn (@AmandaHepburn3) June 17, 2018
I was literally typing a tweet saying #Poldark has jumped the shark but then Ross obligingly had a bath and I'm back in the room — Harriet Evans (@HarrietEvans) June 17, 2018

I flick over to #Poldark and the boys are wrestling and then Ross is having a bath. Merry Christmas to me. — Kitty Gallagher (@KittyLovesDucks) June 17, 2018
However, things then went from the sublime to the ridiculous.
Later in the episode, odious vicar Ossie Whitworth was back to their revolting best as they got down and dirty with their foot fetish. And, understandably, viewers were wishing the scene had come with a health warning:
The sight of that toe sucking vicar in #Poldark is something I'll not b able to unsee for a long time.🤮Thankful I wasn't eating! #Eeewww — Cath (@purpleglostick) June 17, 2018

Poldark continues 9pm Sunday on BBC1
ASK FOR ANGELA: Royal Hotel staff member Mackenzi Finger wants everyone to have a safe night out in Gympie.
ASK FOR ANGELA: Royal Hotel staff member Mackenzi Finger wants everyone to have a safe night out in Gympie. Renee Albrecht
A NORMAL enough night out should never turn into irretrievable disaster, but it can happen.
Royal Hotel owner Stacey Lowe says people who feel things have become unsafe now have an escape route.
Anyone at their hotel who finds themselves in some sort of trouble can now "ask for Angela”.
The Ask for Angela campaign is new here, but originated in Lincolnshire in Britain.
It has now been brought to Australia by Ms Lowe's daughter, Mackenzi Finger.
"The general idea is that if you are out for the night and feel uncomfortable, you can now ask a member of the hotel staff for 'Angela' and they can get you a taxi, help you leave discreetly or help in any other way to get you into a more comfortable situation,” they said.
Mackenzi thought it was a good idea when they heard about it in England and was reminded of it while working at the hotel one recent Saturday night, when they received a text message from a girlfriend needing "help on the smokers' deck”.
Mackenzi went to their friend and told them someone was asking for them and was there to pick them up.
"Venue owners and operators will need to ensure all staff and security know the system,” they said.
"It's another step in creating the safest environment we can for visitors and people in our community when they are in our venues, late at night or otherwise.”
The actor plays Osbourne Whitworth's mother in the new series of the BBC drama
There was much excitement when it was announced that Rebecca Front was joining the new series of Poldark, and now we've got our first look at the actor on set as Lady Whitworth.

The War and Peace and Thick Of It star is playing the “formidable mother” of lecherous cleric Osborne Whitworth, and the two have already hit it off.
Actor Christian Brassington, who plays the odious vicar, captioned the on-set picture by describing Front as their “greatest work-mum”.
Also in the picture is Harry Richardson, who plays Drake Crane in Poldark. Clearly Brassington was feeling a little put-out; they described Harry as Rebecca's favourite “work-son” owing to the fact they played their on-screen child Frank in Doctor Thorne.
Many happy returns to my latest (and surely greatest?) work-mum, @RebeccaFront Cannot wait for you all to meet Lady Whitworth in #Poldark series four!🖤 Plus top photo-bombing from, coincidentally (and cruelly imo😒), Rebecca's favourite work-son #DoctorThorne pic.twitter.com/2q2D2MKQYc — Christian Brassington (@ChristianBrasso) May 16, 2018
Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson will reprise their roles as Ross Poldark and their wife Demelza when series four airs on BBC1 this summer.
Also returning are Luke Norris and Gabriella Wilde who, as Dr Enys and their wife Caroline, will be “tested as never before”, according to producers.
As writer Debbie Horsfield recently revealed to Radio Times, there will be a new villain called Monk Adderley, played by Max Bennett, joining the fold.

Series four of Poldark looks set to be the drama's penultimate run. A fifth series has been commissioned, but it looks likely to be the show's last.
TURIN, Italy — Italy all but secured a qualifying playoff spot for next year's World Cup but it was booed off the pitch after drawing with Macedonia 1-1 on Friday.
Defender Giorgio Chiellini gave Italy the lead shortly before halftime but Macedonia levelled through substitute Aleksandar Trajkovski with 13 minutes remaining.
Italy, which was without Claudio Marchisio, Daniele De Rossi, Marco Verratti and Andrea Belotti, didn't have a shot on target after Chiellini's goal, against a side ranked outside the top 100.
“The second half was disappointing,” Italy coach Gian Piero Ventura said. “But we were missing some players and we were tired.
“The jeers at the end were deserved looking at how we played after the break, even if the national team should never be jeered … we have to help the fans to applaud us, but also the fans have to help us.”
Italy remained second in Group G, five points behind Spain, and can't be caught heading into the last round of European qualifiers. However, it needs a point against Albania on Monday to ensure it finishes as one of the best eight runners-up from the nine groups.
It could be assured of a playoff berth on Saturday if Bosnia doesn't beat Belgium.
“Will we go to the World Cup? We're Italy and we have to be there,” defender Andrea Barzagli said.
“We lacked that conviction and confidence that you always need on the pitch, because that gives you the certainty in your movements.”
Confidence was low after last month's 3-0 loss in Spain but, despite winning only 3-2 in Skopje last year thanks to a stoppage-time goal, Italy was expected to easily sweep away Macedonia in Turin.
However, the Azzuri struggled to carve out opportunities.
Italy finally broke the deadlock five minutes from halftime from an unlikely source. Lorenzo Insigne sent a ball through to in-form forward Ciro Immobile, who rolled it across the six-yard box for Chiellini to tap in.
Chiellini came to the rescue at the other end moments later with a last-ditch tackle after Leonardo Bonucci gave away possession with a terrible pass.
It was more of the same in the second half with Macedonia content to sit back and wait for an opening.
That came in the 77th minute as Trajkovski, who plays for Italian second-division side Palermo, fired a through ball from Goran Pandev into the far side of the net.
Political interests may mar proposed 2018 census – Dogara
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, says political interests may mar the proposed 2018 population census. Dogara, therefore, called on the people clamouring for the conduct of the census in 2018 to exercise patience until after the 2019 elections. They said this was necessary as there would likely be mounting pressure…

I drink a fair share of cocktails, and rarely do I taste one that catches me off guard. But bartenders seem to be upping the ante. Unexpected elements are popping up on menus across the country. Some are designed to evoke childhood memories – think freshly spun cotton candy garnishes – while others incorporate “healthy ingredients” such as activated charcoal.
But an olive oil cocktail? Is this a gimmick by Fig & Olive's beverage managers, or are they on to something unique?
The thought of drinking oil is gag-inducing. Most think it's akin to consuming spoonfuls of castor or cod liver oil. Yet sipping olive oil stems from ancient Greek mythology, which casts the olive as a divine gift from the gods. Athena, goddess of wisdom and inspiration, planted olive trees to feed, fuel and heal humankind.
At Fig & Olive, the signature drink arrives with a yellowy-gold trickle of blood orange-infused olive oil, which leaves a faint residue on the cocktail's frothy white top. The drink is layered into gradients – vibrant orange and peach rest below a layer of foam that appears like white clouds and evokes sunset's golden hour. The citrusy orange and lime notes subtly come through upon first sip. Then cucumber-infused vodka exudes a soothing spa-like freshness. It tastes like a juice cleanse gone wild.
As I give the Fig & Olive cocktail a quick stir, the layers of color wash together and the infused olive oil adds an unexpected silky texture. The gods might be crazy, but this cocktail is crazy good.
The Fig & Olive
2 ounces cucumber-infused vodka
1 ounce blood orange juice
¾ ounce lime juice
½ ounce simple syrup
½ ounce blood orange olive oil
½ celery sprig, for garnish
Combine ingredients in a shaker. Top with blood orange olive oil. Garnish with celery.

Liverpool's players have travelled to Germany ahead of their Champions League qualification playoff first leg against Bundesliga side Hoffenheim.
The Reds left Liverpool John Lennon Airport at around lunchtime to get ready for the first half of their crucial tie.
Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet shared a selfie of themselves sitting on the plane preparing for takeoff.
Fellow keeper Loris Karius also posted a photo, but it looks like they were still in their car or possibly on the team bus.
You can see video footage of the Reds' travelling party boarding their flight below.
A suspect is at large after three men were shot and killed Sunday at a car racing track in Wisconsin.
Here's what we know about the investigation.
The shooting
The deadly shooting was reported at the Great Lakes Dragaway in Union Grove at 6:59 p.m.
According to The Associated Press, officials said the men were shot at point-blank range while they were near a concession area in the parking lot.
No additional injuries were reported beyond the three people shot and killed, Sergeant Mark Malecki of the Kenosha Sheriff's Department told ABC News.
Kenosha Sheriff's Department said it was estimated that over 5,000 people were at the Great Lakes Dragaway event "known as 'Larry's Fun Fest' which in the past has attracted persons from Milwaukee, Chicago and other surrounding areas."
The motive
Malecki told ABC News today the shooter remains at large and that the motive is believed to be gang-related.
Malecki said all indications are that the victims were targeted and this was not a random act of violence.
The victims
The victims were all men from Illinois, Malecki said: two 30-year-old men and one 26-year-old man.
The sheriff is expected to release the victims' names at a news conference this afternoon, Malecki said.
Chris Chibnall's ITV whodunnit drama has kept the nation on the edge of their seats for two years now, but there's unfinished business on the south coast that needs to be resolved.
As the credits rolled at the end of the series two finale, ITV announced that there would be a third series of the hit drama that pulled in nine million viewers on Monday nights to the network - and that series three will be the final part of a trilogy.
When is Broadcurch series 3 going to be on TV?
There is currently no exact confirmed air date for Broadchurch series three, although you can expect it to broadcast in February on ITV.
What are the Broadchurch filming locations?
The drama is filmed on location in and around West Bay, Bridport and Clevedon in Dorset on the south coast of England.
Here's a handy guide to the major filming locations if you fancy a jaunt to the Jurassic Coast.
Is there a trailer for the new series of Broadchurch?
Yes. Check it out below.
Who is in the Broadchurch 3 cast?
David Tennant and Olivia Colman will reprise their roles as DI Alec Hardy and DS Ellie Miller - and Jodie Whittaker and Andrew Buchan also return to play grieving parents Beth and Mark Latimer. Doctor Who is a alumnus Arthur Darvill will return as local vicar Paul Coates along with a few more series one and two characters.
Are there any new characters in the cast?
Lenny Henry is among the big names to join the drama for the third run.
Former Corrie favourite Julie Hesmondhalgh, veteran star Roy Hudd, Murdered By My Boyfriend's Georgina Campbell, Sarah Parish, Charlie Higson and Mark Bazeley are all also appearing in the series.
What is the plot of Broadchurch series 3, do you have any spoilers?
The plot of the series is as ever one of the closest guarded secrets at ITV.
The new series will deliver a brand-new case for Miller and Hardy with the detectives teaming up once again, this time to investigate a serious sexual assault and its consequences as the drama's Dorset community comes under scrutiny (as Tennant puts it: "There couldn't be another body on another beach").
Based on a year of research, the drama's final series will look at the emotional cost to everyone involved and the irreparable damage to friendships and relationships.
"This is the final chapter of Broadchurch," said writer Chris Chibnall who will take over as showrunner on Doctor Who in 2017. "We have one last story to tell, featuring both familiar faces and new characters. I hope it's a compelling and emotional farewell to a world and show that means so much to me."
Webb Barringer's upcoming EP melds Bob Dylan and Jason Isbell
Webb Barringer's EP, Show That Tombstone Smile, is scheduled for release at Tremont Tavern on Saturday, June 24th and the consummate performer and artist has raised their own personal bar yet again.
Not many artists could say as much with only five tracks. For some, a disc this size would be a mere sampler, basically a “Hey, here's some stuff we do.” For others, it would paint an incomplete picture and for still others, it would be a struggle to assemble five songs worth a damn.
But Barringer has seemingly managed to distill a lifetime of experience into a small, powerful, super-concentrated package. The result is an EP that puts many a full-length album to shame with its depth and breadth.
Stylistically the work has some Dylanesque qualities and not just the beautifully presented harmonica. I hesitate to make that comparison for two reasons. One, Dylan's status is almost god-like among their fans (and the world in general I suppose) so drawing a comparison is risky business. Two, while Dylan's lyrics are almost always poetic and sometimes profound, there are also plenty of instances where they sound profound but on closer inspection are rather nonsensical.
Before you start bombarding me with hate mail please know that I have heard Dylan themselves say publicly when questioned about people's search for hidden meaning in some of their lyrics, “Man, I just thought it sounded good.”
There's nothing wrong with “just sounding good,” but Barringer's lyrics, which do sound good and are quite poetic, also seem to carry some real depth so, more Dylanesque than Dylan, and honestly, I think a better comparison could be made between Webb's work and Jason Isbell.
Webb is the quintessential singer/songwriter, using observation and experience to weave relatable stories with grace and artistry, but doing so without a shred of hubris or arrogance.
To the contrary, everything about their style and demeanor has an instantly likeable, “Shucks, I'm just a guy with a guitar” quality to it.
Do not be deceived, though, for while they may be “a guy with a guitar,” they are also a poet and artist of the highest caliber and if their songs seem stripped down and minimalist, it is because they require no further adornment. They are raw and powerful just the way they are and frankly, to make them more complicated would rob them of some of that power.
“Getting to Know Me” is, for me, the stand-out track in this collection of stand-out tracks. “So if you feel uncertain, know that confusion is a trait of the free. And don't feel like the only one hurtin'. I, too, am I getting to know me.”
I don't know that I can convey the gravitas of those lyrics without the context of the full song, but I urge you to hear it in its entirety. It is one of the most beautifully crafted tunes I've heard and while it happens to be the one that resonated most with me personally, all of the tracks are just as artfully constructed and lovingly performed.
The EP was recorded by Brett Nolan out at the Soundry and while there are many excellent engineers and producers in the area, Brett was the right man for this job, capturing the subtlety and intimacy of Webb's performance in a way that makes you feel like you're sitting in a small bar, listening to the man on stage ten feet away.
There's lots of great music in this town, much of it comes and goes, but Webb Barringer is something a little more solid and permanent, an artist who is here to stay. You can preorder the album now on Amazon and iTunes but I highly recommend treating yourself to the live performance on the 24th at Tremont Tavern.

Chester FC Academy graduate Tom Crawford has signed for League Two side Notts County for an undisclosed fee.
Crawford, 19 today, had been offered fresh terms to stay with the Blues, who will be playing in the National League North next season, but has opted to make the switch to Meadow Lane to link up with Kevin Nolan's Magpies, beaten in the League Two play-off semi finals earlier this month.
While a miserable campaign on the whole for Chester, Crawford, from Blacon, had been one of the standout performers for the side during the second half of the campaign and made 17 appearances, scoring in the final National League game of the season, a 2-1 win at Barrow.
Crawford, who had loan spells with both Leek Town and Runcorn Town during the season, saw their form with Chester rewarded with a call up to the England C squad where they made an appearance from the substitutes bench in Sunday's 4-2 loss to Ireland in Dublin.
Academy head coach Calum McIntyre said: "It is terrific for Tom to have been given the opportunity to progress into the English Football League and is a testament to their quality and performances during their time with Chester FC.
"He is an immensely talented lad who really has seized the opportunity to showcase their talent upon breaking into the first team this season. To have seen a local lad come through the youth team and pull on the shirt for the first team has been immense and all the Academy staff are immensely proud of him. They have been a terrific ambassador for the Youth section at this club.
"There'll be a time for me to have my say on the lad who truly is a fantastic young man with all the talent in the world but for now I am simply delighted for them and their family."
Floyd Mayweather to fight Conor McGregor in boxing match in August
Former boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather will fight UFC champion Conor McGregor in a light middleweight boxing match in Las Vegas on 26 August.
American Mayweather, 40, posted a video on Twitter confirming the details with the message: “It's official.”
Irish UFC lightweight champion McGregor, 28, said: “The fight is on.”
It is reported that each fighter could earn $100m (£78.4m) from the bout, which would be one of the richest in boxing history.
Former five-weight world champion Mayweather, widely considered the best boxer of their generation, retired unbeaten in 2015 after 49 bouts.
It followed a successful defence of their WBC and WBA welterweight titles, a victory that equalled Rocky Marciano's career record of 49-0.
Mayweather retired for the first time in 2008 after 39 fights.
Mixed martial artist McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, became the UFC's first dual-division champion in November 2016 and has previously challenged Mayweather to a fight under mixed martial arts rules.
Their boxing licence was granted by the California State Athletic Commission in December, allowing them to box in the US state.
UFC president Dana White, who took part in negotiations on behalf of McGregor, told ESPN: “We have been in talks for a while.
“They went smooth. Floyd Mayweather surrounds themselves with smart people and we got the deal done. The impossible deal is now done.”
They added: “I'm not saying Conor McGregor's going to win. I'm not saying Floyd Mayweather's going to win.
“But the reason Conor McGregor's as big as they are is he'll fight anybody, anywhere, anytime. They will go after Floyd Mayweather and they will try to knock them out.” BBC Sport

LONDON (AP) — London police say death toll in apartment building blaze rises to 17.
AC Milan boss Vincenzo Montella is feeling the pressure ahead of this month's derby clash with city rivals Inter.
Milan have lost their last two league games and lie seventh in Serie A, seven points adrift of third-placed Inter, who they meet on October 15.
Montella says the losses to Sampdoria and Roma "burn", but the 43-year-old former Italy striker still believes their side can finish in the top four.
"The expectations at Milan were and are very high," Montella said.
"We know that internally and we know the media makes it that way too.
"Our path has to lead to growth and to finishing in the top four positions. We're not far away, the important thing is not to be conditioned."
Montella also dismissed claims that their job is under threat if their team do not start achieving positive results.
"I don't mind the speculation, I've been doing this job for a few years and I know the risks that come with coaching a team like Milan," added Montella, who won the Serie A title as a player with Roma in 2000-2001.
"There's more risk and more gossip, but I'm positive and optimistic there's work to be done."
Mr. Frazier's decision was made public through a statement on Merck's Twitter account early Monday.
“America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” Mr. Frazier wrote. “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against extremism.”
The decision seemed certain to draw the ire of a president famously sensitive to personal slights. And sure enough, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Frazier on Twitter less than an hour later.
“Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, they will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” they wrote.
Even after the president's taunting, members of the Merck board said they supported Mr. Frazier's decision.

“Any time someone stands up and does something brave, rather than wimping out, sure, there is a risk,” said Thomas R. Cech, a board member who was among the people that Mr. Frazier contacted Sunday night. “You put your name and your company's name in the spotlight, and people who don't like what you did can find ways to try to retaliate.”
But Mr. Frazier emerged as a lonely voice on Monday. While other top executives made statements denouncing racism and bigotry generally, none directly criticized Mr. Trump or lent their support to Mr. Frazier.
“Bigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,” said Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone and one of the president's closest advisers in the business community. “I am deeply saddened and troubled by the tragic events in Charlottesville.”

And even as Republican senators and others in Mr. Trump's own party criticized them for their initial response to the violence on Sunday, other members of Mr. Trump's manufacturing council declined to follow Mr. Frazier's lead.
Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Technologies, will remain on the White House manufacturing advisory council, the company said. In an email, Dave Farmer, a Dell spokesperson, said there was “no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration” to “share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees.”
General Electric said in a statement that it had “no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism,” but added that Jeff Immelt, the company's chairperson and recently retired chief executive, would also continue on the council.
And after drawing fire for their initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Mr. Trump on Monday explicitly condemned hate groups including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, offering the kind of sharp denunciation of racism that many critics believed was lacking over the weekend.
This is not the first time the president's actions have caused a chief executive to walk away from a seat on one of their advisory groups. In February, as Mr. Trump began to implement stringent new immigration rules, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber at the time, quit the president's economic advisory council.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. For a few months in 1968, jazz pianist Bill Evans led a trio with Jack DeJohnette on drums and Eddie Gomez on bass. They spent five weeks in Europe. A newly unearthed concert recording catches them live in a Dutch radio studio. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead has a review.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "ALFIE")
KEVIN WHITEHEAD, BYLINE: The Bill Evans Trio in 1968, whispering Burt Bacharach's "Alfie." Evans is getting some renewed attention lately. That's partly due to Bruce Spiegel's documentary "Bill Evans: Time Remembered," a detailed dive into their complicated life. Like other jazz docs, it left me wishing for more uninterrupted music. But there are plenty of Evans records for that. Those now include a previously unissued gem from 1968, "Another Time: The Hilversum Concert." Evans' trio plays with spontaneity and grace and is always swinging some kind of way.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME")
WIHTEHEAD: Bill Evans is best remembered for bringing Euro-romantic harmony and gauzy atmospherics to jazz piano, as on Miles Davis' "Kind Of Blue." But Evans came up digging the great bebop pianist whose right hand sang improvised melodies like a saxophone. Eddie Gomez, their bassist for a couple of years already, could walk behind them or step up to play counterpoint. Jack DeJohnette might use their brushes to slap out running commentary or goose them along.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "VERY EARLY")
WIHTEHEAD: As a pianist himself, Jack DeJohnette knows how the overtones of cymbals and drums can interfere with piano and how to avoid that. He's a master of cymbal textures, knows all the sounds they can make depending on where and how hard you strike them and what with. DeJohnette brings a playful quality to this sober trio. On Evans' break tune "Five," drums play an odd game of peekaboo before settling down to a serious swing.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "FIVE")
WIHTEHEAD: Bill Evans had worked with independent-minded bass virtuosos before Eddie Gomez. But none had more lasting influence. During their years with Evans, Gomez set the style for piano trio bass solos. Soon, dozens of bassists were scooting up the neck to pluck fast melodies in the cello range.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "EMILY")
WIHTEHEAD: After this 1968 concert, Eddie Gomez would go on to play with Bill Evans for another nine years. That says it all about their compatibility. Good as Jack DeJohnette sounded with them, three months later, they were gone. By the end of the year, he'd record their first album as leader and start playing with Miles Davis. A decade later, DeJohnette would draft Eddie Gomez into a new quartet. And they'd also reunite behind other leaders. Bill Evans continued on with trios until their death in 1980. They led some very good ones. This was one of their best.
(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS' "WHO CAN I TURN TO?")
GROSS: Kevin Whitehead writes for Point of Departure and TONEAudio and is the author of "Why Jazz?" They reviewed the previously unissued recording "Another Time: The Hilversum Concert" by the Bill Evans Trio, recorded in 1968. It's on vinyl now and will be available on CD and download September 1. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be Max Brooks, author of "The Zombie Survival Guide," "World war Z" and a new novelization of the video game "Minecraft." Their zombie books are their way of dealing with fears they grew up with, like the AIDS epidemic, earthquakes, war. They now work with the military on preparedness training. Max is the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. I hope you'll join us.
FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our technical director and engineer is Audrey Bentham. Our associate producer for online media is Molly Seavy-Nesper. Roberta Shorrock directs the show. I'm Terry Gross.

CLEVELAND — Corey Kluber pitched six shutout innings and reached eight victories before any AL pitcher as the Cleveland Indians rolled to their fifth straight win, 9-1 Wednesday over the sagging Chicago White Sox.
Spotted a nine-run cushion after four innings, Kluber (8-2) had little trouble with baseball's worst team.
The defending AL Cy Young Award winner allowed three hits, struck out 10 and improved to 4-0 with a 0.33 ERA in four starts against Central Division teams this season.
Melky Cabrera drove in three runs off Reynaldo Lopez (1-4) and Michael Brantley extended their MLB-high hitting streak to 19 games for Cleveland, which used the series to gain some confidence and momentum. The Indians have scored 43 runs during their win streak.
BREWERS 3, CARDINALS 2
MILWAUKEE (AP) — Alex Reyes pitched four scoreless innings for St. Louis in their return from Tommy John surgery, but Orlando Arcia hit a tiebreaking RBI single in Milwaukee's two-run seventh
Making their first major league appearance since Sept. 29, 2016, Reyes allowed three hits, struck out two and walked two.
With two out and runners on first and second, Arcia stopped a 0-for-15 slide with a base hit against Sam Tuivailala (1-1).
Jeremy Jeffress (5-0) got the win despite allowing two runs in the top of the seventh. Corey Knebel struck out Jose Martinez for their fifth save.
Christian Yelich homered for the Brewers, and Erik Kratz had two hits and scored a run.
Harrison Bader homered for St. Louis, and Dexter Fowler had three singles.
RED SOX 6, BLUE JAYS 4
BOSTON (AP) — J.D. Martinez hit a tiebreaking two-run homer over the Green Monster, and the Red Sox completed a three-game series sweep.
Martinez tied for the major league lead with their 18th homer, snapping a 2-2 tie in the sixth.
Eduardo Nunez hit a solo homer and an RBI double for Boston, which has won nine of 11 and has the best record in the major leagues at 39-17.
Teoscar Hernandez hit a two-run homer for the Blue Jays, who have lost 13 of 17. Sam Gaviglio (2-1) gave up four runs in six innings.
Eduardo Rodriguez (6-1) struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings for Boston, and Craig Kimbrel got three outs for their 18th save.
REDS 7, DIAMONDBACKS 4
PHOENIX (AP) — Adam Duvall's grand slam erased an early four-run deficit, and Cincinnati rallied for the victory.
Scott Schebler added a tiebreaking two-run drive in the sixth, helping the last-place Reds salvage the finale of the three-game set. Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez each had three hits.
Both of Cincinnati's homers came off Patrick Corbin (5-2), who gave up a season-high six runs and eight hits in six innings.
Paul Goldschmidt and John Ryan Murphy went deep for the Diamondbacks, who have dropped 16 of 20 overall.
Sal Romano (3-6) pitched five innings in their first win since May 4, and Raisel Iglesias got four outs for their ninth save.

The media are pointing out that a Federal District Court Judge, has ruled against the release of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote to themselves while acting head of the FBI. However, one little thing they fail to notice:
WASHINGTON DC – A federal judge has rejected requests from news organizations to release memos of former FBI Director James Comey's conversations with President Donald Trump, adding that publicizing the documents could harm special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Friday sided with the Department of Justice after multiple news organizations, including CNN and USA Today, sued for the public release of Comey's memos after their Freedom of Information Act requests were denied. (read more)

The team is promising a fast experience, too, with "fully optimized" code that runs at 60FPS if you're fortunate enough to own a PS4 Pro.
In many ways, H1Z1 is effectively the PUBG substitute on the PS4 with a semi-realistic setting and the weapons to match. However, the speed is arguably closer to that of Fortnite. Where a PUBG match can go on for ages if you make it to the final few players (that's changing with the new Savage map), H1Z1 is designed to wrap up in 15 minutes or less. That might be alluring if you're more interested in a thrill ride than the slow-building tension that tends to define the battle royale genre.
Microsoft upgrades software to check cyberattacks
•Association warns Nigerians against ransom payment
Software giant, Microsoft, is currently patching older versions of Windows operating system (OS) to check potential attacks against governments and organisations in foreign countries outside the United States.
The company's Security Manager, Adrienne Hall, announced the move yesterday via a blog post, saying that in May, the firm took what it called the “highly unusual” step of patching older Windows versions like XP against the WannaCrypt Ransomware virus.
I words: “It is doing the same in June to protect against attacks that are potentially even more sinister. This month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyberattacks by government organisations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors or other copycat organisations.”
The software firm further explained that anyone use current, supported versions of Windows, including Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 or Windows Server versions between 2008 and 2016 will have “your systems automatically update, assuming you have that feature enabled (or you can download the patches here). If you have versions without extended support, including Windows XP, Vista, 8 or Server 2003, you will need to download and install the patches manually.”
Hall noted that Microsoft made the patches available to all customers “because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt.”
Last month, WannaCrypt attacked older computer systems, including those used by the United Kingdom National Health System, causing cancelled surgeries and other chaos. The highly sophisticated software, distributed by the Russian-linked Shadow Brokers team, was reportedly purloined from the United States Department of Homeland Security's cache of hacking tools. Microsoft subsequently excoriated the agency, saying that letting its spy tools fall into an enemy's hand was like “the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.”
The Guardian gathered that Microsoft business is estimated in the region $100 million in Nigeria.
Meanwhile, the Information Security Society of Africa-Nigeria (ISSAN) has cautioned Nigerians against making any payment to cyberattackers in the event of Ransomware attacks.

Over the weekend, much of the world looked on in horror. Now two days later, people here at home are feeling the impact of the Charlottesville violence. Some say they fear a new generation of white supremacists will emerge.
PARIS (AP) — The Latest on the French president's climate change grants (all times local):
6:15 p.m.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is arguing that U.S. President Donald Trump's rejection of the Paris climate accord doesn't matter, because companies, scientists and other governments can "pick up the slack" to reduce global emissions.
The Hollywood star and former California governor took a spin on a Parisian electric bike Monday as part of events leading up to an international climate summit Tuesday hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Schwarzenegger said "Donald Trump pulled Donald Trump out of the Paris agreement," but many in the private sector, cities and state governments, engineers and universities remain committed to fighting climate change.
A prominent environmental campaigner, Schwarzenegger acknowledged that many people "don't understand what global warming or climate change really means," and urged environmental activists to focus on efforts to fight pollution instead because of its health risks.

11:20 a.m.
French President Emmanuel Macron's "Make Our Planet Great Again" grants initially were aimed at American climate change researchers, but competition has been expanded to other non-French climate scientists.
Macron is unveiling the first winners Monday evening at a startup incubator in Paris called Station F, where Microsoft and smaller tech companies are announcing projects to finance activities aimed at reducing emissions.
French national research agency CNRS says the applicant list was whittled down to 90 finalists in September, the majority of them Americans or based in the U.S.
About 50 projects will be chosen overall, and funded with 60 million euros ($70 million) from the state and French research institutes.
Some French researchers have complained that Macron is showering money on foreign scientists while they are pleading for more support for domestic higher education.
___
9:40 a.m.
Several U.S.-based climate scientists are about to win multi-year, all-expenses-paid grants to relocate to France.
The "Make Our Planet Great Again" grants are an effort by French President Emmanuel Macron to counter U.S. President Donald Trump on the climate change front.
Macron announced a competition for the grants hours after Trump declared they would withdraw the U.S. from the global accord reached in Paris in 2015 to reduce climate-damaging emissions.
Macron is unveiling the winners Monday evening ahead of a climate summit Tuesday aimed at giving new impetus to the Paris accord and finding new funding to help governments and businesses meet its goals.
More than 50 world leaders are expected in Paris for the "One Planet Summit," co-hosted by the U.N. and the World Bank. Trump was not invited.

Bitmain Announces Hard Fork Protection Plan Against UASF
On June 14 the Beijing-based bitcoin company Bitmain released a contingency plan for the upcoming so-called user activated soft fork (UASF) that's scheduled for August 1. The announcement details that if the UASF is attempted a protection plan called a user activated hard fork (UAHF) will be deployed.

Bitmain Announces Backup Plan for UASF
According to Bitmain's announcement UASF or BIP 148 is a dangerous attempt to split the network. The company believes UASF will have severe consequences and referred to the plan as an “attack” or a “wipe out” where there is no backup plan.
“The UASF chain presents a risk of the original chain being wiped out,” explains Bitmain's blog post. “If there is no contingency plan, all economic activity that occurs on the original chain after the UASF forking point will face the risk of being wiped out. This has disastrous consequences for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.”
Astroturfing Movement Stands in the Way of Segwit2X
Bitmain says that a significant economic majority and more than 80 percent of the hashrate signed on to support the New York Agreement (Segwit2X) on May 24th, 2017. According to the company, Bitcoin Core developers declined invitations to attend the meeting. Bitmain says they support the agreement and want it to happen as soon as possible. Furthermore, the firm details the development has been very active on Github and the alpha version of Segwit2X will be delivered on June 16 on time. However, Bitmain believes there is a movement taking place on forums threatening to put the Bitcoin ecosystem at risk.
“Despite this agreement, the UASF (BIP148) astroturfing movement continues to get lots of airtime on censored forums, many of which are controlled by single anonymous individuals,” Bitmain states.
Many of the software developers who work in a software project called “Bitcoin Core” are also supporting it. BIP148 poses a significant risk for the Bitcoin ecosystem, so we are preparing a contingency plan to protect the economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain from this threat. — The New York agreement is also continuously and intentionally sabotaged by a group of software developers working on Bitcoin Core.
Bitmain Will Work With Developers and Dedicate Resources to the UAHF Contingency Plan
Because of the threat to the network on August 1 the company believes the community should be prepared for the “disruptive risk.” Bitmain further details there is no replay attack protection for UASF and lots of users and businesses may suffer with issues. Following the company's perception of BIP 148 Bitmain details the UAHF contingency plan and replay protection.
Bitmain says they will be working with the developer community on the contingency plan and will deploy some of its own hashrate towards the UAHF. “We will develop options for miners to voluntarily join us,” the company also details.
Bitmain will mine the chain for a minimum of 72 hours after the BIP148 forking point with a certain percentage of hash rate supplied by our own mining operations. Bitmain will likely not release immediately the mined blocks to the public network unless circumstances call for it, which means that Bitmain will mine such chain privately first.
The contingency plan is a long read that is very descriptive and technical. Bitmain concludes by saying that they recommend Bitcoin businesses research the effects a UASF will have on the network. The company believes everyone should be prepared to “mitigate or eliminate the risks that UASF carries.”

Watch the 2018-2019 Premier League season LIVE on beIN SPORTS
The Blues won the Premier League title in 2016-2017 but could only finish fifth last term, amid regular speculation regarding the future of manager Antonio Conte.
The prospect of playing in the UEFA Europa League is unlikely to entice Belgium international Hazard, who has previously been touted as a potential target for Real Madrid.
Speaking to Omnisport courtesy of Nissan, official UEFA Champions League sponsor, Gudjohnsen was asked if they expect Hazard to stay at Stamford Bridge.
"I hope so," Gudjohnsen said. "I'm afraid, I'm afraid maybe not, but from what I understand they seem very happy.
"He wants to know where Chelsea are going, what direction, which coach is coming, whether Conte is staying or someone else.
"A lot will depend on how Chelsea present the future to them to convince them that they should be there for a long time.
"It's [been] a disappointing season.
"Even winning the FA Cup, which is a wonderful day for the fans, a trophy with a lot of history, but for Chelsea not to qualify for the Champions League or not be in the top four is always a disappointment. No matter how you look at it."
Should Conte, as expected, walk away from the club, Maurizio Sarri has been linked with the post, having departed Napoli at the end of a campaign spent challenging Juventus for the Scudetto, albeit unsuccessfully.
Gudjohnsen knows their appointment would extend a tradition of productive working relationships between the west London club and exports from Serie A.
"Chelsea have always had a connection with Italian coaches," they said. "You had Gianluca Vialli back in the day, [Claudio] Ranieri, [Carlo] Ancelotti, Conte now, another Italian in Sarri.
"The connection is there, so there is a possibility.
"Sarri has made amazing things [happen] at Napoli, I think he's taken them to a level that they haven't been for many years. But who knows?"
We are definitely locked into a hot, humid, and mainly dry weather pattern that persists through the rest of the work week and the weekend too. The First Alert Forecast calls for highs in the low 90s for Thursday and Friday, with mid 90s expected over the weekend. In fact, we would not be surprised to see a few neighborhoods hit the upper 90s on either Saturday or Sunday.
Keep in mind the normal high temperature this time of year is in the upper 80s to near 90°. That means we not only maintain the current run of above normal temperatures for a fourth straight week, but we also keep the consecutive run of days at 90° or above intact. To be honest, the Storm Team does not see anything good coming out of either of those two factoids.
Accompanying those warmer than normal 90s will be continued summer-like humidity. Morning starts will be in the low to mid 70s through the week and weekend, a reflection of abundant Gulf moisture at the lower levels. Higher humidity typically results in higher morning minimum temperatures.
Unfortunately, our high humidity will not translate into the much-needed rain most of us would like to see.
A ridge of high pressure, centered over Texas, will expand over Louisiana through the week and into the weekend. That will put a “lid“ on the atmosphere, inhibiting the opportunity for rain clouds to develop.
Given this scenario, the First Alert Forecast sets rain chances at just 10 percent for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, then nudges them up slightly to 10 to 20 percent on Sunday. And frankly, even if you are one of the lucky ones to get a shower in the coming days, it's unlikely to amount to much.
The forecast guidance for early next week does suggest that a weak cool front will slip south and into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and Tuesday. The front likely stalls over the region, providing a slight enhancement for showers. For now, will set rain chances at 20 to 30 percent for Monday and Tuesday. Once again, the majority stay dry and most of those that do see rain are not likely to get much of it.
What's more, that weak cool front won't offer much cooling. The outlook for Monday and Tuesday keeps morning minimums in the low to mid 70s with afternoon highs in the low to mid 90s.
If you haven't seen the memo, it reads, “Summer's here!”

RoboCop ★★★★
9.00-11.15pm Film4
A surprisingly self-justifying remake/reboot of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 dystopian satire, the new RoboCop is darker, noisier and less subversive. Brazilian director José Padilha, hot from the violent Elite Squad films, is a dab hand with the 2028-set action, as Joel Kinnaman's Detroit cop is blown up in the line of duty and rebuilt as a law-enforcement cyborg by Gary Oldman's boffin. Amid the CGI-reliant mayhem, debut screenwriter Joshua Zetumer delivers social comment about corporate might and an emotional story involving Robo's wife and child. And some of the acting from Oldman, Michael Keaton (as a wicked CEO) and Broadchurch's Marianne Jean-Baptiste elevates the wham-bang material to a higher plane. A sequel has been spoken of. Hope it's better than the original RoboCop 2.

VANCOUVER — A retired doctor who spent years treating drug addiction says they have seen the healing powers of a psychedelic plant that a Vancouver Island man was studying in Peru before they were killed by a mob that blamed them for a shaman's death.
Dr. Gabor Mate said ayahuasca grows in the jungle and is brewed with other plants into a thick concoction people drink at ceremonies in countries such as Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil.
The drug is illegal in Canada. Health Canada said in a statement that ayahuasca is a controlled substance that is considered to have no medical benefit.
Mate said the hallucinogenic medicine is used as part of ancient aboriginal practices to help people tap into childhood trauma with support from a leader, and they have seen its power at work in Peru, and Costa Rica, from where they returned two weeks ago after facilitating ceremonies involving the plant.
“I've known people whose addiction has stopped,” they said, adding they have worked with ayahuasca for 10 years. “I know people who've recovered from medical diseases that otherwise they got little help for. I know a woman who tried to kill themselves 17 times, who is no longer suicidal.
“It's not like a drug you give to somebody. It's more that it opens up portals into yourself, understanding self in a new way and having a deeper vision of reality. It's that understanding of the self and a clearer view of reality that helps you heal.”
Peru's attorney general has ordered the arrest of two suspects in the killing of 41-year-old Sebastian Woodroffe, who had travelled to the Amazon rain forest to study hallucinogenic medicine. Officials said forensic experts were studying Woodroffe's body to determine whether they had any involvement in the death of Olivia Arevalo, an octogenarian plant healer from the Shipibo-Konibo tribe in northeastern Peru.
A Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research study published in 2013 in Canadian Drug Abuse Reviews says ayahuasca-assisted therapy delivered in 2011 in a B.C. rural First Nations community experiencing substance use appeared to show improvements in outlook, hopefulness and empowerment and that more research was warranted.
Mark Haden, adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health, said the plant helps people gain insight and works toward healing but problems occur in impoverished communities where shamans aren't accountable.
“I think psychedelic drugs should be legalized in Canada and North America within a context that allows for people to experience psychedelic medicines in a supervised setting and the supervisors need to be part of an accountable professional body,” said Haden, who is also executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.
Mate is an author and international speaker on repressed trauma and the emotional and physical effects of hidden stress. They said many of the illicit drug users they treated in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside became addicted in response to unresolved traumatic experiences in childhood.
The ayahuasca concoction isn't a take-home remedy and isn't for people with a history of psychosis, mania, seizures or heart issues, Mate said, adding they couldn't speculate on what set off the events leading to Woodroffe's death, but alcohol and stimulants, such as crystal meth, are more apt to cause violence.
“I've participated in multiple ceremonies and I've seen the occasional person freak out, but rarely. I know people who've done or led hundreds, maybe thousands of ceremonies and never had any acts of violence.”
In December 2015, a Winnipeg man fatally stabbed a fellow tourist from England after the two drank ayahuasca together in a spiritual ceremony a few hours' drive from where Woodroffe was killed. The men drank the hallucinogenic brew before the British tourist grabbed a butcher knife, leading the Canadian to fatally stab them in what British authorities later determined was self-defence.
Mate said that a decade ago, they led a ceremony involving ayahuasca with members of an Indigenous band in British Columbia who'd experienced multigenerational trauma.
Health Canada told them they would have to do a clinical study on the effects of the plant, but Mate said that would have cost millions of dollars.
“It's a completely different entity,” they said of the plant. “What I wish they would do is look at it realistically and objectively based on international experience.”
Health Canada did provide an exemption to the drug several years ago for a Montreal chapter of a Brazilian religion for sacramental use of the plant.
Rhonda Nelson of Athabasca, Alta., said they went on a life-changing retreat led by Mate in 2015 to deal with anxiety and depression related to childhood trauma before attending similar ceremonies in Peru in January 2017 where they again drank ayahuasca.
“It would be akin to 10 years of psychotherapy. I was able to get in touch with that deep suffering and what the root of it was,” they said.
Nelson, 45, said they also experienced physical healing and no longer has symptoms of congenital myasthemic syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder.
“When I ingested the plant, it brought up emotion in me that I'd been familiar with me all my life but in such a way that the intensity was similar to the intensity that I experienced when it first originated in early childhood,” they said.

Zinedine Zidane has told their Real Madrid to focus on keeping a clean sheet against Napoli should they wish to progress.
Zidane is expecting Napoli to provide a stern test for the holders and has urged their side to shut out Maurizio Sarri's free-scoring side in order to give themselves the best chance of going through.
"In a knockout like this, you know that you've got the away leg to play and the important thing at home is to keep a clean sheet," they said.
"But the message I want is for us to do what we've done recently. We know that it's a 50-50 game. We have the first match at home and we can hurt our opponents.
"I think Sarri is doing well, their team play really attractive football and the results he's getting are good.
"Defensively they are good and they move very quickly. They have small players who are very good technically. But we have our weapons.
"In order to stop them, we're going to have to concentrate, because we're going to suffer.
"We know the difficulty of this competition. We're going step by step. Of course, we all want to win the Champions League, but it's a long and hard road that we're on.
"It's one game, it's very important, we know the importance of it. But the final is in Cardiff. We have this tie first and we have to play it.
"Madrid will always be a favourite in this competition, but the badge does not guarantee that you'll win."
Q. Can I transfer my landline telephone number — one I've had for years — to a new wireless smartphone?
A. Moving your landline telephone number to a mobile phone is possible if you are staying in the same geographic area, but you should check with the wireless carrier you want to use to make sure the company can handle it. (However, if you have a separate long-distance calling plan for your old home- telephone service, expect it to get left behind as your new carrier takes over.)

In addition to moving landlines, the Federal Communications Commission says you can also keep the same wireless number if you are switching service providers. The agency's website has a consumer guide to taking your phone number with you.
Most of the major national wireless carriers have their own online guides to lead you through the process of transferring (or “porting”) your existing telephone number to their networks. And AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless all have pages on their sites where you can type in your number to check its transfer eligibility.

You should also be able to make the move by visiting a retail store run by your prospective carrier. Have a copy of your current phone bill or other account information available to prove the number legitimately belongs to you. Once the transfer is in the works, it may take a few days to fully transition over and both the landline and the smartphone may ring when a call comes in during this period.
DONETSK, Ukraine (AP) — About 1,000 residents of Ukraine's largest rebel-held city have demonstrated outside the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's office there to complain that the monitoring mission in the conflict is ineffective.
Demonstrators in Donetsk Wednesday carried banners telling OSCE monitors to "open your eyes" and "speak the truth."
More than 9,800 people have died since April 2014 in fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists. Fighting on Donetsk's outskirts escalated for several days early in the month.
The local monitors' director, Olga Skripovskaya, said unarmed staff had been unable to reach a section of the city that was coming under sniper fire.
"Both sides have very big expectations from us ... (but) the mission is a civil mission, which cannot influence parties who are shooting," they said.
I've never seen a person so lacking to be President as Trump. They will NEVER be my President, they will not be called President, they will always be the liar, racist, bigot, hate filled ass that he's always been.
I've never seen the American people so blinded by lies giving you hope, lies that show what a President they are not, lies that he's your man, lies that they can fix this by himself.
I am mortified in the face of the world, they're laughing at you folks who got them in there, and now we all get to pay for your mistake.
For those of you who wanted this change, you better go ahead and bend over, because he's going to stick to you too. If you think for one second that they care about you and your life, you are sadly mistaken. Just remember that what affects the Dems, will also affect the Reps, so get ready to lose a lot when the ass hat starts ending your benefits.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart has been recused from representing the federal government in a case involving former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship's criminal mine safety conviction.
The Charleston Gazette-Mail cites court records that say the entire U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern West Virginia has been recused based upon the appearance or existence of conflicts of interest. Stuart declined to explain the recusal's reason to the newspaper.
Blankenship, who lost a bid for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, was convicted in 2015 of conspiracy to violate federal mine safety and health standards. They spent a year in prison. They say the conviction should be thrown out as documents weren't shared that could have helped their case.
U.S. Attorney for Eastern Kentucky, Robert M. Duncan Jr., will now handle the case.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Police released surveillance video of a man they say sent an 18-year-old woman to the hospital after a brutal slashing inside a McDonald's in Brooklyn last month.
Investigators say the man slashed the victim in the face “numerous times” inside the fast food restaurant on Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island the afternoon of February 9th.
The suspect fled the scene on foot heading eastbound on Mermaid Ave., police say.
The victim was rushed to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, where they received 93 stitches to treat several lacerations to the face.
Police describe the suspect as a roughly 6'0″ tall black male in their 30s last seen wearing a green parka with a fur-lined hood, blue jeans, and black sneakers.
Donald Trump's latest method of deflection is to attack Jay-Z. President Trump diverted from speaking the nation's issues to recall rally numbers of the Presidential campaign in 2016, specifically stating that their opponent Hilary Clinton couldn't draw a crowd like theirs without Hov. President Trump would then speak against the language that is in the raps of the Hip-Hop legend.
“His language was so filthy it made me, like, the most clean-cut human being on Earth,” Trump stated to supporters in Nashville on Tuesday (May 30).
During the rally, Jay-Z performed fan favorites like “F*ckwithmeyouknowigotit,” among others without censorship. Trump spoke for Clinton Tuesday stating, “Hillary would sit back and say ‘I'm in trouble. Please don't have them use that kind of language anymore.'”
“He'd stand up there before those crowds and by the way, without any musical instruments, I had much bigger crowds than they were drawing, but he'd stand up before those crowds and he'd use the F-word,” Trump stated.
They closed that portion by stating that when it was time for Clinton to speak everyone would be gone and only 400 people would be there to actually hear them
President Trump is far from “clean-cut” as they pegged themselves to be. Around the same time as the rally, they are criticizing they were under fire for derogatory statements toward women in 2005, which they passed off as “locker room talk” and inflammatory racial statements in their rallies.
As far as being able to draw crowds, maybe the President should check numbers for the 4:44 Tour or the upcoming On The Run II Tour.

Fan Zhendong will lead a strong home team at the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) China Open when main draw action commences tomorrow in Shenzhen, a year after the country's top male players withdrew mid-tournament.
Fan, the number one seed, will be joined by reigning world and Olympic champion Ma Long, Xu Xin and Lin Gaoyuan in a Chinese squad looking to continue the form they showed when winning the Team World Championship title in Halmstad at the beginning of this month.
Fan, Ma and Xu all failed to arrive for their second-round matches at the China Open in Chengdu last year in apparent protest at the departure of their coach, Liu Guoliang.
Three more home players, including London 2012 Olympic singles champion Zhang Jike - probably the most recognisable sportsperson in China - and teenager Wang Chuqin, have successfully navigated the qualifying rounds at the Sports Center Gymnasium.
Defending champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov is absent this time around through injury but Timo Boll, who was beaten in an all-German final last year, starts as second seed.
Japanese quartet Koki Niwa, Olympic bronze medallist Jun Mizutani, Kenta Matsudaira and teenage sensation Tomokazu Harimoto - likely to be Wang's big rival at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires later this year - are also among those seeded straight through to the main draw.
Mixed doubles will feature on the China Open programme before the event makes its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 ©ITTF
South Korea's world bronze medallist Lee Sang-su, Brazil's Hugo Calderano and France's Simon Gauzy will be among other seeds hoping to spring a surprise.
China will be expected to prove similarly dominant in the women's draw after their win over Japan in the World Team Championships final.
Top seed Zhu Yuling is joined by world and Olympic singles champion Ding Ning, Wang Manyu - the world junior champion and winner in Hong Kong last week - Gu Yuting, Wu Yang and Sun Yingsha in the main draw.
Second seed Kasumi Ishikawa is also joined by Mima Ito and Miu Hirano in a full-strength Japanese team.
The event, due to take place until Sunday (June 3), will also mark the first mixed doubles competition on the World Tour following the event's addition to the Olympic programme at Tokyo 2020.
Mixed doubles will also feature at four other World Tour events this year as well as at the Grand Finals.
World Championships silver medallist Chen Chien-an and Cheng I-ching of Chinese Taipei and bronze medallists Wong Chun-ting and Doo Hoi-kem of Hong Kong are each entered this time around.
Ito and Masataka Morizono of Japan start as top seeds while Zhang Jike will lead the home charge alongside world junior champion Wang Manyu.
A toothless man ‘gummed' a police offer who was arresting them following a domestic dispute.
Michael Scott sank their gums into the police officer's boot while struggling handcuffed on the ground, South Northumbria Magistrates Court heard.
“Scott was arrested at a house in South Shields,” said Jeanette Smith, prosecuting.
“He had become agitated, and struggled with the officers who eventually managed to handcuff them from behind.
“They put them in their police car, but during the journey they became more agitated, banging their head against the window.
“The officers stopped the car en route to enable Scott to be transferred to a van in which they could be carried in safety.
“Mr Scott has no front teeth, and while they were on the ground during the transfer they sank their gums into the officer's left boot.
“There was no injury.”
Scott, 36, of Johnson Street, South Shields, admitted obstructing a police officer on October 2.
Geoffrey Forrester, defending, said: Mr Scott suffers from ADHD and a split personality disorder.
“He is also on medication for depression, so they have quite a bit on their plate.
“It was they who called the police in the first instance, but as can happen in this type of domestic incident, it was they who the officers decided to arrest.
“During the vehicle transfer they were dumped on the ground, causing them to become frustrated which is why they sunk their gums into the officers boot.”
Mr Forrester said the offence was the least serious of its type.
They added: “I suppose the officer was obstructed in that they would have been unable to chase after a burglar with Mr Scott attached to their boot by theirs gums.
“No one should obstruct the police, but I do ask the bench to accept this offence was very much at the lower end of the scale.”
The bench conditionally discharged Scott for six months.
No order for costs or victim surcharge was made because Scott has no income.

Bills introduced in the Nevada Legislature on Monday will position the Silver State as a leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy, clean-energy advocates said today. Monday was a big night for renewable energy in Carson City, with five new bills introduced aimed at reducing energy use, increasing investments in homegrown renewable energy, lowering costs for consumers, and boosting the state's economy.
Assemblyman Chris Brooks' bill to increase the amount of energy Nevada utilities get from renewable sources, called a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), would spur investment in the state's abundant solar, geothermal and wind resources, a huge boon for the economy. The RPS bill would replace the existing benchmark of 25 percent by 2020 with a goal of 50 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040, an investment that would satisfy consumers and businesses demanding clean energy.
And bills introduced in the Nevada Senate and Assembly would expand access to cost-effective energy efficiency measures. These efficiency measures would create good, local jobs while reducing energy use and power bills, especially in low-income communities.
Members and allies of the RenewNV partnership, which is working to grow Nevada's clean-energy economy, applauded the proposed legislation.
Andy Maggi, Executive Director, Nevada Conservation League Education Fund: Assemblyman Chris Brooks has jumped to the front of the pack when it comes to leadership on clean energy. We applaud their bold vision for Nevada that will put us at the center of the clean energy economy creating jobs while diversifying the economy of Nevada. We're thankful for their action this legislative session.
Pastor Ralph E. Williamson, First AME Church; President, Faith Organizing Alliance:: Faith Organizing Alliance and the many organizations we represent want to thank our legislators for introducing the various energy bills that will have a positive impact in our state and communities.
Rudy Zamora, Program Director, Chispa Nevada: “We're thrilled to see our state legislators leading on this issue for our communities and local economy,” said Rudy Zamora, program director of Chispa NV, an organizing program of the League of Conservation Voters. “Giving all Nevadans access to affordable energy efficiency and clean energy solutions is critical to saving consumers money, protecting public health and strengthening our economy. These bills, introduced by Assemblymen Chris Brooks and William McCurdy, and Senator Pat Spearman, are critical investments to our state and clean energy future.”
Annette Magnus, Executive Director, Battle Born Progress: Investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency means cleaner air for our children to breathe and good jobs right here in Nevada, and the legislation introduced last night will be a huge step toward achieving those benefits. Thanks to the legislative champions who have taken the lead on expanding Nevada's clean energy economy. We will do all we can to support their efforts, and take advantage of the opportunity on the table to make Nevada a national renewable energy leader.
Jessica Scott, Regional Director, Interior West, Vote Solar: We applaud Assemblyman Chris Brooks and State Senator Pat Spearman's commitment to progress in Nevada with ambitious, yet achievable, clean energy goals. Their leadership will prove to build economic growth, local jobs, and healthy communities to the Silver State.
RenewNV is a partnership of organizations working to build and enhance Nevada's clean energy economy. Renewable energy means reliable power, clean air, and good jobs for Nevada, and smart energy policies can make the Silver State an economic powerhouse.
MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin man convicted in a homicide featured on the “Making a Murderer” documentary has asked a judge to toss out their ruling that they don't deserve a new trial.
Sheboygan County Circuit Judge Angela Sutkiewicz rejected Steven Avery's request for a new trial on Tuesday, saying they had failed to establish any grounds to warrant a new proceeding.
Avery attorney Kathleen Zellner filed a motion with Sutkiewicz on Friday seeking to vacate the ruling, arguing their analysis of the evidence hasn't been completed.
Avery was sentenced to life in prison after they were convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the 2005 death of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer.
Avery maintains police framed him. The case gained national attention in 2015 after it was featured in the Netflix documentary.

For the first time since 2013, the Eagles are waking up Monday morning as NFC East champions, the result of their 43-35 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.
There is no denying the win came at a cost, however, with the potentially serious injury to Carson Wentz casting a dark cloud over the division championship.
The injury to Wentz, however, does not change the fact that many felt the Eagles would be able to capture the division in just the second season under head coach Doug Pederson.
How did the Eagles shock so many and win the NFC East? Here are some of the main reasons:

Liberty High School's boys basketball team made sure Alex Serrano would be on a banner in Memorial Gym, kept rival Freedom out of the postseason, and preserved its chance to be in the playoffs.
That's quite a senior night.
The Hurricanes defeated the Patriots 60-50 in an Eastern Pennsylvania Conference Steel Division game at Memorial Gym on Friday night.
Serrano, a senior guard, passed 1,000 career points in the first half and finished with a game-high 28.  They are the seventh Liberty boy to hit the milestone and now has 1,019 points in their career.
“It was something I always wanted,” said the senior, who has scored 435 points this season. “Who wouldn't want to do that? I came out and played for my team every night.”

Imagine a community where every home maintains a comfortable temperature without the use of electricity. Designed with local materials and aligned to maximize use of solar energy, these homes are more than just a place to live: They are also perfectly suited for processing food, participating in religious gatherings, and maintaining social relationships. These houses are also incredibly durable to the test of time—so durable, in fact, that they've survived thousands of years.
The Sky City village in the Pueblo of Acoma epitomizes intelligent architectural design exactly as described. About 60 miles west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, this community has thrived in its Southwestern desert atop a mesa for what tribal elders estimate to be over 2,000 years.
These days, not everyone lives in Sky City. After centuries of oppression and violence from Spanish and American colonial governments, the Pueblo of Acoma retains only about 10 percent of its original land base. And the federal government maintains a significant stake in the Pueblo of Acoma's tribal housing programs.
Today, indigenous communities are impacted by U.S. housing practices. In the case of the Pueblo of Acoma, for example, the primary source of funding for the tribe's housing authority is through a grant program that funds tribal housing projects—so long as they meet standards set by Housing and Urban Development. These standards force projects to conform to Western design principles. As a result, tribal members live in Western-style project homes—homes that don't incorporate cultural needs, aren't energy efficient, and undercut community self-sufficiency.
But some indigenous people are fighting back. They're working to revitalize traditional architecture in Native communities, insert traditional principles into Western architecture training programs, and build housing justice in Indian Country.
In my work as a master's candidate of American Indian studies at Arizona State University, I've studied the impact of housing policy on traditional housing, energy resilience, and culture in indigenous communities in Arizona. This work brought me in contact with Wanda Dalla Costa, an architect who is leading efforts to revitalize traditional architecture in Arizona.
Dalla Costa is a Saddle Creek Cree and visiting professor at ASU. They view housing as not only an expression of tribal sovereignty, but also as a pathway to nation-building.
Currently, Dalla Costa collaborates with the Gila River Indian Community, south of Phoenix, on what they call “re-operationalizing their traditional homes” in a modern context. As part of this project, students from ASU partner with tribal members to learn about traditional building techniques and the role that architectural design plays in supporting and maintaining cultural values.
One outcome of this partnership is to provide the community with recommendations for architecture that integrates traditional design principles into modern structures. Dalla Costa's team has gathered information on the role traditional structures played in the daily life and culture of the tribe's O'otham ancestors. In this process, students have listened to community members tell stories of the important role these structures play in social gatherings.
The movement to revitalize traditional housing has implications that extend beyond Indian Country.
By gathering this information, Dalla Costa and their team will establish cultural priorities that should appear in the design of modern homes. Currently, Dalla Costa is fundraising to build a housing prototype in 2019 and plans to start co-designing with tribal members soon.
Research shows that architecture that reflects local traditions and heritage provides social and cultural benefits. According to award-winning East Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi in an interview for Reuters, architecture that uses interlocking spaces, colors, and designs rooted in local traditions provides residents—especially those in vulnerable communities—with security, and can lead to social change. Yet, in an interview by Dezeen, Doshi notes that India's desire to compete globally has led it to construct characterless skyscrapers. This kind of growth reflects a “desire to be like somebody else” rather than a desire to reflect local heritage, they say. In their designs, they seek to revitalize traditional architecture by incorporating aspects of traditional design, such as architectural elements from Hindu temples.
Indigenous architecture is well-suited to extreme Arizonan heat and climate.
Traditional architecture can also build climate resiliency. Because it was developed over the course of thousands of years by indigenous people, traditional architecture is well-adapted for local climates. In their work with the Gila River Indian Community, Dalla Costa studied how traditional architecture is well-suited to extreme Arizonan heat and climate. Sandwich housing, for example, is built using adobe materials with a high thermal mass. This means they absorb and store heat, making them energy-efficient cooling structures that not only preserve culture, but increase community self-sufficiency, too.
These cultural and environmental benefits stand in contrast to Western architecture in the U.S. and Canada, where housing laws, markets, and architectural standards have commodified housing and stripped non-monetary values from design priorities—values like community strength and resiliency. A typical suburban home may have a yard to impress the neighbors, but it isn't designed to invite those neighbors in. Western architects are trained to build housing for “efficiency and mass appeal,” such as the developer homes, or “purely aesthetic,” overly reliant on slick or sexy imagery, says Dalla Costa.
How can we create homes that represent the cultural values we want without appropriating traditional architecture?
In their work, Dalla Costa hopes to build traditional values into Western architectural training programs while helping indigenous communities begin to revitalize traditional architecture in Arizona. And there are others working to do this, too.
The organization Red Feather partners with indigenous communities in Arizona to increase access to healthy housing. Instead of promoting the creation of new homes and communities, Red Feather works with tribal members to eliminate health risks in traditional—but dilapidated—houses. Also in the Southwest, the Sustainable Native Communities Collaborative plans and researches with tribes to design culturally relevant and environmentally friendly projects that promote community self-sufficiency. Joseph Kunkel, the executive director of SNCC, is a Cheyenne tribal member and visiting professor at ASU who has recently partnered with Dalla Costa.
This movement to revitalize traditional housing in Arizona has implications that extend beyond Indian Country.
It calls into question whether Western housing truly serves our needs as a home—not just a commodity. And it forces us to consider the connection between architecture, design, and cultural values. For example, what do homes with large garages and tiny kitchens say about modern American culture? Do the standard models we see in communities today support the cultural and socio-economic diversity of this country—or do they force cultural assimilation?
And how can we create homes that represent the cultural values we want—homes that are sustainable, healthy, and that build strong communities—without appropriating traditional architecture? Perhaps this is where settler-colonial communities will need to think about how they can support indigenous architects. As more and more Native-owned construction firms open, how can non-indigenous people support them?
Beginning to answer some of these questions is a step toward building housing justice for all our unique communities—on the reservation and beyond.
The seven-time Wimbledon champion is the number one seed and will play the Slovakian on Wednesday 4th July
In 2017, a month before their 36th birthday, Roger Federer became the oldest person ever to win a Wimbledon tennis title in the modern era. They can further extend that particular gap between themselves and their peers this year by retaining their crown – an unprecedented 8th – but they face stiff competition to do so.

Federer's long-time foe Rafael Nadal currently holds the world number one spot and, ten years on from their epic battle in the 2008 final, the Spaniard will be hoping they can bring their A-game from their recent French Open win to take home a third Wimbledon title. And, of course, there's the small matter of Andy Murray…
Nadal was rather respectful at the news that Federer would go into the tournament as top seed, despite the fact the Swiss currently sits at number two in the world rankings: “For winning so many times here and having so much success on grass, they deserve to be the number one seed for everything they have achieved here.”
When is Roger Federer playing their second round match at Wimbledon?
Federer will next play Lukas Lacko, the world number 73 from Slovakia, in what is likely to be another easy test for the top seed, after they saw off Lajovic 6-1 6-3 6-4 in the first round. Federer will play on Wednesday 4th July – they are second on Centre Court so will likely play from around 2:30-3pm. Check the full order of play for more information.

If they come through that, they face a possible third round clash with Ivo Karlovic or Jan-Lennard Struff.
Fewer small employers sought loans and other financing toward the end of last year as many companies dealt with fiscal challenges.
That's the finding of a survey of more than 8,100 companies released last week by the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The survey showed that demand for financing fell, with 40 per cent of companies seeking funding, down from 45 per cent a year earlier.
Meanwhile, 64 per cent of the companies reported they had financial challenges. Forty per cent said paying operating expenses was a challenge and 30 per cent said it was difficult to get credit. Companies that struggled the most were startups and those with revenue up to $100,000. Not surprisingly, many companies with financial challenges, 67 per cent, turned to personal funds to help relieve a cash crunch — they likely believed they'd be rejected if they applied for loans.
Forty-eight per cent sought loans from large banks, while 47 per cent tried to borrow from small banks. Twenty-four per cent applied to online lenders, and 18 per cent sought loans from auto or equipment dealers; farm lenders; relatives and friends and nonprofits and other non-financial organizations. (The figures add up to more than 100 per cent because some companies applied to multiple sources.)
And more businesses were successful in obtaining financing than in 2016, with 46 per cent versus 40 per cent getting approvals. Fifty-eight per cent of loan and credit applications were more successful, getting all the funds they requested. That was up from 53 per cent in 2016.
The survey was conducted in the third and fourth quarters of last year and questioned companies that had up to 499 employees.
BANKING BILL
Small business advocacy groups are praising the passage and enactment of a bill that eased some of the restrictions of the Dodd-Frank law. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act lessened regulations on small financial institutions including community banks whose customers include many small businesses.
Small business and banking industry advocates have said that Dodd-Frank, which was passed by Congress in 2010 in response to the banking industry crisis that began in 2008, has sharply curtailed lending to small companies. The U.S. has lost more than a quarter of its community banks in the decade since the financial crisis, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. While there have been hundreds of bank failures, many small banks have been forced to merge or were bought by larger institutions.
The new law “lifts inappropriate requirements and red tape from smaller financial institutions, which in turn will improve lending to small businesses,” said Karen Kerrigan, CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said the law “will help restore access to financing for Main Street.”
FEDERAL CONTRACTING GOAL
The government met its goal of awarding at least 23 per cent of federal contracting dollars to small businesses last year, the Small Business Administration said last week.
Small companies got 23.88 per cent of contracting funds, for a total of $105.7 billion, up $5 billion from 2016. It was the fifth straight year that the government reached the 23 per cent goal set by Congress.
The government didn't reach its goal of giving women-owned businesses 5 per cent of contracting dollars, for the second straight year. Companies owned by women got 4.7 per cent of contract funds.
The government did surpass its 3 per cent goal for contracting funds for businesses owned by veterans disabled while in the military; 4.1 per cent of contracting dollars went to those companies. Small disadvantaged businesses, those with an owner who is socially or economically disadvantaged, got 9.1 per cent of contracting dollars, surpassing the 5 per cent goal.

HONOLULU — A former member of congress from Hawaii says he's leaving the Republican Party because of President Donald Trump and the failure of fellow party members to stand up to him.
Charles Djou (duh-JOO') represented Honolulu in the U.S. House from 2010 to 2011.
They wrote in an opinion piece published in Civil Beat on Monday he's disturbed that the Republican Party under Trump has become hostile to immigration.
Djou lamented Trump's desire to launch a trade war, treatment of veterans like Sen. John McCain and recitation of conspiracy theories.
Djou says he's most disappointed by “the failure of the GOP to clearly and consistently condemn Trump's childish behaviour.” They say this leads to an “implicit ratification by the GOP of Trump's undisciplined, uninformed and unfocused leadership.”
The White House didn't immediately comment.
Lambda Literary announced the winners of its 29th Annual Lambda Literary Awards for excellence in LGBT literature at a ceremony Monday night at the NYU Skirball Center of the Performing Arts in New York City.
Hosted by trans-genre artist Justin Vivian Bond, presenters included Tony Award-winning producer Vivek Toward, comedian Tig Notaro, actor Cynthia Nixon, and New York Times columnists Frank Bruni and Masha Gessen.
Notable “Lammy” winners included activist Cleve Jones for When We Rise: My Life in the Movement in Gay Memoir/Biography, later adapted into a well-received television miniseries by Dustin Lance Black. “I wrote this book because the LGBT movement saved my life,” said Jones as they accepted their award, “and I'm ready to keep fighting.”
Other honorees are detailed by Lambda Literary:
Jacqueline Woodson and Jeanette Winterson were also honored for their lifetime achievements. Tony Award-winning actor Cynthia Nixon introduced Woodson, a “writer who is part of the institution but stands outside it and critiques,” said Nixon. “She is the writer, the friend, the citizen these times demand.” Accepting the Visionary Award, Woodson noted, “The work we do as a queer community for the generations beyond us make me proud to be standing here and accept this award.”
Later, Baileys Women's Prize-winning author A.M. Homes introduced Jeanette Winterson, who won the Trustee Award. “A lifetime achievement award is more than overdue for Jeanette,” said Homes. During their acceptance speech, Winterson praised the powers of writers and imagination. “Everything that happens starts with an idea,” said Winterson. “We should protect and expand the imagination: to imagine the world as different as it is.”
Other winners of the night included David France for How to Survive a Plague: The Inside Story of How Citizens and Science Tamed AIDS, a companion book to their award-winning documentary film, in LGBT Nonfiction.
Their closing statement:
“In a year of great political turmoil, the Lammys were a reminder that our LGBTQ writing community remains at the forefront of resistance to attacks on our communities,” said Tony Valenzuela, Lambda Literary Executive Director. “Congratulations to all the winners and honorees. You inspire us.”

GLENDALE, Ariz. — Marcus Mariota's answers were clipped, many one word. Their facial expression changed minimally, a quick raise of the eyebrow or lip before giving an answer after their performance against the Arizona Cardinals.
The Tennessee Titans lost a game they should have won and their quarterback shouldered most of the blame.
“Frustration is an understatement,” Mariota said following Tennessee's 12-7 loss to the Cardinals on Sunday. “Defence played lights out, special teams did their job, and I've been hurting our team. I've got to find ways to be better.”
The Titans (8-5) entered tied with Jacksonville atop the AFC South after winning six of their previous seven games. All they had to do was beat the struggling Cardinals (6-7) to stay in the division lead, maybe move a game ahead if the Jaguars couldn't get past Seattle.
Tennessee couldn't get it done. Jacksonville beat the Seahawks to boot.
Not a great first trip to University of Phoenix Stadium.
“At the end of the day, we didn't play very well,” Titans tight end Delanie Walker said. “Our defence held them to field goals and if you can't put points on the board, obviously you can't win game.”
Mariota starred as a redshirt first-year student for Oregon at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl their last trip to Glendale, leading the Ducks to a 35-17 victory over Kansas State. They were mostly ineffective against Arizona's defence, struggling with their aim and not nearly as mobile after tweaking their knee in the first quarter.
Tennessee's run game, which moved up to seventh in the NFL last week, was almost nonexistent, contributing 65 yards on 22 carries after a season-high 198 yards last week. The Titans finished with 204 total yards to fall a game back in the division.
“Defence played out of their mind the whole game,” Titans coach Mike Mularkey said. “We had a chance to win the game because of our defence. Special teams wasn't good enough, and neither was our offence.”
After a punt-filled first quarter, the Titans put together a nine-play, 50-yard scoring drive, capped by Derrick Henry's 6-yard TD run .
Tennessee's offence then went back to sputtering.
The Titans took a gamble in the third quarter, attempting a fake punt that appeared to work. Upon review, the officials changed the spot, leaving Tennessee short of a first down.
Arizona took over at the Titans' 35-yard line, setting up Phil Dawson's second field goal, from 23 yards to cut Tennessee's lead to 7-6.
“We should have got it and I thought we got it,” Mularkey said. “I don't know how it got overturned. With all those bodies, I don't know how they saw it. I question that immensely, that overturn.”
The Titans moved into Arizona's end of the field on its second drive of the third quarter, but a miscommunication with receiver Rishard Matthews turned into an interception by Tramon Williams.
Mariota's second interception, with Tennessee trailing 9-7, was their fault.
Trying to squeeze a pass into Walker, they didn't see Josh Bynes drop back into underneath coverage. Bynes snared the ball and returned it 25 yards to Tennessee's 15, setting up Dawson's fourth field goal, a 35-yarder that put Arizona up 12-7.
“That's on me. I didn't see them under there,” said Mariota, who threw for 159 yards on 16 of 31 passing.
The Titans got the ball back twice in the final 3:45, but were forced to punt once, and turned it over on downs.
Defensively, the Titans were effective pressuring Blaine Gabbert, sacking them eight times, even with outside linebacker Derrick Morgan injured. Tennessee was good in the red zone, holding the Cardinals to four field goals and a miss on another.
It wasn't good enough, thanks to the Titans' wobbling offence.
Now the Titans will remain in the desert to figure out what went wrong, practicing this week at Arizona State University to prepare for Sunday's game against San Francisco.

Police are looking for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Ellesmere Port in the early hours of this morning (Monday, December 11).
The 27-year-old was walking along Princes Road between 12.45am and 1.15am when they were seriously assaulted by three men.
A 24-year-old man from Ellesmere Port has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and is currently in police custody but police are still looking for two other men and urge anyone with any information to come forward.
Detective Sergeant Damian Tierney, of Ellesmere Port CID, said: “Firstly, I want to reassure the local community that this incident is not-connected to a stabbing which took place in the same area last November.
"I also want to make it clear that we believe this to be a targeted assault on the victim and not a random attack.
“The victim has received serious wounds and although we have made an arrest we are still looking for another two men. I am urging anyone who may have any information, no matter how big or small, to come forward and call us on 101.”
The victim remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
Anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the assault or has any information is asked to contact Cheshire police on 101 quoting incident 42 of December 11.
Information can also be passed on anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

It's 3am, London time, Monday and I'm sitting on the floor of Heathrow Terminal 5.
My British Airways flight was supposed to get me home to Washington DC Sunday evening. However, there was a little sleet and snow around London and the system ground to a halt. As I arrived at Heathrow T5, there a lot of flight had already been canceled (mostly to or from Europe) and delays. And there were long lines of people waiting to get re-ticketed.
There was not a lot of snow, but weather can quickly have a knock-on effect. Nevertheless, given that snow was forecast, it was surprising to see that BA and Heathrow seemed little prepared to handle the changes and heavier workloads they must have known would be likely.
My flight (an American Airlines ticket operated by BA) was delayed about three hours - first because there were insufficient gates for incoming aircraft as they backed up; then because a passenger's bag had to be unloaded after we boarded; and then for de-icing.
But as we finally prepared to leave the gate there was a bang, it went dark and the captain announced there had been an APU failure. By the time the APU restarted, the captain announced worse news; the crew was now at the edge of its roster time and there was no spare crew. The flight was canceled and we would have the de-board. We were on the aircraft almost another hour -- because we were waiting for gate agents, they said.
We were told we'd have to go back through immigration, collect our bags, then return to check-in where BA staff would rebook our flights and find us hotel accommodation.
From the moment we de-boarded, however, there was no sight at all of any BA staff. We backtracked through T5's tortuously complicated transit system. This involves two sets of escalators and elevators. The escalators were not working and only two of the three elevators worked, so there was a big backup and crush. But much worse was to come. At immigration, the queues snaked forever. Again, not a single BA or Heathrow agent to be seen. There was no proper signage and a lot of confusion as masses of people from canceled flights tried to work out which was the right place to be for UK, EU or other passports. In the end, it didn't matter. The queues all became one huge clog. I stood for three hours. So did many elderly people and families with small children. There was no one to help or prioritize them.
After three hours, when I at last cleared UK Border Force & Immigration, there was more chaos in the baggage area. Hundreds of bags were piled across the floor in no order and with no signs. And no-one helping anyone to locate their bags. It was now 1am and we finally heard a BA voice (but did not see a BA person), sternly telling us if we couldn't see our bags we must leave the baggage area. We were told there would be no help with hotels; and BA could do nothing more until they reopened at 5am. BA may have been off the hook for any assistance where weather was the cause of cancellation, but my flight was canceled because of an APU failure and crew unavailability. Nevertheless, there was no one at all to help.Karen
So here I am, at now 3.30am, on the floor of a freezing cold T5. No bags, No ticket, No idea when I'll get out of here. BA.com and AA.com are useless - clearly the system just caves in when there is an unforeseen event, which is precisely when you want an airline's online system to work. There are, of course, lots of miserable, tired, cold people sharing this floor with me. They are all BA customers. But there is no evidence of any BA or Heathrow staff. Even if some are working behind the scenes to try and make tomorrow a better day, there should be staff out here with their customers. But there is no evidence whatsoever that they see themselves as being in the service industry or that they regard these people on the floor as their customers.

Interested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
It looks like Groundhog Day for the nation's flu report, too: It's gotten worse and there are weeks of suffering ahead.
The government's report out Friday showed the flu season continued to intensify last week.
One of every 14 visits to doctors and clinics were for fever, cough and other symptoms of the flu. That's the highest level since the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Last week, 42 states reported high patient traffic for the flu, up from 39.
Hospital stays because of the flu also increased.
Experts had thought this season might be bad, but its intensity has surprised most everyone.
"It's been the busiest I can remember for a long time," said Dr. Doug Olson, an ER doctor at Northside Hospital Forsyth, in Cumming, Georgia. Another hospital in the Atlanta area this week set up a mobile ER outside to handle flu cases.
The heavy flu season has also put a strain in places on some medical supplies, including IV bags, and flu medicine.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tally shows hospitalization rates surged to surpass the nasty season of the winter of 2014-2015, when the vaccine was a poor match to the main bug.
So far, however, deaths this season from the flu and flu-related pneumonia have lagged a little behind some recent bad seasons. There are as many as 56,000 deaths connected to the flu during a bad year.
The flu usually peaks in February. This season had an early start, and health officials initially thought it would also have an early peak. But so far it hasn't worked out that way.
And there are some signs the flu season will continue to get worse. The CDC's forecast though wasn't quite as precise as Punxsutawney Phil's; the groundhog "predicted" six more weeks of winter on Friday.
As for the flu: "There may be many weeks left for this season," said the CDC's Dr. Dan Jernigan.
Some good news: Illnesses seem to be easing a bit on the West Coast. Oregon joined Hawaii last week as the only states where flu wasn't widespread. Friday's report covers the week ending Jan. 27.
In the U.S., annual flu shots are recommended for everyone age 6 months or older. This season's vaccine targets the strains that are making Americans sick, including the key H3N2 virus. How well it worked won't be known until later this month. An early report from Canada for the same flu shot shows protection against that bug has been poor, just 17 percent.
Canada's flu season so far has been milder with more of a mix of strains. But CDC officials said effectiveness figures in the U.S. may end up in the same range.
Some researchers say part of the problem may be that most flu vaccine is made by growing viruses in chicken eggs; the viruses can mutate in the eggs, making the vaccine less effective in people.
The cold winter in many parts of the country may also have played a role, keeping people indoors and helping flu bugs to spread, said Dr. David Weber, a University of North Carolina flu expert.
Whatever the reason, "it's a whopper of a flu season," said Mimi Dreifuss, a North Carolina nurse who got sick this week.
Dreifuss, 61, worked in a pediatrician's office for years and didn't catch the flu. They retired last year and didn't get a flu shot figuring they were no longer around sick children. This week they had a 101 temperature and was diagnosed with the flu.
"I'm feeling kind of foolish," said Dreifuss, of Bynum, North Carolina.
In Pensacola, Florida, an ER nurse's Facebook rant after a 12-hour shift got attention this week, with their venting about people not doing enough to stop the spread of germs. They demonstrate the "magic trick" of sneezing or coughing into the crook of an arm.
They also complain about people without true emergencies crowding into waiting rooms, next to people with the flu.
"So guess what? Five flus came in, 15 flus walk out. It's great," says Katherine Lockler. "They'll be back."

VAUGHAN, Ont. — Recipe Unlimited Corporation will eliminate plastic straws from its 19 restaurant brands including Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, Kelsey's and East Side Mario's.
The restaurant giant formerly known as Cara Operations will start phasing out its plastic straws in August.
Recipe Unlimited says it will dump plastic straws because of their impact on the environment and wildlife and the company's commitment to recyclable materials.
It hopes to offer paper straws in all of its restaurants by the end of March 2019.
The compostable and biodegradable straws will automatically be provided with drink orders at the brand's quick serve restaurants, including New York Fries and St-Hubert.
Patrons will have to request paper straws to receive one at its full-service restaurants like the Pickle Barrel and Milestones.

Just in time for summer-like temperatures in October, Allentown is finally opening its multi-million dollar Cedar Beach Pool.
Yes, Allentown residents can take a dip this weekend -- for free.
The city's largest and most popular pool has been dry since 2015, when a leak closed the pool for that summer.
The pool will be open from noon to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday for city residents and city employees. Visitors are required to show identification, such as a driver's license, city ID or school ID.
The cover will come off this $3M public pool project soon
Saturday will also include a showing of "Finding Dory" on the city's outdoor movie screen, which is slated to start at dusk.
That project was supposed to be completed by the summer of 2016, but the city ran into a number of problems, including structural issues discovered after the project began.
The delays have led to the project to balloon from $1.3 million to more than $3 million.

Setting expectations for Baylor in Year One under coach Matt Rhule is complicated. Baylor is still navigating the fallout of a scandal that led to the firing of coach Art Briles and the departures of an athletic director and school president. There is at least a possibility NCAA sanctions could follow. The Bears are coming off a troubled 7-6 season under a lame-duck coaching staff, but from 2011-2015 they had four double-digit victory seasons and won two Big 12 titles. The Bears have the resources and infrastructure to remain a Big 12 contender, but it is not given they won't backslide to the bad ol' days. Theoretically, Rhule will be given some leeway by Baylor fans in 2017 to implement their systems and build their culture. The Bears are not void of talent, and they should benefit from a nonconference schedule that is not overly taxing. Still, it is hard to say what a successful first season at Baylor looks like for Rhule. They will enter next season as one of the most scrutinized of 21 FBS head coaches starting new jobs. Six more new head coaches who will get little to no grace period: Tom Herman, Texas The Longhorns are coming off three straight losing seasons under Charlie Strong, but there is no talk of rebuilding in Austin. The narrative at Texas is Strong recruited well enough that their successor is taking over a team with enough talent to make a quick turnaround. Considering Herman walked into a similar situation at Houston in 2015 and went 13-1, good luck trying to temper expectations at Texas. Major Applewhite, Houston Houston promoted Herman's offensive coordinator to keep a good thing going. Herman leaves behind one of the most talented rosters in the American Athletic Conference and a former five-star recruit quarterback in Texas A&M transfer Kyle Allen. Applewhite is a first-time head coach, competing in the toughest division of any Group of Five conference. Still, if the Cougars regress, fingers will point at him. Charlie Strong, USF See a trend here? From Herman to their replacement to their predecessor. Strong has spent most of their professional career in Florida, so they were a natural fit with the Bulls. They inherit a team that went 11-2 last season, finished ranked 19th in the nation and returns one of the best quarterbacks in the country (Quinton Flowers). Anything less than another AAC title run for the Bulls will reflect poorly on Strong, who is trying to prove their struggles at Texas – not their successes at Louisville – were an anomaly. Lane Kiffin, FAU The Owls are coming off three straight 3-9 seasons, so there is no reason for high expectations. But you might have noticed that their new coach draws a lot of attention. Kiffin will be more closely followed than any Group of Five coach both for the product FAU puts on the field and how they act off it. Willie Taggart, Oregon Oregon just fired a coach (Mark Helfrich) two seasons removed from a national title game appearance. Patience is not in high supply around Eugene these days. Taggart has some rebuilding to do, but with Washington on the rise and USC's arrow pointing up, the Ducks need to show signs of progress fast or risk being relegated to the second-tier of the Pac-12 for a while. Mike Sanford, Western Kentucky A first-time head coach, the youngest in FBS at 34, taking over a program at its peak. The Hilltoppers have not had a losing season since 2010 and went 23-5 with consecutive Conference USA titles the last two years under Jeff Brohm, now at Purdue. There is nowhere to go but down, and some regression seems almost inevitable. Sanford will be learning on the job and they will need to be a quick study. — Follow Ralph D.

Article written by 96five Intern – Alec Camplin
It's March 2017 on a remote Phillipino farm and 34 year old Raoul Olimpo struggles to tend their crops with their pick. Later tonight he'll return home to their family who he's been toiling all day to provide for. He'll walk in the door, gently touch their 3 year old daughters adoring face. They won't be able to see them though. Raoul is blind.
Fast forward to August and millions of people like Raoul are missing out on the opportunity to see their loved ones grow up due to debilitating, but curable blindness. Our Ken, Nicky and Steve have been flown over to the Philippines this week to witness firsthand the pain of sightlessness and the power of a CBM operation. All this week they will be sharing the stories of those suffering from cataracts just like Raoul in the lead up to Miracles Day this Thursday.
With the help of donations such as those from 96five listeners, CBM was able to restore Raouls' sight earlier this year for just $32. Prior to their operation Raoul shared about the need for them to continue to work on the farm for their family despite their blindness;
“Because I really wanted to give a means of living for my family I am still working even though I can't see what I am doing. After the operation I want to see beautiful things and if my eyesight is restored I want to help others.”
After their 12 minute operation they spoke with CBM;
“My eyes are good today. Thank you for your help. Because of you I was able to have my sight restored. And I hope you can help more people like me and now I am looking forward to working well again because I can see better than before.”
The great thing is that more people like Raoul can be helped. We're aiming for 30,000 miracles so this Thursday from 6am we're asking for your help and to give sight for just $32.
If you'd like to help make miracles happen please call 131 226 or donate online here.

Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time
Mark 1:29-39
The Book of Job is the source of this weekend's first reading. This book furnishes few details about the identity of Job. It nonetheless is one of the great literary works in the Old Testament, and one of the best remembered — if not always exactly remembered.
Misreading Job has led to a phrase that has gone into English common speech, the “patience of Job.” Clearly, Job was not always so patient with God.
For instance, in this weekend's reading, Job vents their impatience. They ask if life on earth is not, in reality, drudgery. Each human being, Job writes, is a slave. Personally, Job says they have been assigned “months of misery.” “I shall not see happiness again,” they write drearily.
St. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians provides the second reading.
The same source has given earlier weekend liturgies this winter their second readings. In this passage from First Corinthians, Paul insists that they were free to accept the call to be an apostle, or to spurn the call. They chose to accept the call.
So, they proclaim the Good News. They explain the identity and mission of Jesus. It is an act of service and of love, given for people who otherwise would not know Jesus. Paul sees nothing as more important than bringing people to the knowledge of Christ and to loving Christ.
For its final reading, the Church offers us St. Mark's Gospel the story of the Lord's curing of Peter's mother-in-law.
The story's point is clear. Merely by touching their hand, Jesus cured the woman. They were so fully cured, in fact, that they immediately rose from their sickbed and began to wait on Jesus and the disciples. They were healthy again, but they used their health to care for others.
Lest it appears that this woman simply resumed routine domestic chores, it should be noted that the verb used by Mark in this reference is the same verb used to describe the ministry of the angels while Jesus was in the desert, an event soon to be told. For Christians, serving others, even in their physical needs, is holy and a product of union with Christ.
(This miracle long has fascinated Christians. Indeed, in the ruins of Capernaum are a site that pious pilgrims identified many centuries ago as the place where the house of Peter's mother-in-law stood.)
The story continues. Jesus heals the sick and drives demons away. Then, alone, Jesus went to a distant place to pray. Simon and the others pursue Jesus, longing to be near the Lord, needing the Lord.
When at last they find Jesus, the Lord reminds them that the messianic role is to reach all people.
Reflection
The Church continues to introduce us to Jesus, the Lord, the Son of God, with all the power thus implied. This Liturgy of the Word further puts before us the images of Job, the apostle Paul, Peter's mother-in-law, and the apostles accompanying Jesus.
Paul very obviously gave their lives to the vocation to which Jesus called him, that of being an apostle, of being the bearer to people of the Lord's message and mercy. It was the mission of all the Apostles, as Jesus told them. It is the mission of all Christians.
Peter's mother-in-law, cured by Jesus, did not simply return to life as usual, but, as Mark's use of a particular verb shows, they served others, as Jesus served.
Job brings to mind who and what we are, limited human beings, whose limitations at times may test our best intentions. Amid this reality, the Lord is our strength and our model. The Apostles knew that there is no other model and none with greater strength and power than the Lord.

A centuries old tradition and a centuries old fibre have been reunited in a perfect match with the gondoliers of Venice returning to their roots to again wear wool. And not just any wool but fine Australian Merino wool. The islands of Venice on Italy's north east coast are famous for canals and gondolas, the original mode of transport from 1200 BC for crossing the canals and now one of the world's most sought after tourist experiences. In a move to put wool in front of that global audience, estimated at 26 to 30 million visitors annually compared to Venice's population of 54,000 people, The Woolmark Company (TWC) joined forces late last year with renowned local design house Emilio Ceccato. TWC's Milan-based global strategy advisor Fabrizio Servente said the idea was born two years ago when they and Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) CEO Stuart McCullough were meeting in Venice. Staying at the Monaco Grand Hotel, perfectly located on the Grand Canal near Piazza San Marco they watched gondolas coming to and from the traghetti (gondola rank) in front of their hotel, one of the six gondola ranks operating throughout the city. "Stuart said to me if only we could get these gondoliers wearing wool how good would that be for our fibre branding and some global exposure," Mr Servente said. "I said great idea, I know exactly who we need to talk to." Emilio Ceccato, established in 1902 is the official clothier for the Association of Venetian Gondoliers (AVG), the governing body for its 433 registered gondoliers and Mr Servente knows Guiliano Ceccato, grandson of founder Emilio Ceccato and their family well. An initial conversation with the company's CEO Alberto Bozzo and dialogue with former Italian rugby player and AVG president Aldo Reato sparked the seed of an idea that finally became reality with the launch of three woollen garments in September last year. The range includes a woollen polo shirt, perfect for Venice's temperate summers, a woollen rugby jumper and a puffer vest made from waterproof 100 per cent woollen fabric and filled with woollen down, all in traditional colours of navy blue and navy blue and white stripes.
Each item carries the Gondolier Association logo, designed by Emilio Ceccato and more notably for Australian Merino woolgrowers, the Woolmark logo. The sizeable Woolmark logo is positioned on the sleeve of the upper arm of the polo shirt and rugby jumpers and on the bottom right hand corner of the vest, strategically placed at eye height to passengers riding in the gondola. But the exposure goes well beyond the gondoliers themselves with all products available for purchase by the general public in the official stores operated by Emilio Ceccato and online at www.emilioceccato.com And when local Venetian basketball team Reyer, owned by the mayor Luigi Brugnaro won the national basketball championship it was gondolas that were used to transport the mayor, players and officials around the city for a celebratory procession. With the intention of spreading TWC's collaboration Mr Servente said the three garments designed and made by Emilio Ceccato used Australian woollen product from three Italian companies, with active fabric for the polo shirt sourced from Reda, yarn for the rugby jumper from Tollegno and product for the vest from Tessuti Marzotto Fabrics. As a company focused on top quality, high-end fashion for men and women through its 14 stores in north eastern Italy and online including its own Al Duca D'Aosta label which uses 60 per cent wool in winter collections, Mr Bozzo said their company was very proud to work with TWC on such a significant project to Venice. "Gondolas and gondoliers are part of the heart and soul of Venice and we are happy to be bringing a mark of quality back to them and revisiting the tradition of using wool which is such a top notch fibre," they said. "We're taking tradition and giving it a new twist with the technology utilised in creating these modern fabrics." But perhaps the best seal of approval comes from the gondoliers themselves. Mr Reato said the use of wool provided the best class uniform, raising the quality and visibility through a noble fibre for a noble profession and they liked the fact it revisited their heritage bringing wool back to the gondola after 100 years.
With gondoliers doing shifts of 10 to 15 hours in summer and five to six hours in winter and each tour averaging four to five kilometres, the woollen garments were comfortable to wear and the wives loved them because they could be thrown in the washing machine to wash. That said gondoliering is no longer a male dominated industry with two of the 433 Venetian gondoliers now women and Mr Reato keen to welcome more. The quota of 433 registered gondolier licences is fixed and licences can only be handed down within a family from a father to a son (now also daughter) or sold on the rare occasion there is no succession lineage. As part of its contract, Mr Bozzo said Emilio Ceccato undertook to provide each of the 433 gondoliers with a new woollen kit every year and moves were afoot to extend the range, with Woolmark wool set to replace cotton and other fabrics in future. "Traditionally gondoliers could wear red and white or blue and white stripes so we are introducing red and white striped woollen garments into the next issue, including short and long sleeved t-shirts and also looking at woollen beanies (French berets in use currently) and long sleeved jackets," Mr Bozzo said. Woollen throw rugs for use by passengers in the gondolas in cooler weather was another possibility. Mr Bozzo said every garment worn by the gondoliers, plus a range of other memorabilia totalling about 140 different items, was available for purchase in their three designated gondolier stores, including one at the base of the historic Rialto bridge, and online at www.emilioceccato.com This provides an even stronger branding opportunity for wool as tourists avail This provides an even stronger branding opportunity for wool as tourists avail themselves of products made from the unique fibre and early feedback from within store is the woollen garments are proving extremely popular with the visiting public. "A royalty for every item sold is paid to the gondolier association and this money is being used to fund several projects close to the heart of the organisation," Mr Bozzo said.
FREDERICTON — CannabisNB will be the name of the New Brunswick government's cannabis retail stores when they open next year.
The government announced earlier this fall that a subsidiary of NB Liquor will operate 20 stores in 15 locations across the province when recreational cannabis is legalized in July 2018.
The products will be displayed under glass and will only be sold to people 19 years of age and older.
Finance Minister Cathy Rogers says the provincial government has introduced legislation focused on ensuring public health and safety is respected by having strong regulations for production, distribution, and sale of cannabis.
Nova Scotia and P.E.I. both set their legal age for marijuana at 19 last week, but are taking different paths on how weed will be sold.
P.E.I. will sell marijuana at standalone outlets run separately by its liquor commission, while Nova Scotia said pot will be sold alongside alcohol in its provincial liquor stores.
INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts finally made a splash in free agency Monday by signing tight end Eric Ebron.
Terms of the deal were not immediately available.
Ebron was released last week by the Detroit Lions, the team that made them a first-round pick in 2014.
The 6-foot-4, 2532-pound Ebron gives quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Jacoby Brissett another receiving threat. They will be paired with Jack Doyle, who appeared in their first Pro Bowl last season.
Ebron had 186 receptions, 2,070 yards and 11 TDs in four seasons with the Lions and developed a reputation for dropping passes. But he's just 24 years old.
Indy's move comes on the heels of Saturday's trade that gave the New York Jets the No. 3 overall pick in the draft. Indy got the Jets pick at No. 6, two second-round picks this year and another second-rounder in 2019.

MONTREAL — The sexual misconduct scandal that has dominated Quebec's entertainment headlines this year was front and centre at the annual awards ceremony honouring the best in comedy in the province.
The allegations against Just For Laughs founder Gilbert Rozon were predominant during the Olivier gala on Sunday night, with host Francois Morency tackling head-on the topic of the year in the field of humour.
Morency received lengthy applause when they acknowledged all the victims who've spoken out against their alleged aggressors.
Francois Bellefeuille, who won an award for the best-selling first solo show, said they would auction off their award and match the sale price to make a donation to an association of Quebec centres that helps fight against sexual assault.
They also said Just For Laughs would also match the amount raised — even if they hadn't talked to the organization about it yet.
“But when it's said on television, it's hard to say no after,” they said.
After the event, Bellefeuille confirmed on their Facebook page that Just For Laughs would be matching the amount.
The province's comedy scene has been engulfed by serious allegations against former Just For Laughs boss Gilbert Rozon.
The influential entertainment mogul faces allegations from at least 10 women they either sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them.
Comedians attending the event wanted to put their profession first, but acknowledged on the red carpet it was inevitable the issue would be addressed during the evening.
“I think it's worth denouncing what happened, and also, it's not over, hopefully, because other things have to come out,” said Julien Lacroix, who went on to win the award for discovery of the year.
They expected Morency to tackle the issue quickly, which the host did, but they hoped it would be a festive gala.
“It's still the humor we celebrate,” they said.
Sighing, Morency joked they have called the gala their “annual burnout.”
Last year, they had to navigate a controversy involving comedians Mike Ward and Guy Nantel, who had a number censored at the gala.
Tottenham Hotspur right-back Kyle Walker-Peters was understandably delighted to win the man of the match award on their debut against Newcastle United yesterday.
The England Under-20 World Cup winner put in an excellent display at St James' Park that saw them named as the best player on the pitch.
On the flight back to London from Newcastle, team-mate Eric Dier caught Walker-Peters allowing their pride to manifest itself. The England international snapped a photo of their young colleague taking a picture of the award.
On Friday, Pusha T released their album Daytona. In addition to containing some of the most interesting music from the rapper in years, the album included a song called “Infrared” that took shots at Drake. Less than 24 hours later, the Toronto rapper fought back with “Duppy Freestyle,” a 3-minute Soundcloud track that came with an actual $100,000 invoice billing Push and Kanye for “promotional assistance and career reviving” in reference to a line from the freestyle.
Now, Pusha T has fired back with “The Story of Adidon,” a freestyle rapping over Jay-Z's “The Story of OJ” beat. The album art features Drake in blackface makeup, and the song makes reference to Drake being ‘always afraid they aren't black enough.' Listen below, and enjoy this video of Drake geeking out about an autographed Pusha T microphone here.
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Jarkel Joiner scored 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting, Damiyne Durham added 16 more and Cal State Bakersfield cruised to an 81-58 win over Missouri-Kansas City on Saturday night.

Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil End Arsenal's Away Woes
Arsenal have moved back up to sixth in the Premier League table courtesy of a hard-fought 2-1 victory over struggling Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium this evening.
Alexis Sanchez gave the Gunners a lead with a rare piece of quality in an otherwise uneventful first half, but that was cancelled out by Alvaro Negredo early in the second half.
Anything other than a win would have been another major blow to Arsenal's top-four hopes, but Mesut Ozil ensured that they closed the gap to the Champions League places back to seven points with the winner 19 minutes from time.
Both managers made wholesale changes to their teams in an attempt to improve their dreadful form having seen their respective goals of survival and Champions League football slip away in recent weeks.
Boro – without a league win since December 17 – brought in the likes of Negredo, Gaston Ramirez and Fabio amongst their five changes, but it was Arsene Wenger's decision to switch to three at the back for the first time in 20 years that raised the most eyebrows.
Rob Holding was amongst those to come in, while Petr Cech and Laurent Koscielny also returned as the Gunners brought in no fewer than six new faces to their starting XI having lost four away league games in a row for the first time under Wenger.
Perhaps unsurprisingly for two teams in such poor form it was a tense and cagey contest for the most part, with a 35-yard effort from Grant Leadbitter that flew comfortably wide the most notable attacking moment of the opening 20 minutes.
Boro did have the ball in the back of the net midway through the first half when Ramirez hoisted a delivery into the middle for Marten de Roon to nod home, but they did so from an offside position and the celebrations were immediately cut short by the linesman's flag.
Arsenal's first sight of goal arrived shortly before the half-hour mark, but Aaron Ramsey and Sanchez both failed to make the most of difficult volleyed chances inside the Boro area within a minute of each other.
It was the Chilean who produced the sole piece of real quality in the first half to send Arsenal into the break ahead, though, firing a free kick past a statuesque Brad Guzan from 25 yards for their 19th league goal of the season.
Boro's status as the lowest scorers in the top four tiers of English football made it difficult to see them getting back into the match, but it took just five minutes for them to find an equaliser after the restart as Arsenal once again failed to keep a clean sheet on the road.
Stewart Downing was the creator, cutting inside before clipping a fine ball into the middle that Negredo was able to poke home with the base of their foot having snuck in between the two Arsenal defenders.
The Gunners, who collapsed in the second half on their way to a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace a week ago, looked shaky again in the immediate aftermath of that goal and Downing failed to capitalise on some shoddy defending when they blazed the ball a long way over the crossbar from inside the area.
That sparked an open period of the match during which time Guzan thwarted Ozil after the German had got a toe to the ball having been found by Sanchez's incisive pass.
Ozil would have better luck when they restored Arsenal's lead 19 minutes from time though, with Sanchez and Ramsey combining to lay the ball into the path of the midfielder to fire home from close range.
Boro boss Steve Agnew threw Rudy Gestede into the mix as they looked to get their side back into the match, and the big striker almost made an immediate impact when they teed up Negredo on the edge of the box, only for the Spaniard to see their effort saved by Cech.
Arsenal could have killed the game off with nine minutes remaining when Giroud blazed well wide from the edge of the box, but the hosts were soon back on the attack and Ayala and Ben Gibson both failed to make the most of half-chances as Boro bombarded the area with high balls.
The home side were given four minutes of added time to come up with a response, but it was Arsenal who looked most like scoring in that time and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came close twice before Olivier Giroud sent an audacious lofted effort just past the post.
A one-goal lead proved to be enough for the visitors as they won on the road for the first time in more than three months, though, lifting them back above Everton and into the top six ahead of next weekend's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City.
Boro, on the other hand, remain in a perilous position with just six games of the season to go, three of which will come against teams currently in the top four.

FORT MYERS, Fla. — About a month ago, Minnesota Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco learned they had tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance.
The news of their 80-game suspension, including ineligibility for post-season play, hit the Twins hard on Sunday after their exhibition game.
“We don't want it in our game. We want a clean game. It sometimes is disappointing in seeing guys still trying to use performance-enhancing drugs,” second baseman Brian Dozier said on Monday as the Twins started their final full week of spring training. “But at the same time, when it comes to a guy on my team, that's my brother. They need love right now. That's the only thing I'm really worried about.”
Now the Twins must concern themselves with Polanco's place in the lineup. They had a breakout second half of their first full season as the regular shortstop in 2017, batting .316 with 10 home runs and 42 RBIs over their last 55 games from Aug. 1 on while taking over the No. 3 spot in the batting order and helping the Twins reach the AL wild-card game.
Twins chief baseball officer Derek Falvey said shortstop is one of the positions they felt the team entered the spring with depth at, including Eduardo Escobar, Ehire Adrianza and non-roster invitee Erick Aybar. The versatile Escobar, who played five different positions for the Twins last season including one inning at catcher, is likely to be the primary option. Nobody has played more shortstop for the Twins since 2014 than Escobar, who hit 21 homers with 73 RBIs in 457 at-bats, all career highs.
“What Escobar did step up for us last season and we're going to ask them again, which is to step up and be a big part of this,” Falvey said. “He's worn that jersey and been fine with that before. I think Adrianza is somebody we really liked last year when we got them and was somebody who could continue to progress and grow. So, between those two guys internally who are on the roster, we feel like those guys are in a great spot to step up for us.”
Aybar, who has begun their 12th major league season, was signed to a minor league contract last month, before the Twins knew about Polanco's pending suspension. There's also some uncertainty about the availability of third baseman Miguel Sano, though to a much lesser degree than the half-season Polanco will be absent for. Sano is being investigated by Major League Baseball for alleged harassment of a freelance photographer after an autograph signing in 2015, and he's also recovering from surgery on their shin.
Then there's Nick Gordon, the fifth overall pick in the 2014 amateur draft who was at Double-A Chattanooga last season. They spent plenty of time at second base during spring training before being reassigned to minor league camp on Sunday shortly before news broke of Polanco's suspension, and Falvey said Gordon would continue to work out shortstop, their original position.
As for Polanco, they decided to drop their appeal of the punishment on Sunday out of respect for the team so he'd begin serving it as soon as possible. Polanco met with reporters briefly on Monday before he'd had an opportunity to address their teammates. He'll continue to work out at the team's facility in Fort Myers when the team breaks camp and can play in extended spring training games with the minor leaguers.
“I know how everything happened,” Polanco said. “I know the details, but today's not a day to discuss those things. Today's a day for me to be here in front of all of you guys and the Twins organization and my fans and just apologize.”
In a statement distributed by the players' union on Sunday, Polanco said they didn't realize he'd consumed the banned substance Stanozolol, which came from a combination of vitamin B12 and an iron supplement supplied by their athletic trainer in their native Dominican Republic.
“My hope is that through this extremely disappointing situation other players will learn from my mistake,” Polanco said in the statement.

Patients at a Neston village dental practice describe the treatment they receive as thorough and first class, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) watchdog heard.
The announced inspection was carried out at Willaston Dental Practice in Wheatley Bungalow, Neston Road, Willaston which is run by Dr Susan Elaine Haworth.
The inspector, who was able to consult a specialist dental advisor, found no reasons to take any further action on any aspects of the service.
The CQC describes the practice as safe, effective, caring, responsive and well led.
It is close to the centre of Willaston and provides dental care and treatment to adults and children on an NHS or privately funded basis.
The dental team includes the principal dentist, a dental hygienist, a dental hygiene therapist, five dental nurses, one of whom is a trainee, a receptionist and an administrator. The practice has three treatment rooms.
Hours are Monday to Thursday 9am to 5.30pm and Friday 9am to 4pm with dedicated emergency appointments available.
The surgery is owned by Dr Haworth. The CQC says it received feedback from 35 people during the inspection said to be ‘positive'.
Key findings included the practice is clean and well maintained, infection control procedures are in place, staff know how to deal with emergencies and medical emergency medicines and equipment are available.
Staff provide patients' care and treatment in line with current guidelines and treat patients with dignity and respect. They take care to protect their privacy and personal information.
The appointment system takes patients' needs into account and staff feel involved and supported. They work well as a team.
Patients and staff are asked about the services they provide and the practice has arrangements in place to help manage risk but not all risks, specifically when handling sharps, had been monitored appropriately. The CQC asked for this to be reviewed.
Patients describe the treatment they receive as thorough and first class and are positive about all aspects of the service.
They told the CQC staff at the practice are ‘knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming' and are ‘kind and helpful' when they are in pain, distress or discomfort.
They are given ‘clear explanations' about dental treatment and options and the clinicians listen to them.
Staff make them feel at ease especially when they are anxious about visiting the dentist.
Patients can obtain an appointment quickly in an emergency and staff promptly respond to any concerns and complaints .
Arrangements are in place to ensure the smooth running of the service.
Staff know their responsibilities should they have concerns about the safety of children, young people or adults who are vulnerable due to their circumstances.
They know what to do in a medical emergency and complete training in medical emergencies and life support every year.
Arrangements are in place to ensure X-ray procedures are carried out safely and detailed dental care records containing information about patients' current dental needs, past treatment and medical history are kept.
Pema Lama was at work in New York City three years ago when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck their home country of Nepal.
Over the next four days, they didn't sleep or eat as they tried to reach their children from more than 7,000 miles away.
“Finally, finally my son called me,” they said.
Lama is one of nearly 9,000 people from Nepal living in the United States with humanitarian protection known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
The Trump administration must decide by Wednesday whether to terminate status for Nepal, which was granted after the April 25, 2015 earthquake left approximately 9,000 people dead, 22,000 injured and 755,000 homes significantly damaged or destroyed.
Roughly 25 to 33 percent of Nepal's population - eight million people - were affected.
Wednesday is the three-year anniversary of the earthquake.
Lama, who works as a nanny, came to the U.S. in 1994, leaving their children – ages 4 and 6 – behind. They said they stayed in the U.S. for a “better chance, better education and better future for me and my kids.”
Protected status allowed them to travel to Nepal this year and "touch my kids and celebrate my daughter's birthday after 24 years."
The deadline for Nepal arrives amid a slew of TPS terminations as the administration has taken a strict interpretation on what conditions qualify for an extension.
Over the past year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would terminate status for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan – more than an estimated 300,000 people that will either need to leave the United States of face residing illegally.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in January announced an 18-month extension for Syria.
And the decision deadline for Honduras is next week.
Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan also have protected status and will be up for renewal in the next months and into next year.
“America is a very family-oriented country, so I am hoping for the best,” said Lama as the deadline looms.
The DHS Secretary is authorized to grant TPS to nationals of foreign countries when conditions temporarily prevent people from returning safely. The program provides for work authorization but does not offer a pathway to citizenship.
Lama is also the primary financial provider for their family in Nepal.
Remittances from Nepali citizens working abroad is roughly 30 percent of Nepal's GDP, according to Austin Lord, Ph.D. Student of Sociocultural Anthropology, Cornell University.
"I would argue that remittance is probably the most effective and efficient way to support locally-driven and earthquake-safe reconstruction, as compared to institutionally managed programs that often require significant overhead and that do not adequately cover even half the average cost of construction,” said Lord.
Lama was able to help their children get an apartment after nearly three years of living under a tent and then from one friend's house to another.
“There are no shelters, like in America,” they said.
Humanitarian relief was extended for Nepal for 18-months in 2016, after DHS determined that although conditions in Nepal had improved, the “recovery and reconstruction process was delayed and people remained without homes or adequate infrastructure.
At this time DHS does not have an announcement regarding Nepal's TPS, but one is expected in the coming days, according to an administration official.
“TPS allowed me to continue working and become part of a community,” said Namrata Pradhan, Nepali TPS holder, domestic worker, and organizer at Adhikaar (NYC).
Pradhan said that after moving to the U.S. a decade ago, they were forced to leave behind their legal education and become a nanny, but as a TPS holder they were able to join the staff at both Adhikaar and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
“For them [DHS], it is just a single decision like a signature on a piece of paper. But for me and the almost 9,000 other Nepalis with TPS like me, this is a life-changing decision. Our homes are here, we are as American as anyone else and we deserve to be here,” they said.
Nepal has made some limited progress in stabilizing and rebuilding since the earthquake, but a humanitarian crisis remains, found a recent Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc. (CLINIC) report.
The report concluded that the safe return of Nepali TPS holders and their families remains impossible at this time due to the severe lack of adequate shelter, food, water, healthcare, education and jobs as well as other risks.
“It is critical for the TPS designation for Nepal to be extended, in light of the slow pace and numerous obstacles to reconstruction and recovery from the 2015 earthquake,” said Jennifer Ruddle, CLINIC staff attorney.
Lama said that when they visited this March, they witnessed the country “still struggling” with clean water and air.
“People are happy and trying to build their country, but how?” they said.

3 UP
Andy Firth
Let's kick off with Chester FC 's man of the match in their 0-0 draw at home to high-flying Aldershot Town on Saturday - on-loan Liverpool goalkeeper Andy Firth.
The 21-year-old has been thrown in at the deep move following their move from the Reds but their performance against the Shots showed that they are certainly beginning to swim.
Firth may have been disappointed that they were unable to keep out Scott Quigley's opener for Wrexham in the derby . However, a bigger problem arose in the days after the Racecourse defeat when news broke that they would no longer have a goalkeeping coach to work with at the cash-strapped Blues given the departure of David Felgate.
Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now
We're sure this sort of things does not happen at Anfield but the young Premier League hopeful did not throw their toys out of the pram. Instead, Firth got on with it and went on to produce an excellent individual display, which warranted a place in the Non-League Paper's National League Team of the Day.
Chester manager Marcus Bignot said: "We've had a difficult week in terms of the goalkeeping situation, losing Dave Felgate. But Andy has a maturity and character far beyond their years.  They are a level-headed kid, who is into the coaching side, and is doing their badges, and we have had to rely on them to help us off the pitch as well. They have been a credit and they deserved that (display) and they will have learned a lot from the Wrexham game."
Hartlepool United
Regular visitors to this website will know all about the big problems facing the Blues' rivals Hartlepool United. Administration and relegation remain on the cards for a club that came down from the Football League last season. However, there were rays of light at the weekend - both on and off the field.
On the field, led by caretaker manager Matthew Bates, Pools produced a remarkable late comeback to draw 3-3 at a free-scoring AFC Fylde side that had put seven past Aldershot the week before.
Bates' team seemed set to slip to an 11th loss in their last 18 league games when they trailed 3-1 going into the final two minutes of the match. However, a stunning strike from ex-Airbus UK Broughton forward Jake Cassidy and a dipping effort from Devante Rodney ensured they snatched a share of the spoils.
And better news was to come off the field when reports emerged that north-east business person Raj Singh's bid to take over the trouble club had moved close to completion.
The Hartlepool Mail state the deal could be done as soon as this weekend and that former manager Craig Hignett, who watched the Fylde clash from the stands alongside Singh, will return as director of football.
Barrow AFC
The late, late show could not prevent Pools' from slipping one place above the relegation places, though. That's because Barrow AFC won 1-0 at Maidenhead United thanks to a goal from James. No, that one, the other one (Luke James), although on-loan Chester midfielder Kingsley James did play the full 90 minutes.
The Bluebirds' victory moved them up 19th, and given they have games in hand on all of the sides below them in the table, which starts with a crucial showdown at home to Hartlepool on Wednesday night, you would have to fancy them now to get out of trouble.
"I'm at the stage where I don't care how we play," said Barrow boss Ady Pennock to the North-West Evening Mail . "The wins are the only important thing and this was a massive three points for us.
(Image: Terry Marland)
"There weren't many wins for the teams around us - and that's why this is so big. We didn't come here for a draw, and not many teams come to Maidenhead and win, so that's why we are so happy.
"They're all big wins but yes, at this stage it's probably the biggest since I've come to the club - and that has a fair bit to do with the games we've had called off. Considering the circumstances, we know how big three points this is."
3 DOWN
Chester FC
Now, before you accuse me of being negative, let me explain why it was a bad weekend for the Blues.
Yes, it was no mean feat to become only the second team so far this year to stop the Shots from scoring, especially given the meagre resources Bignot now has at their disposal, and yes, the point certainly went some way to stopping the rot following four straight defeats.
But the draw with Aldershot did little to improve Chester's hopes of avoiding the drop into the National League North. Indeed, the gap to survival now stands at eight points given Barrow's win and Hartlepool's draw and, given next up is a trip to second-placed Sutton United, there is a growing acceptance that it will be a case of when and not if the club is relegated.
But let's end on a positive note with these words from Bignot: "Where we're at at the moment, we're utilising the squad, and no-one can question what they are giving. They could've easily downed tools and thought about their holidays.
"Of course we'd like to be better on the ball but it needed a big performance and show of character to go and get a result and we've found a different way to get a result. That's a massive step in the right direction."
Wrexham
The build-up to Wrexham's trip to Woking was overshadowed by the departure of their impressive young manager Dean Keates to their hometown club Walsall.
And, while we may be being hypercritical, it is clear their absence was already being felt at the weekend as the usually rock-solid Dragons threw away a lead in drawing 2-2 with the Cards.
Wrexham's failure to hold out for the three points - which became their speciality under Keates - meant they slipped to fifth and, more importantly, meant they missed the chance to truly close the gap on leaders Macclesfield Town, who went down 2-0 at Dover Athletic.
The Dragons are expected to make a decision on their new manager before the end of the week, with former Chester City midfielder Gary Brabin one of the favourites with bookies ', but at the moment it is coaches Andy Davies and Carl Darlington in charge.
And Davies said: "It is disappointing and feels like a loss in a way but as a positive, it extends that unbeaten run (to 14 games). To get two goals away from home is good but two concede from two set-pieces is disappointing for us. It's about the team defensively, it's not about individuals and to concede that way... we haven't been opened up, we haven't been dragged about the pitch."
John Rooney
John Rooney, the midfielder who counts Wrexham and Chester among their former clubs, was red-carded in basement boys Guiseley's 1-1 derby draw at home to FC Halifax Town. However, no-one was sure exactly why.
Guiseley's attempt to break out from a corner was ended by a linesman's flag and, after the officials conferred, Rooney was given their marching orders while Halifax's Scott McManus was booked.
(Image: Craig Galloway)
Cue mass confusion, remonstrations and a further caution for Lions captain Kayode Odejayi.
Guiseley caretaker manager Sean St Ledger said : "I don't think anyone in the stadium thought that it was a sending off. John Rooney was nowhere near the incident so I find it baffling how you can send someone off.
"Where's VAR when you need it?"

Police arrest suspected burglar of OOU hostels
By Evelyn Usman
A suspected member of a notorious robbery gang that had been terrorising students of Olabisi Onabanjo University, OOU, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, who live off campus has been arrested.
Recovered from the suspect, identified as Onyebuchi Chika, were a sewing machine, some cooking gas and mattresses suspected to have been stolen from the students apartments.
Chika allegedly broke into the students' apartments around Awa Ijebu and its environs at the weekend, where they succeeded in carting away some property of those who had travelled for Christmas.
They reportedly came back to continue with their criminal act when luck ran on them after a male student, who was returning from an outing, raised alarm.
Arrest
A student, Lola Gbemiga, who explained how the suspect was arrested, said: “He attempted to run but some residents chased them and held them until the arrival of police officers from Awa Ijebu Division, who later took them away.
“Burglars have been disturbing us in this axis and we hope this arrest will send a signal to others.”
Confession
During interrogation, Chika admitted having burgled several apartments in the area, adding that most of the apartments were those of female students.
According to him, “I have burgled several students' apartments in the area. I usually operate when they are not at home, particularly during holidays.
“I sell the loots and spend the money on food.”
They added that they decided to operate on New Year eve so as to use the proceeds from the loots to celebrate.
Spokesman for Ogun State Police Command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the arrest, adding that some house-breaking implements were also recovered from the suspect.
17 arrested
In a related development, 17 suspects were arrested at Ayetoro area of Itele, Ogun State, during raids of black spots.
Also confirming the arrest, Oyeyemi said: “Policemen attached to Itele Ota Division in their efforts to rid the area of crime and criminality, carried out raids of criminal hideouts and black spots in Ayetoro area of Itele, during which 17 suspected criminals were arrested.
“Eight motorcycles, one power generator, nine different phones and N123,000 were recovered from them. Also recovered were bags of weeds, suspected to be Indian hemp, and assorted charms.”
The Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has ordered the immediate transfer of the two cases to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, SCIID, for further investigation.

NEW YORK — Ottawa Senators forward Alexandre Burrows was fined $5,000 for roughing during a game against the San Jose Sharks on Saturday night.
The NHL department of player safety announced the fine — the maximum allowable under the Collective Bargaining Agreement — on Sunday.
Burrows was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct for fighting at 14:51 of the third period after going San Jose's Dylan DeMelo with a stick to the face.
Ottawa lost the game 5-0 for its 11th loss in 12 games.

This has been a summer for dudes: First, they took over the romper. Then, they decided that, you know what, it was time for them to start wearing see-through lace shorts, too. And while we'll never fault a guy who's comfortable enough in themselves to roll on out of their house ready to subvert gender stereotypes, the ladies knew that they deserved a little something-something to make their summer extra special, too. So they came for the dadbod. You hear that, dads? Your hairy chests, weak nipples, and pulpy beer bellies have been appropriated!
The suit, which, for some reason or another features a completely ‘scaped crotch — don't fear the pubes, people — retails for $44.95 and is a comfortable one-piece that shows off everything while actually showing off nothing. Do we think it's genius? Absolutely. You can do whatever the hell you want in this thing: Swim, sun, eat as much as you want and then just blame it on the contouring of the graphic because who gonna check you, boo?
What do other people think? Well, they're a little confused. And disgusted. (Why? All bodies are beautiful.)
26 killed as Philippine bus plunges into ravine
At least 26 people were killed and 21 injured when a passenger bus crashed into a deep ravine in the mountainous northern Philippines on Tuesday, authorities said.
The bus plunged about 24 metres (80 feet) in the upland province of Nueva Ecija before noon after its brakes failed while travelling on a winding road, police and local officials said.
“The vehicle is totally wrecked,” said senior inspector Robert De Guzman, police chief of the town of Carranglan where the accident occurred. The impact appeared to have ripped the top off the vehicle, they added.
“Almost all of the passengers, both dead and injured, were found outside the bus.”
Authorities were still investigating the cause of the accident but Carranglan Mayor Mary Abad told ABS-CBN television there were 60 passengers onboard although the bus had a capacity of only 45.
Abad added the wounded, some of whom sustained critical injuries, were rushed to nearby hospitals.
“The road is really risky. There are many ravines along that road going to Abra,” Abad said, referring to the northern province where the bus was headed.
Dr. Arlene Jara, chief of the nearby provincial hospital treating the wounded, said children were among those injured.
President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesperson Ernesto Abella expressed condolences to the families of the victims and said those responsible would be held accountable.
Road accidents are common in the Philippines, where old, badly maintained buses often drive on poorly lit roads.

OTTAWA — The leader of the biggest group in the Senate is questioning whether the government's pot bill will come to a vote on schedule, and is predicting that the upper chamber will reinstate part of an impaired driving bill on random roadside breathalyzer tests.
During an interview Wednesday Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, the leader of the Independent Senators Group, and deputy leader Sen. Raymonde Saint-Germain were poking the proverbial bear as they wondered at Conservative senators' political intentions with just a few weeks to go in the parliamentary sitting.
All groups in the Senate had agreed to vote on third reading of Bill C-45, which sets up a framework to legalize recreational weed, on or before June 7. While a vote happening before that day seems unlikely, “on (the day) seems questionable too,” Woo told the National Post.
“Look what they did yesterday,” said Saint-Germain. Conservatives did not allow unanimous consent for the tabling of a committee report about the bill Tuesday, meaning that an additional day would pass before the chamber could debate it.
They questioned why they would do such a thing. “Why, the day after, after the clerks and the analysts have worked so hard to prepare this report for it to be tabled and to respect the agreement between the leaders, why does a group block it? Is it democratic? That's a question.”
“You know, we are all trying to be very respectful and to assume the best of all sides but we understand that politics is part of the way the opposition does its calculation,” they said. “So when I say they are doing that I'm not insulting them.”
Woo went so far as to predict the Tories' party line ahead of next Thursday's prospective vote.
“There are things that they might try to do which prolong the report stage debate, cutting short the time for third reading debate and using that again as a demonstration, according to them, of how limited the time was,” they said. “You know what the message is going to be right after the vote. ‘Canadians were short-changed.' … ‘This is a flawed process.'”
They said independent senators got the impression they had a “special responsibility” to undertake thorough review of the legislation. As a case in point, they said 36 of the 40 amendments passed at the committee stage of Bill C-45 came from independent senators.
The government introduced C-45 and C-46, on impaired driving, at the same time last year. It has repeatedly said that it wants both bills to pass before pot actually becomes legal, since C-46 contains new penalties for driving high.
That bill in its original form also contained controversial new powers for police to conduct random roadside breathalyzer tests. Some, such as the Liberal chair of the Senate's legal committee, Sen. Serge Joyal, have argued that those powers are unconstitutional. Last week Conservative Sen. Denise Batters proposed an amendment that would chop the powers out of the bill, and with Joyal's support it passed in committee.
But it appears the Senate might be getting ready to reinstate that part of the bill. “I believe it will. Let's see what happens,” Woo told the Post. They suggested that the government representative in the Senate, Sen. Peter Harder, or the bill's independent sponsor, Sen. Gwen Boniface — a former police chief — could try to do so during third reading debate.
On the timing of both bills, both Woo and Saint-Germain said they believe that unlike in the case of omnibus transportation bill C-49 — that saw the Senate insisting upon its amendments, engaging in a rarely-seen back-and-forth with the House of Commons — the Senate will defer to elected officials on the pot bill, if the Commons does not accept all of its amendments.
On the transport bill there had been a political angle, Woo suggested. They said it was the Senate's right to insist, but, “there was also political strategy” to “embarrass the government,” they said.
Woo and Saint-Germain said they are willing to sit through the summer, if need be — but ultimately, if either chamber sits late or has to be called back to get the bill passed, that will come at the expense of the taxpayer and that could change the political calculus for Conservative senators too.
On Bill C-46, Woo's group is ready to go, and they are ready to say so to the leaders of the other groups so that they can all “get on with the work,” they said.
“It's not about whether we want to satisfy the government or not. It's the fact that this is our job. When bills come here it's our job, you know, to be ready,” said Woo.  They are ready to tell other groups in the Senate: “The biggest group in the chamber very soon will be ready for the vote. Why aren't you ready? Why aren't you ready? What have you been doing?”

Ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) Allegiant Air has signed a 12-year lease with Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Co. for 13 Airbus A320s.
The Las Vegas-based carrier said the eight-year-old aircraft are expected to enter service beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The agreement includes an option to purchase at the end of the lease term.
The A320s will be configured with 186 seats and will be powered by CFM International's CFM56-5B engines.
Allegiant called the agreement “another important step” toward the ULCC's planned transition to an all-Airbus fleet by 2019.
Allegiant chairperson and CEO Maurice Gallagher said the fleet transition “will not only bring the benefit of operating efficiencies in training, scheduling, maintenance and more, but will also mean key economic advantages through greater fuel efficiency and higher seat capacity. This puts us in an ideal position for the future: to continue offering travelers the industry's best fares, while at the same time increasing reliability.”
In May, Allegiant took delivery of its first-ever new A320. The A320s will eventually replace Allegiant's fleet of 47 MD-80s, 12 of which are expected to exit the fleet this year.
ALAFCO CEO and vice chairperson Ahmad Alzabin said Allegiant is ALAFCO's first US customer. “With the recent establishment of ALAFCO's Irish subsidiary, we expect further penetration into the North American market,” they said.
This transaction brings Allegiant to a total of 92 Airbus aircraft either in service or committed for future delivery.

HARARE, Zimbabwe — Pakistan had five balls to spare when it beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets on Wednesday and eliminated the African host from the Twenty20 tri-series tournament.
Solomon Mire missed out on the chance to become Zimbabwe's first century-maker in a T20 international as their 94-run knock carried Zimbabwe to 162-4 after captain Hamilton Masakadza lost their first toss in the tri-series and their team was put in to bat.
Opener Fakhar Zaman (47) and Hussain Talat (44) led Pakistan to 163-3 in 19.1 overs against an inexperienced bowling attack as Pakistan registered its second win against Zimbabwe.
It was Zimbabwe's third straight loss.
Australia plays against Pakistan on Thursday before both teams meet in Sunday's final.
Mire stood tall against Pakistan's full-strength attack as left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir (1-25) got their first game of the series and replaced Usman Khan.
Mire and Cephas Zhuwao (24) provided a solid opening partnership of 49 runs before Tarisai Musakanda (33) added 64 runs for the third wicket with Mire.
Mire, who hit six sixes and six fours, reached their half-century off 32 balls when they hoisted left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for a six over long off in the 11th over.
Pakistan struggled for wickets despite seamer Faheem Ashraf (1-24) and leg-spinner Shadab Khan (1-28) bowling a decent four overs each in the middle overs.
Mire looked set to become the first Zimbabwe batsman to score a century in a Twenty20 before they holed out at deep mid-wicket off seamer Talat in the 18th over — only a ball after Asif Ali missed a sitter at deep square leg.
Mire also featured in two dismissals during Pakistan's innings as they took a fine catch in the deep to dismiss Haris Sohail. They then denied Zaman a half century through their medium pace when the left-hander was caught at mid-on.
Captain Sarfraz Ahmed (38 not out) and experienced Shoaib Malik (12 not out) kept their composure and carried Pakistan home.
Ahmed was not happy with their bowlers, saying it “was not up to the mark, they have to work hard.”
The Chamber of Petroleum Consumers (COPEC) has criticised Parliament for legislating the controversial mandatory road safety fee.
Executive Secretary of COPEC, Duncan Amoah, says the legislators have become “a rubber stamp passing everything that comes before them.”
Mixed reactions have greeted the law that comes into force on July 1 to compel vehicle owners to pay a mandatory road safety fee each time they renew their roadworthy certificate at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA).
Commercial vehicles and taxis will be required to pay GH¢40, mini buses will pay GH¢80, while heavy-duty trucks will pay between GH¢80 and GH¢200 annually, depending on their tonnage.
Non-commercial vehicles are expected to pay GH¢20.
The National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) explains that the new taxes will ensure the successful implementation of a nationwide towing service to clear abandoned vehicles on Ghana's roads.
Abandoned vehicles on roads have been cited as a major cause of motor accidents in Ghana.
Although some people have praised the initiative, others have described it as a rip off that must be shelved.
Related: Why motorists are paying mandatory ‘towing fee' from July
According to COPEC, the tax is wrong and will not solve the problem of abandoned vehicles on roads.
“COPEC Ghana after careful consultations is petitioning the Presidency to ensure this Draconian punitive policy does not see the light of day and will go ahead to organise mass protests across the country together with some of the major stakeholder transport operators,” said Duncan Amoah.
They revealed further that the petition against the tax is ready and will be submitted on Thursday, June 15 “with the hope the Presidency will see reason in stopping this harsh… policy”.
SANTA FE, N.M. — A northern New Mexico town will no longer organize an annual commemoration of the arrival of Spanish conquistador Juan de Onate, leaving the consumed pageant and carnival to an independent group.
Espanola Mayor Javier Sanchez confirmed Wednesday a unanimous city council vote to repeal the local government's obligation to organize the festival.
The celebration includes a costumed procession of an armoured Onate on horseback with a coterie of soldiers, royalty, Christian friars and an Indian scout.
Onate is revered as a Hispanic founding father and reviled for brutality against Native Americans.
Sanchez says the decision opens the way for the city to involve more people including local Native Americans in new cultural celebrations.
Local leaders including city councillor John Ramon Vigil hope a non-profit group can continue the Onate tribute.
An editorial from the Hamilton Spectator, published March 19:
Canada's honeymoon with federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh likely ended last week after the disturbing revelations they had twice participated in rallies with Sikh extremists abroad before taking over the party at home.
In 2016, while an NDP member of the Ontario legislature, Singh took part in a gathering in the United Kingdom in which the co-founder of the British-based National Sikh Youth Federation said political violence was a “legitimate form of resistance” for creating an independent Sikh homeland in India.
The year before, Singh attended a rally in California that was billed as a commemoration of Sikhs who died during the invasion of the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984, but which also celebrated Sikh separatism and political violence.
On neither of these occasions did they explicitly reject the use of violence.
Since this news came out last week, however, Singh has taken pains to condemn “all acts of terrorism.”
They have also accepted the results of an inquiry that concluded Talwinder Singh Parmar masterminded the worst act of terrorism in Canadian history, the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182, which killed 329 people.
Those were the right things for Singh to do even though their clarifications should have come earlier when they faced reasonable media questions about their stand on the contentious issue of Sikh separatism in India.
If many Canadians doubt Singh's judgment today, they have only themselves to blame.
When elected to become the federal New Democratic Party leader last October, Singh was welcomed as the first-ever visible minority federal party leader and a worthy centre-left opponent to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trudeau is young and charismatic. Singh is younger and oozing charm.
And as a proud member of the Sikh community, Singh seemed a perfect fit for an era that embraces diversity.
It's entirely reasonable for the NDP leader to denounce the violence that claimed thousands of Sikh lives in the mid-1980s and express compassion for Sikhs who are still traumatized by that bloodshed.
Yet Singh's flirting with Sikh separatists and radicals is dangerous, unacceptable behaviour for the leader of a major federal party and someone who aspires to be Canada's next prime minister.
It drives a wedge into Canada's 500,000-strong Sikh community, which is split over Sikh separatism and how a separate Sikh state might be established.
It is also divisive for the larger, 1.4-million-strong Indian-Canadian community. India's future could soon become a needlessly thorny subject in this country
Beyond all this, Singh's focus on Indian politics could exacerbate rising tensions between Canada and India, a fellow Commonwealth nation we wish to court for many reasons, including trade.
Trudeau's recent trip to India was deemed a disaster partly because a Canadian Sikh who had been convicted in this country of the attempted murder of an Indian cabinet minister received an invitation to an important event on the Trudeau tour.
Today, Canada officially supports a united India.
Singh will not say if they do. On this subject, too, they should clear the air if they expect to become prime minister.
Paris Saint-Germain full-back Dani Alves said they would return to Barcelona tomorrow if the LaLiga giants contacted him.
Brazil international Alves left Barcelona for Italian champions Juventus in 2016 after winning 23 titles at Camp Nou.
Alves joined Ligue 1 powerhouse PSG in 2017 but the 34-year-old refused to rule out a Barça comeback, despite the circumstances behind their departure.
"Barcelona is my home," they told Globo TV. "It's impossible to say that I wouldn't return.
"I would come back tomorrow if Barcelona were to call me."
Alves, who has helped PSG to Ligue 1 and Coupe de la Ligue glory this season as the French champions seek a domestic treble, added: "If I were to say that I didn't leave there feeling hurt then I'd be lying.
"I left hurt because I think I fought hard to create a great history at Barcelona. I left with 23 titles in eight years.
"I finished up giving them more great results and then they ended it without respecting my story.
NEYMAR: BYE, BYE CRUTCHES
"They wanted me to have a farewell and I told them no, because I consider that place my eternal home and when a place is considered your home you don't have to say goodbye.
"What's the point in a farewell if you're going to come back?"

× Expand Riding for pleasure and for good causes unites Chattanooga area bikers Get your motor running, head out on the highway; looking for adventure, in whatever comes our way. Who hasn't heard this iconic 1968 song from the movie Easy Rider made legendary by the group Steppenwolf? It's the American bikers all time theme song that has epitomized motorcycling for decades. Play it at any biker gathering and the crowd goes freaking wild! At one time a state sponsored slogan was: Motorcycles are everywhere, so look twice! If only it were that simple. Whooosh! You know, that sound that just scared the hell out of you while you were on your cell phone driving down the road completely oblivious to your surroundings. You look up and see what is more than likely a millennial blasting up in front of you on what's called a “crotch-rocket.” No particular make or brand, just really fast! Going in and out of traffic like they have a death wish. Well they don't really, they just loves to go fast…and you were in their way. Operating a motorcycle is several times more dangerous than driving a car. But it's all about the thrill you know? To be honest, most bike riders are responsible law abiding people. Many stigmas from years gone by still exist today in our perceptions. Or maybe you hear the slow rising drone coming up from behind you of what sounds like a squadron of World War II bombers. Oh no! Hide the wife and kids, it's a bunch of black bikes with black leathered tattoo laden, scruffy looking heathens who are no doubt coming to rape and pillage. Sound familiar? Silly isn't it? This prejudice was created back in the ‘60s with Hollywood movies and the American Motorcycle Association. They stated that only one percent of the motorcycle riders were as such. Hence the term “one percenters” was born. If you have seen this moniker on vests, tattooed on arms, legs whatever, this was the phrase that helped create a separate society of riders outside the norm of the so-called regular riders. Everybody else who's not a one percenter is considered a citizen. Most one percenters just want to ride and be left alone, but sometimes it's just not that easy. Several movies and bad press have stereotyped these riders as just plain unsocial and up to no good. Rarely that might be the case, but for the majority of bike riders, it's not. “Murder cycles” as they were once known years ago while being developed over the years have gained acceptance through there many diversified uses. They have been used in several military and police applications. At one time, Indian police motorbikes came with an unusual left hand throttle. The idea was that the mostly predominantly right-handed cops would have their right hand free to shoot their service revolvers at assailants while riding. Just about every continent has their own style and/or brands of bikes. People ride them by the thousands, if not by the millions. Motorcycles reduce fuel consumption and are an economical way for people to travel by. In South America and Asia, the laws are a little more relaxed. You just might see a whole family riding on one motorcycle. There is one group out there that seeks to change the long time negative stigma of the motorcycle rider, the Christian Motorcycle Association (CMA). A non-profit interdenominational organization dedicated to reaching people for Christ, primarily through motorcycling. All bikes are welcome with over 800 US chapters and in over 30 other countries that make up CMA International. The heartbeat of CMA is evangelism. Sharing the Gospel with the motorcycling community for nearly 40 years. They have a group ride somewhere new every month.You can attend a meeting with CMA every first Monday of the month at the Shoney's on Shallowford Village Drive. Meet and greet at 6 p.m. with the regular meeting starting at 7 p.m.
Over at 4113 South Access Road is Crockett Powersports. They offer Indian and Victory motorcycles. Indian is the oldest American made bike since 1901. For a really out of this world choice, they also carry the Slingshot series of half bike half car vehicles. Owner John Crockett is a very gracious host and opens their dealership up for several local motorcycling events. Their son Cayce says every day is demo day at Crockett Powersports. If you're a licensed motorcycle rider and it's not raining, you can ride the entire line of Indian's from the big touring model Roadmaster to the smaller, nimbler Scout. With the recent announcement by Polaris to end production of the Victory line now would be a great time to negotiate a sweet deal. And don't worry; parts will be available for years to come. Crockett Powersports will also service any American made big twin with their team of certified mechanics. Honda of Chattanooga has just about anything you need to ride the streets or trails. Owner Barry White gave me a tour of the facility on Highway 58, which was originally started by their Dad at Glass Street as the Western Auto store. Honda officially came to the US in 1959. Original owner Charles White was invited to meet the founder: Soichiro Honda in Japan and in 1962 they moved across the street and started Chattanooga's first all-exclusive Honda dealership. The first imported Honda's were the Cub 50. Remember the slogan, “You meet the nicest people on a Honda”? Dirt, street, utility you name it, they got it. The large size Gold Wing bike has had a reverse gear in it since the 1988 models! Believe me, you need help sometimes with the enormous weight of the big bikes. The Valkyrie bagger model has the same six-cylinder engine as the Gold Wing.

Oribamise qualifies for 2018 Youth Olympic Games
Nigeria's rising Table Tennis star Esther Oribamise has booked their place at the Buenos Aires 2018 Youth Olympic Games after the African Continental Qualification tournament ended yesterday at the Palais Des Sport El-Mensah in Tunis,Tunisia.
Despite missing out on participation at the recent 2017 ITTF African Junior and Cadet Championships, Oribamise was in terrific form at the Continental Qualification event and the Nigerian representative deservedly sealed their spot at next year's Youth Olympic Games.
Victory over Morocco's Ines Outolla in the last four (11-4, 11-9, 11-7, 11-1) guaranteed a top two finish in the Girls' Singles for Esther Oribamise, but the Nigerian contestant wasn't done there with one more match still to be played.
Marwa Alhodaby awaited Esther Oribamise in the final with the Egyptian having secured qualification following their success against Tunisia's Fadwa Garci in the penultimate round (11-9, 13-11, 11-9, 11-9).
However, despite their best efforts Marwa Alhodaby proved unable to finish their Tunis campaign with a win as Nigeria's Esther Oribamise squeezed over the finish line with a 4-3 victory (11-6, 11-9, 9-11, 12-10, 8-11, 7-11, 13-11) to claim top spot in the competition.
“I think I was ready for them but I could not just fathom what happened when I was leading 3-1 in games and 4-1 in points in the fifth game only to lose the game. Even in the seventh game, I was leading 8-2 and they caught up with me at 9-9, but I was calm to finish the match at 13-11. This victory and qualification for the Youth Olympic Games means a lot to me particularly after missing the ITTF African Junior and Cadet Championships. I have proved a point to my compatriots that the Egyptians are beatable and they just need to believe in themselves”, Esther Oribamise

AUSTIN, Texas — Rory McIlroy had their first Arnold Palmer moment before the tournament even started.
They had just finished their pro-am round at Bay Hill and was about to walk out of the tunnel leading from the 18th green when a man asked them for a picture. McIlroy obliged, because they usually do. But this was different.
The man handed them a black bolero hat and told McIlroy it was from their squadron when they served in Vietnam. They didn't want a selfie with McIlroy. They wanted a picture of McIlroy wearing the hat that meant so much to him. The hat looked awkward on them with golfing attire, but McIlroy didn't mind.
It's all about giving the fans what they want.
Then the 28-year-old from Northern Ireland gave them something even better with what McIlroy described as a “perfect round of golf,” certainly the closing stretch. They birdied five of the last six holes, capping it off with a 25-foot putt on the 18th hole to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
That ended their longest drought without a victory in eight years, and it cast them in a new light with the Masters approaching.
McIlroy had fallen to No. 13 in the world when they missed the cut the previous week at the Valspar Championship, their second missed cut in four PGA Tour events this year. They had not been that low in the ranking since April 25, 2010.
It's not that they were forgotten; rather, attention was shifting to so many others that it was easy to feel overlooked. All it took was one victory for the conversation to include their bid for a green jacket to complete the career Grand Slam.
“It's huge for my confidence going into the next few weeks,” McIlroy said. “I kept saying I didn't need a win going into Augusta to feel like I had a chance. I just wanted to see signs of good golf. And thankfully, I've been able to get both.”
Just don't get the idea their confidence was lagging.
McIlroy always says that when he's playing well, it's hard to remember ever playing poorly. And when he's playing poorly, it's hard to remember what it was like to play well. But they have a history of going through spurts of mediocrity, and coming out of it strong without notice. Most memorable was in 2012 when they missed the cut four times in five tournaments. Two months later, they won the PGA Championship and consecutive FedEx Cup playoff events.
Three times in their career, McIlroy has won in their next start after missing the cut. Five other times, they won after finishing out of the top 30.
That's why they aren't the least bit concerned after missing the cut at the Valspar Championship.
“It's such a fine line out here, and I might have sounded crazy the last few weeks when I was telling everyone it actually feels pretty close and I'm not that far away, and I'm putting up 72s and 73s,” they said. “And all of a sudden, it all clicks into place and I end up winning a golf tournament by three shots and shooting 8 under on the last day. So it's fine lines out here. I think you have to play the game to really appreciate that. It's not as black and white as some people make it out to be.”
They could think of only one time they were genuinely worried about their game.
McIlroy was 19 and in their first full year as a pro in 2008. They had only two top 10s all year on the European Tour. They aren't eligible for any of the majors. They had missed three straight cuts in Sweden, Holland and Scotland. They were concerned they might lose their card. And then they lost in a playoff in Switzerland, lost in another playoff in Hong Kong and won their first pro event early in the next year.
“And I was off and running,” they said.
McIlroy reached No. 50 with that playoff loss in Hong Kong, and they haven't fallen out since then. He's had a few dips, sure, “but it's not as if I've had to panic.”
Palmer and McIlroy share one other connection, at least for now. They are one leg short of the Grand Slam. Palmer never won the PGA Championship. McIlroy needs the Masters. When they had dinner at Bay Hill in 2015 — right before McIlroy's first crack at the fourth leg of the slam — the topic never came up.
“It's amazing to think, all that Arnold did in the game, they never won that Grand Slam,” McIlroy said.
McIlroy at the Masters, Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open and Jordan Spieth at the PGA Championship each have a chance at the career slam this year.
“I'm glad to be part of that conversation, get the first shot at it in a few weeks,” McIlroy said. “So we'll see how we go.”
Their game is never far away, even if it doesn't look like it at times.
As a young boy growing up on Bikini Atoll, Alson Kelen spent idyllic days playing on the beach and fishing.
Their grandfather built canoes and their father tended the land. With fewer than 150 people on the remote Pacific island it was a close community, they say, with few signs of the former U.S. nuclear testing program other than the concrete bunkers they were told to avoid and the sunken ships in the lagoon.
But in 1978, when Kelen was 10, officials evacuated everybody. It turned out they'd been premature in declaring the Marshall Islands atoll safe again for humans. Radiation levels were still dangerously high.
More than 70 years after the first tests, the atoll remains contaminated today. It's part of a troubling nuclear legacy that continues to affect islands and people across the Pacific long after the U.S., Britain and France stopped their testing programs there.
As nuclear tensions rise in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the South Pacific in particular, Kelen and others are reflecting on that legacy anew.
North Korea has discussed testing a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific after earlier firing a missile over Japan and threatening Guam. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to "totally destroy North Korea" if provoked and called leader Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man." The dictator has responded by calling Trump a "mentally deranged U.S. dotard."
Kelen says that if the threats do escalate to a nuclear test or even an attack, "it would be a huge, huge disaster."
The 49-year-old says they have no idea if their exposure to radiation during the four years they lived on Bikini as a boy has affected their health. They say scientists used to test them and their family regularly, but stopped within a couple of years of them leaving the atoll.
Scientists have calculated that about 1.6 percent of all cancers developed by Marshallese people exposed to radiation can be attributed to the nuclear tests. For some islanders who were close to the blasts, the rate rises to 55 percent.
The nuclear tests exacted an enormous social toll on Bikini residents and their children, who are now scattered across the Marshall Islands and beyond and have been left without a homeland. Kelen says they've lost the ancestral land that's central to their identity.
"Ninety percent of Bikinians have never seen Bikini. It's a legend; it's a fairy tale," they said. "They know more about Hawaii and the U.S. mainland than Bikini."
The U.S. government first asked Bikini residents to leave temporarily in 1946. It then conducted a series of tests over a dozen years, including detonating a massive hydrogen bomb hundreds of times more powerful than the nuclear bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan during World War II.
The inhabitants were moved to other islands that proved inhospitable. Kelen's family eventually ended up in Majuro, the capital. They say their parents always planned to return to Bikini but got to spend just four years there before being told to leave again. Kelen's father died two years ago and their mother, now 93, is too old to travel.
"They told us we were relocated from Bikini for the good of humankind, to bring peace to the world. But I think nuclear is the same as climate change," Kelen said. "It benefits the big countries and ruins the small countries."
Bikini residents have received some compensation from the United States. But many people, including Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, say it's not enough.
Heine said in a speech this year that the removal of the Bikini residents produced "inconsolable grief, terror and righteous anger" that hadn't diminished in the seven decades since, and had been exacerbated by the U.S. being dishonest about the extent of the radiation and its effects.
Five thousand kilometers (3,000 miles) away in Tahiti, French Polynesia, Roland Oldham is also grappling with nuclear testing's legacy.
 They are president of Moruroa e tatou, an organization that represents victims of French tests at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls. The nuclear tests lasted 30 years, ending in 1996, the year the United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Studies have shown that people in the region during the tests had an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. But information on radiation exposure remains classified, making it hard to estimate the risks.
Oldham says those who worked directly on the testing program suffered high rates of cancer and other health problems. They say it's difficult to get good statistics on the health effects on the broader community because of the continuing secrecy.
Much of the later testing was carried out underground, but some radiation has leaked. Oldham fears the problem could get much worse because parts of the atolls are in danger of subsiding.
Oldham, 66, says they sailed around Moruroa while completing their military service with the French Navy in 1970. They say they never saw or felt anything, and doesn't know if they were exposed to radiation or the extent of that exposure.
Oldham says the heated rhetoric between the leaders of North Korea and the United States has made much of the Pacific vulnerable at the moment because of U.S. military bases in places like Guam, Japan and South Korea.
"The day the two guys throw a punch at each other," they said, "the whole area will be suffering."
They say they worry that humankind is headed toward its own destruction by nuclear weapons.
"At some stage I want to be sick, when I observe the things happening in front of my eyes," they said. "What a world. What a crazy mess."

ATT is accelerating its rollout of LTE-M, an IoT network that's already being used to track shipping containers and pallets, monitor water use and connect fleets to the internet.
The carrier said Tuesday it will have nationwide LTE-M coverage in the U.S. by the middle of this year, six months ahead of schedule. Previously, ATT had said LTE-M would cover the U.S. by year's end.
That means everywhere in the country that ATT has an LTE network, it will also offer LTE-M. By the end of the year, it will have LTE-M across Mexico too, creating a broad coverage area for businesses that operate on both sides of the border.
LTE-M is one of several LPWANs (low-power, wide-area networks) that are emerging to link sensors and other devices to the internet of things. It's not as fast as the LTE that smartphones use, but it's designed to allow for longer battery life, lower cost, smaller parts, and better coverage. LTE-M has a top speed of around 1Mbps (bits per second) upstream and downstream and a range of up to 100 kilometers (62 miles), including better penetration through walls.
ATT is part of a wave of mobile operators considering or rolling out LTE-M. Others include Orange in France and SoftBank in Japan. ATT launched its first commercial trial of LTE-M last October in San Ramon, California, and has since opened another in Columbus, Ohio.
Several companies are already using the network for enterprise and consumer applications, ATT said. They include Capstone Metering, a supplier of wireless water meters; RM2, which makes storage pallets with sensors for monitoring inventory; and PepsiCo, which is using LTE-M to collect usage data from soda fountains. Consumers can dispense their own blends of soda from these fountains, and PepsiCo uses sensors to keep the fountains stocked and learn what blends are popular.
There are already several emerging LPWAN systems from mobile operators and other service providers. The growing LoRaWAN, Sigfox and Ingenu technologies come from outside the traditional mobile industry.
LTE-M and another technology, NB-IoT, are based on LTE and are designed to run over carriers' licensed spectrum. They may be the best options for enterprises concerned about interference and security, Ovum analyst Daryl Schoolar said.
Though alternative LPWAN providers got a head start as these LTE-based standards were developed, mobile operators can roll out the LTE technologies quickly because they often require nothing more than a software upgrade.

WASHINGTON — Larry Motuzis scored a career-high 29 points with eight rebounds and American University snapped a three-game skid, rolling to a 74-63 win over Howard on Saturday night.
Motuzis was 8 of 16 from the field and 11 of 16 from the free-throw line for the Eagles (3-6). Sa'eed Nelson added 21 points and six assists and Sam Iorio had 10 points and 11 rebounds. The team had a 43-33 rebounding edge over Howard.
American got off to a slow start in the first half and trailed 29-23 late but finished the last three minutes on an 8-0 run to lead 31-29 at the break.
Motuzis hit a 3-pointer early in the second half and followed with two 3-point plays, pushing the Eagles to a 41-34 advantage with 14:55 to go. Charles Williams answered with a dunk to get Howard within five but the Bison (1-10) would not get closer.
Williams scored 18 points to lead the Bison who have lost their last three and have yet to beat a Division I team.
Back in October, we reported that Renée Zellweger would be playing Judy Garland in a new biopic titled Judy.
Today the first look at Zellweger as Garland has been released.
Variety reported:
Opening in the English capital in the winter of 1968 as Garland arrives for a five-week run of sell-out concerts, the movie will also recount the icon's battles with management, and relationships with musicians and fans.
As the concerts get underway the star of stage and screen is 47 and exhausted, fragile, and wanting to be at home with their kids, casting into doubt whether the shows, at the Talk of the Town nightclub, can go on.
And here's the film's official synopsis: “Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging London to perform in a sell-out run at The Talk of the Town. It is 30 years since they shot to global stardom in ‘The Wizard of Oz,' but if their voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only grown. As they prepare for the show, battles with management, charms musicians, and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, their wit and warmth shine through.”
Rupert Goold is directing the film from a script written by Tom Edge (The Crown). BAFTA winner David Livingstone (Pride) is producing.
MILAN (AP) — Inter Milan has signed Argentina forward Lautaro Martinez from Racing.
The Serie A club paid a reported 22 million euros ($25.7 million) for Martinez, with the player penning a five-year contract.
The 20-year-old Martinez turned down an offer from Real Madrid in order to get more playing time at Inter, according to their agent.
On Wednesday, Martinez said: "I expect to adapt quickly to a new type of football. It's very different from Argentine football, but I think Serie A will be very important for me to continue improving and will add other qualities to my game."
Martinez is one of their country's top talents and scored 18 goals in 28 appearances last season.
They were included in Argentina's preliminary list for the World Cup but did not make the final squad.
So-called Islamic State says it was behind the new year attack on a Turkish nightclub that killed 39 people.
The group said in a statement it was carried out by “a heroic soldier”.
At least 600 revellers were celebrating in the early hours of Sunday at Istanbul's Reina nightclub when the gunman began firing indiscriminately, discharging some 180 bullets.
The gunman is still at large and a manhunt is under way. Police say they have made 12 arrests so far.
Late on Monday, Turkish media said special forces police backed by a helicopter launched an operation on a house in the Zeytinburnu district following a tip but that the attacker was not found.
IS has been blamed for recent attacks in Turkey, which is taking military action against the group in neighbouring Syria.
The militant group has already been linked to at least two attacks in Turkey last year.
The IS statement accused Turkey of shedding the blood of Muslims through “its air strikes and mortar attacks” in Syria.
Turkey launched a military operation in August aimed at pushing back IS and Kurdish forces, with some of the most intensive recent fighting against IS around the northern town of al-Bab.
Turkey has also been a key player with Russia in negotiating a truce between moderate rebel forces and the government.
Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Monday that the nightclub attack was a “message” against Turkey's operations in Syria but that they would not be affected.
More details of the nightclub attack have been emerging. The gunman arrived by taxi before rushing through the entrance with a long-barrelled gun they had taken from the boot of the car.
The attacker fired randomly at people in an assault lasting seven minutes, starting with a security guard and a travel agent near the entrance. Both were killed.
The gunman is reported to have removed their overcoat before fleeing during the chaos.
Turkish media reports quote police sources as saying they may have been from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
Kyrgyzstan's foreign ministry said the reports that the suspect might be Kyrgyz were “doubtful” but that it would carry out checks.
Mr Kurtulmus said Turkish authorities were still working to identify the attacker.
“Information about the fingerprints and basic appearance of the terrorist have been found,” they said.
Police are investigating whether they belong to an IS cell blamed for an attack in June on Ataturk Airport in Istanbul.
Turkish media later showed video purported to be of the suspect at an unidentified date and location where they are seen handing over identification documents to an official behind a glass window. The video cannot be independently verified.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused groups such as IS of trying “to create chaos”.
“They are trying to… demoralise our people and destabilise our country,” they said.
Turkey suffered a bloody 2016 with a series of attacks, some carried out by Kurdish militants.
But a day before the IS claim, the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was quick to distance itself from the nightclub attack, saying it would “never target innocent civilians”.
Some two-thirds of those killed were foreign, according to local media, among them citizens from Israel, Russia, France, Tunisia, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
Bollywood director and producer Abis Rizvi was one of those who died, Indian media report.
Victims by nationality:
Turkey: 11
Saudi Arabia: 7
Iraq: 3
Lebanon: 3
Jordan, India, Morocco: two nationals from each country
Germany, Syria, Israel, France-Tunisia, Tunisia, Belgium, Kuwait, Canada, Russia: one national from each country
A complete record of those killed has yet to emerge. The body of one of those who died has yet to be identified.
Security guard Fatih Cakmak was one of the first to die.
Their brother said they narrowly escaped a double bombing three weeks ago, having been on duty when Kurdish militants launched an attack near a football stadium, killing at least 44 people, mostly police.
At least 69 people are being treated in hospital, officials said, with three in a serious condition.
The nightclub, which sits on the banks of the Bosphorus, is one of Istanbul's most fashionable venues – popular with foreigners and often frequented by singers and sports stars.
Some guests are reported to have thrown themselves into the water to escape.
Istanbul was already on high alert with some 17,000 police officers on duty in the city, following a string of terror attacks in recent months.

NEWBERRY – Newberry became the 16th football team in the 42-year history of the South Atlantic Conference to win the conference title by going undefeated in league play during the 2016 season.
The Wolves won their first six SAC contests by an average of 23.8 points per game. A thrilling, come-from-behind win over Wingate before a national television audience gave Newberry the school's third crown, all of which have come in the last 11 seasons, and clinched its first perfect SAC record.
Newberry College football players, coaches, and male support staff and administrators received rings to commemorate Newberry's third South Atlantic Conference championship. Female support staff and administrators received pendants of the ring face.
The rings were produced by Herff-Jones and were based on the design of the University of Alabama's rings from the Crimson Tide's championship in 2012.
The ring face includes the Howling N logo with the phrase, “2016 SAC Champions.” The three footballs signify both the three playoff appearances by the senior class and the three SAC championships in Newberry's history. The scarlet football represents the 2016 team, which finished the season a perfect 7-0 in the SAC and earned a school-record No. 2 seed in the NCAA Division II Football Championship.
The last name of each player, coach, support staffer, or administrator appears on the right side of the ring along with their position. Those identifiers surround a replica of the 2016 SAC championship trophy secured with Newberry's 27-22 win over Wingate in the regular season finale.
The left side of the ring has gold ribbons, signifying victory, inscribed with “South Atlantic Conference” and “Undefeated.” This side also references the team's 10-2 overall record.
The ring's most unique quality is its height. Two rows of additional elements give the ring face a stunning height, noticeably taller than most championship rings.
The first row includes 34 stones around the perimeter of the ring. Ten of the stones are scarlet, one for each of Newberry's 10 wins on the season.
The second row is certainly the ring's most striking element. Country singer Bobby Bare released “Drop Kick Me Jesus” in 1976. It has been appropriated as Newberry's victory song, with Pastor Ernie Worman leading the team in song following a postgame prayer on the field at every Newberry win.
The phrase “Drop Kick Me Jesus” encircles the ring on its second level, paying homage to the 10 times in 2016 the Wolves ended their gameday in song.
The inside of each ring is inscribed with the phrases “No Excuses” and “Family,” two of the team's mottos this season.
Newberry's 10 consecutive wins to close the regular season tied the 2006 team for the longest winning streak in school history. The Wolves have an active streak of 10 straight wins against SAC competition dating back to October 2015 that they will carry into the 2017 campaign.

Disney-ABC Exec Was Using Roseanne's Tweets Just Two Weeks Ago to Promote Show to Advertisers: WATCH
Colton Haynes Hits on Nick Robinson in One of Two Deleted Scenes from ‘Love, Simon' – WATCH BOTH
Jimmy Kimmel launched their monologue last night by talking about yesterday's biggest news: Roseanne.
Said Kimmel: “You're not going to believe this but they tweeted something outrageous. ABC decided to cancel its highest-rated show Roseanne following a tweet in which Roseanne compared an African American woman, a former advisor to President Obama, to an ape, which did not sit well with ABC management or with anyone with a brain really.”
Kimmel told their audience that they have thought of a way to hold on to Roseanne.
“We don't have much on this network…Roseanne was a very, bigly hit for ABC and we needed it! Just because Roseanne is gone doesn't mean the whole show has to go. The show must go on. That's what we say in show business.”
Kimmel then played a promo for a reworked version of the show, called Dan.
Street Artist Sabo Strikes Again! Jimmy Kimmel Slammed As ‘Cry Baby' All Over Hollywood!
Entertainment and Hollywood news sites are all over the newest street art by Sabo.
With Jimmy Kimmel in a blubbery mess on late night trying to politicize every event that rolls their way, from the Las Vegas Massacre to health care reform bills, he's the perfect target.
Jimmy, in recent days, has been taking time to mock “gun nuts” while blaming them from being responsible for the deaths of 59 people. Instead of funny monologues, they choses to say that people who want to keep their guns are waiting for the “storm of outrage” to pass so they can keep on with their “dirty business as usual.” The video has been uploaded online and is titled “It's not too soon to talk about gun violence.”
I miss Carson.
Last night Sabo's posters were plastered in Hollywood both near Jimmy Kimmel's home and on Hollywood Boulevard near the Jimmy Kimmel Live! theater were their shows are shot. Posters included references to the 1990 Johnny Depp feature Cry-Baby, as well as to The Jimmy Kimmel Estrogen Hour which might be a reference to The Man Show, which starred both Jimmy and Adam Carolla. Adam Carolla managed to keep from turning into a wilting pansy leftie, and their Adam Carolla Show is the number one most downloaded daily podcast in the world. Carolla recently appeared with Ben Shapiro and others to testify to Congress on the topic of safe spaces in colleges, saying that “the adults need to start being adults” and to protect children in safe spaces is as bad for their development as it is to keep a kid from ever encountering germs.

Here's one example of the Cry-Baby poster in Hollywood:
Sabo produces their prints quietly, using equipment and services run by fellow conservatives. The left tries to compare them to their liberal whiner Banksy in an effort to delegitimize Sabo by endlessly comparing them to another artist with all the intention of forcing us to believe that Sabo has no good ideas himself, and that they sold all of their tactics from the left.
Last November conservative actor Scott Baio shared a photo of one of Sabo's post-election installments. These benches ended up all around the pricey Los Angeles communities of Pacific Palisades, Brentwood and Beverly Hills. The faux bench ads show perennial nutjob Cher along with President Trump advertising their home for sale via Sotheby's in their “Moving to Jupiter Election Day Sale.”
When most people think of Mustad, they think of a heritage of hook manufacturing as the oldest and largest hook manufacturer in the world but they have also ventured into making other incredible fishing gear as well. I have been a fan of the Mustad Boat Bag since I picked one up for the first time at a fishing event I attended this past summer.
Designed as a waterproof and durable solution to protecting your tackle and other gear on the boat or even dockside, the PVC material this bag is made of is thick and sturdy in even the harshest conditions.
With a hard box style bottom and flexible but tough construction on the sides and top, you don't have to worry about your gear getting soaked or exposed to the harsh conditions you are enduring on the water. The zipper is solid on this bag so you can have a tight barrier between rain or your boat taking on water from waves.
This bag has gone on several boat trips as well as land-bound waterfront fishing voyages with me both fresh and saltwater conditions and has met every expectation I have had for a boat bag. It is as tough as any tackle bag I owned and has made it through all of the challenges I have put it through like a champ. It comes in 18” and 24” sizes making it a great choice for any size boat or other personal watercraft like a round boat or kayak.
I recently tested another product made of this soft but durable and strong PVC material. The Double Rigger Wallet is a more compact storage solution for fishing gear and tackle. With storage compartments on both sides, this is an efficient and effective way to safely store your tackle in a small space while protecting it from the elements and keeping your gear dry and easily accessible on any size of watercraft.
Keeping your gear is dry and clean is so important in preserving the quality and integrity of your fishing tackle. To be honest, I expected something really awesome from the best-selling hook brand on the planet but the build quality of both of these products really impressed me even more than I thought they would.
Mustad gets it. Fishermen of any level want a durable, safe and dry way to transport their gear on any size of watercraft. Both of these products fit my needs well and I think you will find them very beneficial to your future fishing adventures as well. These bags get my Texas Tested stamp of approval as they play as hard in the outdoor as I do!
VICTORIA — The former head of multiple community organizations has been sworn in as British Columbia's newest lieutenant governor.
Janet Austin officially took on the role of the Queen's representative in B.C. on Tuesday with a ceremony in Victoria.
Following the event, the new lieutenant governor inspected a 100-person guard of honour and received a 15-gun salute.
Austin previously worked as the CEO of the Metro Vancouver YMCA, the executive director of Big Sisters of B.C. Lower Mainland, and for B.C. Housing.
Premier John Horgan says they bring an “extraordinary list of accomplishments and tireless advocacy” to the appointment.
Austin is the province's 30th lieutenant governor and follows Judith Guichon, who held the post for six years.
Guichon praised their successor when the appointment was announced earlier this year.
“As someone who has dedicated their career to championing women's equality and social change, they are a wonderful choice to represent Them Majesty the Queen in this great province,” Guichon said in a news release. “Ms. Austin will continue to inspire and connect British Columbians in this role.”
GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Green Bay Packers have signed free agent offensive lineman Byron Bell, adding a versatile veteran to beef up depth.
The 29-year-old Bell played last season with the Dallas Cowboys, appearing in 12 games and making two starts at left tackle. They missed the entire 2016 season after injuring their ankle during off-season workouts with the Tennessee Titans.
The Packers released lineman Jacob Alsadek, an undrafted rookie free agent out of Arizona, to make room for Bell on Wednesday.
Green Bay is short on experienced depth up front. Starting right tackle Bryan Bulaga missed the second half of the 2017 season with a knee injury, while right guard Jahri Evans is a free agent after one season with the Packers.
Injuries also kept out the Packers' top two backup tackles, Jason Spriggs and Kyle Murphy, for much of 2017.
Bell started all 16 games for Tennessee in 2016, playing at left guard and both tackle positions. They entered the league as an undrafted free agent with Carolina in 2011 out of New Mexico.
Bell started 56 of 62 games for the Panthers over the next four seasons, playing both tackle positions.

Hearing for Trump's VA Pick Ronny Jackson Postponed Over Reports of Drinking on the Job, Improperly Distributing Meds
Christina Aguilera Gives Diva Lessons to Melissa McCarthy and James Corden in Carpool Karaoke: WATCH
On their return to air after a weeklong break, Seth Meyers wondered who's benefiting from the Trump presidency at this point, with scandals piling up all over.
For example, there's Trump EPA chief Scott Pruitt who is under ten separate investigations for misuse of taxpayer money and possible ethics violations.
Said Meyers: “He's under 10 different investigations. Pruitt's under so many investigations (showing a punched-out card from a sandwich shop) they get a six-inch sub free of charge.”
Meyers also looked at Kellyanne Conway's tangle with CNN's Dana Bash over the weekend over the anti-Trump tweets Conway's husband has been lobbing out as of late.
Said Bash: “I don't remember the last time we saw somebody working for the president in a high profile position when their spouse is saying critical things about them.”
Replied an obviously pissed-off Conway: “There are other family members of people who work at the White House who certainly don't support the president privately and publicly.”
Quipped Meyers: “First of all (flashing photo of Melania), we know. Second of all, think about how dumb that argument is. ‘So what if my husband hates Trump. Lots of people do!'”
“Statistically speaking, anyone who gets too close to Trump has a good chance of being raided by the FBI,” Meyers continued, diving into the speculation surrounding whether Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will flip on the president.
“Think about how crazy this is,” gasped Meyers. “Michael Cohen isn't saying Trump is innocent. He's saying, ‘I would never rat them out.' It's just taken for granted that Trump did something illegal.”
Meyers then looked at Trump's unhinged tweetstorm over the weekend, in which they insisted Cohen wouldn't flip, but added that if Cohen did flip, he'd be lying.
Said Meyers: “Of course Trump assumes that most people lie to get out of trouble because he's always lying to get out of trouble. If the feds put pressure on him, there's a good chance he'll flip on himself.”

MADRID — Palma on the island of Mallorca plans to become the first Spanish city to prohibit the rental of apartments to tourists.
Palma mayor Antoni Noguera says Tuesday that their government will vote for the ban in a city council because “there is nothing worse than having residents who can't live in their city nor afford a rent.”
Rents in Mallorca and in most Spanish cities have increased in recent years. Many residents and local lawmakers blame the price rise on internet sites and apps that allow travellers to rent apartments short-term directly from homeowners.
Noguera says that houses will be excluded from the ban, unless they are in protected areas, near airports or in industrial areas.
Police declared a crime scene at Double Island Point after swooping on a yacht moored there last week.
A FRENCHMAN charged with bringing an allegedly stolen $250,000 yacht into Queensland has been denied bail in Gympie Magistrates Court, after being branded an international flight risk.
Magistrate Ross Woodford told the man, Frederic Bouchet bail was out of the question, after Bouchet asked to to return to Sydney.
"A court wouldn't grant you bail, we wouldn't see you for dust," Mr Woodford told Bouchet, who appeared in custody in the court on Monday.
Remanding them to appear in the court again on August 29, Mr Woodford said Bouchet, 48, was subject to a visa which was soon to expire. They allowed the remand so police could research penalties for comparable offences.
"You have no residential address for any application for bail, you live in France and your visa will expire soon," Mr Woodford said.
"You have an enforceable departure date of September 17, but nothing can happen until these matters are absolutely finalised."
"So I go back to jail?" Bouchet said from the dock.
"I can go out and every day I sign in at police station," Bouchet offered.
"No," Mr Woodford said.
Bouchet is charged with bringing a stolen yacht, which the court was told was valued at $250,000, into Queensland between July 30 and August 11 and unlawful use of a vessel on August 11.
Police have announced a crime scene at Double Island Point, near a yacht allegedly stolen from New South Wales.
LAS VEGAS — David Copperfield insisted Tuesday they knew of no one being injured during 20 years of performing a signature vanishing act at the centre of a lawsuit by a British tourist who claims they were seriously hurt in a fall during a Las Vegas performance.
Amid complaints from their lawyers about widespread media coverage, the world-famous illusionist returned to the witness stand, telling a Nevada jury about the trick that makes people seems to disappear on stage and reappear in the back of the theatre.
At least 55,000 audience volunteers have taken part in the illusion in the two decades, according to Copperfield and show executive producer, Chris Kenner, who testified last week.
In about 60 to 90 seconds, stagehands with flashlights hurry the randomly chosen participants past dark curtains, down unfamiliar passageways, around corners, outdoors, indoors and through an MGM Grand resort kitchen to re-enter the theatre and “reappear” for the show finale, according to testimony. Copperfield remains on stage the entire time.
Benedict Morelli, attorney for Gavin Cox, has characterized the route as an obstacle course and the pace as dangerously fast for people who might not have appropriate footwear and are not told in advance what they will encounter.
Copperfield said they and stagehands assessed the capabilities of audience volunteers as they approached the stage, climbed stairs and seated themselves in a boxy 13-seat apparatus for the illusion. The trick is dubbed “the Thirteen,” for the number of seats.
The jury has been told that some volunteers were turned away.
Over the objections of Copperfield attorney Elaine Fresch, Morelli asked Copperfield if they thought the number of people not injured by the illusion over the years suggested that it was safe.
“I'm not in the business of hurting people,” Copperfield said.
“The illusion must be safe because of how many people have done it without getting injured?” Morelli asked.
“Numbers are not a defence,” Copperfield said, adding they couldn't remember hearing of anyone getting hurt.
Copperfield said they didn't know Cox claimed to have been injured in November 2013 until they were sued the following year. They said they stopped performing the illusion a year later.
Cox alleges they fell after being hurried by stagehands through an alleyway coated with a powdery residue near a trailer-sized trash bin. The resident of Kent, England, claims lasting brain and bodily injuries from their fall have cost them more than $400,000 in medical care.
Fresch lost a bid Tuesday for a mistrial based on the amount of media coverage about the case, including interviews involving Morelli.
Clark County District Court Judge Mark Denton allowed testimony to resume after asking jurors if they saw news items about the case during a five-day break in the civil trial. Three said they turned off broadcasts when they encountered them.
Copperfield's lawyers lost pretrial motions to close proceedings to the public to avoid giving away performance secrets.
A state appeals court ruled Friday that Denton can close the courtroom to the public for some testimony to protect tradecraft.
So how did Hamilton make their way? As a teenage clerk, they showed such prowess in writing about a hurricane that struck the island of Christiansted that a group of elders teamed up to send them to King's College (now Columbia University) in New York. Once there, however, they set their heart on achieving glory in the War of Independence and was soon captaining an artillery division, before becoming aide-de-camp to General George Washington, a non-combat role. But Hamilton insisted on returning to action, and in the last major battle of the war, they led a bayonet charge against besieged British forces in 1781 at Yorktown, Virginia (now about seven hours' drive from New York), which led to the decisive surrender of General Cornwallis's army.
In the same period, they co-founded the first bank in North America and married Elizabeth Schuyler, the daughter of a general, whom they had met the year before the battle. Then, with the war almost over, they resigned their commission to return to New York to join their wife and their son. They would have eight children together.
In New York, they worked as a lawyer, and helped to forge the US Constitution. They also founded the Bank of New York (alongside the man who would later kill him). When George Washington became the first President of the United States, they made Hamilton their Treasury Secretary. In that role, they established a trading relationship with Britain, opposed slavery and created the first national bank.
But in the same year, Hamilton got involved in an expensive affair with 23-year-old Maria Reynolds, whose husband apparently encouraged the liaison, demanding vast sums in hush money, starting with a payment of $1,000.
Hamilton would later air all their dirty laundry in the first political sex scandal of the new country, detailing the ins and outs of the tawdry business to avoid accusations of embezzlement.

AUSTIN, Texas — Two Texas youth prison guards allegedly choked a teenager in custody until they became unconscious, with one of them asking if they were “ready to go to sleep” while the other put part of their leg across their neck, according to court documents released Friday.
A third correctional guard at the same state-run juvenile lockup is accused of walking up to another teenager and punching them in the face, then tackling the teenager to the ground and using a closed fist to land more punches to the head and body.
All three were arrested Thursday and charged with official oppression as part of a state investigation into the troubled Texas Juvenile Justice Department. Since last year, at least nine Texas juvenile correctional officers have been arrested on abuse or misconduct charges, and a 10th former correctional officer was convicted in July on charges of having sex with youth in custody.
The unfolding crisis has led Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to replace the agency's top leaders and independent ombudsman. They also launched a state investigation into the juvenile system that houses about 1,400 youth offenders — and was drastically downsized and overhauled in 2007 following an earlier sex abuse scandal involving guards and teenagers.
“There is no room among us for those who dishonour themselves and violate the public trust. These arrests improve the safety of the youth we serve,” said Camille Cain, the new executive director over the Texas juvenile detention system.
Court documents filed in Cooke County accuse correctional officers Shannon Hoaglen, 41, and Derrick Day, 39, of moving to restrain a teenager due to a “rule violation” and holding them to the ground until they could “not talk, breath or move until they became unconscious; waking up dazed, confused.” The documents do not spell out what rules the teenager violated or their age. Youths in the Texas system age out at 19.
Another correctional officer allegedly told investigators that Day lay on the teenager and told them “are you ready to go sleep” and counted until “the Youth stopped moving.”
“In the surveillance video, it is obvious, based on the sudden stop in movement by the Youth, that the Youth had lost consciousness during this restraint,” according to an affidavit signed by Sgt Jacob Richardson, who works in the agency's inspector general office.
Cooke County Jail records on Friday did not list Hoaglen and Day as still in custody, and a court clerk did not know whether they had been arraigned or entered a plea. It was not clear whether either had attorneys, and no working phone numbers for Hoaglen and Day could be immediately found.
Derrick Goodman, 56, who allegedly punched the other juvenile in custody, said they had no comment when reached by phone Friday.
In 2007, Texas lawmakers shuttered lockups across the state after authorities believed at least 13 boys in custody had been sexually abused. Five juvenile lockups remain today but are spread out in rural areas, which juvenile advocates say has made finding and retaining qualified officers difficult.

The Los Angeles Lakers have the 25th and 47th overall picks in the upcoming 2018 NBA Draft, where they will hope to hit on another non-lottery pick like they did last year with Kyle Kuzma at No. 27.
This offseason is a pivotal one for L.A. as the Lakers look to bring in some significant free agent talent, like LeBron James and Paul George, to quickly accelerate their rebuild while continuing to build depth through the draft and free agency. With that in mind and a roster that currently features just eight players under contract as of July 1, there will likely be open roster spots for first and second round picks this year.
There are a number of players the Lakers will consider with those picks and their pre-draft workout process has already begun, with a mixture of high-level draft talent and fringe draft picks all making trips to L.A. to show their skills. Among the recent participants was Lonzo Ball's younger brother, LiAngelo, who left Lithuania after one year to pursue the NBA dream.

Black Stars squad
Ghana coach Avram Grant has named three uncapped youngsters Ebenezer Ofori, Joseph Larweh Attamah and Rahpael Dwamena in their 26-man squad for the 2017 Africa Cup Nations.
The Israeli coach controversially left out Juventus playmaker Kwadwo Asamoah as well as Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sulley Muntari who had expressed interest in returning.
Key Ghana players Asamoah Gyan, Andre Ayew, Mubarak Wakaso, Christian Atsu and Jonathan Mensah all named in the squad.
Mensah and Edwin Gyimah were named in the squad despite fitness concerns but it looks like the coach is certain they will be fit for the tournament.
The squad which is dominated by players who played in the qualifiers saw one regular player in the squad David Accam excluded.
Other players axed from the squad are defensive pair of Nuru Sulley and Rashid Sumaila who were popular players among the supporters following their impressive showing at their clubs sides.
Dwamena, the 23-goal man at the halfway stage of the Austria second tier looks to have won the heart of the coach with their goals at training last week.
Tapketey who plays for German side Schalke will get the chance for their showing in the wings while Sweden-based Ofori looks to be the like-for-like replacement for Kwadwo Asamoah
Goalkeepers: Razak Braimah (Cordoba, Spain), Adam Kwarasey (Rosenborg, Norway) Richard Ofori (Wa All Stars)

Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier is leaving President Trump's American Manufacturing Council, saying, "I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."
The resignation came after Trump was criticized for their response to the violence at white supremacist events in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. The president, famous for their ability to be direct and forceful, was faulted for condemning violence "on many sides."
Within an hour of Merck announcing Frazier's withdrawal, Trump retorted on Twitter, "Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned ... they will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices!"
In a statement on their resignation, Frazier said, "America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."
Frazier, who is African-American, said they were acting as both the CEO of Merck and "as a matter of personal conscience."
The rift did not seem to harm Merck's stock: The drug company's shares rose by nearly a full percentage point in the first hour of trading, to nearly $63.
Members of their own party have called on Trump to condemn Saturday's killing of a woman who had been protesting white supremacists as an act of domestic terrorism. The White House later stated that Trump was including "white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups" in their remarks about the violence.
Frazier's departure is the latest high-profile exit from a White House advisory council since Trump took office in January.
After Trump announced in June that the U.S. would be leaving the Paris climate accord, both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger left their business advisory council.
Months earlier, in February, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick left the same panel during the fallout from Trump's executive order that banned immigrants from seven Muslim countries.
"The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick said at the time.
ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) — Ariya Jutanugarn is resigned to the fact that 2017 couldn't possibly be better than their breakout year in 2016. A day ahead of the start of the Women's Australian Open at Royal Adelaide, the 21-year-old Thai golfer also says she's not putting pressure on themselves to overtake Lydia Ko for the No. 1 ranking.
After winning five tournaments last year, Jutanugarn captured the LPGA Tour's player of the year award, the money title and the season-long points competition that came with a $1 million bonus.
"I'm not going to try to compare myself this year with last year, because this year, it's not going to be like 2016," Jutanugarn said Wednesday. "I'm just going to try my best with everything and try to be more happy on the course and try to have fun."
Jutanugarn made their comments not long after Ko said they aren't concerned about being on the radar of other golfers wishing to overtake them for the top ranking. And Jutanugarn also played down the importance of their ranking.
"This year, my target, I won't worry about the ranking at all," they said. "I mean, there's going to be a lot of expectation from other people, so I want to play with my own expectations."
Jutanugarn will tee off in the first round on Thursday afternoon with defending champion Haru Nomura of Japan and England's Charley Hull.
Here are some other things to know about the LPGA tournament which will help Royal Adelaide celebrate its 125th anniversary.
___
THE FIELD: Ko is among four of the top 10-ranked players entered. As well, 10 major champions, including three from 2016, are in a field that includes Brooke Henderson and Michelle Wie and Australian veteran Karrie Webb.
Ko, a South Korean-born New Zealander, has been a pro golfer since October 2013, and she's been No. 1 for roughly half of that time. She's held the top ranking for the past 68 weeks, after a previous stint in 2015. "I have been fortunate enough to be in this position for so long and obviously it takes a lot of hard work and, I think, luck at the same time," Ko said Wednesday. "But when we're out there, we're not thinking about what ranked player they are to me, or what I am. That is the mindset I have been trying to take. I feel more self-pressure rather than pressure from others."
___
CONSISTENT HENDERSON: No. 8-ranked Henderson had the second-most top-10 finishes on the LPGA Tour in 2016 behind Jutanugarn (16) with 15 in their 31 starts. Between February and April, the 19-year-old Canadian had eight straight top-10 finishes, and later captured two wins in June including their first major at the Women's PGA Championship. "2016 was really incredible, having my first major win ... a top 10 at the Olympics, incredible experience and I feel like I learned a lot about myself on and off the course."
___
GETTING A (NEW) GRIP: Wie is back for the first time since 2012 at the Women's Australian Open, where they missed their cut in their only previous appearance in this event. They have five top-10 finishes since their last LPGA victory at the 2014 U.S. Women's Open and had just one top-10 all of last season, after having none in 2015. After missing the cut at the season-opening Bahamas LPGA Classic, Wie said they plan a new style on the greens in Adelaide— the "claw" putting grip made popular by Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia. Wie will also shelve their "table-top" stance, where their body is at a 90-degree angle over the ball, to a regular position over the putter.
___
GALLERIES NOTE: Ko has been paired with Jang Ha-na of South Korea and Henderson for a morning start Thursday. Five-time champion Webb will play alongside American major champion Mo Martin and Sweden's Pernilla Lindberg. Wie has an afternoon start with fellow Americans Angel Yin and Mariah Stackhouse.
CORSICA, France — Corsica's nationalist leaders are demonstrating along with unions and students ahead of a visit next week by French President Emmanuel Macron.
The newly elected leaders on the French Mediterranean island hope that Saturday's march will spur on fresh talks with the French government about demands including equal status for the Corsican language and the release of Corsican prisoners held in mainland prisons.
In December, Corsican nationalists swept the election for a new regional assembly, crushing Macron's young centrist movement and traditional parties. The nationalists want more autonomy from Paris but unlike some in Spain's nearby Catalonia, they aren't seeking full independence — yet.
They also want protections for locals buying real estate on the destination that the French refer to as the “Island of Beauty,” which is famed as Napoleon's birthplace.

An editorial from the Winnipeg Free Press, published May 29:
No one would accuse the Pallister government of being soft on drugs. It has repeatedly lobbied its federal counterpart to push back the deadline for the upcoming legalization of marijuana. It has also found reasons to reject recommendations to establish safe-consumption sites in Winnipeg for the city's growing number of people addicted to harder drugs, including opiates.
But like it or not — and, philosophically, the Pallister government clearly does not — cannabis will soon be legal, likely by the end of this summer or early autumn.
To its credit, Manitoba's government seems to have accepted the inevitable and started thinking ahead, drafting a policy to govern cannabis use among its civil servants. If other employers, both public and private, are not drafting similar policies, they should be. The criminalization that supposedly restricted cannabis use in the workplace is about to be lifted, a change that will create some unique workplace dilemmas.
The province's work on the issue is evident in a five-page draft policy from Manitoba's civil service commission that was leaked to The Canadian Press.
For example, the draft policy mentions staff functions such as Christmas parties, where alcohol consumption is traditionally allowed. Will staff at work-related social functions be allowed to openly use cannabis? The draft policy for the province's civil service says no.
The draft policy also posits different rules for storing alcoholic beverages and cannabis at work for later consumption on the employee's free time. For example, an employee on their lunch break who buys a bottle of wine can store the unopened bottle at their desk, but they won't be allowed to bring into the office the marijuana buds they legally purchased for use on their own time. And that's only the beginning of questions all Manitoba employers will face.
Overt smoking of cannabis at the workplace can be neatly banned under the tobacco-smoking restrictions that already exist. But what about cannabis edibles? While it will be illegal for cannabis stores to sell edibles in Manitoba, cannabis cookies are easily made by anyone with access to an oven: can employees bring cannabis cookies to work or to “pot luck” workplace functions?
What about executives who have expense accounts on which they “wine and dine” important clients? If the client prefers weed to wine, can the company representative vape with the VIP and write off the reefer?
If the Manitoba government finds itself confounded by workplace policies around cannabis, it's not alone.
The Canadian Human Resources Professionals Association surveyed more than 700 of its members in January and found a full 71 per cent of employers is not prepared for the legalization of cannabis.
A report titled Clearing the Haze: The Impacts of Marijuana in the Workplace recommends government sets a clear legal definition of “impairment” and the grounds under which an employee can be drug-tested. This remains a serious debate for employers, as cannabis chemicals remain in the bloodstream and employees who use the drug only after clocking out could fail a drug test even if they're not under the influence at work.
The report also says provincial governments should co-ordinate recreational marijuana regulations as much as possible, so employers with a national workforce can easily adhere to the policies.
It's incumbent on both employees and employers to be responsible about cannabis. For employers, this includes giving workers a clear cannabis-use policy before the drug becomes legal.
Workers have a right to know specifically what is, and isn't, allowed at their office, plant and job site. If workplaces don't yet have clear policies, the employers should get to work, and put in the overtime if necessary.
FOWLERVILLE, Mich. — A Michigan police officer has been charged after their personal gun accidentally fired into the floor of a high school gymnasium as they watched a wrestling tournament in which their son was a competitor.
WHMI-FM reports that 40-year-old Mark Boudreau is charged with misdemeanour careless discharge of a firearm.
The shot was fired May 5 at Fowlerville High School, about 65 miles (105 kilometres) northwest of Detroit.
Boudreau, of the Flint Police Department, will be arraigned June 7.
Defence attorney Frank Manley on Wednesday called the shooting “unfortunate,” and Boudreau “an outstanding veteran command officer.”
The Flint Journal reports that Flint police said in a statement the department “cannot comment on any potential criminal allegations until” it receives “all of the facts at the conclusion of the proceedings.”
Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard were critical of Lionel Messi's performance in Barcelona's humbling at Paris Saint-Germain as the duo slammed the star's lack of effort in the French capital.
It was a night to forget for Messi and Co. after Barcelona suffered a humiliating 4-0 loss to PSG in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.
Angel Di Maria's brace on their birthday condemned LaLiga champions Barça to an embarrassing defeat in Paris, as five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi struggled to have any influence on the contest.

And former Manchester United centre-back Ferdinand criticised Messi's display at the Parc des Princes.
"His reaction there was poor," Ferdinand told BT Sport. "All night they were sloppy.
"He looked dejected and bereft of ideas, [but] he's human."
Former Liverpool captain Gerrard echoed Ferdinand's comments, adding: "He showed zero effort. No reaction all night."
Barça will attempt to salvage the tie in the return fixture at Camp Nou on March 8.
LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) – A Lakeland man is in critical condition after police say they were hit by a car early Monday morning.
Police were called to U.S. Route 98 in Lakeland around 2:45 a.m. for the report of a pedestrian hit by a car.
According to investigators, 31-year-old John Riley was pulled over on the side of the road and was walking around trying to flag other drivers down. A car headed south on 98 swerved to avoid hitting him, but police say another car was unable to react, and hit Riley.
Riley was taken to Lakeland Regional Health Center, and is listed in critical condition.
At the time of the crash, investigators say Riley was in an area of the road not marked for pedestrians.
No charges have been filed at this time.
The investigation shut down the road for about three hours.

PORTLAND, Maine — A New Hampshire-based helicopter service has begun its expansion into Portland, Maine.
Seacoast Helicopters began service to Portland this week, offering tours of the city's historic downtown, Casco Bay islands, and lighthouses around Portland.
Bruce Cultrera, president and CEO, said the service is starting with one helicopter at the Portland International Jetport. More helicopters will be brought in, if needed.
The service started with a single pilot and a single helicopter at the Pease International Tradeport, but now has six helicopters and nine pilots.
Stephen Strasburg didn't think they needed to go on a rehab start, so they made quick work of their brief trip to the minors.
The Washington Nationals right-hander struck out five and allowed three hits and one walk in a rehab appearance for Class A Potomac on Monday night. Facing the Salem Red Sox, Strasburg showcased good command of their fastball and good movement on their curveball as they allowed one earned run.
Strasburg threw 64 pitches, plus a few more in the bullpen to get up to the 75 the team had prescribed. Afterward, the 29-year-old sounded like they were eager to get back into major league action.
"I feel like I was ready to come back before this, but they wanted to be conservative, so hopefully this is enough," Strasburg said.
With a big lead in the NL East and the playoffs in mind, the Nationals have the ability to be conservative with Strasburg and several other injured players. They placed MVP candidate Bryce Harper on the 10-day disabled list Sunday with what general manager Mike Rizzo called a "significant" bone bruise in their left knee.
"We have a pretty sufficient lead in August," Harper said. "Of course that doesn't mean anything until you get there. But it does help out the fact that I can sit out a little bit and let it heal and let it rest and get to where I need to be."
Strasburg has been on the disabled list with a nerve impingement in their right elbow since July 27. They left two innings into their last start on July 23 at Arizona and has been working to get back since.
They said they felt good during a simulated game at Nationals Park last week and came out of the rehab start with the same feelings.
"I felt good," Strasburg said. "No issues. Felt strong throughout."
Strasburg said their plan was, "Go through my pitches, try and hit my spots." A double was the only ball hit hard off the starter who signed a $175 million, seven-year contract last year.
Last season the Nationals didn't have Strasburg in the playoffs because of injury and hope that's different this time around. In 2017 he's 10-3 with a 3.25 ERA and 141 strikeouts in 20 games.
If Strasburg cites no further issues coming out of their minor league start, they could be in line to pitch this weekend in their hometown of San Diego against the Padres.

The Thames is is the central spine of our capital city. The river is the reason that London exists at all, and its iconic meanders are seared into our brains thanks to a combination of the Eastenders credits, the original London 2012 logo and the default view in Google Maps.
But now if one thing is clear it is that the river has become more of a menace than something we should celebrate. And the reason is simple: Bridges.
The Tyranny of the Thames
The central section of the river is spanned by over a dozen bridges - each of which has a unique history and cultural resonance. They're important: They enable South London to be, well, London. And they're interesting too: Sufficiently nerdy Londoners will know all sorts of factoids, such as how the current Waterloo Bridge was constructed mostly by women during WWII, or that one of the previous London Bridges was bought by an American entrepreneur and now in Arizona.
But sail further East, and suddenly the bridges stop. In fact, travel east of Tower Bridge and there's only the Dartford Crossing before you reach the North Sea. And this is because of one other neat-sounding factoid: The reason the bridges just stop is because historically the river needed to accommodate large ships bringing in goods to London's original ports. It's also why Tower Bridge can open up - so that back in the day ships could reach the wharves that lined the river. Today, obviously the inner-city ports are no longer with us, and are instead trendy apartments for rich people. London's imports can now arrive via the massive new London Gateway container port in Essex.
Unfortunately, though London's planners have not kept up with events. It might have been a useful rule in the 19th century, but this ancient dictat is now strangling London in the 21st century.
Bridge Over The River Why?
Darryl Chamberlain gives a powerful explanation of the results of this insanity in a recent post on CityMetric. Essentially, the Mayor and the government want to build and regenerate all of the slightly rubbish bits of London. Skyscrapers are shooting up in lots of new places, which will hopefully go some way towards mitigating London's horrendous housing crisis. There's just one problem: How will everyone get to work?
As Chamberlain points out, the Jubilee Line - the tube line that links North Greenwich - where people live, -with Canary Wharf - where people work - is practically bursting already. Building new skyscrapers is great, but it doesn't mean more people can fit inside a tube train.
The solution is obvious given that the two locales are on opposite sides of the river: Build a damn bridge. But seemingly to fit in with stupid ancient rules, it would require a £90m lifting bridge, rather than something simpler.
And no, a ferry shuttling passengers across wouldn't work well as it would take ages to cross the river, and would likely not be able to meet demand. It would also be unreliable in bad weather - as the similarly stupid Cable Car demonstrates. In 2015, it was revealed that the white elephant was forced to close 354 times in just 36 months because it got too windy.
“Ah ha! But what about tunnels?”, you might ask. There are already a handful of tunnels running under the Thames further East - from Brunel's first ever under-Thames tunnel (which now enables the East London Line to exist), to the Blackwall Tunnel and others. There's also the new Lower Thames Crossing, which was announced earlier this week, which will connect the M2 directly with the M25. Problem solved? No.
Unfortunately, tunnels are not useful for living in a modern city. Not only are they expensive, because digging holes is hard, but they are also only useful if the passengers are inside a car, bus or a train carriage. This means more demand on new hypothetical transport services. By contrast, bridges are easy for pedestrians to use and they can be open 24/7. Bridges also facilitate cycling, which is the closest thing London has to a silver bullet for solving congestion, reducing pollution, improving public health (as we'd get more exercise) and helping mitigate climate change all in one go.
#CloseTheBridge
You only have to look at a map to see how disconnected the lack of bridges has left communities - and potential sites of new housing and regeneration on either side of the river. Woolwich remains separated from Silvertown. A trip from Thamesmead to Barking would an hour by car, or 53 minutes and four modal changes by public transport.
All so that slightly taller ships can look pretty passing through Tower Bridge.
What I'm saying is simple: We need to build more bridges. Sod the tall ships. It's time for the Thames to reflect London's 21st century needs. It's time for Tower Bridge to close for good.

Chester FC Community Trust has announced that it has been awarded a grant of £20,000 from the Premier League Fans Fund.
The grant will support the trust in its drive to engage new fans and improve the match-day experience.
Thanks to the funding, Chester FC Community Trust will launch its Fans First initiative, which aims to attract more young people and families to matches at Chester FC.
The initiative will see the trust develop a brand new Fan Zone on match-days to provide a vibrant, family-friendly meeting space. The zone will feature a number of activities to support this, including face painting and football inflatables.
There are also plans to improve the existing junior fans groups, Cestrians 1885 and the Junior Blues, by upskilling a cohort of volunteers. They will support a range of new engagement opportunities and activities, taking place on match-days and throughout the season.
(Image: Chester FC)
In addition, a new Community Zone within the stadium is planned as part of the project, which will focus on fans between the ages of five and 15. The trust and Chester FC will be working in partnership to develop understanding of how the supporter experience can be improved, with an emphasis on younger generations.
Chief executive of Chester FC Community Trust Jim Green said: “We're thrilled to receive this grant and very grateful to the Premier League Fans Fund for supporting us.
“Through this project, we will be able to make significant improvements to fans' experience of attending games at the Swansway Chester Stadium, further strengthen the relationship between the Club and supporters, and ensure we are engaging and retaining both new and existing fans.”
The Premier League Fans Fund is a commitment from the Premier League to fund projects and organisations which improve the relationship between fans and their clubs, the way football supporters engage with each other and fans' experience of the game.
To celebrate this grant, Chester FC Community Trust will be holding a photo opportunity at the Swansway Chester Stadium on Friday, March 30, prior to their home fixture against Torquay United FC, with Club officials and supporters set to benefit from the grant.
DENVER (AP) — Republicans on the campaign trail this year will be eager to tout the potential benefits of their tax cut plan.
Voters like Jeanine Limone Draut, a freelance technical writer in Denver, have something else in mind: health care.
Failed efforts by congressional Republicans last year to repeal former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act exposed not only deep divisions within the party but also revealed core benefits of the law that millions of Americans now take for granted. Draut is tired of the attacks and the uncertainty surrounding the law's future.
"As a small business owner, it just wreaks havoc on how you do business," Draut, an independent, said of the on-again, off-again repeal talk from Republicans. "I don't know if either party has a solution. My vote is pretty closely tied to my livelihood."
Both parties are paying attention, especially after a better-than-expected enrollment season under the health care law. Democrats especially have used health care to go on the attack, and the issue is coming up in congressional races in California, Colorado, Michigan, Washington and elsewhere. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Friday found health care as the top issue voters want congressional candidates to address.
Enrollment was especially robust in many of the states that operate their own insurance marketplaces, where enrollment periods were longer than on the federal exchange and promotional budgets were beefed up. Strong sign-ups came despite Republican attacks against the law and President Donald Trump's administration taking several steps to undermine it, including cutting the federal sign-up period in half and slashing advertising.
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Maryland, New York, Vermont and other states with their own exchanges saw enrollment approach or surpass 2017 levels. Minnesota's health insurance exchange set a record for private plans with an enrollment period that was more than two weeks shorter than in 2017.
California's state exchange, the nation's largest, has reported more than 1.2 million renewals for 2018 and an additional 342,000 new customers. Its 2018 enrollment period doesn't end until Wednesday, as does New York's.
Democrats say the level of consumer interest presents a political opportunity.
"We're definitely making it an issue," said Jason Crow, a Democrat who is challenging five-term Republican Congressman Mike Coffman in a suburban Denver district.
Crow has criticized Coffman's vote for the GOP tax bill, which eliminated the tax penalty for people who don't get health insurance. That move is expected to undermine the individual insurance market starting next year.
More than 22,000 people enrolled last year for coverage on the state exchange in Coffman's district, which went for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
"People in our district recognize the progress we've made under health care. The fact that 20 million more people have health care matters — it matters a lot," Crow said. "And under Trump, we are now moving in the opposite direction."
Coffman encountered hoots and boos at town halls last year for their insistence that Obama's health law be repealed, even though they eventually voted against the legislation. They insist that any replacement guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
Coffman's campaign manager, Tyler Sandberg, described the incumbent's approach to health care as nuanced.
"His stance ultimately is about pre-existing conditions. It's something everyone can relate to," Sandberg said. "And if Democrats think they can hit them over the head with it, I think they're going to be sorely mistaken."
Democrats also are making health care a key part of their strategy in this year's race to select a successor to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. The Democrat last year worked with moderate Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, lobbying Congress in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain the requirement that all Americans have health insurance.
A Republican field that includes former Rep. Tom Tancredo and Attorney General Cynthia Coffman is focusing on roads, education, immigration and spending limits. The Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, a longtime health care executive, and U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, have made protecting the state exchange a central campaign theme.
Safeguarding the Obama-era health care reforms is essential to Colorado voters such as Draut, 45, who said their state exchange policy gives their peace of mind that she'll be covered if they become ill, and Caleb Jackson, a 27-year-old graduate student at the University of Colorado-Denver.
Under the Affordable Care Act, Jackson was covered until last year on their parents' policy, which allowed them to receive a $200,000 bone marrow transplant that stabilized a debilitating neurological condition. Now treatment-free, they have taken advantage of the law's Medicaid expansion while they pursue an advanced degree in public administration and urban planning.
They said they switched their voter registration from Republican to Democrat because of the GOP's repeated attempts to repeal the law.
"At this point I couldn't, in good conscience, vote for people who voted to repeal the ACA," Jackson said. "I think it will come back to haunt them."
Democrats began using health care as part of their congressional campaign strategy last fall. That's when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran its first radio and cable TV ads of the 2018 election cycle. They were in 11 Republican-held congressional districts and asserted that a Republican-run federal government would keep trying to undo Obama's overhaul: "They'll never stop," the ad said.
Democratic committee spokesperson Tyler Law said health care is an issue that should help their party in races across the country.
Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said their party won't run away from the health care debate, but the focus will be different. If Democrats take control of the federal government in the future, they said, they are likely to push for government-run, single-payer health care.
"It's become the litmus-test issue for Democrats," Hunt said.
In California, many Democratic candidates are unapologetic about their support for a single-payer system and say it's time for the U.S. to follow the health care models in most other wealthy countries.
Among Republicans considered vulnerable in the state is Rep. Steve Knight, a former state lawmaker who has drawn criticism from progressive groups for their vote on the GOP health care bill. Knight's 25th Congressional District stretches from the middle class suburbs north of Los Angeles to the high desert. An estimated 34 percent of its residents rely on public health coverage.
They defended their vote, saying structural problems with the Affordable Care Act discourage people from buying insurance, which has driven up premiums and forced insurance companies to leave the marketplace.
Two leading Democratic contenders, attorney Bryan Caforio and Katie Hill, a former head of a nonprofit helping the homeless, have made health care a top issue and support a universal health care system.
"We know that the ACA has been a dramatic improvement from where we were, but we still have a ways to go before we get to a health care system that works for everyone," Hill said.

Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Tonderai Ndiraya wants their men to express themselves freely when they take on Dynamos in a Castle Lager Premiership tie at the National Sports Stadium tonight.
The match starts at 7pm. Ndiraya, who has a strong Dynamos DNA, said it was time their men showed they can compete against the Glamour Boys.
“We need to be stubborn on Thursday (today) when we play Dynamos,” they said.
“We still have a lot to do, we are a small team, but people need to be reminded that dynamites come in small packages and we have already shown that by remaining on top of the log standings.
“Our league needs a strong Highlander, a strong CAPS United and a strong dynamo to make it exciting, but we have to compete against them.”
Ngezi Platinum have won five and drawn one of their last six matches.
“My players are eager to meet Dynamos. I hope the boys will adjust to the night game and I hope they will not be affected. I am also ready to play the biggest team in the land,” said Ndiraya.
Ngezi are likely to miss the services of Byron Madzokere, Donald Teguru and Edgar Tapera. Dynamos coach Lloyd Mutasa expects a tough match.
“We are playing the log leaders and we respect them. The match will be difficult, but we have done our part in preparing for them. We know the opposition and they have been enjoying a good run of form.
“Ngezi need to be reminded that we are Dynamos and every game we play we need a positive result and the game tomorrow is not an exception.
“I was happy with the inclusion of Lincoln (Zvasiya) in the national team and it only shows they are playing good football.
“My appeal is to the multitude of Dynamos fans to come in their numbers and support the team. It's a few days after commemorating the DeMbare 9 who perished on their way to watch Dynamos playing Chapungu and I feel that the Ngezi game is one match we must win for them,” said Mutasa. The Herald

MOODY — The Moody Police Department is currently investigating a fatal stabbing that occurred around 1 a.m. on Sunday.
Police say a 57-year-old man was stabbed by a woman in the Acton Road area. The stabbing is under investigation, but authorities believe this could have been an act of self-defense.
The St. Clair County coroner identified the man as Eugene Curtis.
More information will be added as it is received.
MADRID — Spain secured its 11th straight World Cup appearance aided by Italy's disappointing home draw against Macedonia on Friday, while Serbia missed on its chance to make it to next year's finals in Russia after a loss at Austria.
Spain comfortably defeated Albania 3-0 in a match in which defender Gerard Pique, an outspoken defender of Catalonia, received a mixed reaction from the home fans.
Italy practically secured a playoff spot but it was jeered by fans after drawing with Macedonia 1-1 in Turin. Even a victory would have kept the Italians in a difficult position to surpass Spain for first place in Group G because of its worse goal difference.
Serbia needed a win against Austria to clinch its spot from Group D but it lost 3-2 in Vienna, while Wales kept its chance alive by beating Georgia 1-0 despite Gareth Bale's absence.
Iceland stayed on the path to becoming the smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup after beating Turkey 3-0 in Group I.
The group winners automatically qualify, while the best eight second-place finishers from the nine groups advance to the playoffs.
Here's a look at the action:
GROUP D
Serbia conceded an 89th-minute goal in its loss to already-eliminated Austria, while Wales beat Georgia 1-0 away without injured star Gareth Bale thanks to a goal by Tom Lawrence just after halftime.
The Serbs can still secure first place with a home win against Georgia on Monday. But Wales was only a point behind Serbia, and Ireland was another point back and still alive after defeating Moldova 2-0 in Dublin.
Wales and Ireland meet on Monday to decide their fate.
GROUP G
Spain defeated Albania with first-half goals by Rodrigo, Isco, and Thiago Alcantara in a match marked by a mixed reaction toward Pique, who was booed and applauded by the crowd of nearly 30,000 fans in Alicante.
Many fans have targeted Pique for being openly critical of the Spanish government's handling of the independence referendum organized by Catalonia on Sunday, when authorities and voters confronted each other in violent clashes.
Italy's chance of winning the group ended with a surprise draw in Turin. Defender Giorgio Chiellini put the Italians ahead shortly before halftime but Macedonia substitute Aleksandar Trajkovski equalized near the end.
Liechtenstein fell at home to Israel 1-0 for its ninth straight loss. Liechtenstein has been outscored 35 to one.
GROUP I
Iceland stayed at the top of the group with its stunning 3-0 win at Turkey.
With Finland surprisingly holding Croatia to 1-1 away, and Ukraine taking three points from Kosovo after a 2-0 away win, the tightest group in European qualifying will have to be decided on Monday in the last round of matches.
Iceland leads with 19 points, and Croatia and Ukraine are two points behind. Turkey is out of contention with 14 as well as Finland with 8.
Iceland is a clear favourite when it hosts Kosovo in its last qualifier, while Croatia has to travel to Ukraine.

Republicans will not be easily dislodged: In many states, Republican governors have built powerful machinery to defend their allies, and Mr. Trump remains popular enough across much of the Midwest and South to limit Democratic gains. In 31 out of 50 states, Republicans command the entire legislature; in 25 of those states, the governor is also a Republican.
But with some momentum behind Democrats — at least for now — the party appears positioned to make inroads in crucial legislatures, winning a new measure of relevance in state policy and perhaps limiting Republicans' influence on congressional redistricting after 2020.
Photo
Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, the party's national hub for legislative campaigns, said Republicans were on the defense in all but a few states. Citing Democratic turnout in recent special elections, Mr. Walter said Republicans should use the next nine months to sound the “alarm bells” for their voters.
“What we have seen in the special elections is a significant spike in the interest, engagement, spending and energy by the liberal Democrats and progressive movement,” Mr. Walter said, adding: “The spending is real. The organizational prowess is real. And the energy is real.”
That energy was on raucous display last weekend in the Bucks County borough of Newtown, where well over 100 Democrats packed into a red-brick tavern to cheer Steve Santarsiero, a Democrat seeking a State Senate seat left open by a Republican's unexpected retirement. Before a lively breakfast crowd, Mr. Santarsiero needled Mr. Trump and hailed their fellow Democrats running for the legislature's multiplying number of open seats.
Applauding from the front was Helen Tai, an official in nearby Solebury who is running in a May special election for the State House prompted by a Republican's resignation. Democrats nearly swept local elections in four counties outside Philadelphia last November; Ms. Tai said the combination of Republican retirements and liberal enthusiasm had transformed the fight for the legislature.
“I wish it was a presidential year,” they said. “People want to vote. They can't wait to vote.”

Adding to Republicans' unease are several unresolved lawsuits that could unravel carefully drawn maps in states like North Carolina and Texas. The United States Supreme Court is expected to consider a number of cases involving gerrymandered maps this year, and Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said the group is considering new litigation against state legislative districts in the Pennsylvania courts, which voided a Republican-drawn congressional map last month.
Ms. Post said special elections over the last year had revealed “early indicators of the wave.”
In many of the biggest purple states, however, Democrats must overcome huge Republican majorities and forbidding legislative maps. In Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 120 seats in the 203-seat State House, and 34 of 50 in the State Senate.
Photo
Though Republicans have thin majorities in a few states, like Colorado and Minnesota, the party is entrenched by gerrymandering across most of the Midwest and has long controlled Sun Belt prizes like Florida and Arizona.
In North Carolina, Republican legislators wield margins enormous enough to override a veto by Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, on a party-line vote in both chambers. For 2018, Mr. Cooper and state Democrats have announced a “Break the Majority” campaign, not to capture either chamber, but merely to deprive Republicans of their supermajorities.
Representative Darren Jackson, the Democratic leader in the North Carolina House, said there had been a surge in candidate recruitment, and Democrats plan to pursue more than five-dozen seats where Mr. Cooper won about 44 percent of the vote or more in 2016. They are especially hopeful about the areas around Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte — the state's three largest cities — which resemble suburbs in other states that have turned on Republicans.
But Mr. Jackson takes an unromantic view of their party's prospects. A screen saver on their laptop cycles through headlines from when Mr. Trump won the presidency, as a reminder that any anticipated victory can evaporate.
“We're seeing a lot of interest in challenging incumbents, even in fairly red areas,” Mr. Jackson said, cautioning: “You've got to have good candidates.”
Democratic legislators in several states said in interviews that they were waiting on a major trove of data related to last year's elections in Virginia, where a coalition of educated white, young and minority voters delivered the party a 15-seat gain in the House of Delegates. State leaders say they intend to use that information to hunt for targets even in areas with unfriendly district lines.

Republicans are most concerned about a collection of big states where they hold at least one legislative chamber by a narrower majority. In Florida, they hold the State Senate with 23 of 40 seats, and in Arizona both chambers tilt Republican by five seats or fewer. Mike Gardner, a former Arizona legislator who is now a Republican lobbyist, predicted Republicans would keep power in that state, but noted surging energy in the “hatred-toward-Trump camp.”

State Representative Jose R. Oliva of Miami Lakes, a Republican in line to be speaker of the Florida House, doubted Democrats could win either chamber, but said Mr. Trump might hobble Republicans in the ultra-diverse communities in and around Miami. Democrats picked off a State Senate seat there in 2017, though they have faced their own woes, including the resignation of a state party chairperson amid harassment allegations.
“It's been my experience over the last several cycles that these are national elections,” Mr. Oliva said.
Most telling may be Wisconsin, a traditional swing state where Republicans have governed largely with a free hand since 2010. Mr. Trump won the state in 2016 and, with the help of gerrymandered districts, Republicans began last year with 20 of 33 State Senate seats.
But that number recently shrank to 18 after the Democrats' special election upset and with another vacancy. Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term, called Republicans' defeat in a red district on the Minnesota border a “wake-up call,” and party strategists are monitoring the Milwaukee suburbs, a cornerstone of Mr. Walker's political coalition, for signs of unrest.
State Senator Chris Larson, a Democrat, said a special election fought in below-freezing temperatures had buoyed Democrats who had grown accustomed to disappointment. “A lot of skepticism by Democrats is starting to melt away,” they said.
It is not Mr. Trump alone mobilizing Democrats down ballot. In some states, Republicans have been in charge long enough to generate their own cloud of fatigue. In moderate areas where Mr. Trump is toxic, some voters have also tired of Republican policies — on abortion, guns and environmental regulation — championed by rural legislators.
At a meeting of the liberal group Indivisible in Eagleville, Pa., last month, Democratic activists railed not just against Mr. Trump, but also against Republicans in Harrisburg, the state capital, accusing them of wringing money from suburban voters while neglecting local schools and infrastructure. Katie Muth, a leader of the group who is running for State Senate, declared from the front of a Unitarian church that 2018 was the moment to “save Pennsylvania.”
But Mr. Trump's unpopularity is likely to help. Pam Hacker, an electrician running for the State House, said they rarely bring up the president, but sees them alienating communities that once voted Republican.

BOISE, Idaho — Authorities say an Idaho man tried to crash a car into a courthouse in downtown Boise because they were upset with the court system.
The Ada County Sheriff's office says 37-year-old Jonathan Joseph Locksmith drove toward the courthouse in the state's capital city Sunday morning.
According to authorities, Locksmith apparently made it onto the courthouse plaza in the car, spinning it around in a “doughnut” before landing the vehicle in a fountain.
There were no injuries reported.
Locksmith has been arrested on a misdemeanour reckless driving charge and is now in jail.
It's unclear if they have an attorney.
The sheriff's office says Locksmith told a passer-by that they were upset with the court system and wanted to be arrested to go back to jail.
NEW ORLEANS — On Sunday June 24, 1973, dozens of patrons had gathered at the Upstairs Lounge, a gay bar in New Orleans when an arsonist set fire to the building. Within minutes, the flames engulfed the bar, killing 32 patrons. Now author Robert W. Fieseler has come out with a new book “Tinderbox: The Untold Story of the Upstairs Lounge Fire and the Rise of Gay Liberation,” that details the fire and its aftermath:
WRITING THE BOOK
As a gay man, Fieseler said they thought they knew a lot about the gay liberation movement but then in 2013, their journalism professor — who was from the New Orleans area — told them about the fire: “I was fascinated and compelled. I thought that this was this inherently important history.”
On a personal level, writing the book was also a way to reconnect with a relative whose death had been an important turning point in Fieseler's life, a gay man who had died of AIDS when Fieseler was 13. Attending their funeral was “life-changing” for Fieseler as they went from feeling that they were entirely alone to understanding that there were other gay men like him.
THE LIFE OF A BAR
Fieseler describes in the book how the Upstairs Lounge had a family-like atmosphere in some ways where manager Buddy Rasmussen ran a tight ship: no hustling of patrons, no sloppy drunks and no drug use. The bar's customers often put on theatrical performances, sometimes written by the wife of a customs agent who frequented the bar. Fieseler writes the Lounge became “an oasis where regular customers felt safe, less a hook-up space than a hangout where friends and lovers could exhale and be themselves.”
THE FIRE'S AFTERMATH
The fire was front-page news but only briefly. There was no public outpouring of grief and no rushing of top political figures to the scene. In the aftermath, survivors and friends of those who perished worried they might be accidentally revealed as being gay.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid.
New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: “An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H. word.”
PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING
About halfway into Fieseler's four-year book writing process, a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The June 2016 shooting eclipsed the Upstairs Lounge fires as the single-biggest loss of life for the LGBT community but also re-focused attention on the New Orleans fire, Fieseler said. Posts and stories about the New Orleans fire began appearing on social media as the Pulse nightclub shooting was discussed. Fieseler said the heightened attention on the 1973 fire gave them greater emotional urgency as a “piece of history I was writing about truly spoke to the present moment.”
It also spurred many people who had been reluctant to speak about the fire to come forward.
“Their reticence was replaced with urgency,” they said. “In the context of the Pulse nightclub shooting they thought that telling their story and bearing witness might do a greater good.”
RELIGION AND THE GAY COMMUNITY
A recurring topic in the book is the connection between the Metropolitan Community Church and the lounge. The MCC is a nationwide church started in 1968 to minister to gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people.
For a time, the MCC's New Orleans branch held services in the lounge and about a third of the fire victims were members of the church including the pastor. Troy Perry, who founded the church, came to New Orleans quickly after the fire to assist. Fieseler wanted to explore these connections in the book:
“For me, really the idea of queer faith was so compelling because I'd never really heard of it before or heard it explored in an in-depth way as it related to early gay liberation culture. And especially as I delved into the early history of gay liberation movements, it's virtually impossible to talk about that movement … without also addressing how important these queer religious organizations were at the time,” Fieseler said.

Irrefutable. Fifteen years ago, not every respected US war correspondent made this assessment of the threat posed by Iraq. Nor did every respected US scholar of international relations. Fifteen years ago, though, respectability could be lost in an instant. To oppose a war that began March 20, 2003 was to oppose freedom, humanity and the low theatre performed by Secretary Colin Powell at the United Nations.
It was to embrace a despot, to collaborate with terrorists and/or to be a conspiracy theorist. Perhaps a person was unconvinced by a drawing of weapons facilities. Perhaps a person knew firsthand that a nation already invaded by the first Bush, one subject to Clinton administration sanctions so extreme they ended half a million Iraqi lives in childhood, simply did not have the means to build such evil. In just weeks, those Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) diagrams offered to the UN Security Council were no longer evidence, but “irrefutable” bullshit drawn from the imagination of some Pentagon doodler. Didn't matter. Journalists and nations who had joined the Coalition of the Willing found themselves unable to leave.
OTTAWA — A Liberal MP who is facing an allegation of assault after a weekend visit to a Halifax bar is speaking out, calling the whole thing a case of mistaken identity.
Francis Drouin, who represents the eastern Ontario riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, has issued a statement detailing their version of what happened in Halifax in the early hours of Saturday morning.
In it, Drouin — who was in Halifax for the federal Liberal policy convention — says that while they were chatting with friends, they heard a woman shouting from another part of the bar.
“While I was standing facing the bar, with my credit card in hand, I heard what I believed to be a woman's voice coming from another area of the establishment behind me, yelling that their buttocks had been grabbed,” the statement says.
“Her comments were clearly not directed towards me.”
Drouin says they then shouted for the alleged perpetrator to be evicted from the bar, paid for their drink with their credit card and proceeded with their friends to another area of the establishment.
That's when they say a woman with a cellphone “mistakenly” tried to connect them to the alleged incident.
“We told them that they were mistaken. We left the establishment shortly thereafter.”
Drouin says they proactively informed the Prime Minister's Office and the government whip's office, and has been co-operating fully with a police investigation into the matter. A number of witness interviews have been gathered, they added.
They reiterated statements they made over the weekend stressing the importance of ensuring individuals are supported in a safe way when they come forward with allegations — but insists that in this case, it was all just a big misunderstanding.
“I am confident that the facts of the issue will lead to a clear outcome.”
Halifax police confirmed Monday they are investigating a report that a woman had been sexually assaulted. But the regional police service did not specifically name Drouin.
A spokesperson said no charges have been laid in the incident, which took place sometime after 2 a.m. Saturday at the Halifax Alehouse.
Jurgen Klopp rued the free-kick that led to Sunderland's equaliser, but David Moyes told them if they feel hard done by they should try managing a side at the bottom of the Premier League.
Sadio Mane handballed from a Seb Larsson free-kick inside the Liverpool box, after a soft foul was given for a trip on Jermain Defoe.
Moyes pointed out that Sunderland could have had another penalty for handball, when Emre Can handle a chipped cross from Adnan Januzaj in the first half.
The Sunderland boss also spoke of their pride at their side's application and energy, and said that the impressive recent home form could make the difference in the relegation fight.
Moyes said: “I think things go against you, you should see what it's like at the bottom of the league! I could have said that I thought there was another handball.
“I actually think the players today raised the supporters, by the way they got up to Liverpool, the pressure, the way they pressed them. Maybe if I was a German manager you might praise that, you might have been saying ‘great, he's trying something different!
“We weren't too defensive, with the team that we were putting out today, we were always mindful of getting something from the game if we could, we were disappointed from Saturday. Picking up points at home is important, we start to get belief that we can win games or draw games against the better teams here, which between now and the end of the season is going to be massive for us.”
Moyes also said that they had complete faith in Jermain Defoe to score from the spot on and seal a precious point for the hosts.
They said: “I said how important it is to have a really good penalty taker, because through the season you'll get them and you hope you can say ‘this will be OK'. With Jermain a lot of the time you think that. They converted them brilliantly well.”
A new teaser for the Stephen King-inspired Hulu's original series Castle Rock, which will air during the Super Bowl, just hit the Internet. The 10-episode show will interweave stories from the horror maestro's oeuvre, all set in Castle Rock, the fictitious Maine town where King set many of their freakiest novels. Castle Rock will premiere on Hulu sometime this summer. The show is directed by the legendary J.J. Abrams.
Stephen King is without a doubt the most respected and brilliant horror author. They have been composing from the 1970s and has unnerved ages of perusers. They additionally hold the refinement of having various adaptations of their books, novellas and short stories. A year ago, the adaptation of their novel It turned into a humongous achievement and the most elevated thriller ever. The Shawshank Redemption, in light of their novella Rita Hayworth is considered by numerous as the best film ever.
Made by J.J. Abrams, Hulu's up and coming original Castle Rock which is said to become as big as The Handmaid's Tale is an american psychological horror web television series which is based on the stories of Stephen King, intertwining characters and themes from the fictional town of Castle Rock. King has lived in the US province of Maine for the greater part of their life, and the vast majority of their books have been set in anecdotal Maine towns like Derry, Jerusalem's Lot and Castle Rock. In spite of the fact that the show is named Castle Rock, there are notices of characters from all the three pretend towns in the teasers. The date of release has not been announced yet but it will come out this year.
Here is the official synopsis, “A psychological-horror series set in the Stephen King multiverse, Castle Rock combines the mythological scale and intimate character storytelling of King's best-loved works, weaving an epic saga of darkness and light, played out on a few square miles of Maine woodland. The series stars André Holland, Melanie Lynskey, Sissy Spacek, Billy Skarsgård, Jane Levy and Scott Glenn. Sam Shaw & Dustin Thomason developed the project for television and serve as executive producers along with J.J. Abrams, Ben Stephenson and Liz Glotzer. Castle Rock is from Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.”

Some might consider the plague a thing of the past, buried deep in medieval history. But it thrives in Madagascar, where the disease is a seasonal worry.
And this year, the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years: About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August, and 30 people have died as of Tuesday, according to Madagascar's Ministry of Health. Experts say they can't remember the last time the death toll was so high; last year, 63 people died over the course of the year, out of 275 cases.
As a result of the outbreak, Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions. Government authorities ordered two universities to close, and other schools have shut their doors across the country, including the capital, Antananarivo, so that the buildings can be sprayed with insecticides. People are lining up to buy masks, according to media reports, and the World Health Organization is making plans to ship emergency supplies, including antibiotics for treatment, prophylaxis and personal protective equipment.
“We are scared — all of these deaths show that the situation is serious,” Miora Herinjatovo, 55, told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday. They got a mask from a hospital — unlike their husband, who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy. They instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics.
Experts say the outbreak started in late August, when a 31-year-old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe, where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations. While there, they came down with malaria-like symptoms. They died in a taxi home, passing through Antananarivo, the WHO said in a Sept. 28 statement.
The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man, which is evidence of person-to-person transmission. Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him, four became ill and died, the WHO said. Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most-infected cities: As of Sept. 30, Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths, and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths.
If people don't notice fast enough, or don't have access to health care fast enough, they die very quickly. Katharina Kreppel, epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute
Antananarivo has about 1.3 million residents, while Toamasina has about 237,000, according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar.
Public gatherings, including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments, have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading, according to media reports. One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles, who died while visiting the capital for a basketball tournament, according to a WHO report released Thursday.
“Right now, we have the outbreak of a very infectious, fatal disease,” said Katharina Kreppel, an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar. “If people don't notice fast enough, or don't have access to health care fast enough, they die very quickly.”
This plague shares the same bacterium, Yersina pestis, that caused the “Black Death” pandemic in Europe during the 14th century. The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was, until this year, the bubonic plague, spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit, like rats. The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics. But if left untreated, the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, and cause pneumonic plague — a deadly, more infectious form that's now spreading throughout Madagascar. The pneumonic plague, similar to the common cold, is spread through coughing, according to the CDC.
There have been three major plague pandemics: The Justinian Plague, which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541; the “Black Death,” which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe; and the Modern Plague, which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894, according to the CDC. It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites, and rat-associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas.
The plague has since been controlled in most countries with effective insecticides, according to the CDC. And since it can be treated with antibiotics, the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified.
Plague is most commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas which account for more than 95 per cent of reported cases, according to the CDC. Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide, and can see around 600 infections annually.
Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world, with more than 92 per cent of the population living on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank Group. It has lost a substantial portion of international aid and its infrastructure has deteriorated.
Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer, the rat population drops, as they don't have as much food. Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite, and settle on humans.
As an island, Madagascar is home to specific species that transmit the plague and often aren't found anywhere else, Kreppel told The Washington Post.
While Madagascar's scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new, pneumonic plague, the money and resources to do so aren't available, Kreppel said.
There isn't adequate funding for insecticides, spraying equipment or antibiotics, they said, and there aren't enough health facilities to house quarantined patients. The country can't afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages, should the disease spread further, Kreppel said.
“If an outbreak like this happened in the U.S. or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast, because the resources are there,” they said.
The Department of Health and Human Services recommends people between the ages of 18 and 64 get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. (Source: CNN/KCPQ)
(CNN) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say fewer than a quarter of American adults get enough exercise each week.
This is according to the CDC's National Center For Health Statistics.
The Department of Health and Human Services recommends people between the ages of 18 and 64 get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week.
Or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, every week.
They also recommend strength training at least twice a week
According to new data, just 23-percent of adults are meeting that goal
But even that number exceeds the department's "Healthy People 2020" initiative
Its goal is to get just over 20-percent of adults meeting the exercise guidelines by 2020.
As for those who are meeting or exceeding that exercise goal, the study shows a lot of it has to do with where they live.
States with cold weather generally had a larger percentage of active adults than their warmer-weather counterparts
In fact, states in the southeast like Florida, Georgia, and Alabama failed to meet the healthy people 2020 goal.

The broadcaster confirms that Sarah Parish will be reprising their role as Elizabeth Bancroft in another four-part run of the drama
Bancroft will be returning for a second series, ITV has confirmed.

Although Sarah Parish will be reprising their role as Elizabeth Bancroft, other cast have yet to be announced.
The mini series was originally set to air on ITV Encore, but after ITV's original drama Hatton Garden was removed from the schedules, the new series stepped in, and ended up averaging 6.7 million viewers per episode according to ITV.
Series two will once again have four episodes when it returns.
“The new series focuses on Bancroft's continuing success following their promotion to Detective Chief Superintendent,” a statement from ITV explains.
“She's popular with their colleagues, and their crime figures are down. However, their success comes at a price, as she's lonely and estranged from their beloved son Joe and under pressure as a result of their dangerous pact with crime boss Daanish Kamara.
“When Joe is inadvertently dragged into the middle of a double murder case, Bancroft determines to do anything to protect their son and finds themselves up against a chilling new antagonist.”
The new series will go into production in 2018 and will be filmed in Bolton and the North West of England.
Writer and creator Kate Brooke said: “In Bancroft I wanted to explore a contentious anti-hero, a woman we love and loathe in equal measure.
“I'm thrilled to be continuing their story. In this new series the repercussions of their past actions will come back to bite them in ways they could never have expected.”
Catherine Oldfield, Executive Producer for Tall Story Pictures added: “That the audience took to Elizabeth Bancroft in all their terrible, distorted glory in such numbers is fantastic.
“Kate has loads of brilliant twists and turns in store for this new series and I can't wait to see what Sarah and the cast do with them.”

Meanwhile Head of Drama at ITV Polly Hill has said that the second phase of Bancroft's journey “promises to be as intriguing as series one.”
CORVALLIS, Ore. — Brittany McPhee had 18 points and 12 rebounds and scored No. 24 Stanford's last four points as the Cardinal held on for a 60-57 win over No. 16 Oregon State on Friday night.
Stanford (15-8, 9-2 Pac-12) led 51-42 on DiJonai Carrington's layup with 7:58 left in the fourth quarter. Mikayla Pivec made a pair of free throws at 1:17 and Taya Corosdale split a pair at 53 seconds to cut Oregon State's deficit to 59-57.
McPhee made 1 of 2 free throws with 7.7 seconds left and Carrington stole it from Kat Tudor for the final play of the game.
Kiana Williams added 14 points and Alanna Smith scored 11 for the Cardinal, who made just 2 of 19 from 3-point range, but had 17 offensive rebounds and a 44-35 edge on the glass overall.
Katie McWilliams made 4 of 9 from 3-point range and led the Beavers (16-6, 7-4) with 16 points. Pivec added 15 points and Taylor Kalmer scored 12.

Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.
Editor's Note: 2016 was a big year in the church—and in the world. This week we're looking at some of the biggest stories of the year, selected based on feedback from our readers. Thanks for reading Charisma News this year and stay tuned as we continue expanding our coverage in 2017 to include more spiritual insights on the stories that matter most to you.
This article was published May 8th.
Though Christ warned that no one but the Father knows the exact day and hour of Their return, Scripture provides us with myriad signs that illustrate the time is drawing nearer. Here are five key signs of the end times that are making waves right now.
1. "Endless" drought burns forests like kindling
The ongoing California drought has killed more than 12 million trees in its San Bernardino National Forest to date. The danger is compounded by rampant bark beetle infestations and wildfires, both of which take advantage of the trees' water deprivation.
"It is almost certain that millions more trees will die over the course of the upcoming summer as the drought situation continues and becomes ever more long term," biologist Jeffrey Moore, acting regional aerial survey program manager for the U.S. Forest Service, told the Los Angeles Times.
Now four years into the deadly drought, California has approved unprecedented water usage restrictions on businesses, government agencies, and individuals, in a desperate effort to conserve the state's increasingly limited water. But with more than 93 percent of the state experiencing severe, extreme or exceptional drought as measured by the U.S. Drought Monitor, the situation looks dire indeed.
"This is the drought of the century, with greater impact than anything our parents and grandparents experienced," said Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, in a statement.
2. Bird flu outbreak the next step toward a new plague?
Although the burgeoning Ebola epidemic has largely been brought under control (for now), another highly pathogenic virus is just starting to rampage through the American heartland.
The H5 strain of avian flu has infected upward of 20 million birds at dozens of commercial sites from Iowa to Idaho, from California to Arkansas. Though the poultry and egg industry is taking steps to prevent any of the infected birds from entering our food supply, one can only imagine the potential devastation that could be wreaked should some of these infections slip through—potentially triggering the long-feared jump to a strain of the virus inherently infectious to humans.
3. Thousands of starving sea lions mysteriously displaced
A record number of sea lions have washed up, starving and stranded, on southern California shores in recent months. This ghastly phenomenon more than doubles the total of lost sea lions appearing in 2013, the previous worst winter on record for the animals.
Moreover, the record counts don't even include the vast number of dead sea lions, many of which may never be discovered.

Government agencies and news media have blamed the "unusual mortality event" on a confluence of strange events, from warming coastal waters and unseasonably weak ocean winds to abnormal food shortages. Whatever the cause, it is clear that something strange and unprecedented is disturbing the normal flow of this marine ecosystem, and it's growing in intensity.
4. The Altar of the Lord rebuilt in Jerusalem
One of the key unfulfilled elements of end-times prophecy is the rebuilding of the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem. For centuries, the Temple Mount has been occupied by the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and even today, though the site is in the State of Israel, the site is administered by the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a Muslim organization. In short, there are several key barriers that seem to block the way to that particular prophecy being fulfilled.
The Temple Institute is one organization vying for the temple's reconstruction, and it recently undertook an unprecedented step in this prophetic restoration: rebuilding the Altar of the Lord.
"We know that end-time prophecy cannot be fulfilled without the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem," said New York Times best-selling author of The Mystery of the Shemitah and The Harbinger, Jonathan Cahn. "What many people don't realize is that along with the Holy of Holies, the altar of the Temple is the most central and critical part of the Temple."
Though the altar, which was completed in December, would comprise just a portion of the prophesied restored temple, this is just a step in the Temple Institute's overall plan to fulfill Scripture.
In keeping with its stated goal of "do[ing] all in our limited power to bring about the building of the Holy Temple in our time," the organization, and other supporters of the "Temple Movement," are working to bring this prophecy to fruition in the very near future.
5. Microchip implants—the Mark of the Beast?
It has long been surmised that the Mark of the Beast could be electronic in nature, perhaps as an implanted microchip in the hand or forehead, to be used for commerce, identification and access to various elements of life under the Antichrist's rule. Recently, one company in Sweden voluntarily piloted a program that bears eerie similarities to those apocalyptic predictions.
Employees of BioNyfiken are able to unlock doors, access their printing accounts, and pay for lunch with a simple wave of their hand, as scanners read the chip implanted within and identify the user associated with it.
Hannes Sjoblad, BioNyfiken's chief disruption officer, predicts a future in which "big corporates and big government come to us and say everyone should get chipped."
Meanwhile, tech trends expert Faith Popcorn revealed that, "We foresee a future in which everyone will have an implanted chip."

An unusual Android bug found by a Reddit user is causing a lot of people to scratch their heads: When typing "the1975..com" (note the extra dot) the poster found all of their recent text messages displayed through Google instead of the content they were searching for.
Other Reddit users chimed in saying that they were getting the same results, with some even experiencing it when they performed a search for "Vizela viagens" (a travel agency in one Reddit user's home town), and the glitch also appeared with variant spellings too.
Reddit users with a wide variety of Android devices said they were affected as well. Particularly interesting is one comment stating that if you type "my text messages" into the search bar you receive the same result. What this means for how Google may be caching text messages is unknown.
Is it a security risk?
Google has yet to issue a statement regarding the bug, and without some acknowledgement of the issue and its scope it's difficult to know if there is any real risk of data exposure.
More likely is the possibility that the bug is connected to Google Assistant, as pointed out by an article on MSPoweruser: "upon testing, I found out that any Android device with Google Assistant has this issue. It isn't certain if this is a deliberate action by Google or just a weird glitch that [lets] Google access the messages stored on the device."
SEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)
Google Assistant has been able to read text messages aloud for some time, raising the distinct possibility that Google simply overlooked a few precise search terms that would generate the same result.
Those concerned about the privacy and security of their text messages can protect themselves, and the process is easy. Open the Settings app, tap on the Apps option, and then revoke SMS permissions from the Google app.
There's a good chance this isn't anything more than a simple bug, but taking precautions to protect your personal messages is good to do just in case.
The big takeaways for tech leaders:
Android users are reportedly finding their text messages in Google Search results when typing specific things like "the1975..com" or "Vizela viagens." It's not known at this point if there is a security risk inherent in this glitch.
It's more likely that this is a bug tied to Google Assistant's ability to read text messages aloud. If you're still concerned about device security you can disable Google's SMS permissions in the Android Settings app.

Turkish guards at the border with Syria are indiscriminately shooting at and summarily returning asylum seekers attempting to cross into Turkey, Human Rights Watch said. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Syrians were now fleeing heightened violence in the northwestern province of Idlib to seek refuge near Turkey's border, which remains closed to all but critical medical cases.
Of the 16 Syrian refugees who were smuggled into Turkey last year, 13 said that Turkish border guards shot at them and other asylum seekers as they tried to flee Syria
Turkish border guards are firing at the Syrians who attempt to flee the violence and seek refuge in Turkey, an official of the Human Rights Watch said. “Syrian asylum seekers leaving the brutality of Idlib province in northwest Syria are being forced back with bullets and abuse,” CNN quoted Lama Fakih, Deputy Director Human Rights Watch's the Middle East and North Africa division, as saying on Saturday.
About 247,000 Syrians were displaced to the border area from December 15 to January 15, according to the United Nations.”As fighting in Idlib and Afrin displaces thousands more, the number of Syrians trapped along the border willing to risk their lives to reach Turkey is only likely to increase,” Fakih said. Despite the fact that Turkey accommodates more Syrian refugees than any other country in the world, hosting around 3.5 million, Human Rights Watch said: “Turkey's generous hosting of large numbers of Syrians does not absolve it of its responsibility to help those seeking protection at its borders.”The accusation against the Turkish border guards comes amid rising tensions along the Turkey-Syria border as Turkey's military has moved into northern Syria.
Turkey's incursion has opened up another front in the Syrian conflict which is now in its seventh year. Of the 16 Syrian refugees who were smuggled into Turkey last year, 13 said that Turkish border guards shot at them and other asylum seekers as they tried to flee Syria. Of 16 Syrian refugees HRW spoke to, 13 alleged that Turkish border guards had shot toward them or other fleeing asylum seekers as they tried to cross while still in Syria, killing 10 people, including one child, and injuring several more.
PHOENIX — Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake's re-election race is becoming a case study in the GOP's convulsions between the establishment, a furious base and angry donors.
After bucking Donald Trump in a state the president won, Flake is bottoming out in polls. Yet Republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.
A White House search for a candidate to replace former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. And now conservatives want to turn Arizona into the latest example of a Trump Train outsider taking down a member of the GOP establishment.
“People are fooling themselves if they think Jeff Flake is anything but a walking dead member of the United State Senate,” said Andy Surabian, whose Great America Alliance is backing Ward.
“I don't see how they survive a primary. I don't see how they survive a general. The numbers just don't add up,” added Surabian, who worked at the White House as an adviser to Steve Bannon, then the president's top strategist.
Despite discontent among some Republicans over Ward, Bannon met with them last week at a conservative conference in Colorado Springs to encourage their campaign, according to a Republican official who demanded anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.
Ward unsuccessfully challenged Arizona's senior senator, John McCain, in last year's election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. But in Flake, they would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the GOP establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by Republicans' failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap Barack Obama's health care law.
Flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. Yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-Trump GOP voters, he's all but dared them to take them down by kicking off their campaign with an anti-Trump manifesto, “Conscience of a Conservative,” a book in which they bemoaned their party's failure to stand up to Trump in last year's presidential race.
“We pretended that the emperor wasn't naked,” Flake wrote.
Trump, in turn, has lashed out at Flake on Twitter, calling them “toxic,” while praising Ward. White House officials say there's little chance Trump will have a change of heart over supporting Flake. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said Trump is irritated not only by Flake's public criticism, but by what Trump sees as the senator's attempts to use their critiques of the president to gain attention.
Nevertheless, Flake, 54, insists they won't be getting out of the race. The primary is Aug. 29.
“We always knew we would have a tough primary. We always knew we would have a tough general,” Flake said in a brief interview at the Capitol. Asked about Trump's opposition, Flake smiled and said, “There's a long time between now and next August.”
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has protected vulnerable GOP senators in the past, but their ability to do so in the future was thrown into question last month by Sen. Luther Strange's loss to rabble-rousing Roy Moore in a runoff in Alabama. A McConnell-aligned super PAC had spent around $9 million to help Strange.
Trump was encouraged by McConnell and others to back Strange, a decision which they reportedly now regrets and which only added to the frictions between the president and the Senate leader. Flake's candidacy could provide occasion for yet more conflict between the two, given the possibility that they will be on opposite sides in the primary.
Adding to Flake's problems, donations to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP campaign arm, have dried up after the “Obamacare” failure. Some donors say they intend to withhold money from incumbent senators like Flake until they start delivering on Trump's agenda, a strategy encouraged privately by some top White House officials.
“Donors are going to start cutting off funding for all senators until they get Trump's initiatives passed,” said Roy Bailey, a Trump supporter and fundraiser in Texas. “I think there's a real kind of movement going around that is catching momentum.”
Flake's campaign points to strong fundraising numbers and upcoming events including a fundraising visit Monday by Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio. But Flake can't even count on support from fellow members of their Arizona delegation. GOP Rep. Trent Franks demurred when asked if they would be supporting Flake for re-election
“I'm probably not going to, for a lot of reasons, not going to address that,” Franks said. “Obviously Sen. Flake knows how profoundly bewildered and disappointed I was with their actions that, in the general election last year, if everyone had followed that line of reasoning would have resulted in Hillary Clinton's election.”
Franks' name is one of several that have circulated as potential primary challengers to Flake, along with Rep. Paul Gosar, state university board member Jay Heiler and former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham. Several Republicans said the White House has been searching for some alternative to Ward.
Yet Ward shows no sign of stepping aside, and another consideration, usually unspoken, is McCain's brain cancer which will likely mean another vacant Senate seat at some point in the future.
Ward's erratic history, which causes mainline Republicans to view them as damaged goods, is underscored by comments they made after McCain's July cancer diagnosis where they urged them to step down and suggested they should be considered to replace him.
“Look, you see what their numbers were in the McCain race – I don't know what would make us think different now,” said Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Ariz. Whichever Republican emerges from the primary will likely face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, seen as a strong candidate.
It's all adding to a season of trouble for GOP senators like Flake and Dean Heller of Nevada, who also faces a primary challenge from the right. The good news for Senate Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority, is that they have an extremely favourable map next year that has them defending only two genuinely endangered incumbents, Flake and Heller, while Democrats are on defence in 10 states Trump won.

Werner reported from Washington.
Andy Carroll has distanced themselves from reports linking them to a big-money move to China, insisting they want to stay with West Ham.
Striker Carroll was linked with a £20million move to the Chinese Super League that reportedly would have paid them wages of £300,000-a-week earlier this year.
But the 27-year-old insists they feel settled with West Ham having been with the club since their initial loan move from Liverpool in 2012, which became permanent the following year.
"No, no - I don't know where that came from," Carroll said to Sky Sports about the China links.
"I'm very happy, I'm settled. Obviously in the past I've done a lot of things and I have settled down here.
"I think it is great, I love the club. I think the staff, fans, players, and the area that I live, everything is perfect. I have settled in pretty well and I'm enjoying it."
Carroll is preparing for Manchester United's visit to London Stadium on Monday, with 13th-placed West Ham aiming for a third consecutive home victory having initially struggled at their new ground.
"It was tough at the beginning," they added.
"Now we are getting a few games there, the lads are starting to like it, the fans are warming to it. It is a fantastic stadium and a great place to play.
"We would like to start the year off obviously with a win, it would be good for us. It is going to be a tough game."
NFF appeals to Nigeria Police on late Douglas Uzama
The Nigeria Football Federation has called on the Nigeria Police to intensify efforts to fish out the killers of former Nigeria youth international Douglas Uzama, who was killed in Benin City on Thursday, 29th December 2016.
The Gombe United FC player was said to have been murdered in the capital of Edo State where they had gone to celebrate the yuletide with their family.
NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi said at the weekend that the Federation was in deep grief over the manner of death of the former Golden Eaglet and Flying Eagle.
“Only two months ago, we had a similar case of a player of Shooting Stars FC of Ibadan (Izu Joseph) who was murdered in cold blood in Rivers State.
“We are really worried about this trend and we use this opportunity to call on the Police to hunt down and arrest the killers of Uzama, as well as intensify efforts in their search for the killers of Izu Joseph.”

Congressman Shot at Congressional Baseball Practice, Suspect Dead
by Rashad Snell
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot Wednesday at a congressional baseball practice, congressional officials say.
Rep. Mo Brooks, (R-Ala.), said several other people also were hit, including two law enforcement officers.
President Donald Trump says they and the vice president are “deeply saddened” by news of a shooting “tragedy” at a congressional baseball game.
The president said in a statement Wednesday that “the Vice President and I are aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely.”
President Donald Trump says the assailant in the congressional shooting has died from their injuries. The assailant has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson.
Trump says, “We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected.”
Trump praised the “heroic actions” of the Capital Police at the scene.

But since Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was removed from power in 2014, the state-owned factory, known as Yuzhmash, has fallen on hard times. The Russians canceled upgrades of their nuclear fleet. The factory is underused, awash in unpaid bills and low morale. Experts believe it is the most likely source of the engines that in July powered the two ICBM tests, which were the first to suggest that North Korea has the range, if not necessarily the accuracy or warhead technology, to threaten American cities.
“It's likely that these engines came from Ukraine — probably illicitly,” Mr. Elleman said in an interview. “The big question is how many they have and whether the Ukrainians are helping them now. I'm very worried.”
Bolstering their conclusion, they added, was a finding by United Nations investigators that North Korea tried six years ago to steal missile secrets from the Ukrainian complex. Two North Koreans were caught, and a U.N. report said the information they tried to steal was focused on advanced “missile systems, liquid-propellant engines, spacecraft and missile fuel supply systems.”
Investigators now believe that, amid the chaos of post-revolutionary Ukraine, Pyongyang tried again.
Mr. Elleman's detailed analysis is public confirmation of what intelligence officials have been saying privately for some time: The new missiles are based on a technology so complex that it would have been impossible for the North Koreans to have switched gears so quickly themselves. They apparently fired up the new engine for the first time in September — meaning that it took only 10 months to go from that basic milestone to firing an ICBM, a short time unless they were able to buy designs, hardware and expertise on the black market.
The White House had no comment when asked about the intelligence assessments.
Last month, Yuzhmash denied reports that the factory complex was struggling for survival and selling its technologies abroad, in particular to China. Its website says the company does not, has not and will not participate in “the transfer of potentially dangerous technologies outside Ukraine.”
American investigators do not believe that denial, though they say there is no evidence that the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko, who recently visited the White House, had any knowledge or control over what was happening inside the complex. How the Russian-designed engines, called the RD-250, got to North Korea is still a mystery.

Mr. Elleman was unable to rule out the possibility that a large Russian missile enterprise, Energomash, which has strong ties to the Ukrainian complex, had a role in the transfer of the RD-250 engine technology to North Korea. They said leftover RD-250 engines might also be stored in Russian warehouses.

But the fact that the powerful engines did get to North Korea, despite a raft of United Nations sanctions, suggests a broad intelligence failure involving the many nations that monitor Pyongyang.
Since President Barack Obama ordered a step-up in sabotage against the North's missile systems in 2014, American officials have closely monitored their success. They appeared to have won a major victory last fall, when Mr. Kim ordered an end to flight tests of the Musudan, an intermediate-range missile that was a focus of the American sabotage effort.
But no sooner had Mr. Kim ordered a stand-down of that system than the North rolled out engines of a different design. And those tests were more successful.
American officials will not say when they caught on to the North's change of direction. But there is considerable evidence they came to it late.
Leon Panetta, the former C.I.A. director, said on CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the North Korean drive to get workable ICBMs that could be integrated with nuclear weapons moved more quickly than the intelligence community had expected.
“The rapid nature of how they've been able to come to that capability is something, frankly, that has surprised both the United States and the world,” they said.
It is unclear who is responsible for selling the rockets and the design knowledge, and intelligence officials have differing theories about the details. But Mr. Elleman makes a strong circumstantial case that would implicate the deteriorating factory complex and its underemployed engineers.

“I feel for those guys,” said Mr. Elleman, who visited the factory repeatedly a decade ago while working on federal projects to curb weapon threats. “They don't want to do bad things.”
Dnipro has been called the world's fastest-shrinking city. The sprawling factory, southeast of Kiev and once a dynamo of the Cold War, is having a hard time finding customers.

American intelligence officials note that North Korea has exploited the black market in missile technology for decades, and built an infrastructure of universities, design centers and factories of its own.
It has also recruited help: In 1992, officials at a Moscow airport stopped a team of missile experts from traveling to Pyongyang.

That was only a temporary setback for North Korea. It obtained the design for the R-27, a compact missile made for Soviet submarines, created by the Makeyev Design Bureau, an industrial complex in the Ural Mountains that employed the rogue experts apprehended at the Moscow airport.
But the R-27 was complicated, and the design was difficult for the North to copy and fly successfully.
Eventually, the North turned to an alternative font of engine secrets — the Yuzhmash plant in Ukraine, as well as its design bureau, Yuzhnoye. The team's engines were potentially easier to copy because they were designed not for cramped submarines but roomier land-based missiles. That simplified the engineering.
Economically, the plant and design bureau faced new headwinds after Russia in early 2014 invaded and annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine. Relations between the two nations turned icy, and Moscow withdrew plans to have Yuzhmash make new versions of the SS-18 missile.
In July 2014, a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warned that such economic upset could put Ukrainian missile and atomic experts “out of work and could expose their crucial know-how to rogue regimes and proliferators.”
The first clues that a Ukrainian engine had fallen into North Korean hands came in September when Mr. Kim supervised a ground test of a new rocket engine that analysts called the biggest and most powerful to date.

Norbert Brügge, a German analyst, reported that photos of the engine firing revealed strong similarities between it and the RD-250, a Yuzhmash model.

Football legend Pelé has reportedly blamed strike action for missing a second appointment to testify in defence of Carlos Nuzman as part of the bribery investigation surrounding Rio de Janeiro's victory in the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic bidding contest.
Pelé, the 77-year-old three-time World Cup winner, had already missed one appointment with Judge Marcelo Bretas on health grounds.
According to O'Globo, they have claimed that they were unable to leave São Paulo, where they live, to provide testimony via videoconference from Santos due to strike action in the city.
Pelé was a key campaigning figure for Rio's successful bid in the latter stages of the contest in 2009.
This included an appearance in the decisive International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Copenhagen when the city beat Madrid by 66 votes to 32 in the third round of a contest also featuring Tokyo and Chicago.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in Brazil is in the process of investigating payments of at least $2 million (£1.5 million/€1.7 million) supposedly distributed to then-International Association of Athletics Federations President Lamine Diack from Brazilian business person Arthur Cesar de Menezes Soares Filho shortly before the vote in the Danish capital.
It is alleged that this money was used to secure the votes of four IOC members.
Ex-Rio 2016 and Brazilian Olympic Committee President Nuzman is under investigation in connection with the alleged bribes, but denies wrongdoing.

There is no suggestion that Pelé was aware or involved in wrongdoing but they are one of many figures involved in the bid called by Nuzman's team as part of their defence.
Others include former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, another figure present in Copenhagen who was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison last year for accepting bribes from an engineering firm in return for assistance in winning contracts with state oil company Petrobras.
According to O'Globo, Lula, who was President of Brazil from 2003 until 2011, will testify to Bretas via videoconference at 10am on June 5.
It is not yet clear if a fresh date has been arranged for Pelé to testify.
 They are expected to attend the FIFA World Cup in Russia which starts next month after being given doctor's clearance to travel following their health problems.

A man who was late was caught driving at almost twice the speed limit.
Matthew Simpson, 41, of Salmon Leap in Chester, was on their way to pick up their son from their ex-wife's home - and they had to leave to catch a flight.
A police camera van caught them driving their Mercedes on the A494 Mold By-Pass at Broncoed Isaf at 8.39am on July 3 last year at almost twice the speed limit - 110 mph - explained prosecutor Alun Williams at Flintshire magistrates' court at Mold.
Simpson, a team leader, admitted the speeding by letter on an earlier occasion and the case was adjourned until Tuesday for magistrates to consider a disqualification.
It was dealt with in their absence when they did not attend and they were banned from driving for 56 days, fined £400 with £85 costs and a £40 surcharge.
GRAY RAPIDS, N.B. — Two people are dead after the raft they were in overturned on New Brunswick's Miramichi River.
RCMP Sgt. Brent Johnston says eight friends were rafting down the river in Gray Rapids, N.B., on Tuesday shortly after 4 p.m. when it flipped.
Johnston says six people made it to shore on their own, and a 29-year-old woman from White Rapids, N.B., was pulled from the water by first responders and given CPR.
They were taken to hospital, where they were pronounced dead.
Johnston says the body of a 55-year-old man from White Rapids was found a short time later.
They say foul play is not suspected.
Johnston says they don't believe the current was flowing rapidly at the time of the incident, but an investigation is being conducted to determine what caused the raft to overturn.
This kitty is looking for employment opportunities in a barn or warehouse.  They are a 5-year-old feral cat that was spayed a few years ago. “Unfortunately they cannot go back to their home territory and they have not warmed up to us, so we are looking to rehome them as a barn cat,” per shelter staff.
For more information about their or other cats and dogs available for adoption, visit the Trumbull Animal Shelter, 324 Church Hill Road, or call 203-452-5088.
Seeking donations
The Trumbull Animal Shelter is always in need of the following items: Canned cat food, clay cat litter, large rawhide, Kong or Nylabones for larger breed dogs. They can be dropped off at the Trumbull Animal Shelter.
One Lagos Fiesta: Revellers welcome 2017 with pomp
From the Eko Atlantic in Victoria Island to various capacity arenas in Ikorodu, Badagry, Epe and Agege, the funfair was the same with a long list of artistes performing to the delight of fans for free.
But the climax of the events, tagged One Lagos Fiesta, created the loudest echo across the state with cross-over excitement, musical flare, energized dancing and bellows of fireworks with which the New Year was ushered in.
Lagos has maintained this annual tradition that has endeared residents in the Lagos communities to contemporary entertainment during the Yuletide.
The initiative introduced by the government of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode last year, was part of their Tourism, Hospitality, Entertainment/Arts Sports for Excellence (T.H.E.S.E) project.
The event was supported by various companies, including indigenous telecommunications company, Globacom.
At the dot of crossover, the city joined the rest of the world to say goodbye to 2016 and welcome the New Year with fanfare at the end of the 8-day long event. Governor Ambode who was live at the Eko Atlantic venue gave a message of hope for a better 2017, urging residents of the state to remain resolute in the face of challenges.
The governor who was at the Badagry venue few days back promised to build a state-of-the-art cinema in Badagry within the next 18 months. The construction of the cinema, they said, would create employment opportunities for youths, while also boosting the tourism potential of the region.
Artistes at the various shows who were drawn from different genres include the Mavin team, MI, Phyno, Reminisce, Lil Kesh, Seriki, Mayorkun, Adekunle Gold, Olu Maintain, Dremo, Niniola, Idris Abdulkareem, Kenny Saint Best, Azadus, Tony Tetuila, Jazzman Olofin, Klever Jay, Wale Thompson, Minjin, Lanre Teriba, Busola Oke (Eleyele), Oluwaseun Rantiola, CDQ, Dammy Krane and Konga among others.

Melania Trump Just Showed Critics How Much Their Opinion Matters To Her- I APPLAUD HER!
Stop the presses! Melania wore heels again!
Before boarding Air Force One to visit Puerto Rico with their husband, Melania Trump was photographed wearing black or navy high heels paired with a relaxed pant and sweater. That monster! And the faux outrage began.

Melania was first targeted by outraged liberals looking for any reason to insult the Trumps when they boarded Air Force One back in August wearing black stilettos. Of course, when they got off the plane they can be changed into a more casual black pant with a white blouse and white sneakers along with a super cute FLOTUS-branded baseball hat.

If wearing heels hours before attending a dressed-down event is “out of touch” then I'm out for the count. Love me, love my shoes. I'm short, so it's probably a hate crime if you ever insulted me for misusing footwear before visiting a disaster zone.
This time, just like the last time, when they landed they were dressed down in an outfit finished by Timberland boots. Of course, nothing was good enough for the fainting masses looking for any reason to insult her, with social media users mocking them for wearing the boots “as if she's going to go work in Puerto Rico.” Well, maybe they were looking to work after the Teamster's union members decided to not show up to work to help distribute the relief items sent to the territory.

Some of the tweets don't even make sense. “lol Melania is wearing white jeans and Timbs in Puerto Rico.” Was they supposed to go naked? None of you will ever be happy with what she's wearing, so there's no use in pleasing you. But there is use in making you mad, because your outrage helps to focus back on the Trumps.
lol Melania is wearing white jeans and Timbs in Puerto Rico — halloween sucks (@kath_krueger) October 3, 2017
USA Today said that Melania's high heeled antics showed “she [had] no intention of physically digging into the problem of disaster relief,” which is a nonsense phrase. They casually said that their heels “left many feeling they were out of touch with the difficulties.” They don't really cite how many people constituted the “many” who had “feelings” that Melania was a certain way. If heels is what turns them away from Melania, they were never going to vote for their husband in the first place.
Last October after the “Grab em by the p***y” tape was released, Melania Trump trolled the media by showing up wearing a pink “pussy bow” style shirt from Gucci. The “pussy bow” style has a neat, loose little bow around its high collared neck. Melania spent years working as a fashion model, so there's no getting around that this was a deliberate choice.

Under the restrictions, residents or landholders seeking to burn vegetation will not be granted permits.
Permits previously issued in the specified areas during the restriction period will also be cancelled.
Rural Fire Service Acting Assistant Commissioner Gary McCormack said the restrictions were intended to prevent smoke and ash affecting Games venues and transport corridors.
"Fortunately, recent rainfall has helped to increase soil moisture and bless us with a green landscape,” Mr McCormack said.
Fire permit restrictions will be imposed from 12.01am next Monday, March 26, to 11.59pm Friday, April 20 in the Gympie, Noosa, Sunshine Coast, Moreton Bay, Brisbane, Redland, Logan, Scenic Rim, Ipswich, Gold Coast, Lockyer Valley, Somerset, Toowoomba and Southern Downs Local Government Areas.

"This means the bushfire threat in the coming weeks is low. However, we will impose fire permit restrictions as a precautionary measure to further minimise the risk of a fire taking hold.”
Mr McCormack said some fires would still be permitted under the restrictions, including fires less than two metres in any direction.
"A fire lit outdoors for the purpose of cooking or warmth is also permitted, as long as it is enclosed in a fireplace constructed to stop the fire escaping,” they said.
”Campfires go hand-in-hand with camping and we know that many people like to escape to the bush or beach on a camping trip at this time of year.

"The key is to ensure you start, maintain and extinguish your campfire safely and correctly.
"Never leave a campfire unattended and always use water to extinguish it.”
Other fires permitted within the restriction period are fires lit for the purpose of burning the carcass of a beast and fires lit at a sawmill for the purpose of burning sawdust or other residue resulting from the operation of a sawmill.

Who's Able-Bodied Anyway? The 400-year history of how we talk about the deserving versus the undeserving poor. Image Credit Cristóbal Schmal
The “able-bodied” are now everywhere among government programs for the poor, Republican officials point out. They're on food stamps. They're collecting welfare. They're living in subsidized housing. And their numbers have swelled on Medicaid, a program that critics say was never designed to serve them.
These so-called able-bodied are defined in many ways by what they are not: not disabled, not elderly, not children, not pregnant, not blind. They are effectively everyone left, and they have become the focus of resurgent conservative proposals to overhaul government aid, such as one announced last month by the Trump administration that would allow states to test work requirements for Medicaid.
Able-bodied is not truly a demographic label, though: There is no standard for physical or mental ability that makes a person able. Rather, the term has long been a political one. Across centuries of use, it has consistently implied another negative: The able-bodied could work, but are not working (or working hard enough). And, as such, they don't deserve our aid.
“Within that term is this entire history of debates about the poor who can work but refuse to, because they're lazy,” said Susannah Ottaway, a historian of social welfare at Carleton College in Minnesota. “To a historian, to see this term is to understand its very close association with debates that center around the need to morally reform the poor.”
In Washington, “able-bodied” has retained its moral connotations but lost much of its historical context. The term dates back 400 years, when English lawmakers used it the same way, to separate poor people who were physically incapable of supporting themselves from the poor who ought to be able to. Debates over poverty in America today follow a direct line from that era.
“The basic point is that the physical distinction always implies a moral one, and that's why politicians use it,” said Steve Hindle, the interim president and director of research at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif. They find it not surprising but “profoundly sad” that so few politicians think about the lineage of the term.
Historians trace America's welfare system to England's 1601 poor law, which required local communities to collect taxes and distribute aid to the poor. But only the “impotent poor” — those truly powerless to support themselves — were to receive aid. The “able-bodied” were to be put to work.
Public debate about the poor, Mr. Hindle said, has centered ever since on a set of opposites: the deserving versus the undeserving, the idle versus the industrious, the able-bodied versus the old and sick. Over time, the English came to recognize a third class: the able-bodied who were blocked from work for reasons beyond their bodies, such as a shortage of available jobs. But even then, as today, structural problems and personal failings proved hard to separate.
Under Elizabethan poor law, the job of making these distinctions went to church wardens and parish overseers, people who lived in the community.
Today, we've constructed vast and expensive government bureaucracies to draw these lines. Kentucky, for instance, has outlined a number of exemptions to its new requirements that able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries must work and pay small premiums. Former foster care youths and pregnant women don't have to pay insurance premiums. The evicted and the homeless won't be locked out from coverage if they miss their payments. People who are “medically frail” with serious ailments can postpone their work requirements with a doctor's note.
Such exemptions sketch new definitions of who is truly able. And they erect more elaborate barriers to assistance as another way of winnowing out the unworthy. Eighteenth-century English overseers tried establishing rules (“nobody who tipples in the alehouse will get poor relief”). Requirements today that the poor take drug tests or pay $1 monthly premiums effectively do the same: “If you can't figure out who is or isn't deserving,” Ms. Ottoway wrote in an email, “then you can make rules about behavior that will force the poor to reveal themselves as worthy or not.”
By narrowing aid, proposals like Kentucky's — and Indiana's Medicaid work requirement, approved Friday — reverse the more recent history in which Medicaid has steadily expanded access. The program began in 1965 with Elizabethan notions intact. It initially served the elderly poor, the blind and the disabled, as well as pregnant women. Over time it came to cover more parents and children. Eligibility was extended to poor women with breast or cervical cancer. In the 1990s, some states began offering coverage on a broader basis — simply according to income.
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act sought to make that policy experiment universal. It required all states to expand coverage to everyone earning below or just above the poverty line. (The Supreme Court later made the change optional, so now 32 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to expand.) Millions of nondisabled adults have joined the program in recent years, driving down the rate of Americans without health insurance and increasing Medicaid's ranks.
“It's a clear sequence from 1965 to 2010, where ‘able-bodiedness,' ‘worthy poor' is being written out of the statute,” said Leonardo Cuello, the health policy director at the National Health Law Program, a legal advocacy group that is bringing a lawsuit against the Kentucky Medicaid proposal. “And that comes to its full completion in 2010, where able-bodiedness is explicitly irrelevant.”
For Medicaid advocates like Mr. Cuello, the recent focus on the able-bodied feels like an anachronism.
To others who use the term, it captures how Americans of both parties feel about poverty today. In one 2016 survey by the American Enterprise Institute and The Los Angeles Times, 87 percent of people said it's better to require people to seek work or participate in a training program “if they are physically able to do so” (9 percent countered that it's better to give the poor benefits “without asking for any effort in return”).
“Free riders threaten society — they undermine the basis of altruism,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped write a work requirement into welfare reform in the 1990s. That's not a liberal or conservative belief, they argue, but a human one. “People want to be compassionate, but they don't want to be taken advantage of.”
Robert Doar, a scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, suggests that conservatives are also less likely to write off the poor as unable to contribute, or to dismiss entry-level jobs as dead ends.
“The barriers that prevent people from going to work are real,” said Mr. Doar, who served as an administrator of social services in New York State and in the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York City. “But if you start from the premise that those barriers are insurmountable, I think you really won't be helping people escape poverty.”
Just five years ago, Cindy Mann, who ran Medicaid in the Obama administration and is now a partner at the consultancy Manatt Health, said they seldom heard the term able-bodied in connection with Medicaid. Its ubiquity today — in news conferences from the White House podium, in think tank reports, in news articles — suggests that its adherents have been effective in an important way. “Able-bodied” has lately come to feel technical, not ideological; objective, not judgmental. This language has nudged its way into how many people, not just House Speaker Paul Ryan, speak.
And despite our borrowing it from Elizabethan England, its assumptions feel deeply American.
“To me, there is something about this that gets right to the heart of a lot of central myths about America,” said Sarah Handley-Cousins, a historian who has written about nearly identical debates over who deserved pensions after the Civil War. Americans pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Work is a moral endeavor. Those who work hard get ahead. “And people get very suspicious and get very angry,” Ms. Handley-Cousin said, “about the idea that some people aren't doing that.”
Absent all its context, however, “able-bodied” is an odd term for an era when so much work isn't physical in nature. Today, a blind person who is categorically eligible for aid could well do work that a person with depression — and who is “able-bodied” — could not.
And this part is most curious: While these words were explicitly cited in the legislation that established Elizabethan poor law, they barely exist in the statutes and guidelines governing American aid today. The food stamp program does identify a group called “able-bodied adults without dependents.” But Medicaid makes no mention of them.
“It has no basis in the law or the program,” Ms. Mann said. “I think it's a political term, and I think it's used pejoratively, and I think it's quite intentional when it's used.”
It's used, they say, to imply that the newest group of people who receive Medicaid don't deserve it.

WRENTHAM, Mass. — Police have found a carrier full of kittens they say were “steaming hot” on the side of a Massachusetts highway.
WCVB-TV reports two drivers called police and animal control Tuesday when they noticed a cat carrier on the side of Interstate 495.
Police said the five kittens inside were brought to King Phillip Animal Rescue in Plainville.
The kittens appear to be fine, but one's condition is unclear. The carrier was in the sun for an unknown length of time before being reported.
The kittens are so small that they're being syringe- and bottle-fed for the next two weeks. People are encouraged to donate kitten formula to the rescue effort.
Police are seeking the public's help in identifying who left the carrier on the side of the highway.

Transcript for The man who triggered a false missile alarm in Hawaii is speaking out for the first time
We start this half hour with the man would trigger a mass panic in Hawaii now speaking out. They mistakenly sent out a warning of an impending missile attack. Good morning, Marci. They feel so terrible that in the week since they have barely been able to eat or sleep. But they tell us they do not believe the mistake was their fault. For the first time since the widespread panic sparked by that false missile warning that went out across Hawaii, the former emergency management employee who sent out the alert publicly explaining their respective on how it happened. Well, at the time I was 100% sure that it was the right decision. Reporter: Asking we hide their identity they say they had just started their shift when the emergency call came into their office, a preliminary federal investigation said the recorded message began and ended with the words exercise, exercise, exercise. But the former employee says they never heard that. In the middle of the message it said this is not a drill then at the end I didn't hear exercise either because it was just an unannounced drill, unplanned and kind of spriz thing where, you know, the sup supervisors weren't there. They believed it was are real and followed their training saying it wasn't until moments later they realized the mistake. It was just a body blow for me. It was very, very difficult, very emotional. I felt terrible. We all did our best to try to remedy the situation. Reporter: But it took nearly 40 minutes for the alert to be retracted. The former employee blames what happened on a failure of the system that cost them their job of more than 11 years and led to death threats insisting they are not to blame. There's been problems with the procedures and the equipment and lack of training I think that the military should handle this, not the state. Reporter: A preliminary federal report says the employee who sent out the alert confused drills with real-life situations in the past which they adamantly deny, still they say they have learned a lot from this. Dan and Paula. I think a lot of people are learning a lot from this. Marci, thank you very much.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three women who have previously accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment are sharing their stories on NBC's “Megyn Kelly Today.”
Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey and Rachel Crooks on Monday told of alleged harassment by Trump spanning decades.
The White House called the claims false and “totally disputed in most cases.” It said “the timing and absurdity of these false claims speak volumes.”
One of the accusers, Rachel Crooks, called the White House statement “laughable.”
Crooks says of sexual misconduct: “I think politicians seem to be immune to this.”
The women, who first shared their stories before the November 2016 election, were holding a press conference later Monday to call for a congressional investigation into Trump's alleged behavior.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) members were left embarrassed after a blunder occurred during an event in Beijing held to announce the entry of India and Pakistan into the organisation.
During the SCO summit at Beijing headquarters, the organisers displayed the Red Fort of India with the Indian flag as Shalimar Gardens of Pakistan in the tableau of Pakistan.
Apparently, the organisers of the summit failed to cross-check the crucial facts and mistakenly showed the Indian monument with tricolour in the name of Pakistan.
Apart from the SCO members, the faux pas occurred in the presence of Indian ambassador Vijay Gokhale, Pakistan's Masood Khalid and the Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, who were also present at the event.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is an Eurasian political, economic, and security organisation which consists of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
The induction of India and Pakistan into the organisation was announced during the Astana Summit last week.
FRISCO, Texas — Long snapper L.P. Ladouceur has re-signed with the Dallas Cowboys, the team they initially joined after a workout in 2005.
Ladouceur will be going into their 14th season, the second-longest tenure among current Cowboys. They have played in 205 consecutive games and made 1,875 snaps without a miscue.
The only current Dallas player with the team longer is 11-time Pro Bowl tight end Jason Witten, who was a third-round pick in the 2003 draft.
Last year Witten matched the franchise record by playing their 15th season with the Cowboys. The 35-year-old Witten is already signed for their 16th season in 2018.
Ladouceur went to the Pro Bowl in 2014. Last season marked the completion of a five-year contract extension.

A Tampa nightclub has accused Chris Brown of assaulting its house photographer during a paid celebrity appearance. It's the latest bad headline for Brown, who recently took to Instagram to deny an unflattering Billboard report in which associates described them as struggling with drug addiction, prone to anger, and frequently abusive to staff.
According to TMZ, Brown and their entourage arrived at Tampa's Aja Channelside club around 1:30 a.m. Monday morning. Their crew reportedly asked for no photos, but shortly after, Brown apparently spotted the club photographer taking photos, and allegedly punched them in the face. (The photographer's name has not been released.)
There's cellphone video footage of the incident, though the club is dark and the action is difficult to make out. According to TMZ, Brown is wearing the red shirt, while the man in yellow is their bodyguard. The photographer is apparently standing in the shadows to the left of the projection screen.
In a Facebook statement, Aja Channelside said its staff is pressing charges. Brown is currently on tour. He's set to appear at a Miami nightclub tonight, and at a concert in Jacksonville, Florida tomorrow.
Read Aja Channelside's account of last night's incident below.
Update, 5:45 p.m.: The Tampa Police Department has shared a brief report on last night's call at Aja Channelside.
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Pakistan's military says a roadside bombing has killed at least two soldiers and wounded three in the country's northwestern tribal region that borders Afghanistan.
A military statement says that Wednesday's bombing took place in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan.
It says the bomb exploded as a vehicle ferrying soldiers drove near it. The casualties were transported to a military hospital in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The tribal region was a sanctuary for militants until several massive military operations claimed to have pushed them out of the safe havens. The army claims to have cleared the area but militants in North Waziristan sporadically strike back, targeting security forces.
From their rough-hewn, rambling music, you wouldn't immediately take Steve Gunn for a Smiths fan, but apparently he's been a devotee since their days as an introspective adolescent in the Philadelphia suburbs. The former Kurt Vile sideman recently tackled two songs by their teen heroes–“This Night Has Opened My Eyes” and “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle”–for Aquarium Drunkard's “Lagniappe Sessions” series of low-key recordings.
It's easier to imagine Gunn nerding out over Johnny Marr's sparkly guitar arpeggios than it is to think about them tearfully reciting Morrissey lyrics, and Gunn's performances here reveal Marr's subtle influence on their own playing. “Marr's arrangements mystified me, transfixed me,” Gunn wrote in a short essay that accompanies the songs. “It felt that they were something I'd never be able to decipher.” Hear the songs at Aquarium Drunkard.
12 dead, dozens injured in London tower fire
A blaze engulfed a 24-story housing block in central London yesterday, trapping residents as they slept and killing no fewer than 12 people.
The fire brigade said the inferno was unprecedented in its scale and speed.
More than 200 firefighters, backed up by 40 fire engines, fought for hours to try to control the blaze, London's deadliest in a generation.
The Grenfell Tower apartment block was home to about 600 people.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the fire raised questions about the safety of such high-rise blocks, and the BBC reported that the scale of the disaster could delay Prime Minister Theresa May's announcement of a parliamentary deal to stay in power.
Some residents screamed for help from behind upper-floor windows, others tried to throw children to safety, as flames raced through the block of about 120 apartments in the North Kensington district just before 1 a.m.
Firefighters said they had rescued 65 people – some in pyjamas – from the 43-year-old block, a low-rent housing estate overlooking upscale parts of the Kensington area.
“We could see a lot of children and parents screaming for ‘Help! Help! Help!' and putting their hands on the window and asking to help them,” Amina Sharif told Reuters.
“We could do nothing and we could see the stuff on the side was falling off, collapsing. We were just standing screaming and they were screaming.”
Another witness, Saimar Lleshi, saw people tying together sheets to try to escape.
“I saw three people putting sheets together to climb down, but no one climbed down. I don't know what happened to them. Even when the lights went off, people were waving with white shirts to be seen,” Lleshi said.
The fire sent up plumes of smoke that could be seen from miles away. The ambulance service said 68 people were being treated in hospital, with 18 in critical condition.
More than 16 hours after the fire started, crews were still trying to douse flames as they sought to reach the top floors.
But London police commander Stuart Cundy told reporters they did not believe further survivors would be found in the building.
At a nearby community center used to house some of those rescued, tensions were rising as occupants waited for news. “The fire, which was unprecedented in its scale and speed, will be subject to a full fire investigation,” said Steve Apter from the London Fire Brigade.
“Any lessons learnt from this will be borne out not just across London, across the UK – and lessons learnt globally.”
The emergency services said it was too early to say what had caused the inferno, which left the block a charred, smoking shell. Some residents said no alarm had sounded. Others said they had warned repeatedly about fire safety in the block.
The building had recently undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11.08 million) exterior refurbishment, which included new external cladding and windows.
Residents who escaped told how they woke up to the smell of burning and rushed to leave through smoke-filled corridors and stairwells.
There were reports that some leapt out of windows. Other witnesses spoke of children including a baby being thrown to safety from high windows.
Tamara, one witness, told the BBC: “There's people, like, throwing their kids out, ‘Just save my children, just save my children!'”.
Prime Minister May said their thoughts were with all those affected. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said sprinkler systems should be installed in such blocks and called on the government to make a statement in parliament.
Khan, the London mayor, said questions needed to be answered about the safety of tower blocks after some residents said they had been advised they should stay in their flats in the event of a fire.

Rebel in the Rye is a biographical drama written and directed by Danny Strong, who is making their directorial debut. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and stars Nicholas Hoult, Zoey Deutch, Kevin Spacey, Sarah Paulson, Brian d'Arcy James, Victor Garber, Hope Davis, and Lucy Boynton.
The world of legendary writer J. D. Salinger is brought vividly to life in this revealing look at the experiences that shaped one of the most renowned, controversial, and enigmatic authors of our time. Set amidst the colorful backdrop of mid-20th century New York City, Rebel in the Rye follows a young Salinger (Nicholas Hoult) as they struggle to find their voice, pursues a love affair with famed socialite Oona O'Neill (Zoey Deutch), and fights on the frontlines of World War II. It's these experiences that will inform the creation of their masterpiece, The Catcher in the Rye, bringing them overnight fame (and notoriety) and leading them to withdraw from the public eye for the rest of their life. Costarring Kevin Spacey and Sarah Paulson, Rebel in the Rye offers a tantalizing window into the life and times of a little-understood genius who broke the rules and redefined American literature.
Strong's first experience with Salinger was at age 14, when they read The Catcher in the Rye. “It was the first time I had read anything that reflected how I felt,” they recall, “the voice of the character felt so real and truthful to me in a way other books didn't feel. And it was also the funniest book I had read at that time. It still might be.”
Rebel in the Rye is rated PG.
In 2013, for the first time in its history, Funcinpec failed to capture a single National Assembly seat.
Though pundits at the time said the loss was a nail in the coffin for the royalist party, a paper published on Monday by political analyst Ou Virak's Future Forum think tank credits the loss to a quirk in electoral math.
Funcinpec would have won five seats if the government used the allocation formula it abandoned after the 1993 general elections, the paper says, arguing that the “highest average” formula adopted in 1997 and used ever since favors large parties at the expense of small ones.
“Smaller individuals know full well that there's not a chance of winning any seats, so why would you start a political party?” Mr. Virak said on Monday. By returning to the old system, “politics would be a lot more vibrant, and it could be a lot more representative.”
Cambodia uses a proportional representation system with two steps. In the first step, parties must clear a threshold of votes to win a seat. If “Imaginary Province” had 100,000 votes and five lawmaker seats, for example, a seat there is worth 20,000 votes. So “Party A,” which won 12,000 votes, would not necessarily win a seat, while “Party B,” which won 28,000 votes, would take one, and “Party C,” which won 60,000, would take three.
The difference between the two systems hinges on the second step, and how they divvy up any seats not distributed in the first. Under the old, “largest remainder” system, all that a small party had to do to win any leftover seats was to have more remaining votes than any other party. Party A would secure the one remaining seat since its 12,000 votes edge out B's 8,000 outstanding votes and C's zero.
The new system, however, allocates any additional seats based on how many seats parties won in step one, handing Party C the leftover seat.
In its 2012 commune election report, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections said this formula “favor[ed] the CPP and disfavored other contesting parties.”
Hang Puthea, spokesperson for the National Election Committee, said the formula could only be altered with fresh legislation—an unlikely prospect given the ruling party's control of Parliament.
Yeng Virak, head of the Grassroots Democracy Party, was still optimistic that “small parties can win more seats” by focusing their efforts and success in specific provinces.
But Mr. Virak of Future Forum doubted any minor party would claim a seat in next year's national election, which could determine the future of Cambodian democracy.
“A two-party race could polarize Cambodia,” they predicted.

São Paulo — The death toll from a day care centre fire in southeastern Brazil has risen to seven after a 4-year-old boy succumbed to their injuries while en route to a hospital.
A firefighter in the city of Janauba in the state of Minas Gerais said by telephone Friday that Renan Nicolas Santos died Thursday night due to burns that covered 90 per cent of their body.
The firefighter declined to give their name.
On Thursday, four other children and a teacher died when a guard doused the “Innocent People” day care centre in Janauba with alcohol and set it alight. The guard, who had helped with security at the centre since 2008, died hours later in a local hospital.
Janauba Mayor Carlos Isaildon Mendes has declared a seven-day mourning period.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — An envoy says Maldives will not extend the state of emergency that is due to expire on Wednesday amid criticism of the government over the recent political turmoil.
Mohamed Hussain Shareef, ambassador to neighbouring Sri Lanka, said the government “has no intention of extending” the emergency when its 30-day period expires, “barring very unusual circumstances such as widespread violence.”
Maldives declared an emergency due to turmoil following a Supreme Court ruling ordering the release of several of the president's jailed political opponents. Under the emergency law, President Yameen Abdul Gayoom had two Supreme Court judges arrested for alleged corruption and the remaining three judges annulled the order to release Yameen's opponents.
The emergency regulations gave Maldives' security forces sweeping powers, including to make arrests and search and seize property.
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Now slugging for the Bronx Bombers, Giancarlo Stanton.
The New York Yankees announced Monday they'd acquired Stanton from the Miami Marlins, getting the NL MVP and cash from Miami for Starlin Castro and two minor leaguers, right-hander Jorge Guzman and infielder Jose Devers.
Stanton was to be introduced later in the day at Major League Baseball's winter meetings.
The 28-year-old outfielder is still owed $295 million over the final decade of their record $325 million, 13-year contract.
The Marlins, with former Yankees star Derek Jeter as their new CEO, are expected to send $30 million to the Yankees if Stanton doesn't exercise their right to opt out of their contract and become a free agent after the 2020 season.
Stanton led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs last season. Once they put on the pinstripes, Stanton will pair with Aaron Judge, the 6-foot-7 rookie who was second in the majors with 52 homers.
The Yankees topped baseball with 241 home runs last season. The prospect of the daunting duo together in the lineup — and putting on batting practice shows — raised thoughts of their previous powerful 1-2 punches, such as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, along with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.
Shortly after the Yankees and Marlins agreed to the deal last weekend, Judge, the unanimous AL Rookie of the Year, sent a tweet to Stanton showing a clip from the movie “Step Brothers” with Will Ferrell saying, “Did we just become best friends?”
The Yankees came within one win of the World Series in October, losing the final two games of the AL Championship Series at Houston. The deal is sure to get a legion of fans that already dislike the Yanks railing against Jeter sending Stanton to their old team.
Stanton had a no-trade clause in their contract and last week turned down prospective deals to St. Louis and San Francisco. There was speculation they wanted to play close to home with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but clearly the Yankees were to their liking.
The Yankees haven't had a losing record since 1992. The Marlins haven't had a winning season since Stanton made their big league debut for them in 2010.
Jeter is expected to reduce payroll by at least 20 per cent to $90 million or less. The Marlins shed $38 million of salary through 2020 by trading two-time All-Star second baseman Dee Gordon to Seattle last week for three prospects.
Castro is due $10 million in 2018 and $11 million in 2019, plus a $16 million club option for 2020 with a $1 million buyout.
The Yankees' payroll for purposes of baseball's luxury tax was about $209 million this year, and owner Hal Steinbrenner has vowed to reduce it below next year's $197 million threshold, which would reset the team's base tax rate from 50 per cent to 20 per cent in 2019. That would put the Yankees, under new manager Aaron Boone, in better position for next off-season's free agent class, which includes Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and possibly Clayton Kershaw.
The 27-year-old Castro was an All-Star last season, hitting .300 with 16 homers and 63 RBIs. There's speculation the Marlins will try to trade them to the New York Mets.
The 21-year-old Guzman was 5-3 with a 2.30 ERA in Class A Staten Island. The 18-year-old Devers hit .245 in the Dominican Summer League and the rookie Gulf Coast League.

When Transcript Pharmacy, Inc., opened in January 2003 in Jackson, it initially was hoping for just some regional success in Mississippi and neighboring states, because there is a lot of competition with specialty pharmacies.
But the company now is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and has been recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of country's 5,000 fastest growing private companies.
“We were fortunate to have that recognition five years in a row,” said Clifton Osbon, R.Ph., president of Transcript Pharmacy. “The only other company in Mississippi we are familiar with that has the same distinction would be (remote technical support firm) Bomgar.”
The business provides prescriptions for patients with long-term medical needs such as those with solid organ transplants, Hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis, certain cancers and other conditions.
Osbon said by focusing their services on specific patient populations, the staff can provide the highest level of service and expertise possible.
“We believe we offer a high tech/high touch model,” Osbon said. “It is the right fit in this space where patients need extra care, but we also use technology to deliver that. We utilize all of our technology on the back end so it never interferes in the relationships with our patients.”
Every call gets answered live. They don't use tools like an automated attendant or phone trees.
“Patients have direct access to our staff promptly,” Osbon said. “We all know what it is like to call a company, be on hold for 15 minutes and then be transferred around.”
Patients are offered the opportunity to communicate with Transcript Pharmacy on email, but less than five percent do that. Most want to call in and complete the transaction. Patients call to order refills, update insurance information and schedule deliveries.
“On average, it takes only one minute and 15 seconds for a call to be completed,” Osbon said. “We don't waste their time. We offer friendly, personal service. Many of our patients develop a working relationship with one employee in particular, and we encourage that. In addition to patients, nurses and other healthcare professionals we interact with tell us they love the personal service that is delivered.”
They have found that nurses like fax communications.
“We use faxes as a primary way of communication with nurses because they can receive that and work with it at their convenience rather than taking a telephone call or some other technology that is more an interruption of their work flow.”
The company that employs 12 people also helps make sure that patients get their new prescriptions before the old one runs out.
“We place live outbound calls to patients every month if they haven't contacted us three days before the prescription is due for refill,” Osbon said. “We also check in with them to ask if the medicine is working for them or causing any problems. If there are any problems, the pharmacist communicates with the patient's physician.”
Osbon said the company has been fortunate to be able to hire superior employees.
“We have been able to hire great qualified people here,” Osbon said. “And because we are dependent on shipping to patients in many states, it helps to be in an area with a favorable climate. In the North, there might be challenges with snowstorms in the winter. We don't have that here. We also have a reasonable regulatory environment here that has been helpful to us. The Mississippi Board of Pharmacy's responsibility is to protect citizens by regulating pharmacists and pharmacies. Their regulations are fair and protect the citizens, but are not overbearing. We find they have a strong understanding of the business of pharmacy.”
While there are big questions right now about the future of the Affordable Care Act, Osbon said their biggest challenge is competition.
“We have a lot of competitors,” they said. “There is significant vertically integrated competition. Everyone from payers to health systems have specialty pharmacies. The thing sets us apart is we are able to work with the provider staff and help them manage patient care without interfering with their work flow.”
Transcript Pharmacy had revenues of $105 million in 2015, but it has declined since then. Osbon said that was expected because 2015 was a banner year due to treatments for Hepatitis C, which cost $30,000 a month and need to be taken for three months.
“That really drove our 2015 sales,” Osbon said. “Many patients didn't have to be retreated. We and our competitors showed a decrease in Hepatitis C prescriptions in the past two years because of that.”
Osbon said they rarely advertise, and instead rely on regional sales managers who call on nurses and other clinic staff members in specialty clinics throughout multiple states.
Osbon said another important factor in growing the company has been measuring metrics to evaluate success. Each quarter they send out surveys that ask patients to evaluate Transcript Pharmacy on eight different service components on a scale from one to five, with five being the best.
“We just got back our results from the second quarter survey where we averaged 4.94 for all patients,” they said. “They are telling us they are really happy with our services. On average speed to answer a call, call abandonment rates, the average time to dispense a prescription order, and clinic satisfaction surveys, we got 5 out of 5.”
The company prides itself on helping patients have a high compliance rate for taking their medicine. They said most pharmacies are satisfied if patients take 85 percent of their prescribed medicine.
“We are seeing numbers like 92 to 94 percent,” they said. “Our staff truly cares about the end result for the patient and we strive for better outcomes.”
WASHINGTON — American consumers saw their confidence rebound in April to a level close to the 18-year high it had reached two months ago.
The Conference Board says its consider confidence index rose to 128.7 in April, up from a March level of 127.0. The March level was just below the 130.0 hit in February, which had been the highest since November 2000.
The business research group's index measures consumers' assessment of current conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Economists believe the strength in confidence reflects a strong labour market, with unemployment at a 17-year low, as well as the impact of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts approved in December, which began showing up in workers' paychecks earlier this year.
BOSTON — Students who survived last month's shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead are set to participate in a panel discussion at Harvard about guns.
The event Tuesday evening at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics will feature six students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.
The students have become vocal advocates for stricter gun laws.
They say they're expecting more than 1 million people to participate in marches on Saturday in Washington and in other parts of the country calling for tougher firearms regulations.
They've already helped lead rallies and lobbied lawmakers in Washington and Florida.
Tuesday's event will be streamed live on the institute's website .
Unremitted $5.5bn: NEITI demands review of oil assets
From Uche Usim, Abuja and Adewale Sanyaolu
For failing to remit $5.5 billion and another N72.4 billion into the federation account, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has called on the Federal Government to revisit and re-valuate the transfer of the federation's oil assets by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to its subsidiary, the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company (NPDC).
Executive Secretary of NEITI, Mr. Waziri Adio, made the call while answering questions on the highlights of the recently released NEITI policy brief entitled, “Unremitted funds, oil sector reforms and economic recovery.”
Adio stated that the review has become imperative in view of the under-valuation, non-payment for the assets and the inability of the NPDC to either make returns on the investments or be accountable to the federation over its management of Nigeria's oil assets in its custody.
NEITI in the policy brief also observed that beyond the issue of unremitted monies, there are issues of transparency and efficiency with the operations of NPDC, noting that, ‘‘since 2005, NNPC has transferred 16 OMLs to NPDC. However, the process of transfer of these assets raises serious questions, as there appears to be no clear-cut criteria for transfer of oil mining assets to NPDC.
“The process for the transfer of the federation's assets to NPDC does not seem to pass the transparency test. One of the upshots of this is the undervaluation of these assets, thereby depriving the federation of optimal value for the assets.”
According to NEITI, the undervaluation reported results from NNPC's divestment of its 55 per cent shares in the Shell Joint Venture, which it valued at $1.8 billion, adding that PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) valuation of the same assets was $3.4 billion.
In addition, it said four other assets were divested in 2012 by NNPC to NPDC under the NAOC JV, which the DPR valued at $2.225 billion.
‘‘NPDC is contesting these valuations even though it currently operates these 12 OMLs without paying in full, the undervalued rates (paid only a $100 million) nor the new figures arrived at by PwC and the DPR. In total, the non-payment for the 12 oil blocks by NPDC sums up to $3.925 billion.”
NEITI questioned the situation where NPDC deliberately refuses to be accountable in its management of Nigeria's oil assets entrusted to its care.
“NPDC continues to be unaccountable to state institutions and the laws of the country. NPDC has consistently declined to give account of its operations and its management of national oil assets in its possession. NPDC failed to cooperate with the forensic audit ordered by the Auditor General of the Federation in 2015. Similarly, the company failed to cooperate with NEITI for five audit cycles and only partially cooperated during the 2013 and 2014 audits.”
In the policy brief, NEITI also expressed concerns over NPDC's technical expertise and financial capability to manage Nigeria's oil assets. The transparency agency stated: “The lack of technical know-how has been evident since the mid-2000s when the NPDC started engaging in service contracts with international oil companies.
“Also, NPDC's lack of finances has been evident since the beginning of the 2010, when the company resorted to Strategic Alliance Agreements (SAAs) with indigenous oil companies to carry out production on the fields in its possession.”
NEITI maintained that if NPDC was established to foster indigenous participation in the upstream sector, the company has not, in the past three decades, demonstrated ability to either maximise its production capacity or show that it has the financial muscle to operate independently.
“In mid-2006, total output from its wholly owned production was just 10,000 bpd. On the other hand, production from its service contract agreement with Agip was 65,000 bpd… Despite NPDC's clear operational and capacity deficiencies, the company continues to be allocated valuable concessions of Nigeria's most productive OMLs”.

CLEVELAND — Students in a high school auto repair program have returned a rebuilt Cleveland police cruiser destroyed during the celebration of the Cleveland Cavaliers' NBA championship in June 2016.
WJW-TV reports city officials listed the cruiser as a total loss after over-exuberant fans jumped on the roof of the cruiser, broke its windows and caused extensive damage. A teacher at Max Hayes High School approached the city about allowing students to rebuild it.
Students recently gave back the cruiser, which will be returned to service. Cleveland's commissioner for vehicle maintenance says the students' work saved the city around $10,000 and called the rebuild “fantastic.” The city had planned to scrap the cruiser for parts.
Max Hayes senior Percy Bouldin says the project provided motivation for them to go to school.

The search for sponsorship can be a tough one. You may think that your work is done once the race season starts, but, in fact, that may be the best time to be lining up sponsors. It doesn't hurt to put a little extra money into your program throughout the year, does it?
One of the biggest challenges in finding sponsorship is asking the right people. Some are willing to listen to your proposal; some won't return a phone call. It's the nature of the sponsorship hunt. However, there are some types of companies that are primed and ready to sponsor racing. They might not know it yet, but they could be much easier to convince.
Here are our top ten types of companies you should ask to sponsor your race team.
Your Local “Mom ‘N Pop” Store.
Local family-owned businesses are always looking for ways to keep up with the big-market types of store. Whether it's groceries, sporting goods, hardware, etc., they all have to try to compete with online shopping and the big-box stores. Let them know how loyal race fans are. Did you know a recent study showed 72% of motorsports enthusiasts showed loyalty to a brand/company? Use that information to show the value of advertising with your race team.
Any Company that Advertises on a Billboard
This one is pretty simple mathematics. If a company is doing well enough to advertise on a billboard, they certainly should be able to afford a race car. Depending on where these billboards are located, the prices can be hefty. You might not get the same number of eyeballs as a billboard on the freeway, but who is more attentive to the message? Wouldn't you rather advertise to a captivated race fan versus someone who might be road raging on their way to work?
Any New Business
If you have a finger on the pulse of the businesses in your area, you should know when something new is opening. If it's a new restaurant or a store, let the owner know how much you can help spread the word. Offer to show off your race car at the grand opening, or on a day they would like to drive some extra business. If it's a new service company (i.e. plumber, electrician) offer them a chance to come see you at the track. Help them build some team chemistry for the office, and let them see their race car in action.
Local Distributors
Have you ever seen a car that is sponsored by a big beer or beverage company and wondered why you can't have that on your car? For the most part, those drivers didn't get that sponsorship through the big corporation itself. They locked down that sponsorship through a local beverage distributor. Check to see who distributes beverages to your favorite local gas stations, grocery stores, and even the race track. They might be worth a proposal the next time.
Local Bars
The bar business is tough. Much like the other Mom N' Pop shops, locally-owned bars are always looking for a way to get an edge against the big chains and other forms of competition. This particular tip comes with a caveat…you may not get much money from a local bar. However, a lot of bars may sponsor you with “product” or a tab after the races. Money saved is money earned.
Pet Care Businesses
Have you seen a pet care business on someone's race car and wondered, ‘what does that have to do with racing?' Well, when it comes down to it, pets are pretty universal. They can generate some serious dollars too. A 2015 estimate showed that American may have spent up to $60 billion on pets. Do you have someone locally who sells pet food? Maybe a pet daycare service? Check those out next time you're working on proposals.
Local Sports Teams
No, you don't want to go to the Green Bay Packers, Boston Red Sox, or Indiana Pacers asking for money. However, many lower-tier sports teams have an interest in different types of promotions. It isn't rare to see a minor league baseball or hockey team lending their colors to a race car. If you see your local sports team doing things outside of the box when it comes to advertising, let them know how your race team could help them sell some tickets.
Your Work Place
It may seem obvious, but have you asked? Many race teams are sponsored by the driver's, crew's, or owner's place of business. If you haven't asked, you could be missing a major opportunity. Who better to spread the word of a business than a happy employee behind the wheel of a race car?
Your Family/Friends/Fans
Some racers have found an interesting way to get together some extra cash, either for the whole season or a big event. Racers will put out an all-call on their social media pages and ask for small amounts at a time. In exchange anyone who donates gets their name on the car for the event. You never know, something like this could attract a bigger fish in the future. Just make sure you follow up with whatever your promises are to these people.
The Company on that Other Race Car
Now, don't get us wrong. We're not advocating that you try to steal someone else's sponsor. However, if a company is already willing to sponsor one race car, are they willing to sponsor more? Try to show them the extra value. Maybe you race at another track and can help bring their product/service more exposure. So long as you show them the extra investment in racing can be worth it, they might be willing to help. But remember; don't try to tell them they are wrong to sponsor someone else. There is a reason they made that investment. Be sure to respect that.
PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said Monday that it was Ronald Darby's explosiveness that drew the team to trading Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick to the Buffalo Bills for the 23-year-old cornerback on Friday.
"The first thing you look at," Roseman said Monday morning during an appearance on SportsRadio 94.1 WIP. "He's explosive. Not only just in their straight-line speed, but their quickness. They have tremendous production on the ball with pass breakups, you like you see them catch more of those.
"When you watch them in the coverages and schemes that coach (Jim) Schwartz does, you watch them against guys in the NFC East, and they do a lot of the things that Schwartz does. He's 23 years old. They have two years left on their deal. We have a young group of corners that we can build with. That's really exciting for us."
Projecting Eagles WR Depth Chart post-trade
Darby immediately took first-team reps in their first practice with the Eagles Sunday morning, and appears on track to hold down one of the outside cornerback jobs opposite Jalen Mills, with former Buffalo Bills teammate Ron Brooks in the slot.
More than just aiming to improve the secondary, Roseman knew the risk that they were taking by trading away a player such as Matthews who was immensely popular within the locker room, and went so far as to meet with individual players such as Carson Wentz after pulling the trigger on the deal.
"We always have to do what's best for the team," Roseman said of the trade. "The most important thing there is, we're communicating with those guys. We go through the logic with them and make sure we let them know the logic behind the trade. I think our players understand the nature of the business, they understand what happens, they want what's best for the Philadelphia Eagles.
"It''s important to communicate with our players. It's important for them to understand our logic and know that we weren't doing this for the sake of doing it. It's about building together. At the same time, we understand that Jordan's a good player, and as good a player as they are, he's a better person. It isn't an easy trigger to pull when we do it."

The children pile into the stadium in shiny clothes, clutching green-and-white Pakistani flags. Their parents light the area with cell phones to record the event as they scream, chant and cheer, watching soldiers close a gate that separates India from Pakistan.
In the evening ritual at the Wagah-Attari border, near Lahore and Amritsar, soldiers from both countries high-kick, shake their fists, then shake hands – and slam the gate shut.
It is deeply visceral for many Pakistanis: an acknowledgement of their border, of a plucky country they feel they have sacrificed so much to create.
Pakistan was imagined more than 70 years ago by a stern, British-educated, whiskey-drinking Shiite lawyer. Muhammad Ali Jinnah hoped for a nation as cosmopolitan as they are. They led the fight to carve the country out of British-ruled India. In a new, independent India, Muslims were fearful that they would be dominated by a Hindu majority.
But in the decades since, the sense of who is a citizen in the Muslim state hasn't been resolved. The question has come at a high price: Although Pakistan's constitution specifies the protection of minority rights, "the government limited freedom of religion," according to the State Department. The country's tiny minorities of Sikhs, Christians and Hindus are vulnerable to persecution. Certain laws, such as blasphemy laws, are often used to target them.
Within the Muslim community as well, the definition of who exactly is a Muslim has narrowed.
The seeds of Pakistan's intolerance were sown within the country's very ideology as a Muslim state, says Taimur Rehman, a political scientist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
That intolerance was "inherent in the very way in which Pakistan was created and the very purpose which it was supposed to serve of being a Muslim state," they say. "By its very definition, it has already singled out a community in opposition to another one," they say, referring to Muslims and Hindus. "And it's very easy for that community to be narrowed further."
Over the decades, they argue, the narrowing has been exacerbated by the military, Pakistan's most powerful institution, which cultivated hard-line Islamists to wage a jihad in the disputed region of Kashmir, among other things.
This has given right-wing religious groups outsize influence. "Despite never having won an election," Rehman says, "they are nonetheless able to dictate the narrative in the country because of the support that they have from the military establishment."
Perhaps none have suffered more than members of a small Muslim sect, known as Ahmadis, whose beliefs clash with the dominant Sunni version of Islam. They played a key role in founding Pakistan. They are a community of over-achievers: An Ahmadi physicist, Abdus Salam, received one of only two Nobel prizes awarded to Pakistanis.
But the state declared Ahmadis as heretics via a constitutional amendment in the 1970s and restricted their rights further in the 1980s. They're not allowed to call themselves Muslims, and can't refer to their houses of worship as mosques. Over the years, militants have attacked their mosques and targeted them in killings.
In a leafy suburb near Lahore, the Khans live in a two-story home behind a high gate that's firmly bolted. Mrs. Khan stands on the balcony every morning, waiting for their husband to return from prayers at their local mosque. She's terrified that somebody will kill him.
"We are frightened," they say. "For the life." (Her first name isn't being published out of concern for the family's safety.)
Most of their family already fled overseas.
So far, Mrs. Khan insists on staying. They run a clinic that dispenses free medicine to their poorer neighbors. "If I go, the people will suffer," they say.
They don't want to "just sit and eat" in exile. "This is not the meaning of life."
She's also worried about their nephew. Twice, somebody threw a note into their house warning them to convert to Sunni Islam — or die. They hide out here when he's afraid.
They repeatedly tried to flee Pakistan – but they say the U.K., Sweden and Canada all rejected applications.
The roots of intolerance run deeper than just how Pakistan defines itself as a Muslim state, says Anam Zakariya, an oral historian in Islamabad.
They trace it back to Pakistan's birth story – at the time of Partition, in 1947, when millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled to India and Muslims to Pakistan. Mobs raped and butchered each other — around a million people died.
But Zakariya says those events are pushed aside. Pakistan focuses on celebrating its creation – and emphasizes how Muslims were victims.
"Now if it's your biggest victory to date," Zakariya says, "you have to make sure that the bloodshed is portrayed to the younger generations as perpetrated by Indians — Hindus and Sikhs."
It's to drive home the point: "And that's why there was a need to create Pakistan."
There are challenges emerging to that narrative. In a sprawling park in the heart of noisy, smoggy Lahore, a museum will soon open that will look at Partition through the stories of the people who witnessed it. It's a collaboration between the Citizens Archive of Pakistan, a nonprofit, and the government of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province.
"This is the first place in the entire country where you'll experience what the refugees in 1947 experienced," says Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, an Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker and head of the Citizens Archive.
Being exposed to stories from survivors of Partition will help create a more inclusive Pakistan, they believe, but it's a race against time – the people who lived through Partition are fading away.
And 70 years on, the very idea of what Pakistan is meant to be – an Islamic state, in opposition to Hindu-dominated India – feels hard to shake.
Near the museum construction site, the Abdul Aziz family huddles under a shelter as a sudden summer rain drenches the park. Their patriarch, Yousef, isn't sure of their age, but says they used to work in fields alongside Hindus – and so they predate Partition. When the Hindus left Pakistan, they said, Muslims became free.
"We are now in a country where we can say, 'There is no God but God and Muhammed is their messenger,'" they say, reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.
In Pakistan, they say, "There is no idolatry" – a reference to polytheist Hinduism.
Their granddaughters Sania, 22, and Aya, 19, nod in agreement. They say he's proud of Pakistan, which they describe as a "fort of Islam" where it's safe for their grandchildren to grow up.
Sania says she's not interested in a museum. She's already heard their grandfather's stories of Partition, and she'll tell them one day to their own children.
Besides, they say, "I know history — the Islamic history of Pakistan."

WASHINGTON — The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit Texas, Florida and other Southeastern states. It was the first decline in six years.
The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 per cent from 4.4 per cent, the lowest level since February 2001.
Looking past the hurricanes' impact, the job market and economy generally look healthy. Some economists expect job growth to rebound in the coming months as businesses in the area reopen and construction companies ramp up repair and renovation work.
Last month's drop was driven by huge losses in a restaurants and bars, which shed 105,000 jobs, a sign of the damage to Florida's tourism industry.

Ghana Oil Company Limited (GOIL) presented fuel coupons worth GH¢10,000
Two bodies on Monday extended support to strengthen the arms of the Media Coalition Against Illegal Mining in its fight against galamsey in Ghana.
The Ghana Oil Company Limited (GOIL) presented fuel coupons worth GH¢10,000 while Globe Productions offered to support and sustain the fight with dramatised, communications of the ills of illegal mining (galamsey) through its stage and radio plays. The plays will be in Hausa, Twi and English.
Marcus Deo Dake, Head of Fuels Marketing at Goil, during the presentation indicated that part of Goil's mission is to operate in a very safe, healthy and environmentally friendly and socially responsible market, hence coming on board to support the transportation needs of the coalition to make Ghana a safer and friendly environment.
In that regard, they said the company will support causes that seek to promote the safety and protection of the environment.
Latif Abubakar, playwright and Chief Executive Officer at Globe Productions said that they found it prudent to join the fight to end illegal mining due to its wide-reaching effects in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) areas and most importantly agriculture.
They said the stage plays to be organised by their company will not only entertain patrons but to harness their support in the fight against illegal mining.
According to him, using stage drama, radio and films to demonstrate the effects of illegal mining will go a long way to win the support of ordinary citizens who otherwise could not have been bothered about the effect of illegal mining.
They said theatre is one of the channels that can be used to educate people on the effects of illegal mining.
Mr Abubakar explained that the galamsey fight must be embraced by every Ghanaian because of its effect on food crops, water, sanitation and health which cannot be underestimated.
“People think because they are not directly involved with galamsey, so it's not a big deal but the effects are gradually getting to the city centres where people think they are safe,” they noted.
Mr Kenneth Ashigbey, the Managing Director of the Graphic Communications Group Limited and convener of the Coalition Against Illegal Mining assured Goil that the fuel coupons will be judiciously used and accounted for.
Mr Ashigbey expressed gratitude to Goil and Globe Productions for joining the fight and said the fight against illegal mining has begun yielding some positive results but there was still more to be done to support and strengthen the cause.
Mr Ashigbey said the fight requires the effort all and sundry particularly corporate Ghana and other relevant stakeholders to help nip the menace in the bud.
According to him, active advocacy to end illegal mining must be sustained as the fight reaches a crucial stage especially with the role of the anti-illegal mining task-force dubbed Operation Vanguard.
They commended the task force in their operations but added that they must follow due process in order to curb any eventualities that might mar the efforts of the fight against illegal mining.
Mr Ashigbey said the coalition has a budget of over 3 million cedis which is inadequate in the conscientization and sensitization programmes being undertaken, adding that “as corporate Ghana we all have roles to play to ensure that Ghana is safe, to ensure that our water bodies are clean.”
They also thanked other supporters of the cause, including GH¢50,000 and GH¢20,000 support from The Ghana Grid Company Limited (GRIDCo) and Ghana Insurers Association respectively.
They took the time to commend other stakeholders who have devoted their time and resources to ending the galamsey menace that threatens to destabilise the environment.
President Donald Trump signed a bill on Tuesday that eliminates regulations imposed by the Obama Administration. ( Reuters photo )
The Congressional Review Act gives Congress the authority to review any new government regulation enacted by the Executive Branch within a certain time frame after it has been reported to the Legislative Branch, and provides requirements for timely reporting of all new regulations.
In the waning days of their presidency, Barack Obama's administration enacted a number of policies that conservatives believe are damaging to the nation, particularly to efforts by President Donald Trump to encourage job creation. The CRA allows Congress to remove those harmful regulations.
The president signed into law the first such act on Tuesday. House Joint Resolution 41 repeals some Dodd-Frank regulations on the energy industry.
In a statement announcing the bill signing, the White House call the regulations "misguided," and said they burdened American companies. The three primary benefits to Americans by removing the regulation are:
it has removed a costly impediment to American extraction companies helping their workers succeed;
it could save American businesses as much as $600 million annually in regulatory compliance costs, and spare them 200,000 hours of paperwork; and
it created an unfair advantage for foreign-owned extraction companies.
Prior to signing the bill, the president made a brief statement to the press pool on hand in the Oval Office.
"This is a big signing, a very important signing. And this is H.J. Resolution 41, disapproving the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule on disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers. It's a big deal," they said. "This is one of many that we've signed, and we have many more lefts. And we're bringing back jobs big league, we're bringing them back at the plant level; we've bringing them back at the mine level. The energy jobs are coming back. And it's—you see what's going on with the stock market. They know that we know what we're doing, so it's going up."

After Trump signed the bill, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) issued the following statement:
"This is the first of many Congressional Review Act bills to be signed into law by President Trump. H.J. Res. 41 repeals regulations that would have put American oil and natural gas companies at a disadvantage on the world stage, and actually could have threatened the safety of American workers abroad.
"Congressional Review Act legislation provides relief for Americans hurt by regulations rushed through at the last minute by the Obama administration. This means freeing up American entrepreneurs, creating jobs, and jump-starting our economy. The House continues to take up Congressional Review Act initiatives this week."
Republicans are reviewing a number of regulations adopted throughout the Obama presidency, however, because it is believed many departments didn't comply with the reporting provision. It is believed that Trump Administration officials can report any unwanted regulations to Congress to expedite the CRA process, even though some of them may have been on the books for several years now.
The White House issued the following statement, as well:
President Trump has been steadfast in their commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on everyday Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses.
President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump will initiate fundamental changes to the United States healthcare system to reduce the financial burden on Americans by getting the government out of the way. President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. President Trump directed their Secretary of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects. President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of Dodd-Frank to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny. President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.

Cambodia to arrest three behind photoshopped image of king
Cambodian police on Monday said they planned to arrest three suspects, including one believed to be in Thailand, for being behind an offensive photo-shopped image of the country's king that placed them in a gay porn scene.
The image, which appeared on some Facebook accounts in both Cambodia and Thailand this week, is a rare public insult aimed at King Norodom Sihamoni, a monarch who is largely respected and deemed above the country's political fray.
In contrast to neighbouring Thailand, which outlaws any criticism of its monarchy often handing down decades-long sentences, Sihamoni is not shielded by a specific lese majeste law.
However the country's constitution describes them as “inviolable”.
General Khieu Sopheak, spokesperson for the Cambodian Ministry of Interior, confirmed an investigation had been launched.
“We have got orders to arrest them,” they told AFP. “If we don't take action against them, more people might follow their act.”
They declined to specify which law the three suspects might have broken but said: “The king represents the whole nation and they are insulting the king, which is like they are insulting the whole nation.”
Two suspects were believed to be in Cambodia with the third thought to be in Thailand, they added, saying authorities would consider asking for help from Bangkok.
Sihamoni ascended the throne in 2004 following the abdication of their father King Norodom Sihanouk.
Observers say they have ruled quietly as a constitutional monarch, fulfilling a symbolic role as head of state and, unlike their father, staying away from domestic politics.
Sihamoni speaks French, Czech and English after spending much of their adult life abroad pursuing a career in the arts — including establishing their own ballet company — before taking the throne.
 They are unmarried and has no children.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Javon Bess had 17 points and 11 rebounds and made all six of their free throws Saturday night to help Saint Louis beat Fordham 73-50.
The Billikens (13-11, 6-5 Atlantic 10) led 37-18 at halftime after closing the first half with a 15-0 run and maintained a double-digit edge throughout the second half, keeping their lead between 12 and 23 in the period.
Jalen Johnson had 14 points, D.J. Foreman scored 12 and Hasahn French had 11 points and 11 rebounds for Saint Louis. Jordan Goodwin added nine points, 10 rebounds, five assists and four steals. Goodwin grabbed six of their boards on the offensive glass.
Saint Louis had 17 offensive rebounds and a 48-31 overall advantage on the glass.
Joseph Chartouny had 11 points and Cavit Havsa scored 10 for Fordham (7-15, 2-8). Ivan Raut and Prokop Slanina added nine points each.
PARIS (AP) — Five months after they seemed destined to be sold off, Angel di Maria has become one of the first names on Paris Saint-Germain's team sheet.
They have arguably been PSG's best player in recent weeks, scoring six goals in their past seven games and showing the flair that once made them one of soccer's most sought-after wingers.
As January's winter transfer window shut at midnight on Wednesday, Di Maria was preparing for Saturday's French league game away to Lille. Some contrast from the final days of the summer transfer window when it seemed PSG's priority was selling him.
Qatari-owned PSG needed to sell to raise cash to balance the books, after being placed under investigation by UEFA for potential breaches of Financial Fair Play rules over the signings of Neymar for 222 million euros ($260 million) and teen star Kylian Mbappe for 180 million euros ($216 million).
However, a reported third offer of some 45 million euros ($56 million) from Barcelona — trying to unite Di Maria with their Argentina teammate Lionel Messi — was rebuffed.
PSG coach Unai Emery has been repaid for holding firm by Di Maria's sparking form since the turn of the year. Di Maria, who has scored 100 goals in 503 career games, is still in their peak years. They will be 30 on Feb. 14 — the day PSG is at Real Madrid in the Champions League in their round-of-16 match.
"I'm especially happy for him, he's shown great commitment to PSG," said Emery, who took charge in 2016-17 after Laurent Blanc was fired. "I've known Angel for one-and-a-half years and he's had some difficult times. I've spoken with them to help them regain their confidence and their best level."
Di Maria, who helped create two of PSG's goals in a 3-2 win away to Rennes in the League Cup semifinal on Tuesday, will hope to have done enough to start the first leg against their former club Madrid.
But Emery faces a very difficult decision.
Barring injury, Neymar and striker Edinson Cavani — PSG's all-time leading scorer — appear certain to start that game.
This leaves one place up for grabs in PSG's biggest match of the season, and one which could shape Emery's future. They were hired by Qatari owners QSI to take PSG into at least the last four of the Champions League, something PSG has not managed to do since QSI took over the club in June, 2011.
After PSG's humiliating exit to Barcelona at the same stage last season — losing 6-1 in Barcelona after winning 4-0 at home — all eyes will be on Emery for this game.
If they pick Di Maria on the right flank, it means dropping Mbappe, who has formed a lethal understanding with Neymar.
But Di Maria's slumps this season and last have been as a direct result of them being a substitute. Their fragile confidence impacted both times, and it took them many weeks to regain top form.
Emery's decision likely rests on how they approach the Madrid game and, crucially, how they expect Zinedine Zidane's under-performing side to play on the night.
If PSG takes the game to Madrid, then Mbappe's pace and direct running seem the better option.
But if PSG sits back and tries to hit Madrid on the break, then it will mean long periods of soaking up play and waiting for the right moment to push forward.
This scenario better suits Di Maria's greater experience and ability to track back more than Mbappe, whose defensive work-rate is sometimes lacking.
Questions have been raised this season, too, about Mbappe's temperament.
They demonstrated a volatile streak on Tuesday against Rennes, getting sent off after raking their studs on the back of a Rennes player's leg. A similar gesture of indiscipline might prove costly for Mbappe — and Emery — at this stage of the Champions League.
With Mbappe suspended for Saturday's game at Lille, Di Maria will get another chance to stake their claim.
The Lehigh University student who was hospitalized last week with a suspected case of bacterial meningitis was discharged from the hospital Monday, the school reports.
The student was admitted to an area hospital Wednesday and their condition has improved significantly.
"Lehigh staff and administrators have been in contact with the student and family members, and we are all very grateful for what we expect will be a full recovery," Ricardo Hall, vice provost for student affairs, and Thomas Novak, interim director of the health and wellness center, said in an email to the campus Monday.
In the message, Lehigh officials stressed how serious bacterial meningitis is and reminded students that several strains of Meningococcal meningitis may be prevented through two vaccines. Students can check their immunization history by signing onto their patient portal found here.
The university is not recommending students who may have encountered the ill student take any preventative measures.
"Lehigh health officials have been in close contact with infectious disease specialists who have not recommended any prophylaxis for others who may have been in contact with the student," university spokesperson Lori Friedman stated in an email message.

But anyone experiences symptoms consistent with meningitis is urged to contact the campus health center or a local hospital emergency room since its critical to catch the infection early. Common symptoms include fever, severe and sudden headache, lethargy, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting and rash.
If students are not fully vaccinated they can contact the health center or their primary care doctor.
Bacterial meningitis can be caused by several types of bacteria, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An infection "is very serious and can be deadly," the CDC says. "Death can occur in as little as a few hours. Most people recover from meningitis. However, permanent disabilities (such as brain damage, hearing loss and learning disabilities) can result from the infection."

Many pinned Liverpool's hopes in the UEFA Champions League final on the performance of Salah, but the Egypt star was forced off after just 30 minutes of Real Madrid's 3-1 win in Kiev.
Salah and Ramos tussled for the ball and linked arms in the process, before the Spain international hauled their opponent to the ground, the fall resulting in a dislocated shoulder for the Reds star.
With Salah's World Cup participation put in doubt, Ramos has come in for fierce criticism.
But Pons – who has travelled with the Liverpool attacker for treatment in Spain – does not think it was a calculated attempt to cause an injury, and believes Salah has a chance of featuring for Egypt in the World Cup group stage, with its first match against Uruguay scheduled for 16 June (NZST).
"Salah has not told me anything about Sergio Ramos," Pons said. "I do not think he's angry with him. It was an accidental action.
"Salah is already more animated, much more optimistic. It's not a very typical injury in football, maybe more in goalkeepers. The Egyptian Football Federation believes that in three or four weeks they will be recovered.
"We are going to do double session every day and we will try to reduce the recovery period."
OTTAWA — The Competition Bureau says its new interim commissioner will be former assistant crown attorney Matthew Boswell.
Boswell succeeds John Pecman, who was the first bureau staffer and non-lawyer to hold the commissioner title.
Boswell joined the Competition Bureau in 2011 and has been senior deputy commissioner since September 2012.
They previously served as senior litigation counsel for the Ontario Securities Commission's enforcement branch.
The Airbus A350-900 ULR (ultra long-range) made its first flight on April 23, starting a short flight test program ahead of its first delivery in the second half of 2018.
The aircraft, MSN 216, will be the only one involved in the test campaign that, according to A350 head of marketing Marisa Lucas-Ugena, will take only weeks to complete. Launch customer Singapore Airlines has ordered seven. The airline—so far the only airline that has ordered the type—plans to re-introduce nonstop flights from Singapore to New York, among other destinations. Airbus hopes Qantas will also select the type for the planned expansion of ultra-long haul services from Australia.
The A350-900 ULR features a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 280 tons, up from the current maximum of 275 tons. Airbus also introduced aerodynamic changes to the wing: the winglets are now 0.5 meters higher and the flap fairings are extended by 0.3 meters. The wing twist has also been changed slightly. The changes to the wing will become standard also on the A350-900, for which the 280-ton MTOW will be on offer as well.
The ULR version will incorporate changes to the center fuel tank to allow more fuel volume to be used. The aircraft will be able to carry an additional 24,000 l of fuel compared to the standard -900. According to Airbus, it will have a range of 9,700 nm compared to 8,100 nm for the A350-900 and 7,950 nm for the -1000. The A350-900 ULR competes with Boeing's 787-9 and 777-8X in the small market for ultra long-haul routes. United already deploys the 787-9 on sectors such as Los Angeles-Singapore and Qantas recently introduce non-stop flights from Perth to London-Heathrow.

We're not mugging you off. This really is happening
We've got a text!!

And that text says: Love Island is coming to Netflix.
Yep, it's been confirmed that the entirety of series one and two of the hit ITV2 reality show will be available to stream from 1st May.
Sadly Netflix have been a bit muggy in only acquiring the first two runs, meaning that last year's runaway success of a series that starred (amongst others) Chris Hughes and Kem Cetinay is so far MIA.
Although with a total of 66 episodes in series one and two, you're going to need to get grafting if you want to catch up on all of the action from villas past ahead of series four kicking off this summer.
RadioTimes.com recently reported that this upcoming series is set to be the longest ever, with the series currently scheduled to run for eight weeks over the summer. This year's islanders will also reportedly return to the same villa as last year's alumni.

It's also been confirmed that Caroline Flack will be back to host and narrator Iain Stirling will also be returning to give their unmistakable take on the unfolding action in Mallorca.
Montreal police divers will return to the Rivieres des Prairies today in hopes of finding 10-year-old Ariel Jeffrey Kouakou.
The boy hasn't been seen since March 12 when they left their home in the city's Ahunstic-Cartierville district to visit a friend's house.
Police divers made three dives on Monday, but didn't find any sign of the boy.
Sgt. Manuel Couture says the dives are difficult, not just because of the water temperature, but due to ice and snow on the river blocking the sunlight.
Police have been going door-to-door in the neighbourhood and using horses, the canine unit, all-terrain vehicles and a helicopter to search the area.
The boy's father has said they believe their son had been abducted and has asked police to restore an Amber Alert that was issued immediately after Ariel had disappeared. Couture said it will be up to investigators to make that determination.

A space launch was scrubbed Tuesday from a remote launch site in New Zealand after an engine glitch caused engineers to abort the flight.
The command to abort came two seconds after the engine of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket fired on its launch pad at Mahia Peninsula on North Island's east coast.
There was no immediate explanation for the launch attempt being called off, although mission control said the problem had been reported as the engine built toward liftoff .
In a tweet, Rocket Lab said the launch of the rocket nicknamed "'Still Testing' (was) scrubbed for the day while team reviews data."
It said in a statement that the weather is not favorable for a launch on Wednesday, so a new launch would be attempted "no earlier than" Thursday afternoon.
The 23-meter (75-foot) rocket had three satellites on board for Tuesday's launch, each about the size of a shoebox.
Founded by New Zealander Peter Beck, the company last May reached space with its first test launch, only to abort the mission when a communication glitch occurred.
Rocket Lab has official approval to conduct three test launches and sees an emerging market in delivering lots of small devices, some not much bigger than a smartphone, into low Earth orbit.
The satellites would be used for everything from monitoring crops to providing internet service.
The company hopes to begin commercial launches next year and eventually launch one rocket every week.
SOREL, Que. — The Nature Conservancy of Canada says it is expanding a wetland conservation area in southern Quebec that is home to several bird and wildlife species.
The conservation group says it's adding 25 hectares to its 305-hectare preserve on Ile de Grace, about 95 km northeast of Montreal.
The island located between Sorel and Trois-Rivieres consists of forested wetlands — an important habitat for many bird species including the least bittern, which is considered threatened under the Canadian Species at Risk Act.
The wetland also home to waterfowl, wildlife, and several species of flowers, according to the group.
The Nature Conservancy announced the creation of the new protected area on Feb. 2, which is World Wetlands Day.
They also announced new conservation areas in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.

If you've not seen the previous series of Last Tango in Halifax or you've got a hazy memory, here's a guide to what's happened so far, who plays who and where you've seen the actors before.
Advertisement
Celia (Anne Reid)
The Last Tango story begins with Celia, a 70-something widow, who gets in touch with childhood sweetheart Alan after they spot them on Facebook. They meet up and get on so well that it's like they've never been apart. By episode two they're engaged, much to the shock and confusion of their children. The duo is based on writer Sally Wainwright's own mother's experience of a meeting their teenage boyfriend 60 years later on Friends Reunited. Wait, so there is hope I could end up marrying Sam, who I fancied in year nine? Interrrrresting….
Anyway, Celia's daughter Caroline is going out with a woman named Kate in series two and unlike Alan, Celia doesn't take the same-sex thing well at all. In fact, they refuse to accept it and there are torrid, throw-plates-at-the-wall, rows until Celia realises she's making their daughter miserable with their homophobia. As the Christmas special begins, Celia is happily married to Alan and is caught up in the daily chaos of their family. (Some) lessons have been learnt although their sharp tongue hasn't lost its edge.
Played by: Anne Reid, who you'll know as Valerie in Coronation Street and Jean in dinnerladies.
Alan (Derek Jacobi)
Alan knows all about life's peaks and troughs. They get engaged to Celia and then at the end of series one they have a heart attack. It's all ok though because they recover and marries Celia as planned. Alan's daughter Gillian has a complex time in the show and he's very involved – but more about that later. The crucial thing to know about Alan is that they discover they have a son called Gary from an affair they had in the 1980s while married to their first wife, their daughter Gillian's mum. Alan doesn't tell Celia about Gary because he's worried she'll judge them for having had an affair – and especially because Celia's own husband was adulterous and they suffered badly. When they do tell her, she's devastated and genuinely questions whether he's the man they thought they are. By the time series four begins, they're reunited and the pair are off to New Zealand for a belated honeymoon – courtesy of their new, millionaire son Gary who Celia has come to terms with. And not just because he's bought them a fancy holiday.

Played by: Derek Jacobi, who's best know for their hugely successful theatre career. On TV they star in Vicious with Ian McKellen and you'll have seen them in Gosford Park and The King's Speech.
I used to think I had a thing for old recipes. I've learned that this self-observation (like most of my impressions of myself) was wrong. I've actually followed “old recipes” probably twice. I once faithfully reproduced a “clam loaf.” I don't know if it was my fault or the recipe's, or maybe even the concept's, but the result was inedible, and a little scary, and I arrived at the party I'd promised to bring it to holding a can of compensatory Spanish cockles. And I once made an antique “sauce piquant” with bone marrow, spooned it over a roast and coughed politely as murmurs round the table confirmed my impression that it tasted like old fish. We ate a lot of bread.
What I've realized is that I like dreaming about what old dishes would be. I like imagining where they would be eaten and by whom, how they might be served, what conversation and convention punctuate their eating, what time of day, what weather, what energies drive eaters to that table and from it. I do like reading their instructions. I just don't like to follow them. I like to take what I can. It's sometimes a particularly good way of describing one step of a process, or the suggestion of a way of life — involving long lunches and wild strawberries — or a really wonderful general idea for a dish, with a lovely and evocative name.
Salisbury steak is such an instance: a good idea and a good name, though its reputation as a TV dinner has stained the prettiness somewhat. Salisbury steak, the preparation — hand-chopped meat formed into a patty and cooked in fat — probably originated in unnamed kitchens wherever cattle grazed. It definitively existed on the menus of fine Swiss and French restaurants here and in their native lands throughout the late-19th and early-20th centuries as biftek haché, Hamburg steak or haché de boeuf.
The innocent ruddy mixture appeared under its new name in 1888 in a recipe by a Dr. Salisbury, a 19th-century physician with potent, and extreme, ideas about diet and health. Here is Salisbury's recipe — which in its tone and intention (as a nutritional plan) blurs the distinction between “recipe” as we understand it and pharmaceutical “receipts” for prevention and cures that were once regular companions to cooking instruction. “Eat the muscle pulp of lean beef made into cakes and broiled,” they wrote. “Simply press it sufficiently to hold it together. Make the cakes from half an inch to an inch thick. Broil slowly and moderately well over a fire free from blaze and smoke. When cooked, put it on a hot plate and season to taste with butter, pepper, salt; also use either Worcestershire or Halford sauce, mustard, horseradish or lemon juice on the meat if desired.”

How many times it was recreated in that naïve, wholesome form, I don't know. By 1962, according to a book I have from that year, titled “Meats,” and similar volumes, recipes for Salisbury steak had become burial grounds for convenience foods. One in “Meats” reads: “1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 cup cream or evaporated milk . . . flour, bacon drippings or margarine . . . Worcestershire sauce . . . 1 4 oz. can mushrooms, undrained. . . .” (This is succeeded by a recipe for Savory Beef Burgers that begins: “1 1/2 cups Rice Krispies. . . . ”)
ATHENS, Greece — Authorities on the Greek island of Lesbos say they have blocked a ship carrying container homes for refugees and other migrants in protest at the refusal of the government and the European Union to move more people to Greece's mainland.
A government-chartered ship carrying the containers remained anchored at the island's main town Monday after municipal vehicles were used to block port facilities. The island's municipal board was due to meet later Monday to decide on whether to lift the blockade following talks with the government, state-run TV said.
The mayors of five Greek islands facing the coast of Turkey are demanding that the government and EU end a policy of containment for migrants — introduced last year as a deterrent against illegal migration — because living facilities are severely overcrowded.
Hey, Spice Girls fans -- "Wannabe" really happy?
Then take a look at the first photo of all five Spices, together in the same room for the first time since 2012.
Team member Mel B captioned the pic, "These amazing women have helped me become who I am,so to all the girls out there remember “friendship never ever ends”!!!! Boom #spicegirls #coloursoftheword #wantwereallyreallywant #mumsworkinghard #blastoff."
"We have enjoyed a wonderful afternoon catching-up and reminiscing about the amazing times we have spent together," a statement issued by the former band-mates says. "We are always overwhelmed at how much interest there is across the whole world for The Spice Girls. The time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together."
The statement adds, "We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of The Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of female empowerment for future generations."
The British paper The Sun reports that all five members met up at Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell's home, along with their former manager, Simon Fuller, who went on to create "American Idol."
Victoria "Posh Spice" Beckham also captioned the photo of the women with Fuller, "Love u all so much!!! X Such a great day!! Thank u Simon!" The snap of the five women together was captioned, "Love my girls!!! So many kisses!!! X Exciting x #friendshipneverends #girlpower."
“Kanye West shilling for Donald Trump is enough to make me wish the Arcade Fire album rollout would come back,” I said to myself not two hours ago. Lo, the eyes of Everything Now Corp. are everywhere, because this afternoon's new episode of the Song Exploder podcast features Win Butler dissecting Everything Now track “Put Your Money on Me.” Butler cites influences for the song including Marvin Gaye's “Sexual Healing,” Vangelis's Blade Runner soundtrack, the “magical” sound of slot machines clanging, and the vocal harmonies of ABBA. They discuss working in Paris with Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (who, according to Butler, “doesn't really like electronic music”) and notes that they wrote “all the lyrics very, very fast” (big surprise).
Arcade Fire are currently in Europe, continuing to tour behind Everything Now, which received a lengthy parody marketing campaign but ultimately met lackluster critical reception upon release in July 2017. Last month, the band released a double video titled “Money + Love” that incorporated “Put Your Money on Me,” and they also performed the song on Saturday Night Live. Listen to Butler on the latest episode of Song Exploder below; you'll need a log-in, because the other thing Kanye West has in common with Arcade Fire is a stake in Tidal.
A new member was recently added to the Settles Hotel team.
The historic hotel announced Alex Phillips as their brand-new sales and event manager for the La Corsha Hospitality Group property in Big Spring, Texas.
As the sales and event manager of Hotel Settles, Phillips oversees all logistics and operations for group events, and works to implement additional events and programming at the iconic property. With over 10 years of experience in the hospitality industry, the Settles has high hopes that they will bring expertise in event creation, planning and execution to the property.
“We are thrilled to have Alex Phillips on the Hotel Settles team,” said Jeff Trigger, President of La Corsha Hospitality Group. “Alex's event management skills and fresh perspective will continue to propel forward the stellar programming at the property.”

Fashola tasks quantity surveyors' board on cost data bank
The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, has urged the reconstituted Quantity Surveyors Registration Board of Nigeria (QSRBN) to develop a cost data bank to support the formation of estimates that would serve as a reference material for stakeholders in the construction industry.
Fashola, at the ministry's headquarters in Abuja, urged the professionals to develop a range of costs for the different ecological zones of the country as well as evolve means of making the practice of quantity surveying simple enough and responsive to the man on the street.
Emphasising the importance of Quantity Surveyors in the economic growth of the country, Fashola declared: “These are people whose core professional mandate is really ensuring that clients get value for money on all building construction projects.”
They challenged the members of the board “to develop a very open and possibly nationwide cost data bank that will be used in different parts of the country, so that at least in water lodged environment, for example, we can know what is the minimum cost of materials required to complete a project as against what would be required on normal land.”
Congratulating the chairperson and members of the reconstituted board, Fashola who noted with pleasure the broad mix of experience and value that were brought to the board, said: “This board has, among many other roles, the responsibility for registering persons who are fit and qualified to serve and practise as Quantity Surveyors and also the responsibility to regulate the standard and the knowledge and the general practice of the profession in our country.”
They said the current crop of professional Quantity Surveyors have a duty to bridge the gap between town and gown to ensure that young Nigerians studying to become professionals are put on the right trajectory.
President of the Board, Malam Murtala Aliyu, thanked the minister and the Federal Government for the opportunity and privilege given the members to serve, adding that the members of the profession were in a fit position to contribute to the economic growth of the country.
They expressed satisfaction that the board has been captured in this year's budget and pledged that with the collaboration of the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, it would carry out its job effectively.
Aliyu said the QSRBN was already working hand in hand with the Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS) on a cost database that will be used across the country.

HUNTSVILLE, Texas — Attorneys for a Texas inmate want the U.S. Supreme Court to halt their scheduled execution for the shooting deaths of a 5-year-old girl and their grandmother during a birthday party 10 years ago outside a Fort Worth apartment.
Former Fort Worth street gang member Erick Davila is set for lethal injection Wednesday evening.
Lawyers for the 31-year-old Davila argue it's improper for the elected Tarrant County district attorney to be involved in the case because they were the judge at Davila's 2009 trial. They also contend evidence that Davila may have been high on drugs at the time of the shooting improperly was withheld from defence attorneys.
State lawyers are contesting the arguments.
Davila was convicted of killing Queshawn Stevenson and their 48-year-old grandmother, Annette Stevenson.
Gossip: Could Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo be set to go to war over a possible transfer from Real Madrid?
One way to make your Gareth Bale transfer story stand out from the rest is to include the word BEEF in the headline in capital letters for no apparent reason.
That's the Star's clever ploy to spark intrigue in their latest report on the Welshman's potential move to Manchester United, although meat connoisseurs will be left disappointed because the article has nothing to do with food. It turns out the tabloid has been using the language of the street: and beef means war.
Specifically, it means war with Cristiano Ronaldo, with whom Bale is allegedly “furious” after their Real Madrid teammate hinted that they wanted to move to Old Trafford, mere minutes after Bale had done the same thing.
READ MORE: Croatia and Brazil will light up Anfield, says Croatian goal king Davor Suker
READ MORE: Salah injury petition: Nearly half a million people back punishment for Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos
These rival hints have caused the forwards “to BEEF” (indeed, the Star uses the verb) because Bale thinks Ronaldo is “playing transfer games” with Man Utd and pretending they want to move there, whereas Bale really does want to sign for the Red Devils because Zinedine Zidane never picks him.
A legitimate grievance perhaps, although it's unlikely that these beefs will damage Bale's chances of securing a return to the Premier League, with Spanish paper AS reporting that United are set to offer £122m to sign them imminently.
Chelsea and United want Barça left-back
The Red Devils are also eyeing a move for another El Clasico veteran in the shape (the exact human shape) of Jordi Alba. Sport says United are battling with Chelsea to sign the 29-year-old Barcelona left-back, who is currently involved in a contract stand-off at the Nou Camp.
Meanwhile, the Blues continue to be beefing with Napoli over the release clause in Maurizio Sarri's contract.
Story Continues
The Italian coach remains Roman Abramovich's top choice to replace Antonio Conte, but their opposite number Aurelio De Laurentiis is demanding £7m compensation to let the manager leave, despite the fact they have just appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri's successor.
Chelsea are refusing to pay that sum, raising the prospect of Napoli of having two managers next season, which could end up being the key to football success, you never know.
Roma name their price for Alisson
Roma will not let their goalkeeper Alisson move to Liverpool until after the World Cup and they will demand £79m for the 25-year-old Brazilian, reports the Guardian. The Italians originally only wanted half that amount, but they bumped up the price after watching Loris Karius' performance in the Champions League final.

Adding insult to injury for the German goalie is Giorgio Grassi, the president of third-tier Italian side Rimini FC, who has offered to take the keeper on a season-long loan deal in Serie C as a “birthday gift”. Thanks, Giorgio.
Elsewhere, Manchester City are hoping to get Riyad Mahrez from Leicester for £60m, which is substantially less than the £75m transfer fee mooted earlier in the week (Sun), West Ham are planning a defensive shake-up with moves for Barcelona centre-back Marlon Santos and Genoa centre-back Armando Izzo (Sky Sports) and Real Madrid are expected to beat Arsenal to the £53m signing of Atletico Madrid's Uruguayan defender Jose Gimenez (Talksport). Unless they have a change of heart and decides they would rather be team-mates with Carl Jenkinson than Ronaldo.

Mahama Ayariga says farming is not alternative livelihood to prevent illegal and small scale miners
Farming is not alternative livelihood to prevent illegal and small scale miners from their illicit activities, according to a former Minister of Environment Science, Technology and Innovation, Hon. Mahama Ayariga.
“We talk of farming as an alternative livelihood, who said they do not know they could farm? …they know there are farms and they could farm but will the amount they generate from farming be the same as what they are getting from galamsey”, the lawmaker asked.
” They know the government has provided fertilizer subsidies and they could farm but the illegal miners feel that this is not profitable for them especially the youth”, they observed.
According to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) lawmaker for Bawku Central Constituency, they once in a working visit then as minister observed that people in high places involved themselves in illegal mining.
“Whenever you find out there is gold somewhere sometimes the people at the agencies for licensing other people to mine end up having arrangements contrary to the mining laws”, Hon. Mahama Ayariga alleged.
This, according to him, makes it difficult for people to obtain mining licenses to do legal mining despite the ban by Ministry of Land and Natural Resources.
The private legal practitioner, therefore, opined the use of police/military taskforce to stop galamsey in the country is unnecessary suggestion easy mode of obtaining licensing will rather do the trick.

Igbo quit notice: Ethnic groups call for youth confab
By Levinus Nwabughiogu
ABUJA-Determined to douse the tensions arising from the 3-month quit notice to Igbo residents in the north and restore the country back to path of peace, a coalition of ethnic nationalities have sued for calm among Nigerian youths.
The nationalities also called on the federal government to urgently convoke a national youth confab, which would have Acting President Yemi Osinbajo in attendance.
Rising from a meeting in Abuja Wednesday, the groups also urged for a ceasefire among the various youth groups in the country.
In a communique raised at the end of the meeting, the groups said that the constitution of Nigeria guarantees Nigerians the right to live in any part of the country of their choice.
They added that the confab would provide Osinbajo an opportunity to hear directly the grievances of youth, stressing that it would also calm frayed nerves and restore the country to the path of unity.
According to the groups, their resolve to toe the path of peace was hinged on the intervention of former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi who they said advised them to remain calm.
The communique was signed by Comrade Eric Oluwale of the Yoruba Youths Council Worldwide and Secretary General, Ethnic National Youths Leaders; Comrade Emma Zompal of the Middle Belt Youth Council Worldwide; Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council; Barr. Oweilaemi Ereotubo of the Ijaw Youths Council; and Arewa Northern Youths Assembly led by Alhaji Musa Abdulahi.
The communique read in part: “Good citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we wish to express our concern over the quit notice to Igbos by Arewa youths last week. Nigeria's federal Constitution gives right to citizens of Nigeria to freely move to any part of the land and choose where to live without any form of discrimination and denial. We hereby declare the quit notice unconstitutional and treasonable.
“We condemned the quit notice served by Arewa youths‎ to Igbos resident in the North and have resolved for peace to reign in all quarters. The meeting has, however, instituted peace process of reconciling the north and the south east
“We are still insisting on restructuring of the country so as to guarantee an equitable federalism for peaceful co existence.
“For the collective interest of Nigeria, we are calling for a ceasefire among all the aggrieved youth groups in the country. Pushing this matter too far has grave implication for Nigeria and by extension, the youths.
“We have resolved to toe the line of peace owing to the fatherly advice from the former governor of Anambra State, Chief Peter Obi, the Okwute Ndigbo. The youths, without hesitation, are ready to heed their advice considering their towering reputation beyond the shores of Nigeria. They remain in history as the best Governor Anambra has ever had and for that singular reason, their intervention is welcome.
“Obi has made it clear to the youths that there is futility in disunity and songs of war. They have convinced us that we are better of together, united.
‎”In the light of the above, we call for immediate end to further verbal exchanges on the above matter. This is the time for us to unite and champion a common course for Nigeria's unity.
“However, the youths hereby resolved that there will be a national Youth confab in other to address fundamental problem confronting our dear country by July; date and venue will be communicated in due course.
“The confab must have in attendance the Acting President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. This shall be an opportunity for them to calm frayed nerves and restore the country to the path of unity.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is disputing a report that they watch hours of television each day, calling it, “Another false story.”
The president is pushing back against a report in The New York Times about their first year in office that mentioned they watch at least four hours of television a day, sometimes twice that amount.
Trump says on Twitter that they “seldom, if ever,” watches CNN or MSNBC, “both of which I consider Fake News.” The president says they also never watches CNN anchor Don Lemon's show, “CNN Tonight.”
The Times said its story was based on interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.
Trump has repeatedly lodged complaints about mainstream news outlets that they argue have covered their presidency unfairly and inaccurately.

Management tells us the visuals is almost ready and will be available right after the audio is officially released.
We just can't wait for this one
How did Cambridge Analytica get 50 million people's data?
With a little outside help. To understand the story, we need to rewind to 2014 when Aleksandr Kogan -- a psychology researcher at Cambridge University -- created a Facebook app called "thisisyourdigitallife" with a personality test that spit out some kind of personal prediction at the end. To build credibility, the app was originally labeled a "research app used by psychologists," but that was only part of the truth -- as it turned out, Cambridge Analytica covered more than $800,000 of Kogan's app development costs. (Kogan also got to keep a copy of the resulting data for their trouble.) Some US Facebook users took the personality test as a result of ads on services like Amazon's Mechanical Turk and were paid for their efforts, but it's unclear how many chose to take the test on their own.
All told, some 270,000 US users took the test, but CA obviously walked away with data on many more people than that. That's thanks to a very specific Facebook peculiarity.
If you have a Facebook account, you've almost certainly used Facebook Login before -- it lets you create an account with a third-party app or service (or log into an existing account) with your Facebook credentials. It's incredibly convenient, but by using Facebook Login, you're tacitly giving developers of Facebook apps access to certain kinds of information about yourself -- email address and public profile data, for instance, are available to developers by default.
In 2014, however, using Facebook Login didn't just mean you were offering up your own data -- some data about the people in your social network was up for grabs too. (Facebook later deprecated the API that let this happen because, well, it's just creepy.) Those thousands of people who logged in to Kogan's app and took the test might have gotten the personality predictions they were looking for, but they paid for them with information about their friends and loved ones. Whether those results were ultimately valuable is another story. Kogan themselves later said in an email to Cambridge coworkers (recently obtained by CNN) that they had provided "predicted personality scores" of 30 million American users to CA's parent company, but the results were "6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person's personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct."
Was this really a data breach?
For better or worse, no. Facebook's official line is that calling this a breach is "completely false," since the people who signed up for Kogan's app did so willingly. As a result, that the information gained through those app logins was obtained within the scope of Facebook's guidelines. In other words, despite how shady all of this seems, the system worked exactly the way it was supposed to. The breakdown happened later when Kogan broke Facebook's rules and provided that information to Cambridge Analytica.
What has Facebook done about all this?
When all of this went down, very little -- in public, anyway. In a statement in its online newsroom, Facebook admits that it learned about Kogan and Cambridge Analytica's "violation" in 2015 and "demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties they had given data to that the information had been destroyed." As it turns out, some of that personal data might not have been deleted after all -- Facebook says it is "aggressively" trying to determine whether that's true.
More troubling is the fact that, as noted by Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr in an interview with CBS, Facebook never contacted any of the users involved. (She also added that Facebook took threatened to sue The Guardian to prevent an exposé from being published, which obviously isn't a good look.) Facebook VR/AR VP Andrew "Boz" Bosworth posted a rough timeline of the events (along with answers to certain FB-centric questions) earlier today, and it seems likely that timeline will remain a point of focus as investigations continue.
Finally, on March 16, a day before many of the biggest Cambridge Analytica stories broke, Facebook suspended accounts belonging to CA and its parent firm. The move is widely read as an attempt on Facebook's part to clean up some of the mess before The Guardian and The New York Times ran their most damning reports. Then, in a somewhat unexpected move, Facebook also disabled Christopher Wylie's account and prevented them from using Whatsapp, the popular messaging app Facebook acquired in 2014. (Consider this a brief reminder of how much of your social world Facebook currently owns.)
Beyond that, some Facebook execs spent the weekend asserting that there was no actual data breach. Meanwhile, CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasn't said anything about the unfolding situation, though we can imagine their silence can't last for too much longer.
So what happens now?
Scrutiny, and lots of it. Now that all of this is out in the open, powerful people are taking an interest. On March 18, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) tweeted that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, adding that "it's clear these platforms can't police themselves." Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) sent a letter (PDF) to Zuckerberg the following day, requesting information like the number of times similar incidents have occurred within the past ten years and whether Facebook has ever notified "individual users about inappropriate collection, retention or subsequent use of their data by third parties."
Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves. I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say "trust us." Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary. — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) March 17, 2018
Meanwhile, in the UK, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix recently told the Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the company did not collect people's personal information through Facebook without consent. Since Nix lied, Committee chairperson Damian Collins has accused the CEO of peddling false statements and has called CA whistleblower Christopher Wylie to offer evidence to parliament. Even more promising, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham confirmed that they are seeking a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers.
BREAKING: Damian Collins, chair of UK parliament's news inquiry, has called Cambridge Analytica whistleblower @chrisinsilico to give evidence next week to parliament. I predict: fireworks. — Carole Cadwalladr (@carolecadwalla) March 19, 2018
And as far as Facebook is concerned, there are few people more powerful than its shareholders. We wouldn't be surprised to see Facebook's financials bounce around for a while, too -- as I write this, the company's share price is down nearly 7 percent, shaving billions of dollars off Facebook's market cap (and eating away at Zuckerberg's net worth.) The entire core of its business is built on a foundation of trust with its users, and incidents like this can do serious damage to that trust.
This is scary -- should I keep using Facebook?
Honestly, you should at least give serious consideration to deleting your account. If you're a Facebook user, then you and all of your Facebooking friends are collectively the single most valuable thing the company has. Its fortunes rise and fall when its user numbers ebb and flow. The old internet adage says "if you're not paying, you're the product," and this is a perfect example of that.
The data we offer Facebook freely is a commodity to be accessed, mashed up, scraped and targeted against. For some, the value of the platform is enough to override the dangers. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's worth taking a few minutes to dig into account's privacy, app and ad settings to limit the amount of data you unknowingly offer to the machine. But there's also nothing wrong with saying enough is enough. None of us will cough up a cent to get bombarded by fake news, inane quizzes and game requests. But that doesn't mean we aren't paying for Facebook.
NEW YORK — A Cameroonian-American writer detained as they tried to leave the Central African nation is facing charges over writings critical of its government, and family and friends are calling for public support in a campaign for their release.
Patrice Nganang, a professor at New York's Stony Brook University, is due to go before a prosecutor in the coming week, according to an account from their wife that was sent to fellow Stony Brook professor Robert Harvey. Nganang was detained on Thursday as they were trying to leave Cameroon to join their wife in Zimbabwe.
Nganang and their attorney were informed of the charges against them at a hearing with judiciary police and were told the charges include accusations of insulting Cameroon President Paul Biya and issuing a death threat.
Nganang has been critical of how Biya, in power since 1982, has handled a secessionist movement in some English-speaking areas. They wrote an article that was published shortly before they were detained.
At the judiciary police hearing Saturday, Nganang's lawyer said they didn't represent a threat because they had never worked with any violent or armed groups and had always been a peaceful activist. A prosecutor will decide what happens with the case moving forward.
Nganang's supporters called for an outpouring of support for him, suggesting actions including calling the Cameroon embassy to demand their release; getting in touch with the U.S. Department of State and federal elected officials; reaching out to advocates like Amnesty International or the Committee to Protect Journalists; and spreading the campaign through social media.
Have you ever had a straight guy tell you there's a gay guy at work and then get completely flummoxed when you ask them whether the guy is hot, even though they know the answer?
Michael Henry and Travis Coles sort out the meaning behind that wishy-washy behavior in another on-the-street investigation.
PISCATAWAY, N.J. — Geo Baker was known for their shooting abilities on the recruiting circuit. It turns out they can be a good facilitator too.
The first-year student had their first career double-double with 19 points and 11 assists, while fellow backcourt mates Corey Sanders had 19 points and Mike Williams had 17 points to lead Rutgers past Fairleigh Dickinson 92-54 Saturday night.
The trio was efficient from the floor as Baker went 7 of 11 from the field and 4 of 5 from the free-throw line, Sanders went 8-of-14 shooting and Williams was 5 of 7 from the field and 6 of 6 from the free-throw line.
“It's showing now that if we keep things together we can be a really scary backcourt,” Sanders said.
While Baker's distributing was impressive, coach Steve Pikiell was happier that they cut down their turnovers after six the previous game against NJIT.
“To go 11 and 1, I'm more excited about the one turnover,” Pikiell said.
Baker attested the change from two nights ago to making sure they were locked in.
“Me and coach had a really good conversation after the last game just talking about being focused every game and every game counts,” Baker said. “I came in today and I brought that focus and wanted to share the ball.”
FDU took a 6-3 lead at 17:59 when Darnell Edge hit a 3-pointer off a pass from Darian Anderson. That's as long as it would be a competitive game.
At 24-16, Rutgers went on a 22-2 run, making 11 straight field goals in a five-minute stretch as a 46-18 game was 50-22 at the break.
FDU was led by Noah Morgan and Darian Anderson, who had 13 and 12 points, respectively.
“We've had a really difficult stretch here. We've been playing every game on the road against really good teams. That's the reality, everyone in our league is doing it. But right now, we are in the gauntlet,” FDU coach Greg Herenda said, adding, “tonight I think was a culmination of a lot of things, but ultimately it was Rutgers with a really strong performance. They were really really good and you have to give those guys credit.”
BIG PICTURE
Fairleigh Dickinson: The Knights are in the midst of a seven-game road trip in which they are looking for their first road victory of the season. They are currently 0-5 away from the Rothman Center.
Rutgers: Playing five games in 10 days, the Scarlet Knights were playing a game with only one day to prep for the third straight time. The game also marked the second of five straight games against metro area teams. However, outside of No. 19 Seton Hall, none of the teams should pose much of a challenge for Rutgers.
EJECTED
Nadi Beciri was charged with a technical foul with 11:21 left in the game after they appeared to punch Sanders in the face while setting a pick. The FDU forward was charged with a flagrant two foul, which resulted in their ejection.
UP NEXT
Fairleigh Dickinson: The Knights have a week off before playing at NJIT.
Rutgers: Hosts Fordham on Tuesday night.
Ian McKellen took a minor role in Coronation Street when they had already played Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings. Johnny Depp still thinks their appearance in The Fast Show is their best performance ever. Neither, however, is quite up there with Sigourney Weaver's cameo in Doc Martin.
Advertisement
In 2015, Weaver turned up in Portwenn as a stubborn American tourist, in a jungle hat, denim shirt and rucksack. Feeling unwell, the American Tourist (as they were billed) breezed into the chemist's and demanded prescription-only medicine. Mrs Tishell, behind the counter, refused to comply.
So the American went to see Doc Martin, handed their long-suffering receptionist a copy of The Assertive Female and was surprised by the doctor's forthright manner. When they suggested they might feel better if they smiled, they pretended their accent was impenetrable.
None of Doc Martin's seven million viewers could quite believe their eyes. What on earth was the star of Alien, Ghostbusters and Avatar doing in the sleepy village of Portwenn? The answer, in fact, is simple: they have been best friends with Selina Cadell, who plays Mrs Tishell, since they met in 1974.
So how did the guest role come about? By chance, Weaver was on The Jonathan Ross Show with Martin Clunes and told them they had always meant to visit Cadell in Cornwall – whereupon Clunes's producer wife Philippa Braithwaite asked them if she'd like a cameo. It was so successful that Weaver is back in the jungle hat for this week's final episode.
It's initially a little strange to see Weaver, 68, and Cadell, 64, chatting in a break from filming. The former is a nearly 6ft, three-times Oscar-nominated film star; the latter, a comparatively diminutive 5ft 5in, is a versatile TV and theatre actor and director. Yet the two women get on famously.
We talk first in Weaver's trailer, a minute's walk from the converted barn that acts as an interior studio, and later at the St Enodoc Hotel in nearby Rock, where they often have dinner together. They do what all old friends do: talk easily and warmly, touch each other on the shoulder to show empathy – and laugh uproariously.
Selina Cadell on Sigourney Weaver
When my friend Peter first mentioned Sigourney, a friend of theirs from Yale Drama School, I thought it was an extraordinary name. Very exotic. Peter and I were to meet them in a pub in London's Swiss Cottage that looked like a chalet and was surrounded by roads.
Sigourney was slightly late. I looked up to see this wonderful gazelle-like creature leaping over the small wall that separated us from the road. They were wearing a circular skirt, white ankle socks and trainers. I was struck by their height and incredible beauty.
It was the summer of 1974 and we were so young, still in our early 20s. They were only supposed to be in London for a few weeks, but they ended up staying for the whole summer.
We clicked and became close friends really quickly. Our backgrounds were in many ways very different, but in other ways similar; both our mothers had been to Rada [the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art].
Sig's mother was the English actor Elizabeth Inglis, who appeared in Hitchcock's The 39 Steps. I've never discussed this with her, but to me it made Sig feel more European.
New Yorkers can be quite intimidating, but they aren't. Anyway, we ended up spending the whole summer bombing around in my yellow Renault 4. We giggled until it hurt.
We've had a couple of moments when we've thought we were going to burst laughing. We have, for example, always shared a horror of people getting too intense for words about acting. Sig is more mischievous than the world realises. She's like a little imp.
We've spent a lot of time laughing at things we shouldn't, from evensong in Chichester Cathedral that first summer to the Actors' Studio in New York. Laughter is a great glue.
After Sig returned to New York in the autumn of 1974, we talked on the phone quite regularly and I often got jobs in the theatre there so we frequently hooked up. When they got Alien, they left a message at the stage door of the Salisbury Playhouse in Wiltshire, where I was doing a panto.
I had to walk up to the roundabout to find a phone box, which I fed a never ending pile of coins because it was an international call. I was thrilled that she'd got the part of Ripley. My friend was going to be in a Hollywood movie! Plus it meant they would be filming at Shepperton and I'd see more of them
Sig married six months before me in 1984 and asked me to be their best woman in Hawaii, where their husband Jim [Simpson] is from, but I'd been cast in Agatha Christie's Miss Marple: A Pocket Full of Rye and couldn't go. I was so upset.
Then they couldn't come to my wedding because they were at the César Awards in Paris. My husband and I passed through Paris on our honeymoon. I noticed this woman at the station who was a vision in a midnight-blue floaty sequinned dress with some kind of duffel coat around it.
I thought, “What an extraordinary woman.” As we got closer, I realised it was Sig. They bombarded us with cooked rice, because it was the closest thing to confetti they could find.
They thrust a small Fortnam & Mason hamper into our hands that contained a little bit of everything delicious you can imagine. I have kept the crepe paper adorned with red hearts and the little champagne glasses. I keep my Christmas decorations in the hamper now.
I don't want to get sentimental about Sig, but… I love visiting Sig in their house in the Adirondacks in upstate New York. When our kids were younger we spent holidays and Christmasses together, but now we mostly discuss work.
We admit our fears to each other, which is probably rare among actors. I've spent quite of a lot of time reminding Sig that she's a famous, brilliant, wonderful actor.
Filming Doc Martin together is a joy, but we'd love to work together properly, perhaps on a comedy. We still have such a giggle and she's still the girl who jumped over the pub wall all those years ago. We've grown up together.
Sigourney Weaver on Selina Cadell
I loved Selina as soon as we met in that London pub. We stayed in touch the old-fashioned way after that first summer in London, sending letters and postcards. When I found out I'd got the part of Ripley in Alien, I phoned my parents and then Selina. I was thrilled that I was going to be filming in London.
When you have a friend who's also an actor, but is as generous and as well-balanced as Selina, then you can call them up and tell them about a great job. There were plenty of friends I wouldn't have been able to call, because their first instinct would've been, “Why am I not getting a movie?” But I knew she'd be happy for me.
Selina says that people don't see me as she'd like them to. But Ripley didn't have time to be mischievous – one person dies after the other in Alien – and often people's perceptions of you are based on the first few films you do.
I've been very lucky to be in high-profile films, but I'm always looking for comedies. I'd love to do a comedy with Selina; we have stories that we work on periodically.
But they are very busy directing and writing and I'm filming Avatar 2 and 3, taking a break, then filming 4 and 5.
In the meantime, I'm so happy to be working on Doc Martin. They often talked about it, but I hadn't realised it was a comedy. I kept trying to visit Selina here in Cornwall, but it never worked out.
Then, wonderfully, I was on The Jonathan Ross Show with Martin Clunes. He's such a lovely guy and they beam with bonhomie. I had a drink with them and their wife Philippa in the green room and they suggested I come on the show.
I said, “Are you kidding? I'd love to!” They sent messages via Selina asking if I'd appear in series seven and again in series eight. Of course I did! I made Avatar rework their schedules so I could be here.
People expect me to behave in a grand manner, but it's not like I'm John Travolta. Having a cameo in Doc Martin is a dream job for me. Cornwall is the most beautiful place. I've read every novel about it I can and I watch Poldark on my iPad.
I identify strongly with my British heritage. I was sent on a plane on my own to meet my maternal grandmother when I was 11, which was thrilling. I remember saying to this sweet woman who'd had nine children, “You're my bloody relation!” I thought it was so funny. They just shook their head and muttered, “This half-American child…”
I also spent a lot of time in Europe with my mother and we lived in France for a few years when I was 12. I've always been grateful to have had the chance to live somewhere other than America. My husband and I have watched every single episode of Escape to the Country and I've seen pretty much all of England while travelling to see Selina in various plays. Some day we might move here. I hear so much laughter around me in Cornwall. In America we're not laughing nearly as much.

I admire you British: when things get tough, you reach for humour. Not firearms. I'd love to live closer to Selina, but however far away they might be, they are always with me. When I'm working I start each day by listening to a tape they recorded for me ten years ago. They tell me how to relax, how to catch my breath. It's my safe place.

At least 62,140 candidates will have to re-write university admission examinations as the Joint Examination and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has delisted computer-based centres (CBT) from board examination as a result of technical deficiencies, extortion, organised examination malpractice and other infractions. The board also suspended 24 centres for one year due to technical issues. It said …

Three years ago, my wages were stolen. I worked for $15 an hour with no penalty rates in a local restaurant. I can still smell the sweat and food scraps stuck to my clothes, hear the screaming from the hot kitchen and feel the sinking disappointment when opening my weekly envelope of cash, poorly hidden beneath the register. “They must have made a mistake,” I thought at first. But it was no mistake.
My bosses were cordially duplicitous. They offered staff free pizza, as if this compensated more than halving our weekend wages. They were mostly friendly and light-hearted, as if this excused forgoing breaks and superannuation. Their image as benevolent "regular mums and dads" slowly crumbled as precarity, trying conditions and poor recompense left a sour taste in my mouth.
AUSTIN, Texas — Chris Del Conte is leaving TCU to take over the University of Texas' athletic department.
The surprise move was announced Saturday by Texas President Greg Fenves, and Del Conte will start their new job Monday. They succeed Mike Perrin, who was hired in 2015 after former athletic director Steve Patterson was forced out after less than two years.
At TCU, Del Conte led the Horned Frogs into the Big 12 and heled mould a program that turned them into a football power.
While Perrin had never been viewed as a long-term athletic director, Texas had made no hint it was looking to replace them before their employment agreement expired in late 2018. Texas said Perrin will stay on as an adviser for Del Conte.
“Mike has been a trusted partner and friend and will forever have my gratitude and the gratitude of Longhorn Nation,” Fenves said.
“Chris has the experience, vision and character that's needed for Texas to build on the Longhorns' rich legacy and to continue winning with integrity for years to come. They know the state of Texas, supports student-athletes, understands the media landscape of college sports, and is one of the best athletics directors in the country,” Fenves said.
Del Conte will have the title of vice-president of intercollegiate athletics at Texas. Longhorns women's athletic director Chris Plonsky will still lead the women's athletic department and will report to Del Conte.
A person with knowledge of Del Conte's contract told The Associated Press they have a seven-year deal with an annual salary starting at $1.3 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the school was not yet ready to publicly release contract details. The contract must still be approved by the Texas board of regents
Del Conte will lead one of the largest and wealthiest athletic programs in the country and one that is starved for success on the football field. After three straight losing seasons, the Longhorns (6-6) play in the Texas Bowl under first-year coach Tom Herman. Del Conte will lead a basketball program that plans to build a new on-campus arena after 40 years in the Frank Erwin Center
But while football is struggling, Texas appears set for long-term success across the athletic department. The women's basketball and volleyball programs rank among the best in the country, baseball was resurgent last season in coach David Pierce's first season, and the swimming and diving programs routinely compete for national titles. Men's basketball finished last in the Big 12 last season, but coach Shaka Smart is showing signs of quickly turning their program around.
Del Conte led the TCU program for nine years and recently signed football coach Gary Patterson to a contract extension through 2022. The Horned Frogs played last week in the Big 12 championship game. Under Del Conte, TCU made a $170 million upgrade to its football stadium and a $72 million renovation of its basketball facility, and the baseball team made the College World Series the last three seasons.
“I firmly believe that TCU's athletics program is positioned for continued future growth and success,” Del Conte said. “After being with President Fenves and hearing their vision for the future of The University of Texas, I couldn't be more honoured to join their leadership team.”

SAN MATEO (KRON) — A woman woke up to a mountain lion snatching their dog off of their bed at a Pescadero home early Monday morning, according to deputies.
At around 3 a.m., a woman called 911 reporting that their dog was taken by a mountain lion from their home in the area of 800 Native Sons Road.
The woman told deputies they and a child were sleeping in a bedroom with their 15-pound Portuguese Podengo at the foot of the bed.
They had left the bedroom's French doors partially open to let the dog out.
In the middle of the night, the woman woke up to their dog barking aggressively.
They looked up at the French doors and saw a shadow of an animal enter the room.
The animal took the small dog from the bed and walked out, they told deputies.
The woman then went outside with a flashlight to look for their dog. They saw large wet paw prints at the entrance to the bedroom and called 911.
Deputies searched the area and also found paw prints similar to a mountain lion.
Authorities want to remind residents to lock and secure their home's doors and windows.

To take a drive in a traditional, fenderless hot rod is a life-changing event for many, and it's something that Chris Ball believes everyone into antique cars should experience.
For Chris, of Millworks Hot Rods & Supply Co. in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, Model A hot rods in particular provide the best experience on the open road. And they seem to be the largest source of inspiration for their builds. They tend to come back to this style as the foundation for their next “great hot rod idea.”
Chris was influenced by their father's builds and raised in the hobby along with their brother Dave. They started the journey into building early hot rods with a '29 Model A roadster pickup that was powered by a Buick nailhead. Not long after followed a '28 Model A tudor running a flathead, thus spreading the spectrum into calmer and well-mannered fenderless hot rods. Chris thought at one point this phase of build style was covered, and they sought to move on with full-fendered later 1930s to 1940s hot rods and customs. After more than 25 years of experience and a matured passion for the culture, Chris sold these cars, and they realized that their original inspiration still haunted their conscience.
One day Chris was chatting with friend Rich Willet, a local hot rod legend, about work in their shop, and unfinished projects in particular. That brought up the topic of project cars hanging around in the area, and a '28 Model A phaetons that just happened to be for sale.
The frame-off had been started more than 20 years before. Over the course of the last 15 years, more had been done to the project as funding became available, to chip away at completing it. This car instantly sparked an interest with Chris, as it was the type of project that would keep them up at night thinking of interesting approaches to build a Model A.
Chris asked more questions about the car, its chassis, front axle, rearend, engine, and the condition of the sheetmetal to see what it would involve. The answers only got Chris more excited about what seemed a long-seasoned project that would take many years and owners to finally see the light of day.
Chris discovered the car sat on an original 1932 chassis that retained its factory holes and was partially boxed, with the rear horns bobbed. The rear crossmember had been removed and a Model A rear added. The center crossmember had also been removed, and a custom fabricated one was used for fitment. The suspension already had early Ford spindles and brakes, Model A springs with reversed eyes, and 1939 split wishbones. A 331 Caddy mill came with the car, and other notable items that were in a box included the old chrome 1928-'29 dash rail, the aristocrat accessory dash panel, an original 1928-'29 chrome grille shell, 1931 Chrysler imperial hood ornament, and a 1928 codfish license plate, which for Chris, being a Massachusetts resident, was the cherry on top!
Speaking of cherry, the Argentinian phaeton body was almost pristine, and what made the car truly unique was that it was right-hand drive. Chris knew they had to have it, and managed to wiggle their way into a suitable deal.
Now the project had their wheels turning, trying to decide in what direction to take the build. While it had already had a lot of work done on it, the project lacked clear direction, which was perfect for Chris. They would find the right road for this phaeton.
At first Chris thought about making it a mid- to late-1950s Autorama show rod, but that quickly changed after a few beers and a long discussion with business partner and brother Dave. Dave was hell-bent on Chris making the car worthy of racing. Who knows, maybe it would land on the beach at Wildwood, New Jersey?
Wanting that period-correct racing appeal would mean adding a front air dam, tonneau cover, and aluminum hood, and removing the windshield and headlights. Using post-war salt flat and beach racing history, they would end up with their interpretation of a purpose-built hot rod.
For their purposes, the Cadillac engine had to go, and their powerplant of choice came via a longtime friend and another New England legend, Tommy Caruso. It just so happened they had a strong 1946 Mercury 59AB that had been bored 0.060 over and freshened in recent years using cast iron heads milled 0.080 for a compression bump. Chris then gathered up a Stromberg 97 on a polished 1934 Ford ported aluminum manifold, and a 1939 Top Loader 78 case with later 27-tooth gears from around the shop.
With the gear under their arm Chris began the engine transplant. They used a F1 truck open-drive setup for the trans and a F1 3.54:1 banjo rear, which they had around the shop. The Top Loader and the shifter kinks were worked out, while an early Bell steering arm was connected to a 1949 F1 steering box. After many discussions about speed tricks with Tommy and trying to stay on budget, the combo turned out to be a good one once put to the test. The engine and trans would be a strong runner, making a great combo for some high eighth-mile trap speeds.
After all the fitment checks came the plumbing and wiring before moving onto the body and sheetmetal fabrication. This is when some of the ideas floating around in Chris and Dave's heads were laid out, including the tonneau, alloy hood, and front air dam that had been in their initial plans. Chris converted the phaeton to left-hand drive, added Brookville front doors, and moved the front seat pan 4 inches back to allow for more legroom. They reinstalled the stock seats and put some Stewart-Warner gauges in the chrome dash.
The phaeton did make it to The Race of Gentlemen in 2017, where it ran strong! Going 8-1 brought it plenty of attention.
With that under Chris's belt, maybe it's time to bring back the original plan of a late-1950's Autorama entry? Or maybe not. It did serve well as a post-war race car, and maybe that's what best suits it.
SENATE AND THE ANTI-GRAFT LAW
The executive bill passed by the Senate will help in tracking down corrupt elements
The Senate recently passed a bill to enhance the nation's anti-corruption war by ensuring that suspects do not evade justice locally and enjoy the proceeds of their crimes abroad. This followed the adoption of the report of its Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, and Foreign Affairs.
An executive bill, it is for mutual assistance in criminal matters between Nigeria and other foreign states to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, restraining, recovery, forfeiture and confiscation of proceeds, property and other instrumentalities of crimes. It is intended to provide a legal framework that will strengthen the fight against corruption, terrorism, economic and financial crimes, money laundering and other related offences. The bill is also intended to effect the temporary transfer of persons in custody to assist in investigations or appear as witnesses, facilitate obtaining and preserving of computer data, and providing any other assistance that is not contrary to the law of the requesting state.
In summary, the bill, which provides to repeal the Money Laundering Act of 2011 prohibits money laundering activities, expands the scope of money laundering offences, provides protection for employees of various institutions and provides appropriate penalties for offences.
When concurred to by the House of Representatives, and signed into law by the President (which is expected since it is an executive bill) Nigeria would be able to request that any country where a money laundering suspect is resident can prosecute such person in line with the relevant laws of that country. Nigeria can also supply such country with evidence to further the case against the suspect.
This bill is therefore considered a critical component of the country's anti-corruption war, which would facilitate the required collaboration to prevent individuals from escaping prosecution and justice by taking refuge in another country. In this age of globalisation and the increasing cross border form of crimes, the passage of this bill is commendable.
While some may choose to criticise the bill as an ‘outsourcing' of justice, it remains a legal process to ensure justice against criminals, and deterring potential money launderers for whatever purposes. In this case, the law is a necessary means to an end, where the eyes should be kept on the prize.
We commend the passage of the bill. But it is necessary to point out that without the necessary political will, the aims and objectives of the bill would not be achieved. We have always canvassed the need to build strong institutions, and we are again doing that. Anti- corruption agencies that are subject to the whims of the powers that be would not be effective in implementing this law.
For instance: would the authorities have the courage to seek transfer of a crony of the president or be willing to supply necessary evidence that could ensure the conviction of someone in the good books of the president? This consideration is necessary particularly as cases of corruption seem to fizzle out the moment a ‘suspect' politician renounces their party and decamps to the ruling one.
Again, the anti-graft agencies themselves have to get more serious and thorough with their investigations. Media trials would not be enough to secure convictions in climes where the justice system is based on facts, and not sensationalism or hearsay. These are not enough even in local courts as evidenced by the inability to secure any notable conviction despite the mudslinging of ‘suspects' of stolen national funds in the recent times.
The message therefore is clear: If the anti-graft agencies do not get their act together, invest time in credible and reliable investigations, partnership countries would not take Nigeria serious.

Hollyoaks hots up next week when a fire breaks out at the McQueen house. Is tragedy set to strike for one of the soap's most popular families? And is the blaze an accident or does someone deliberately set out to burn the place down?
Advertisement
The explosive storyline kicks off on Tuesday's E4 episode when the inferno begins. By the next day flames have engulfed the McQueen residence and the fire has spiralled out of control.
In sensational pictures released today, no characters appear to be in the house as firefighters battle to stop the building from burning, but could this be a bluff to put us off the scent? Are some shock exits ahead?
A line-up of characters in another image gives us a clue as to who's involved and who's potentially in danger, showing Goldie (released from prison days before the fire), Myra and Prince representing the McQueens, firefighter Leela Lomax, Jesse Donovan and a very grave looking Adam Donovan.
Could the fire be linked to Adam's secret betrayal of gangster dad Glenn as they plot with the police to try and bring them down? Has Goldie got on the wrong side of their cellmate and brought trouble back to the village in the form of a vengeful arson attack? Or is Myra pulling an insurance job?
Hollyoaks continues weeknights on E4 at 7pm and on Channel 4 at 6.30pm.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Nick Mangold was the anchor of the New York Jets' offensive line for 11 seasons, a smart, reliable and tough dude who was one of the franchise's most consistently good players.
Their sharp wit and sarcasm made them a favourite of teammates and fans. Mangold also rocked a big, bushy beard and long blond hair that made them look more like they belonged on a Viking ship than a football field.
But from 2006 until through 2016, Mangold was one of the NFL's best players at their position. On Tuesday, they were again the centre of attention as they signed a one-day contract with the Jets to officially retire as a member of the team.
“I've had the good fortune of signing three contracts with the New York Jets,” Mangold said while holding their 3-year-old daughter Eloise. “This was the first one I signed with a child on my lap.”
The 34-year-old Mangold, wearing their Jets cap backward as they always did during their playing days, was honoured during a ceremony that included a framed No. 74 jersey displayed on the podium, a video featuring career highlights and some music from Dave Matthews Band — one of their favourites — playing over the speakers as guests arrived.
The team feted the seven-time Pro Bowl selection, who announced their retirement last week , with their wife Jennifer and their three children in attendance, along with several other members of their family, including their sister Holley, a member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic weightlifting team. Former teammates D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Brandon Moore and Willie Colon were there, too, as was former Jets centre John Schmitt from the 1969 Super Bowl-winning team, and current coach Todd Bowles and general manager Mike Maccagnan.
Mangold was a first-round draft pick out of Ohio State in 2006 and immediately became a starter for New York. They made their first Pro Bowl in 2008, and finished with the second-most all-star honours in franchise history. Only offensive tackle Winston Hill with eight AFL/NFL selections has more.
“We knew they were smart, we knew they were tough and we knew they would give us everything they had on the field,” acting owner Christopher Johnson said of the team drafting Mangold.
“What we didn't know was how much they would embrace our organization and this community. My vivid memories of them are running out of the tunnel wearing a first responders' hat, carrying the American flag or serving as Santa Claus for a charity event.
“Best Santa Claus ever, by the way.”
Mangold played in only eight games in 2016 because of ankle and foot injuries that landed them on the injured reserve list for the final month. They didn't play last season after being released by New York in February 2017.
“Going through the injury was difficult,” Mangold said. “But then as I was rehabbing and realized that I probably wouldn't be able to play at the level I wanted to play at and going through the (2017) season, I always thought that I was going to miss it. Like, something was going to happen where I'd miss it and be like, ‘I need to be out there. I need to be on the field.' And that never came.
“That's kind of where I knew: I'm in a good spot.”
Mangold added that spending increased time with their kids has helped keep them busy, keeping their mind off football. There were, however, some things they have missed.
“The hot and cold tubs,” they said, drawing laughs. “It's really difficult to do that at home.”
There was also the camaraderie of being with teammates, trying to deliver wins for the Jets.
“But, as far as football, I did what I could do,” Mangold said. “And I was done.”
Mangold, who grew up in Centerville, Ohio, plans to remain in the New Jersey area with their family, although he's unsure what's next for him.
“Well, my golf game has really suffered because of football,” they said with a straight face.
“So, I'm looking forward to improving on that. Beyond that, I don't know. It's funny being retired at 34 and your career's over at 34 when there's still so much left to do.”
Maybe Mangold will eventually find their way into the political game. A report earlier this year linked them to a potential seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“I found it funny when that came out because that was based off of a five-minute conversation,” Mangold said with a laugh. “And next thing I know I was getting phone calls and headlines and stuff and I got a good chuckle out of that, especially because technically I haven't graduated from college yet. So, I don't think I'm qualified.”
Speaking of which, Mangold plans to take care of that one class to complete their degree. Until then, though, he'll enjoy celebrating one of the best careers in Jets history.
“To play in this city and be a part of it for 11 years,” Mangold said, “has been one of the greatest things I could have ever asked for.”

The expensive series price of -900 (bet $900 to win $100) at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com for the Golden State Warriors shows just how tough the 2018 NBA Finals is expected to be for LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
And for Game 1 on Thursday the Warriors are listed as 12-point favorites on the NBA Finals odds versus the Cavaliers, who have seen James turn in one of the most remarkable postseasons of their career. Without the departed Kyrie Irving and injured Kevin Love (concussion) in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James had 35 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists while playing all 48 minutes as Cleveland eliminated the Boston Celtics 87-79 on Sunday.
A day later, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 15 three-pointers and 80 points in a 101-92 Golden State victory against the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors not only overcame a double-digit halftime deficit for the second straight game to win, but more impressively covered the spread both times after losing the previous two games by a total of seven points.
The Cavaliers are +675 underdogs (bet $100 to win $675) on the series prices for this year's NBA Finals, and for good reason. Unlike 2016 when Cleveland had Irving and Love and Golden State did not have Durant, there are simply too many individual matchups working in favor of the defending NBA champion Warriors and against the Cavaliers in this series.
Since Golden State lost four straight games to Cleveland between the last three games of the 2016 NBA Finals and the first regular-season matchup the following season, the Warriors have gone 7-1 straight up and 6-1-1 against the spread in the past eight meetings, according to the OddsShark NBA Database.
The key addition for the Warriors that helped them immensely during that recent stretch is Durant, the 2017 NBA Finals MVP. James will likely be the best player on the court in this year's NBA Finals, but Durant's presence could prevent that from making enough of a difference to impact the final outcome of the series.

The Killers' Brandon Flowers and Ronnie Vannucci appeared on Song Exploder, a podcast that features musicians analyzing their own work. In the episode, the Las Vegas rockers discuss “Rut,” a track from their recent album Wonderful Wonderful.
As Flowers describes it, “Rut” originated on the tour for their 2014 solo EP The Desired Effect. They wanted to play a song that wasn't on the EP and would introduce the show. Fiddling with chord progressions and piano notes over time, Flowers eventually brought the track to the band for their input. Vannucci, the band's drummer, adapted their percussion and added loops to bring it to life and give it that signature Killers snazz.
The lyrical inspiration came from Flower's wife, Tana Mundkowsky. Without giving explicit examples, Flowers said they experience PTSD due to a traumatizing childhood.
“I, of course, okayed it with her, but that ended up being a big part of this record,” Flowers says. “And so the song is from my wife's point of view, and it's from their perspective. And it's about resilience. So, she's singing to me. It's almost like this submission, it's them accepting like, ‘I'm facing this thing.'” Flowers' voice was altered accordingly to take on a more feminine pitch.

The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):
5:30 a.m.
Crews aided by calm overnight winds kept a wall of flames from descending from mountains into coastal towns after a huge Southern California wildfire exploded in size over the weekend.
Thousands remain under evacuation orders Monday as the fire churns west through foothill areas of Carpinteria and Montecito, Santa Barbara County seaside towns about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. Much of the fire's new growth occurred on the eastern and northern fronts into unoccupied areas of Los Padres National Forest.
The fire, which had already destroyed more than 750 buildings, burned six more in Carpinteria on Sunday. It's just 10 percent contained after burning nearly 360 square miles (930 square kilometers).
Officials say the blaze, which broke out a week ago in neighboring Ventura County, is now the 5th largest in California history.

That was definitely one to forget.
The usual air of positivity that comes with the beginning of a new year quickly vanished with an abject Chester FC performance that saw them dispatched 3-0 by Solihull Moors at the Lookers Vauxhall Stadium.
It meant back-to-back defeats for the Blues and saw them drop to 10th in the National League, but it is important not to forget all that has gone before and the efforts of the players so far this season.
That being said, yesterday was one to forget and it was hard to pick too many positives from that performance. Here's our ratings.
Alex Lynch – 6/10
At fault for the second goal when they made a hash of coming for an in-swinging free-kick, allowing Liam Daly to rifle home. Some smart saves, though, and an excellent one-handed stop to deny Omari Sterling-James in the first half.
Luke George – 4/10
The defence struggled time and time again against Moors and Sterling-James, who operated on both flanks during the game, gave George a torrid time and they always looked vulnerable.

Sam Hughes – 5/10
Hit the bar with a header but wasn't anywhere near their usual standards.
Ryan Astles – 5/10
Probably their poorest performance of the season. The usual defensive steel wasn't there and it will be a game they will quickly want to forget.
Evan Horwood – 5/10
Hit the post with a free-kick but struggled against the pace of Moors coming forward. Substituted at half time with an injury.
Elliott Durrell – 5/10
Wasn't a factor for much of the game and failed to find any space to operate in. Did threaten on occasion.
Jordan Chapell – 5/10
Showed some signs of brightness in the opening 15 minutes but made little impact for much of the contest.

Ryan Lloyd – 5/10
Their last game in a Chester shirt following the end of their loan spell and not the way they would have wanted to sign off. Nothing came off for him.
Tom Shaw – 6/10
Chester's best player, but that isn't really saying a lot. They tried their best to add some bite in midfield and get things moving but was very much on their own in that regard.

Kane Richards – 4/10
A peripheral figure for much of the contest as the Blues failed to make any inroads in attack.
James Alabi – 5/10
Given little to no service, Alabi cut a lonely figure up front for long periods.
Substitutes
Theo Vassell (on for Horwood – 46 minutes) 6/10
Considering it was their first taste of football since October they did ok from the bench and at least tried to aid the effort going forward.
Other ratings
Entertainment value – 2/10
A healthy crowd in at the Lookers Vauxhall Stadium and they winter chill wasn't helped by the performance on offer. Many had left with 10 minutes to go.

Referee rating (Peter Wright) – 4/10
These poor referees are just par for the course now, it seems. Another fussy official who seemed intent of stopping the flow of the game, making a series of bizarre calls. Definitely not a 'homer'.
Atmosphere – 3/10
It's hard to be banging the drum to a performance like that and, despite offering up some hope in the opening 15 minutes, Chester gave their home fans very little to cheer.
The embarrassing antics of one of the Solihull coaches, who revelled in goading Blues fans, did raise the temperature slightly.
And while everyone is entitled to their opinion, hearing some of the criticism for Jon McCarthy from a minority was slightly unsettling for many givens the run that the club has just been on.
In Todd Miller's prescient new book, Storming the Wall: Climate Change, Migration, and Homeland Security, the Tucson journalist and author travels the globe to document how climate disasters are uprooting people from their homes. Miller visits the Philippines in the wake of 2013's devastating Typhoon Haiyan, as well as Central America and other global hot spots, documenting a rapidly changing world of rising sea levels, melting ice caps and border walls guarded by machine gun-toting men. They walk on a pilgrimage with climate activists to the United Nations' climate summit in Paris, where a former Filipino negotiator turned activist tells Miller a grassroots movement is the only solution to push wealthier nations to act: “Solidarity is not an alternative, it is not an option, it is our only chance.” Despite rampant climate-change denialism in Washington, including in Trump's White House, the military and the Department of Homeland Security already accept that the threat is real. As Miller writes, the government has “begun preparing for the future dislocations of people, global instabilities and threats to U.S. political and economic interests due to climate destabilization.” YOU Can Support The Texas Observer Today Stay Informed Sign up for our weekly newsletter Spread the Word Give a friend a gift subscription Despite the dire predictions, Miller told the Observer that there is much to hope for and that they were inspired by the resilience they found among communities around the globe. THE TEXAS OBSERVER: You traveled the world reporting for this book. What are some of the moments that stood out?
TODD MILLER: The Philippines were definitely an eye-opener. It was like going to a place that had been bombed in a war, but it wasn't a war; it was the climate shifting that was causing the destruction. Especially in the city of Tacloban, which had been hit by Typhoon Haiyan, the most powerful storm ever recorded. I did the interviews a year after the storm hit, but it was all still really vivid. It was like getting punched in the gut just seeing and understanding the changes that are already happening — right here and right now — and that I hadn't fully imagined until that point. Did the climate impacts feel even more personal because your grandmother is from the Philippines? Yes. I went to the small island of Marinduque, south of Manila, where my grandmother is from. I had heard stories about the island all through my childhood, and on one hand it was incredible to go to this place I'd heard about all my life and seek out members of my family. But it also became clear that the island is endangered, and one of the reasons is sea-level rise. It was the first time I'd seen waves lapping into a house. The house was half destroyed. It almost looked like a carcass on the beach. People there talked about the sea level rising and the storm surges that can cause catastrophic damage. It was a place I'd always thought about in the distant past, but suddenly I was seeing what was in store for my grandmother's island in the future, and what much of the world can anticipate with a changing climate. I asked three guys from Honduras, “Why are you heading north?” One of them, they were 17 years old, looked at me and said, “There's no rain.” You also traveled to Central America, where migration has already directly impacted the Texas-Mexico border. To what degree is climate change driving the migration north? I was in Tenosique, Mexico, about 20 miles from the Guatemalan border, where I stayed at a migrant shelter. I went out to the train yard where there were Central Americans waiting to catch the train north. I asked three guys from Honduras, “Why are you heading north?” One of them, they were 17 years old, looked at me and said, “There's no rain.” This was in 2015, and their community was in what's called the dry corridor that extends through Central America from Guatemala to El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. And this corridor was suffering one of the worst droughts ever — there were people telling me it was a catastrophe, that there was no rain and no harvest. So there was no food
A climate scientist told me Central America is ground zero in Latin America for climate change, and the reason why is because of its precarious socio-economic political conditions. It's also between two oceans, and the huge storms predicted in the 21st century will be more powerful and [more frequent]. Central America is very vulnerable to hurricanes and extreme weather where it's either very wet or very dry.
You write about the amazing amount of money being invested in guns, guards and gates around the globe, while so much less is invested in climate change mitigation and prevention. You also make the connection that a major driver of this border security buildup around the globe is what disaster sociologists call “elite panic.”
In referring to “elite panic,” I was influenced by Rebecca Solnit's book A Paradise Built in Hell. They used the term to show that in disaster situations there's this panic where people with power and money believe that if a hurricane or an earthquake hits, there will be chaos and conflict. But disaster sociologists have actually found that in disaster situations it's usually the opposite. Most people tend to be cooperative, sometimes even altruistic. It's the elites themselves who panic and send in police and the National Guard.
In the book, I propose a variation of this, which is more like “elite anxiety.” Homeland security is always looking into the future and preparing for catastrophes yet to come, predicting that people will panic and there will be conflict. [Border militarization is] a market that is exponentially growing and predicted to double in the next decade. One thing driving this market is climate change and the prediction that it will result in upheaval, and that more money needs to go into building up borders because more people will be on the move. One of the big arguments I make in the book is the huge influx of money being poured into military and homeland security for a future world of potential disasters and upheavals is a type of climate adaptation program for those in power.
BRUSSELS — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the European Union on Monday to back a new U.S. peace initiative in the Middle East, after President Donald Trump's unilateral decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital met with widespread condemnation and triggered clashes in the Palestinian territories.
Netanyahu, making the first official visit by an Israeli premier to the EU's Brussels headquarters in 22 years, told reporters that recognizing Jerusalem merely stated the reality on the ground. They said they expected many European countries to follow Trump's lead.
But EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who chaired talks between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, said no European leaders plan to adopt the U.S. president's position.
Netanyahu insisted that, in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, “what President Trump has done is put facts squarely on the table. Peace is based on reality.”
“Jerusalem is Israel's capital, no one can deny it. It doesn't obviate peace, it makes peace possible,” they said.
The Israeli leader added that they believed most European countries would now “move their embassies to Jerusalem, recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.”
Reacting to Netanyahu's remarks, Mogherini said EU ministers were concerned about Trump's move.
“We do not wish to see a discredited U.S. administration when it comes to the negotiations in the Middle East,” they said.
As far as EU member countries relocating their embassies in Israel, Mogherini was quick to disabuse Netanyahu of the idea.
“He can keep their expectations for others, because from the European Union member states' side, this move will not come,” they said.
Nevertheless, Mogherini and other ministers were impatient to hear details of any U.S. peace initiative in the pipeline. The EU's top diplomat said the time-frame for any new plan and who might be involved do not appear to have been worked out.
“Both the horizon and the framework appear still to be determined,” Mogherini said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: “They've announced to us some kind of American initiative. We've been waiting for several months. If it's not the case, then perhaps the European Union should take the initiative, but it's too early to say.”
“Everyone knows that the resolution of the Middle East crisis goes through negotiations and the recognition of two states,” they said.
Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said Jerusalem “could be the capital of Israel and a future Palestinian state, but that has to be negotiated between the two parties.”
Reynders said that as the biggest aid donor to the Palestinians and a major partner of Israel, the European Union has “a particular role to play” in encouraging a political solution to the conflict.

DALLAS (AP) — Dallas has agreed to pay more than $173 million to settle decades-old lawsuits from thousands of public safety workers over years of back-pay claims.
The Dallas Morning News reports that an executive committee representing nearly 8,700 current and former Dallas police officers and firefighters approved the settlement Tuesday.
The settlement still needs to be approved by a City Council vote this summer.
Council members say Dallas will be able to pay out without increasing property taxes, funding the settlement with existing bond capacity.
Mayor Mike Rawlings called the latest settlement "a prudent move for taxpayers" both financially and psychologically.
Last year, Dallas settled four lawsuits for more than $61 million arising from the language of a 1979 pay referendum.

Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain knows there is no room for complacency against miracle men Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday.
The Serie A leaders boast a commanding 3-0 advantage over Barça from the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
But Luis Enrique's men – who face a pivotal week in the season with a trip to Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday following on their agenda – made Champions League history in the previous round when they overturned a 4-0 deficit against Paris Saint-Germain with an improbable 6-1 win on home turf.
"I don't know whether our 3-0 lead will be enough. We have to come out fighting at Camp Nou and play like we did in the first leg in Turin," former Madrid striker Higuain told Juve's official website.
"Barcelona showed against PSG that they're capable of producing miracles, so we have to be on our toes.
"They'll be wary of us too, however. We'll be looking to create opportunities to score and we're certain that we have what it takes to reach the next round."
Juventus have designs on sweeping the board with a treble this season.
They hold a handsome eight-point advantage over Roma at the top of Serie A with six games to play and face Lazio in the Coppa Italia final at the end of next month.
"I'm very satisfied about how the season is going. There's still just over a month left and we want to go all the way in each competition," said record signing Higuain, who has 29 goals in all competitions.
"This is a crucial moment in our league campaign. It's not over yet and we've 18 points to play for so we can't take our foot off the gas.
"With each game, however, we're getting closer and closer to that sixth straight Scudetto we all want so much. We're in the driving seat."
Monkey Scandal Is The Latest Black Eye for Volkswagen
Automaker Volkswagen has suspended a top executive in response to widespread public criticism over experiments in which monkeys were exposed to diesel exhaust.
The company said in a statement Tuesday that Thomas Steg, head of government relations and sustainability, was stepping away from their duties at their own request.
The statement from the automaker said that the company was "drawing the first consequences" as it investigates the activities of EUGT, the entity backed by Volkswagen and other carmakers that commissioned the monkey experiment.
Steg had said in an interview published in the Bild newspaper that they had known about the experiment but did not inform the company's then-CEO, Martin Winterkorn. Steg said they rejected an initial proposal to use human volunteers and said that even after animals were substituted the experiment "should not have taken place."
The move follows a report in The New York Times that the now-disbanded EUGT commissioned the 2014 monkey test at the Lovelace Respiratory Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to measure how Volkswagen's diesel technology was succeeding in controlling harmful emissions.
Diluted exhaust gases from a late-model Volkswagen vehicle were fed into chambers where the monkeys were exposed for four hours; afterwards, lung samples were taken; the monkeys were not killed as part of the tests but their fate is not clear. The study did not deliver a definitive result.
The test was done with a vehicle that used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests, turning controls off when the vehicle was not being tested. That practice was then exposed in 2015, leading to Winterkorn's resignation.
Volkswagen's current CEO, Matthias Mueller, said in the statement that "we are investigating in detail the work of EUGT, which was dissolved in 2017, and drawing the necessary conclusions." They said that Steg "has declared that they take full responsibility, and I respect that."
Volkswagen said the probe would be carried out "at top speed." Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said that the board's executive committee expected to hear the status of the investigation next week, the dpa news agency reported.
"We will ensure that such things will not be repeated," they said. The company has said that rejects animal experiments and that "we apologize for the wrong behavior and bad decisions of individuals."
Government officials, environmental groups and animal rights activists all condemned the experiment.
Daimler and BMW also condemned the experiment and said they were investigating. The New York Times report said that the three companies backed EUGT financially.
The monkey scandal is another black eye for the German auto industry as it seeks to move past the Volkswagen scandal and the doubts it unleashed over how clean diesel technology really was.
Volkswagen paid billions in fines and settlements and pleaded guilty to criminal charges. The Volkswagen case led to increased scrutiny of diesel cars from other manufacturers, which were found to emit more in everyday driving than during tests, though not necessarily through illegal software as at Volkswagen.

VATICAN CITY — South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis, after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute.
Pope Francis didn't seem to notice or mind, thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “which was a show of the will for peace, the two Koreas together.”
South Korea's World Taekwondo organization, the Seoul-led international body, said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome.
The South's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace.
The Lone Star Conference and the City of Frisco announced Wednesday an agreement that moves the LSC Men's and Women's Basketball Championship tournaments to Dr Pepper Arena in Frisco, Texas, beginning in 2018.

Our goal is always to provide our student-athletes and fans with a first-class experience and this new partnership will certainly do that. We're grateful for the opportunity to align with such a great venue and community," LSC Commissioner Jay Poerner said.
The LSC and Frisco have a two-year agreement starting in 2018 with an option for a third year (2020).
"We're excited to welcome the Lone Star Conference to Frisco, which is quickly becoming a destination for championships," said Mayor Jeff Cheney, City of Frisco. "We're a sports centric community and we rally to provide athletes, fans and alumni unique championship experiences that they'll remember for a lifetime. Again, we welcome Lone Star Conference to the Frisco team. We're looking forward to watching some great Division II basketball."
Tournament Games will take place at Dr Pepper Arena, a multi-purpose sports and entertainment venue located in Frisco at the corner of the Dallas North Tollway and Gaylord Parkway. The venue seats up to 6,000 and features amenities such as a state-of-the-art sound system, three HD video screens, 12 suites and a private lounge area. It is the home practice facility and Executive Offices for the NHL Dallas Stars as well as the home of the Texas Legends Basketball Team. The Legends are the NBA D-League affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks. The arena also hosted the 2016 NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Elite Eight.
"We're excited about the opportunity to bring the Lone Star Conference Men's and Women's Basketball Championship to Frisco and Dr Pepper Arena for the next two years. This event helps affirm our venue's mission to host quality sporting events in our family-friendly environment," said Bill Herman, Dr Pepper Arena General Manager.
The 2018 tournament, to be held March 1-4, will be comprised of the top eight men's and top eight women's teams, according to the LSC regular-season standings. There will be a total of 14 games played over a four-day period, and the winners will receive automatic bids to the NCAA Division II national tournament. Ticket information will be available this fall at www.lonestarconference.org.
Frisco will be the third neutral site location to host the LSC Basketball Championships. Since 2012, the tournament has been played at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas after previously being held in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

If left always on, I think there is a fair chance at some point people will determine that cellular Apple Watches cause cancer. Apple should investigate this possibility and do what it can to mitigate.
Airplane Mode is Your Friend
For a little perspective, don't go running with your hair on fire to throw your Apple Watch into the trash. I own an Apple Watch. I even wear it every day. However, my Apple Watch is always in Airplane mode.
Why? Well, first, because then I can wear it for long periods of time without needing to recharge it—it lasts 3 days between charges in Airplane mode. Second, because I find most Apple Watch apps useless. But third, and most importantly, I believe it is inevitable that people will discover that wireless technology causes cancer.
The Math of: No it Doesn't, Yes it Does
In fact, I believe that this is more a math problem than it is a debate of scientific studies. The bottom line is, the more exposed you are to RF radiation, the more likely you are to have a random DNA-bit flipped that spawns a mutation, i.e., cancerous growth.
Now there have been dozens of “yes, cellphones cause cancer”, “no, cellphones do not cause cancer” studies. To me, that sounds amazingly like what happened with the tobacco industry for decades. That includes one recent study by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) that shows an increase in tumors in rats exposed to cellphone radiation (albeit at exposures which are at greater levels than most cell phone users experience).
However, I think that there is something people are not paying attention to. The Apple Watch 3 now sports a cellular transceiver strapped to your arm as much as 24 hours a day. Every day. This seems beyond NTP rat-like exposure, and perhaps even beyond the long exposures that caused many Connecticut cops to contract testicular and brain cancer from their radar guns.
With many radiation safety protocols, you reduce radiation injury by increasing distance, decreasing time exposed, and increasing shielding, whereas the Apple Watch seems to be doing the opposite.
In my totally non-expert, non-learned, non-medically-trained, non-scientific, monkey-at-best opinion, it is a near certainty and inevitability that such constant close contact and exposure will increase the odds of a radiation-induced-DNA-bit-flip and cause cancer. [Update: Even the CDC is noting that the “International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified RF radiation as a ‘possible human carcinogen.'”]
Minimize-RF
Personally, I would like to see Apple do something to mitigate against this possibility. Apple should implement a ‘minimize-RF-mode' for the Apple Watch. It would work like Airplane mode and turn off all the RF transceivers on the watch. This would have the added benefit of saving a ton of battery life. And then, only when you turn your wrist to see the time, would it temporarily turn on the transceivers, get a burst download/upload of what was needed, and then turn off soon thereafter.
Such a mode would also block out a lot of interruptions, including emergency texts and notifications. Overall, blocking out a bit more noise, these days, for me at least, is more a feature than it is a bug.
I wonder if Apple has thought about this issue, and if the company has done any studies or experiments in this regard. If so, I wonder if Apple would share its findings on the issue. If not, I wonder if it should?
TORONTO — Jozy Altidore opened the scoring in the 67th minute and Toronto FC beat the Seattle Sounders 2-0 on Saturday in the MLS Cup to become the first Canadian champion in league history.
Toronto avenged a penalty-shootout loss to Seattle last year in the title game.
In the 67th, Sebastian Giovinco's pass from just inside the Seattle half helped Altidore split a pair of defenders. Altidore took a few steps to their left and fired the ball over goalkeeper Stefan Frei, setting off a wild celebration among the 30,584 fans that left BMO Field shaking.
Victor Vasquez made it 2-0 in injury time when from close range after substitute Armando Cooper's shot rebounded off the post.
Altidore scored in Toronto's 1-0 victory over Columbus Crew in the Eastern Conference final. They had 15 goals in the regular season, second on the team to Giovinco's 16.
Call the Midwife is back – with faces old and new. From Nurse Trixie Franklin to Nurse Phyllis Crane, Nonnatus House's most experienced midwives return for series seven and we'll see plenty of familiar characters: Reggie, Fred, Violet, Dr Turner, Shelagh and Sister Julienne, to name but a few.

But there will also be newcomers in Poplar, including Nurse Lucille Anderson who arrives in the middle of a blizzard.
Creator Heidi Thomas has lined up some excellent guest stars throughout the series too.
Here are all the characters you need to meet, and where you've seen the actors before.
Leonie Elliott – Nurse Lucille Anderson
Who do they play? Newcomer Nurse Lucille Anderson is the first-ever West Indian midwife to feature in the BBC1 drama. Funny and clever, they will soon settle in to life in Poplar, bonding with the rest of the midwives and bringing a “fresh new energy” to Nonnatus House.
Where have I seen them before? Leonie Elliott is best known for their role in Black Mirror episode Hated in the Nation, where they played Fiona. They have also recently been in Casualty, Boogie Man and Damned, and in 2015 they featured in Lenny Henry's BBC comedy drama Danny and the Human Zoo. As a child actor they appeared on stage in The Lion King and Annie.
Helen George – Nurse Trixie Franklin
Who do they play? Nurse Trixie is one of the most experienced midwives at Nonnatus House. Always well-groomed and fashionable with perfectly-applied lipstick and eyeliner, they can be flirty and fun. They have previously battled an alcohol addiction. In series six they met divorced dentist Christopher Dockerill and started a relationship.
Where have I seen them before? Helen George joined Call the Midwife right at the very beginning. They have appeared in Red Dwarf, Doctors and Hotel Babylon, and in 2015 they starred in Strictly Come Dancing where they waltzed their way to sixth place with Aljaz Skorjanec. Helen actually fell in love on the set of Call the Midwife and began dating their co-star Jack Ashton (who plays Reverend Tom): they gave birth to their daughter, Wren, in September 2017.
Jennifer Kirby – Nurse Valerie Dyer
Who do they play? Valerie is a Poplar native who previously served in the army as a nurse before returning home to work as a barmaid in East London. She's a relatively recent addition to Nonnatus House and hasn't really opened up yet.
Where have I seen them before? Jennifer Kirby made their TV breakthrough in Call the Midwife, but they also had an impressive stage career with the Royal Shakespeare Company before joining the BBC1 drama.
Jenny Agutter – Sister Julienne

Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has refused to distance themselves from claims they want to leave the Bundesliga champions.
Lewandowski's agent Pini Zahavi told Sport Bild their client is keen to move on after four consecutive top-flight title triumphs at the Allianz Arena.
"Robert feels that they need a change and a new challenge in their career," said Zahavi, who helped to broker Neymar's world-record move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain last August.
"The leaders of Bavaria know about it."
Addressing a news conference while on duty with the Poland national team on Wednesday, Lewandowski looked to sidestep the issue but confirmed their future remains in Zahavi's hands.
"My agent takes care of these things," they said. "I am focused on the preparations for the World Cup.
"That is the most important thing. I do not think about anything else."
Lewandowski is under contract until 2021 at Bayern and has been heavily linked to Real Madrid this season.
"Throughout the season there were many rumours about him, but we all stayed calm, Lewy as well," said Bayern defender Niklas Sule when they spoke to reporters at Germany's pre-World Cup training base.
"From the outside there is always more talk than there actually is inside the team. They were always motivated and scored 30 goals [29] again this season in the Bundesliga.
"What their agent said or what the situation is with Lewy - only they [Lewandowski] knows best.
"But the club will handle this situation. All I can say is that Robert Lewandowski is highly respected within the team, they are a great guy and they always score goals for us."
As automakers race to put battery-powered cars on the road, a Boeing Co.-backed startup plans to put a hybrid-electric aircraft into commercial service within five years.
Zunum Aero's 12-seat plane will carry battery packs and a small fuel reserve for a back-up engine. The first model will fly about 700 miles, far enough to ferry travelers from Boston to Washington or Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, the company said Thursday.
By applying advances in battery technology pioneered by the auto industry, Zunum aims to eliminate the emissions and roar of combustion-based jet engines. That's a tall order for a company with just 15 employees, especially in a business where breakthrough designs can cost billions of dollars. Zunum, backed by JetBlue Airways Corp. as well as Boeing, is racing competitors such as Europe's Airbus SE and a partnership that includes EasyJet Plc. The U.S. military and NASA are pursuing similar concepts.
“People are surfing that Tesla wave, if you will, with some of the same range anxiety,” said aviation consultant Robert Mann. “Everyone is looking at this.”
For Zunum CEO Ashish Kumar, the all-electric buses tooling around Seattle are more of a model than Elon Musk's electric cars at Tesla Inc. Zunum's planes will need to be on the move all day to make money for operators, while Tesla's owners typically have short commutes.
“We spent some time, actually, at the maintenance depot for King County Metro,” Kumar, a co-founder of Kirkland, Washington-based Zunum, said in an interview. “We think that's the future of aviation.”
Battery Swaps
The Seattle area's buses, manufactured by Proterra Inc., have batteries that can be recharged in less than 10 minutes. Zunum is aiming for a similar turnaround for its planes and devising a way for ground crews to quickly swap spent battery packs — which will be housed in the wings, where fuel is typically held on jetliners — with replacements.
For now, designers of electric or hybrid aircraft are limited to using small planes because of the power density and weight of current-generation batteries. As technology evolves, so too will aircraft concepts and capabilities.
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, with the most advanced electric generation and distribution system of any commercial jet, is another inspiration for Zunum. The company hired Waleed Said, the lead designer for the Dreamliner system, to develop a similar power train with lighter-weight components.
“Future-proofing” designs so that they can easily adopt rapidly evolving electronics and batteries, is a headache for Said's team, they said.
Resource Competition
Another is managing the heat thrown off by an electrical system generating a megawatt of power, sufficient to light about 400 homes. There's also the hassle of competing with far larger car, bus and ship manufacturers for battery packs. Meanwhile, suppliers are loath to explore advances beyond the electrical system that Boeing is planning for an all-new airplane it is considering.
“There are things we'd love to do, but they're not going to be on the first aircraft,” Said said.
Kumar has hired a team from Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc to develop the plane's propulsion system: basically an electric motor turning a fan inside a casing, and far simpler than a full-scale jetliner's turbine. The former Google Americas COO is coy about where the plane will be built, saying there are manufacturers worldwide that could assemble the frames.
Even if Zunum's aircraft delivers on its potential, Kumar faces the greater challenge of creating a new market of air travel that fits between general aviation and the regional affiliates of major airlines, said Mann, the consultant. But that's part of the reward — and risk — of innovation.
“When you go in and do these things, they may not be immediately practical, but they all make an impression,” they said. “And all those impressions eventually form a path.”

TORONTO — It's been a rough MLS season so far for injury-ravaged Toronto FC. But there were smiles all round this week as players collected their championship bling, a sparkling reminder of their record-breaking 2017 campaign.
The impressive rings look like the red TFC emblem has been dropped on a icy bed of diamonds.
“We're really happy with them. I think it's brought an MLS ring to a new level,” said team president Bill Manning.
“It was something we wanted the players to be proud of,” they added.
More than 170 diamonds, spread on white and yellow gold, with a string of individual touches, lift the giant rings out of the ordinary.
The jewelry was made by Baron Championship Rings of Tecumseh, Ont. The company specializes in championship bling, having created rings for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Sparks, Hockey Canada, Toronto Argonauts, London Knights and Raptors 905 among others.
The diamonds came from Houston-based Uptown Diamond.
Judy Tanenbaum, wife of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment chairperson Larry Tanenbaum, played a major role in helping design the rings, said Baron sales director Arthur Horton.
Eighteen players, included the now-retired Benoit Cheyrou, plus team officials were presented with the rings at a private luncheon Monday at Casa Loma, a majestic castle home completed in 1914 by Sir Henry Pellatt that now serves as a tourist attraction and special events host.
Each player got a personalized package complete with ring, picture of the MLS Cup trophy with the TFC logo on it and their name and what looks like a bottle of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades Brut Gold Champagne, which retails for $649.95 at the LCBO.
The rings have the red-garnet-coloured Toronto FC emblem in a black circle on the front, framed with the words MLS Cup on top and Champions below.
The player's name and number — complete with diamond — are on one side. The Philip F. Anschutz Trophy and team motto “All for One” adorns the other.
The team's 20-5-9 regular-season record and MLS record 59 points are inscribed on the inside of the ring. There are three stones stamped into the bottom of the ring to mark the three trophies won: the MLS Cup, Canadian Championship and Supporters' Shield.
Baron says it takes 10-12 weeks to make the rings. The process starts with a 3-D modelling program, which becomes a wax model that is cast.
The MLSE order called for 795 rings, with the exact bling varying over five different tiers.
“Every (MLSE) staff member is getting one,” said Manning, who already has an MLS championship ring from 2009 with Real Salt Lake and a USL ring from 1999 with the Minnesota Thunder plus an NFC Conference champions ring in 2004 with the Philadelphia Eagles.
That includes the soccer team's “go-to babysitters” and BMO Field security.
“When we say all for one, it does mean everybody,” said Manning
The staff rings are slated to be handed out Thursday.
The TFC boss declined to say how much the player rings cost.
“But I'll tell you that we as a company invested a lot of money not only for the players but our staff,” they said.
Suffice to say you could probably buy a modest economy car with the cost of the deluxe players' ring.
The TFC players were quick to show off the new bling on social media. Striker Jozy Altidore posted a photo of themselves wearing the massive rink on their little finger.
“I would pinky swear, but my pinky ring is too big,” they wrote.
Italian forward Sebastian Giovinco posted a close-up of their ring-wearing hand with the caption “The Lord of the Ring.”
“Got a Ring!!!” tweeted defender Chris Mavinga, with several shots of their new jewelry.
Baron Championship Rings is a family affair, founded some 30 years ago. Richard Baron started with a Toronto jewelry store that did class and other rings but the business expanded into championship rings about 10 years ago.
Baron and Jostens, based out of Minneapolis, are the big players in championship bling. Jostens did the rings for the Houston Astros, Seattle Sounders, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots and Chicago Cubs to celebrate their recent titles and have partnered with the reigning NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles.
By the Bling
A look at the Toronto FC player championship rings:
— Each one has an approximate 3.30 carat weight.
— The ring includes 132 round brilliant diamonds, 42 princess-cut black diamonds, 2 custom-made black onyx stones (for the T logo), and a red garnet stone (with Toronto encrusted in it).
— The ring is 10-karat white gold ring with a 14-karat yellow gold star at the top.
— All rings weighs about 80 to 85 grams (depending on finger size), measuring 30 by 34 millimetres.

The Postal Service is also trying to make service easier for customers at the Tampa Main Post Office. Construction surrounding the nearby Tampa International Airport could cause traffic delays, so airport authorities will be there to direct traffic. Postal Service employees will also be collecting mail by the Spruce Street exit, and in front of the blue collection boxes in the post office parking lot so customers don't have to get out of their cars.
If you're mailing your return, the Postal Service suggests mailing early in the day. If you're depositing your return in a collection box, make sure to double-check the pick-up schedule on the box to make sure you're depositing before the last scheduled pick-up. You should also make sure you're using the right postage, and verify you have the right address for the IRS.
Taxes are due on Tuesday this year because the usual April 15 deadline fell on a Saturday.

THree games to go and the Championship play-offs are too close to call. Qualification was on a plate for Leeds United a month ago but the pressure told over the Easter weekend and the club are suddenly swimming in it.
They have stuttered in patches since turning over champions-in-waiting Brighton on March 18 but yesterday was the first time when Garry Monk might have wondered if their squad were starting to choke. Defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers would have been a problem in any form. The way in which Leeds invited it left an unavoidable feeling of concern.
Chris Wood and Mike Williamson
In a first half strewn with mistakes, Wolves lapped them up and scored the only goal, the least they had earned from a period in which Leeds came apart at the seams. Nouha Dicko produced a sharp finish beyond Rob Green in the 39th minute but the disjointed play which preceded their goal was symptomatic of the tension running through Elland Road. Green had already pulled off two excellent saves to keep the game goalless and Leeds had used up their lives.
Monk inspired some more energy and direction at half-time but the damage was done and for the first time in almost four months, Leeds find themselves outside the Championship's top six with three games left, reassured only by the fact that victories from all of those fixtures will guarantee a position in the play-offs. The saving grace might yet be the fact that Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham, the clubs directly above them, meet at Hillsborough on the final day.
Monk was plainly aware of the league standings at full-time, a table showing Leeds in seventh after 25 consecutive games inside the top six. They tempered criticism of the “one of the worst 45 minutes we've had all season” with a defiant tone about the ability of their players to recover in the weeks that remain. Paul Lambert, the Wolves manager, offered their own encouragement. “They're well in the mix,” Lambert said. “It's really tight to call and it could go down to the wire. If you're asking me can they do it, absolutely they can.”
Lambert's words oozed more confidence than Leeds' body language yesterday; strangely introverted after the intense drama of Chris Wood's equaliser at Newcastle United on Good Friday. Leeds were made to seem unshakable by that 95th-minute goal but Wolves played on very obvious nerves while failing to kill the game before half-time. Leeds' reaction after the interval produced the sporadic threat of an equaliser either side of a penalty claim which wasn't given but Monk was philosophical.
Luke Ayling is challenged by George Saville
“In the first half we were waiting for something to happen and it cost us,” they said. “In the second half we tried to make things happen and that's the way it has to be in these next three games. We can't afford any more periods like that first half now.”
Elland Road has been a comfort blanket for them and their players for most of the season, a highly dependable venue acting as a makeweight for fragile form away from home. Monk's side have recorded only one away win since the first day of February, in contrast to results at Elland Road. At the worst possible time, their consistency in West Yorkshire dipped.
Monk was consistent with their selection of players, retaining the line-up which started Friday's gripping draw at Newcastle but failing to free them from the stress of the run-in. It would not have upset them to see Wolves missing £20m-worth of signings in injured pair Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro but Lambert threw experience to the fore and found a way of causing trouble. At the end of an in-and-out year, Wolves are still a long way from the beach.
The make-up of the Championship before kick-off was such that Leeds had no urgent need to keep an eye on events elsewhere but news of other scorelines were bound to filter through and Fulham were leading an Aston Villa team reduced to 10 men within minutes of the start at Elland Road. Word of the opening goal for Sheffield Wednesday at Queens Park Rangers followed soon after. Both Fulham and Wednesday were hoping for help from Wolves which nearly came in the 16th minute. Pontus Jansson and Gaetano Berardi crossed wires over a loose ball on the edge of Leeds' box and Andreas Weimann unexpectedly found themselves one-on-one with Green. Weimann was as surprised as anyone to see the goalkeeper in front of them and Green blocked their low shot after narrowing the angles quickly but that wobble exposed United's anxiety.
Souleymane Doukara
Throughout the first half Leeds struggled to piece a performance together. Kalvin Phillips drew a low block from Andy Lonergan after spinning onto a pass from Alfonso Pedraza but Wolves were rarely forced to stretch themselves at the back. It was Green who was called into another good save on 23 minutes, pushing Dave Edwards' volley around a post. Kyle Bartley's sliding block then dealt with George Saville's shot with Monk's defence wide open again.
In amongst mistakes and blind passes which ran astray, Leeds fended for chances as Wolves saw several. Dicko's left-footed finish on the half-hour flew inches wide of Green's far post and it took until the last 10 minutes of the half for United press Wolves back. Bartley's claim for penalty at a Pablo Hernandez corner fell on deaf ears and the centre-back saw an effort blocked before Jansson headed another corner over but Wolves had more than earned the goal which came their way six minutes before the break.
Jansson embarked on a long run upfield but lost possession, inviting Wolves to break. Ben Marshall slipped a pass into the feet of Dicko who met it first time with a deft finish across Green. There were only so many times Green could be asked to dig their defence out.
By the closing minutes of the first half, Hernandez was dropping regularly into their own half, drawn deep by the absence of any good possession. Monk could do nothing more than regroup at the interval, taking comfort from the fact that Green's early saves had kept the game alive.
Garry Monk
Wood was screaming for a penalty eight minutes into the second half when their cross hit Richard Stearman's arm but referee Jeremy Simpson gave Stearman the benefit of the doubt. “Of course it's a penalty,” Monk said. “His hands are above their head, they stop the cross going in. You see them given every time. But there are no excuses. It wasn't good enough from us and there'll be no excuses in the next three games.”
Monk blinked soon after, removing Liam Bridcutt and calling on Hadi Sacko's pace, and Wolves' swagger began to fade. A fingertip save from Lonergan prevented another of Monk's substitutes, Souleymane Doukara, from levelling with a header on 73 minutes. Green was spectating by that stage, a mile from the action, but the view was not pleasant and Leeds were surging forward desperately when Kemar Roofe's header from a 90th-minute corner was nodded off the line by Kortney Hause.
Simpson served up five minutes of injury-time, the same amount which rescued Leeds at St James' Park on Friday, but there was no twist in the plot and when a last-gasp cross from Hernandez dropped to Wood, the striker's header crashed over the bar. Monk can only hope that a play-off place is not heading that way.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Rickie Fowler birdied the last three holes in front of the largest crowd in golf history Saturday to take the lead in the Waste Management Phoenix Open.
Fowler shot a 4-under 67 to reach 14 under with a round left at TPC Scottsdale's Stadium Course, the layout packed with an estimated 216,818 fans on an 80-degree afternoon. The crowd pushed the week total to 654,906, just short of the record of 655,434 set last year.
Former Arizona State players Jon Rahm and Chez Reavie were a stroke back along with Bryson DeChambeau. Phil Mickelson, another former Sun Devils star, was two shots behind.
Justin Thomas birdied the first six holes, then had to fight to shoot even par after a back-nine meltdown. They had a bogey-triple bogey-double bogey stretch that left them eight strokes back.
Ben Silverman (70) of Thornhill, Ont., and Adam Hadwin (74) of Abbotsford, B.C., were the low Canadians at 4 under. Abbotsford's Nick Taylor (73) is even.

SULLIVAN COUNTY, TN (WJHL) – A local district attorney is proposing changes to drug legislation to help battle the opioid problem in our region.
Sullivan County District Attorney General Barry Staubus shared their ideas that they say they hope the legislature will consider as pieces of the puzzle to fight opioid addiction.
Fentanyl is a drug that, as the Director of the Sullivan County Anti-Drug Coalition, Alice McCaffrey hears about often.
“We've heard of people literally taking the dose and falling to the ground immediately, I mean its deadly,” McCaffrey.
But the punishment for those illegally distributing the drug, District Attorney General Barry Staubus says, doesn't match the seriousness of it.
“It's a very dangerous drug, however the punishments for it are much lower than methamphetamine and cocaine,” Staubus said.
That's why Staubus is proposing more enhanced consequences for illegal fentanyl distribution.
They also have another hope for a legislative change.
“If you furnish, distribute, sell a schedule 1 or 2 drugs and someone dies as a result of taking a schedule 1 or 2 drugs, it is second degree murder. However, if someone dies as a result of other drugs or a combination of one, schedule 1 or 2 drugs, it is not a crime,” said Staubus.
Staubus says a loophole in the law right now doesn't cover multi-drug related deaths.
“There is no punishment at all, so I think there needs to be a punishment and I think that we would need to craft a law that would allow some punishment for this kind of cases and it should be a serious punishment, a felony punishment,” said Staubus.
Though Staubus says they don't know the exact punishments that could be at this time, he's hopeful the legislature will consider their ideas to help solve the region's opioid crisis.
“I think there are a number of answers, and I think it will take a lot of hard work and determination on a lot of fronts, but these are some ideas that I have that I think would be parts of the puzzle toward a solution,” they said.
Staubus said the next steps include talking to local legislators to formulate more concrete ideas.

Foteini Agrafioti is the chief science officer of the Royal Bank of Canada and the head of Borealis AI.
At the Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society conference in New Orleans last month, machine learning researchers presented a program that uses neural networks to classify potential gang activity from within a database of criminal behaviour. The algorithm was designed in the hopes of helping authorities automate the process of identifying gang-related crimes, giving police a sense of whether there may be any retaliatory activity after a crime. This advance knowledge would ideally provide them with a window of opportunity to curb further violence.
These predictive measures are meant to provide intended outcomes. But the tool's creators surely didn't intend the outcome that did emerge at the conference: swift backlash. Critics suggested the algorithm's potential to erroneously label individuals as gang members could ruin lives and contribute to a growing sense of mistrust against police. When grilled over these potential misuses, the Harvard University computer scientist who presented the work waved the question off, saying: “I'm just an engineer.”
Statements like this from within the machine learning community reveal a divide over ethical responsibility. On one side are researchers who see their work as a function of pure scientific inquiry that should be allowed to advance without interference; on the other side are those who loudly demand that the scientists and companies building today's AI technologies have an obligation to consider the broad and long-term impact of their work. Most fall somewhere along this spectrum.
Out in the real world, however, there's only one side that matters. Machine learning, at its best, sets out to improve quality of life by eradicating the errors that can lead to human rights abuses and systemic failures. AI technology already shows great promise in areas like healthcare, where machine learning algorithms are making headway toward improving patient diagnostics and curing genetic diseases.
But it just takes a few spins around the reality block to recognize that humans are imperfect, subjective and—in far too many cases—prone to corruption. In other words, if someone builds a system, someone else will find a way to fleece that system. So if dubious actors have already found their way around spaces with established laws and protocols, the gaps in AI understandability present a rare window of opportunity for those who would abuse the technology for malicious or self-serving purposes.
And the stakes are getting higher; now that AI-based algorithms are getting smarter and being used to drive decision-making in areas like recidivism, hiring, and public policy, the unintended consequences of flawed datasets and algorithms are inevitably piling up. Dr. Latanya Sweeney, a Harvard professor-in-residence and the former chief technologist of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, once had to pay a company to show a potential employer they didn't, in fact, have a criminal record after a Google search of their name turned up targeted ads suggesting she'd been arrested. When they dug into the matter, they discovered 80 per cent of what are considered “black” sounding names in the U.S. returned a similarly targeted arrest ad, while “neutral” (read: white) sounding names turned up completely different results.
Research into the use of computer programs to predict the probability of criminal recidivism has shown that, instead of being more accurate, the algorithms currently being used as admissible testimony in courtrooms are perpetuating the human prejudices that have upheld systemic inequalities within the U.S. penal system. And a recent study found that social media-driven job postings for high paying executive roles were deliberately targeted toward men while significantly limiting the number of women who saw the ad.
In response, organizations that study ethical AI are cropping up in top universities, and governments have promised to take the subject seriously. Conferences like the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)—seen as the Super Bowl of AI conferences—are tackling the issue with new research; at last year's NIPS in Long Beach, California, Dr. Kate Crawford, a leading researcher in data bias, fairness, and algorithmic accountability, delivered a scorching keynote on “The Trouble With Bias” that received some of the highest praise and attention of the event. Building on that momentum, a group called Fairness, Transparency, and Accountability in Machine Learning (FATML)—whose mandate is to apply computationally rigorous methods to their queries around problems like bias, discrimination, and understandability in AI—held their inaugural conference at New York University's Vanderbilt Hall in late February. And Montreal is even pledging to be the first city to drive the template for ethical AI.
While this is a great start, the multiple ways in which AI technologies are already embedded into our systems requires us to act now. Fairness can't be an afterthought; its impacts must be understood and respected by industry, the place where AI meets the market and touches human lives. Safeguards should be built right into the core of our systems in order to ensure that machine learning will not introduce bias and that it will result in explainable and justifiable actions.
There is a lot of appetite for innovation using AI, and for good reason. Predictive modelling has reached peak accuracies in several domains, creating enormous opportunities. But one cannot be blind to the risks of deploying models which may work well on one hand, but are not fully explainable on the other.
It is important to decouple the pursuit of fairness in AI from immediate commercial interests and to create room for sound and universal scientific solutions to be developed. To that end, fundamental research aims to provide rigorous mathematical foundations that can help us better understand how decision-making works in AI. This is a big undertaking for the research community. And if definitive solutions are not yet scientifically accessible, then one needs to consider trading accuracy for explainability. Failure to address this gap is simply not an option.
Ethics need to remain top of mind in all product and design decisions, even if that means integrating ethical training and awareness in core components of our tech education. There also needs to be a far deeper understanding at the policy level of how AI technologies work, how they interact with human societies, and how to protect the vulnerable from these inevitable impacts.
Technologists and computer scientists must consider context when interpreting results, and, as Princeton's Arvind Narayanan noted, they need to avoid the too-common viewpoint that the algorithm is not to blame when the data is biased. Data collected in the real world, after all, will inevitably be biased; the challenge, instead, should be on how to make algorithmic systems support human values. Finally, we need to support and amplify the voices of advocates, regulators, and journalists currently shouting for rigour, transparency, and accountability.
Things are already changing. Joy Buolamwini of the MIT Media Lab and Timnit Gebru of Microsoft Research recently exposed how automated facial analysis algorithms used by major tech companies had been trained on datasets comprised of disproportionately large percentages of lighter-skinned faces. As a result, the models returned a maximum error rate of 0.8 per cent for light-skinned male faces, while the error rates for darker-skinned females shot up to 34.7 per cent and in some cases couldn't even recognize them. At the time, these algorithms had been lauded for their technical progress. Yet studies like this show they achieved their results by effectively erasing the majority of world's phenotypic subgroups.
Within a day of sharing their results, Buolamwini said IBM turned around an immediate fix. It took fear of public exposure for this disparity to even get acknowledged as a problem, but the study moved a mountain within hours. We have more power than we realize; the only real barrier is public passivity, and the speed at which this technology is advancing means passivity is a luxury we can ill-afford.
The work done right now in AI will be the foundation upon which future generations interact with technologies. We can't realistically account for every misuse, but we do have the opportunity to set the technologies in a direction that minimizes harm.

CLEVELAND — Cavaliers centre Kevin Love is out against the Philadelphia 76ers because of a sore left hip.
Love went through warmups Saturday before the decision to hold them out was made. They injured the hip Wednesday against Memphis, but played Friday against Indiana, scoring 20 points in 26 minutes.
Love played in Cleveland's first 26 games, averaging 19.2 points and 10.4 rebounds.
Ante Zizic started at centre against Philadelphia. Sixers centre Joel Embiid is also out because they have yet to be cleared to play on back-to-back nights following off-season knee surgery.
Cleveland is also playing without Tristan Thompson (strained left calf), Derrick Rose (sprained left ankle), Isaiah Thomas (strained right hip) and Iman Shumpert (left knee surgery).
News and intrigue from home and abroad
Beloved Lego figurine Stephen Harper was in the news last week. Ol' helmet-hair travelled to the White House to discuss the Trump Administration's anti-Canada agenda. Prairie Dog was delighted to learn that Harper took time out from whatever the hell they think he's doing to call for regime change in Iran while having nothing to say about dictatorships like, say, Saudi Arabia.
In other Canadian political news, Prairie Dog staff dismissed as “entirely fictitious” reports that current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent Canada Day in Regina, Saskatchewan recklessly leaping in front of pedestrians, cyclists and even cars without their shirt on in a deranged attempt to take as many selfies with Reginans as possible. Prairie Dog CAN confirm reports that two and a half years after a traumatic decade of Stephen Harper politics, it remains very difficult to hate Trudeau.
Meanwhile, lots of other things happened. Here are three of them.
PCC To Indigenous Protesters: Get Off Our Lawn
In a grotesque and tone-deaf move, Saskatchewan's Provincial Capital Commission requested Regina police remove the teepees and individuals occupying Legislative grounds as part of the Justice for Our Stolen Children camp. Regina Police Chief Evan Bray, whose officers have futilely evicted protesters once already, politely declined, stressing the peacefulness of the protest, lack of danger to the public and ongoing productive dialogue between the protestors, the government and First Nations.
The still-intact camp was the site of a rockin' Trespasser's Powwow on June 30, in which a good time was reportedly had by all.
The Justice for Our Stolen Children camp was launched earlier this year in response to the acquittal of Gerald Stanley in the fatal shooting of Colten Boushie, as well as an increasingly long list of disturbing failures by multiple levels of government towards the general well-being Indigenous people over the last 151 years. In a July 2 meeting, protesters gave the government a list of reasonable and specific demands including detailed reforms to the care of foster children and an end to attempts to remove the camp.
A few days before press time, high-profile former PC member of Parliament John Gormley advocated for police arresting Justice for Our Stolen Children protesters. Yuck.
Moe And Ford Vs. Trudeau Tax
Climate change continues to accelerate, threatening human civilization. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan's government has reached out to new Ontario Premier Doug Ford in hopes of finding an ally in its crusade against federal government legislation that requires Canadian provinces to implement carbon pricing.
The Saskatchewan Party government rejects carbon pricing, which supporters say could increase government revenue as well as reduce green house gas emissions. While critics insist that a carbon tax could hurt low and middle income households, supporters point out there's nothing stopping the province from bringing in targeted rebates.
At press time, it was still depressing that Rob Ford's brother is now Ontario's premier.
Alberta Suckage Continues To Decline
One might be forgiven for thinking Alberta's 2015 election of an NDP government was a step into a civilized future for a place that's often seemed drearily wedded to antiquated social ideas.
It turns out there's still some red in the province's neck.
Take, for example, a recent court case challenging an NDP law protecting Alberta students who join gay-straight alliances.
The law, which was passed last November, is a solid piece of common-sense legislation that makes life safer for Alberta's LGBTQ children. Under the law, schools cannot inform parents when their children join gay-straight alliances (GSAs), which are peer support groups where LGBTQ students can hang out with other students — straight, gay, transgender, bisexual and otherwise.
Experts say that such groups can be critical to the health and safety of this LGBTQ youth whose sexual orientations and gender identities are not supported at home (often for religious reasons).
Unfortunately, the law was challenged by an anti-LGBTQ group called The Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, which represented a coalition of 26 religious schools and unspecified number of parents (”more than ten,” JCCF press release says).
The absurdly named group called gay-straight alliances “ideological sex clubs” in its filing and claimed that the law violates parent's legal right to know what their children are up to.
The law's supporters point out that some LGBTQ children can and do face persecution and even physical abuse from intolerant family members and for these kids, GSAs are a desperately needed safe haven. If joining a GSA could result in a student being outed to their hostile family, however, it's less likely an at-risk LGBTQ child would take the risk. And that's a problem. LGBTQ kids need support. A 2017 University of Alberta study found that 65 per cent of transgender individuals contemplated suicide between the ages of 19 and 25.
Fortunately, Alberta Court of Queen's Bench Justice Johnna Kubik upheld the legislation. Kubik found there to be no evidence GSAs cause harm and lots of evidence they help children.
At press time, there may be hope for Alberta.

EDMONTON — Scientists say they have identified the world's oldest lizard fossil — a discovery that sheds light on the evolution of lizards and snakes.
The fossil, which is 240 million years old, is called Megachirella wachtleri and is believed to be the most ancient ancestor of scaled reptiles known as squamates. The conclusion is based on an analysis of data from both living and extinct reptiles.
The research by scientists in Alberta — as well as in Australia, Italy and the United States — was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
“It's a fossil lizard that we found to be the oldest-known lizard on the planet,” said Tiago SimÃµes, a PhD student in the University of Alberta's biological sciences department and the study's lead author.
The specimen is 75 million years older than thought when it was first described in 1993, they said.
SimÃµes said it fills a gap in understanding the evolution of lizards and snakes.
There are about 10,000 species of squamates around the world, and scientists say they are still learning about the early stages of the animals' evolution.
Researchers initially thought the fossil, which was found in northern Italy's Dolomite Mountains, was related to but not actually a lizard.
Further analysis, however, determined it to be the oldest relative of existing lizards and snakes, which, SimÃµes pointed out, are essentially limbless lizards.
They said researchers in the last four years compiled the largest dataset ever. It included micro CT scans, photographs and molecular analysis rather than relying on previous research.
“We are sure it's a lizard by the particular combination of features,” said SimÃµes.
Some of those features include the shape of bones in the brain, shoulder and trunk of the fossil. The results indicate a more gradual evolution than previously thought.
“It's important … to understand how such a diverse and important component of the modern biological world originated,” said SimÃµes. “There has been a lot of hot debate in the past.
“For the first time, we are providing agreement.”
They said it's also valuable to know how invertebrates evolved during drastic shifts in environmental conditions.
“One of the things we learned in this study was that most of the larger groups of reptiles were already present in the Permian period, which means they were present and evolved before the largest mass extinction in the history of the planet.”
The Permian mass extinction killed about 90 per cent of the Earth's species.

By RYAN J. FOLEY
Associated Press
IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Republicans who control a majority of the nation's statehouses are considering a wide range of abortion legislation that could test the government's legal ability to restrict a woman's right to terminate pregnancy.
The Mississippi House passed a bill Friday that would make the state the only one to ban all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In Missouri, lawmakers heard testimony earlier in the week on a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks.
The Ohio House is expected to consider bills, already passed in the Senate, that would prohibit the most common type of procedure used to end pregnancies after 13 weeks and require that fetal remains be buried or cremated.
Abortion is a perennial hot button issue in statehouses across the country. Republican-controlled states have passed hundreds of bills since 2011 restricting access to the procedure while Democratic-led states have taken steps in the other direction.
The early weeks of this year's state legislative sessions have seen a flurry of activity around the issue. It comes as activists on both sides say they expect the U.S. Supreme Court to soon consider a question that remains unclear: How far can states go in restricting abortion in the interest of preserving and promoting fetal life?
The state bills debated since the start of the year "are all tests designed to see how far government power to legislate on behalf of a fetus can reach," said Jessica Mason Pieklo, who has been tracking legislation as the senior legal analyst for Rewire, a website that promotes views supporting abortion rights.
They said the outcome will determine whether states can legally ban abortion after a specific time period and outlaw specific medical procedures. Advocates for abortion rights say those strategies undermine the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling that women have the right to terminate pregnancies until a fetus is viable.
In Utah, critics have warned that a pending bill to prevent doctors from performing abortions on the basis of a Down syndrome diagnosis is unconstitutional. But It's co-sponsor, Republican state Sen. Curt Bramble, said they are willing to defend the bill in court because its goal is to protect unborn children.
"There are times if the Supreme Court got it wrong, it is appropriate to push back," said Bramble, an accountant from Provo.
The anti-abortion bills have drawn opposition from women who say they have made the excruciating choice to terminate a pregnancy, often after discovering serious fetal abnormalities.
"A 20-week abortion ban sounds OK, but if that gets passed, what's next - 18 weeks, 15 weeks? At what point does it make abortion truly illegal?" said Robin Utz of St. Louis, 38, who submitted testimony this week against the Missouri bill. "It's terrifying and it's willfully ignorant."
Utz recounted terminating their pregnancy in its 21st week in November 2016, after learning their daughter would be born with a fatal kidney disease if they survived birth. They said doctors told them that dilation and evacuation, the most common abortion procedure in the second trimester, was the safest way to terminate the pregnancy.
Undeterred by such stories, the National Right to Life Committee and its allies have been pushing for state laws that ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and outlaw dilation and evacuation. Supporters of both measures argue that fetuses are capable of feeling pain after 20 weeks and call the procedure "dismemberment abortion."
Several court challenges to both types of laws are underway, with federal appeals courts considering the "dismemberment abortion" bans approved last year in Texas and Arkansas. The Kansas Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the first-in-the-nation ban passed in that state three years ago.
Ingrid Duran, director of state legislation at the National Right to Life Committee, said the model state laws drafted by their group are aimed at U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote who wrote the court's 2007 opinion upholding a federal ban on a procedure critics call partial-birth abortion.
They said the court could use similar reasoning to prohibit dilation and evacuation and noted it has never considered whether states have an interest in protecting fetuses from pain.
"We did draft these laws with the bigger picture in mind," Duran said.
The shifted focus comes after the court dealt the anti-abortion movement a blow in 2016 by ruling that strict Texas regulations on abortion clinics and doctors were an undue burden on abortion access and unconstitutional.
Anti-abortion groups hope President Donald Trump will be able to nominate one or more justices to the Supreme Court following last year's confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, potentially making the court more conservative on the issue for decades to come.
In the meantime, some of them are cautioning their allies not to go too far.
Duran said the proposed 15-week ban in Mississippi, which now goes to the state Senate, caught them by surprise. They noted that prior state laws banning abortion after 12 weeks or once a heartbeat was detected have been found unconstitutional.
In South Carolina this past week, state senators tabled a bill that would have banned most abortions to give lawmakers more time to study the consequences. Also last week, a legislative committee in Tennessee amended a bill to remove language that would have outlawed abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detectable, which is usually around six weeks. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Micah Van Huss, said they would be back.
"I will not stop fighting for the lives of babies until abortion is abolished in this state," they said.

Watch the Met Opera Stage a Sea of Blood
Image Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times
When it comes to blood, Quentin Tarantino has nothing on the Metropolitan Opera. Stabbings, shootings, torture and beheadings are routine at the Met. But the bloodiest show of them all may be François Girard's production of Wagner's “Parsifal,” which returns on Feb. 5 and floods the theater's vast stage with some 1,250 gallons of the stuff.
The stage blood — made from a recipe that includes tap water, glycerin, and red and blue dye, mixed to taste — is created in Brooklyn by a company called J&M Special Effects, which heats and trucks it to the Met in 250-gallon rectangular tanks before each performance.

Since opera singers do not care for frozen feet, the blood is kept warm in the tanks, which are swaddled in industrial-grade heating blankets until the last possible moment. At eight minutes before the curtain went up at a recent rehearsal, Terry Ganley, a stage manager, gave the cue.
“Fill 'er up,” they told a team of stagehands, many of whom wore rubber boots. The blood flowed.

The Met isn't trying to create a slasher opera. “Parsifal” is Wagner's metaphysical meditation on the knights of the Holy Grail, the goblet supposedly used at the Last Supper and which later caught Jesus's blood on the cross. Their leader, Amfortas, suffers from a mysterious wound that will not heal. In Mr. Girard's poetic 2013 production, blood is a central visual element.

“The overall staging didn't glue until we started playing with blood, because that is ultimately the voltage of the piece,” said Mr. Girard, who has included a river of blood; a bleeding bed; and, here, in Act II, a shallow pool of blood that covers the stage. “There was a lot of resistance: You can imagine the nightmare. But they've mastered it now.”

The Met tries to keep the blood warm for the singers and dancers who must stand in it — for a typically Wagnerian hourlong act — by placing heating pads under the red vinyl that lines the pool onstage. But the blood begins cooling as soon as it pours out. Philip J. Volpe, the Met's master electrician, monitors its temperature with an infrared thermometer.

Keeping things neat and safe with over 1,000 gallons of fake blood sloshing around is not easy. An overflow trough sits behind the pool. Rows of chairs with towels and sandals are placed for the performers coming off the bloody stage, and absorbent mats and brown paper are taped along the path to their dressing rooms. Members of the stage crew are posted beneath the stage to make sure no blood seeps into the Met's underground storage areas, where sets for operas like “L'Elisir d'Amore” and “Pagliacci” are currently stored.

A unique kind of stage-prop dialysis is used to keep the blood hygienic. Following each performance, the tanks of blood are trucked back to J&M, which filters out any newly added particles of foam and dust. The blood is then purified with ultraviolet light to kill bacteria.
“We can't use chlorine or anything like that because it would turn the water pink,” said David Feheley, the Met's technical director. “Which is, you know, less dramatic.”

The blood creates striking tableaus — drenching the dress Evelyn Herlitzius wears as they sing the role of Kundry, a wild woman in the thrall of an evil sorcerer; and helping the audience visualize the spiritual quest taken by Parsifal (the tenor Klaus Florian Vogt). And it fits squarely into Mr. Girard's conception of the opera.
“We're talking about life, Christ, Amfortas's wound, sexuality, all of those things,” they said. “Blood became the connector.”

When the rehearsal ended, stagehands used brooms to push the blood into a small well at the back of the pool, where sump pumps sent it coursing back into the tanks.
“Where is the AB negative?” joked Stephen A. Diaz, the master carpenter.
The dancers and choristers filed offstage dripping, their feet stained slightly red. The remedy for the stains, it turns out, is much simpler than the one for Amfortas's wound, which requires the touch of a holy spear. Many of the performers have found that the red can be wiped away with Barbasol shaving cream.

Zinedine Zidane has played down the idea James Rodriguez will be out to prove a point when they come up against Real Madrid in the Champions League.
James could be included in Bayern Munich's starting XI on Wednesday when the Bundesliga champions have home advantage in the first leg of the semi-final.
The Colombia international fell down the pecking order during their second season at Madrid, leading to their departure on a two-year loan deal to Bayern, who have the option to make the move permanent.
Left out of their squad for the Champions League final last year, they now have the chance to knock their parent club out of this season's competition.
JAMES: "ZIDANE IS STILL MY IDOL"
Yet Zidane revealed on the eve of the contest that they never wanted the player to leave Spain, while also stating there is no bad blood between the pair despite media speculation to the contrary.
JAMES BACKS Bavaria TO BEAT MADRID
"I didn't want James to go, they decided to go. I never had any problem with James and it's more about what is said in the press," the Frenchman told the media.
Zidane: “James will be motivated as they are a footballer and will want to do well. But not to show anything to me, or anything like that. Anybody who thinks I am against James is wrong, they are a good player, and will show that for sure. — Dermot Corrigan (@dermotmcorrigan) April 24, 2018
"I think they will be motivated because they are a football player. They don't have to prove anything to anyone.
"Anyone that thinks I am against James is wrong.
"He will want to go out and prove themselves but because they like football and that's it."
Supporters from the Zimbabwe Vigil's earliest days, now scattered far and wide, were invited to join us to be photographed for the back cover of a book to be published soon about our protest.
The book's introduction begins: ‘In the fifteenth year of the weekly Vigil under the windows of Zimbabwe House in London, we produce this journal in the hope that real change is in sight and the country can embrace a future free of the malignant Mugabe influence.'
The book, titled ‘Zimbabwe Emergency', is based on the Vigil's diaries which over the years have recorded how events in Zimbabwe have unfolded as seen by the diaspora in the UK. The diaries chronicle the economic disintegration, violence, growing oppression and political manoeuvring – and the tragic human cost involved.
The introduction cautions people of the dangers of further co-operation with Zanu PF's divisive legacy. It says: ‘They say the leopard never changes its spots. Our fear is that, with the departure of Mugabe, the people of Zimbabwe may again have the Zanu PF leopard foisted on them in some form or other. For the likely results be warned by these pages.‘
All proceeds from the book will go to help the Vigil finance its work in Zimbabwe, which ranges from humanitarian aid to voter education. Much of this is carried out by the sister organisation the Vigil set up at home, the Restoration of Human Rights in Zimbabwe.
ROHR's latest project is to help the Zimbabwe Peace Actors' Platform (ZimPAP) which aims to train 100,000 civilian peacekeepers to overcome fear and intimidation, particularly in the rural areas, during next year's elections.
On Friday about 150 ROHR supporters staged a peace march in the centre of Chitungwiza in defiance of an unconstitutional police attempt to stop them. ROHR President Ephraim Tapa told us that the police later raided the homes of several of the organisers and ordered them to report to the police on Monday. Legal representation is being obtained.
Ephraim said the police had earlier refused to allow a peace march planned in Harare at the end of May. They said ‘this is against the constitution which stipulates that people only have to notify the police about a demonstration, not get permission. It is the police who are being lawless and we must challenge this.'
Other points
Ephraim encouraged people to help raise sponsorship for a walk on Saturday 1 st July organised by Daizy Fabian to raise funds for ZimPAP. The walkers will cover 15 miles from Ilford planning to reach the Vigil by 2 pm.
A proof copy of the book was passed around at the the Vigil and aroused much interest – though not perhaps as much as the annual parade of more than a hundred naked and semi-naked cyclists down the Strand past the Embassy. Fortunately for them the weather was bright and sunny this year.
We managed to catch a picture of Mugabe next to the Ambassador's car. They looked horrified at the cyclists.
Thanks to those who arrived early to help set up: Mavis Chisvo, Enock Dzonga, Jonathan Kariwo, Fungayi Mabhunu, Netsayi Makarichi, Rosemary Maponga, Margaret Munenge, Charles Mupawose, Mduduzi Ndlovu, Edmore Pedzisai, Rumbidzayi Sambana and Michael Sirewu. Thanks to Mavis, Catherine Musa and Netsayi for looking after the front table, to Rosemary, Enock and Rumbidzayi for handing out flyers and selling wristbands and to Mduduzi, Rumbidzayi, Fungayi, Jonathan, Edmore, Charles and Netsayi for putting up the banners. Thanks also to Nyarai Masvosva for the extra photos and to Fungayi for wearing our Mugabe mask.

Both U.S. presidential administrations have referenced "strategic patience" when dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.
North Korea has angered several countries — mostly South Korea, Japan and the U.S. — over its repeated nuclear and missile tests. These tests have resulted in stricter sanctions by the United Nations and world powers, but the reclusive nation continues to carry out such launches in defiance.
On Sunday, Pyongyang test-fired a missile but the launch ended up in failure as the projectile “blew up almost immediately,” according to the U.S. military. The launch came ahead of Vice President Mike Pence's official visit to South Korea.
However, this is not the first test-firing of a missile by the Kim Jong Un-led country. In all, it has carried out three missile test-launches this year and several others in previous years. Here's a timeline.
1984: Under Kim Il Sung's rule, North Korea test-fired its first Scud-B missile.
1990: Pyongyang test-launched its first Rodong missile.
1994: The country's founding leader Kim Il Sung died in July. Following the death, their son Kim Jong Il took over the control of the governance.
1998: The reclusive country fired a Taepodong-1 missile. However, the North said it was a satellite launch.
2003: Pyongyang withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and started gathering weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods.
2005: The country announced that it has nuclear weapons.
2006: The North test-launched Taepodong-2, Rodong and Scud missiles in July that year. In October, the country's official Korean Central News Agency announced a “successful nuclear test.”
2009: In April, North Korea fired a Taepodong-2 missile, but said it was a satellite launch. The following month, the country conducted a second nuclear test and in July that year, it test-fired Scud and Rodong missiles.
2011: North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il died in December, allowing their son Kim Jong-un to assume power.
2012: The country test-fired Unha-3 rocket in April, but the launch was a reported failure. In December that year, Pyongyang successfully launched the Unha-3 rocket — the country's first satellite into space.
2013: In February, North Korea carried out its third underground nuclear test.
2014: Ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea in July, the North carried out missile tests.
2015: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in December that their country is “ready to detonate” a hydrogen bomb.
2016: The year witnessed a series of nuclear and missile tests from the isolated nation. In January, North Korea said it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. The impact of the test was so strong that it triggered a 5.1-magnitude artificial earthquake near Pyongyang's main nuclear test site.
In February, the country launched the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite into orbit.
Following the satellite launch, the country fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile in August.
In September, Kim Jong-un's regime fired three ballistic missiles with at least one of them reportedly entering Japan's air defense zone. In the same month, it carried out a fifth nuclear test.
In October, North Korea fired a ballistic missile, which exploded immediately after the launch.
2017: In February, North Korea test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile into the East Sea. The missile launch was the country's first since Donald Trump took office as the U.S. president in January.
In March, the reclusive nation fired four ballistic missiles as a part of, what it claimed, drills targeting U.S. military bases in Japan.
On April 16, North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile. However, the launch was reportedly a failure.

Boys & Girls Clubs of American Samoa (BGCAS) is helping community youth learn critical thinking, problem-solving, and coding through the new Computer Science (CS) Pathway program, thanks to a $3 million partnership between Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and Microsoft.
BGCA and Microsoft developed the CS Pathway to prepare the next generation of students with science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) skills.
The program puts a special emphasis on helping a larger number of underserved youth learn and apply computer science skills throughout their education so that they will be prepared to succeed in an increasingly technology driven economy. The pathway structure empowers young people to find programs that best meet their needs.
For Club members who already have some coding proficiency through Hour of Code or other programs, the CS Pathway provides additional options to them further and build on that interest.
BGCAS and thirty-one Boys & Girls Clubs across the country took part in the CS Pathway program offering four levels of fun and engaging CS curriculum. Pathway delivery and acquired skills build on one another to encourage members to develop passion and proficiencies in coding, over time and at any level.
“The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects there will be one million unfilled jobs for computer scientists and programmers by 2020, yet many children today still lack access to the tools and resources they need to learn and love computer science” said Mrs. Mary A.T. Tulafono, BGCAS Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Volunteer Officer.
“Thanks to CS Pathway, we will be able to help our Club members interact with code and other computer science skills by channeling their personal interests and providing a long-term path to develop program capabilities over time,” they said.
“Jobs increasingly require critical and computational thinking skills, yet only 25% of high schools in the United States offer computer science,” said Mary Snapp, Corporate Vice President and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. “The Computer Science Pathway is an after-school program that will empower young people from all backgrounds to pursue a broad range of career opportunities, both in technology and otherwise.”
According to STEMConnector.org, STEM jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow nearly twice as fast as other fields by 2018. By 2020, one million jobs will likely go unfilled due to a lack of computer science skills.
The CS Pathway curriculum taps into engaging content like gaming and app development to introduce more underrepresented youth, of all ages, to computer science skills.
Boys & Girls Clubs of American Samoa serves over 150 youth through Club membership and community outreach annually.
CS Pathway is part of Boys & Girls Clubs of American Samoa's strategy aimed at ensuring all members graduate from high school on time, are ready for a post-secondary education, and a 21st century career.

Look, everyone's different. Some people celebrate Easter with a trip to church, a delicious meal with their loved ones, and maybe an adorable Easter egg hunt for the kids. While others celebrate by building explosives and then firing rockets into a church.
TO EACH THEIR OWN (we always say). And the city of Vrontados located on the Aegean island of Chios certainly has their own unique spin on the holiday. Every year, the Greek island makes and stockpiles fireworks and rockets for their Easter celebration which draws tourists from all over the world.
The festival called, Rouketopolemos, involves two churches with a several hundred year old rivalry: Agios Markos and Panagia Erithiani. And every year (going back to sometime in the Ottoman Empire) the churches face off in a rocket war. Over the course of the night, tens of thousands of rockets are fired at each other across the valley. The goal is to strike the other's bell tower. And the church that provides the most direct hits on the other is considered the “winner” of the battle. The result is a crazy display of fireworks and rockets that light up the night sky from miles around, and cause a good amount of property damage to both the churches and surrounding homes. But you know what they say, “You can't make a rocket omelet on Easter without cracking a few eggs…” Or something like that.
It's an awesome party. And if you've ever wondered what it would look like if Michael Bay directed Easter Sunday and called it “The First Transformer: Rise of the Son” then Rouketopolemos should be on your “must do” list.
The event is understandably not beloved by all. Some residents don't care for the yearly property damage or influx of partying tourists who plan to drunkenly set off explosives (is there any better time to shout, “USA, USA, USA” than when trying to set off a firework after shotgunning 7-8 beers? Doubtful!). But as the tradition has continued for hundreds of years, it looks like it's safe for a little longer.
So, as Zayn says in their song Pillowtalk, “So we'll piss off the neighbours…It's our paradise and it's our war zone. Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise. War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone. Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise. War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone.”
Truer words were never spoken. Sing on poet, sing on.
PHILADELPHIA — Eagles star quarterback Carson Wentz has a torn left ACL and will miss rest of the season and playoffs, coach Doug Pederson confirmed.
Wentz, a favourite in the NFL MVP race, had an MRI on Monday that revealed the severity of the injury. Wentz was hurt late in the third quarter Sunday at Los Angeles. Backup Nick Foles rallied the Eagles (11-2) to a 43-35 win over the Rams that secured the NFC East title and put them in first place in the conference with three games remaining.
The Eagles have overcome several key injuries and now have to move forward without their most indispensable player. Nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters, return specialist/running back Darren Sproles, star linebacker Jordan Hicks and special teams captain Chris Maragos already went down for the season.
“If there's ever an opportunity for me to rally the troops as the football coach, now might be the time,” Pederson said. “You can't lose faith. This has been a resilient football team all season long.”
After starting all 16 games as a rookie, Wentz made a giant leap this year. They passed for 3,296 yards and set a franchise single-season record with 33 touchdown passes while only tossing seven interceptions.
Foles led the Eagles to a pair of field goals on consecutive drives against the Rams.  They are 20-17 as a starter in six seasons with the Eagles, Rams and Chiefs.
Pederson insisted the offence won't change with Foles.
“He's a highly intelligent football player,” Pederson said.
A third-round pick by former Eagles coach Andy Reid in 2012, Foles in their second stint in Philadelphia. They replaced an injured Michael Vick in 2013 and led the Eagles to an NFC East title during Chip Kelly's first season as coach. Foles tied an NFL record with seven TD passes in a game at Oakland in November 2013 and finished that season with 27 TDs and only two picks. The Eagles lost at home to New Orleans in the playoffs. Foles went to the Pro Bowl and was the offensive MVP.
But Kelly traded Foles to St. Louis for Sam Bradford after the 2014 season. Foles spent a year with the Rams, a season with the Chiefs and returned to Philadelphia as a free agent this season.
Second-year pro Nate Sudfeld is Philadelphia's No. 3 quarterback. Pederson said they haven't spoken to personnel boss Howie Roseman about adding a third quarterback yet.
“I'm absolutely ready to go — need be,” Foles said after the win over the Rams. “I prepare every day.”

Mammy and their family are back on screens for two more festive specials – but what about a full run of episodes?
Mrs Brown's Boys is back for what is now an annual tradition of festive specials. Every year it is one of the most watched programmes on television with fans crying out for a full series. So, will there be any more of Brendan O'Carroll's Irish mammy on screens in the near future?
Advertisement
There's good news and bad news. Mrs Brown's Boys has been commissioned for Christmas specials stretching all the way until 2020. BUT there are no plans for a full series – although it's unlikely that's a decision made by the BBC. The last run of episodes, which aired back in 2013, pulled in an average of nine million viewers – staggering numbers which were matched by last year's Christmas special.
With three series in total, there is plenty of material for fans to watch back on DVD and the Mrs Brown's crew often tour arenas in the UK and around the globe.
There is also All Round to Mrs Brown's – the television chat show that was launched on BBC1 earlier this year. The new venture was deemed a success by the Beeb who rewarded mammy with a second series, starting in March 2018.
“The whole family are thrilled with the reception the show has received on Saturday nights,” O'Carroll said at the time of to recommission.
“Although our focus right now is on the Christmas Specials of our regular Mrs Brown's Boys Show, we are excited that 2018 will see party time at the Browns' house again.”

So, not long until you see Mrs Brown and their eccentric family on your screen again.

The Alexandria Police Department reported five people were taken to the hospital for treatment. Officials said the investigation is ongoing, but the city is safe.
Police Chief Michael Brown said the shooting happened just after 7 a.m. They added the FBI will be taking over the investigation. A spokesperson with the FBI said it is too early in the investigation to say if this was an act of terrorism or whether members of Congress were being directly targeted in the shooting.
The team roster shows Scalise was the only member of the Louisiana congressional delegation at the practice.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Michigan's Charles Matthews is removing their name from consideration for the NBA draft.
Matthews announced their decision Wednesday, saying he's learned a lot through this process. They say he'll now focus on finishing their education at Michigan and leading their teammates to more success next season. The Wolverines made it to the NCAA title game this year before losing to Villanova .
Michigan already lost big man Moe Wagner, who left early for the draft. Matthews declared for the draft without hiring an agent, but he's now withdrawing.
The 6-foot-6 Matthews averaged 13 points a game this past season, their first with the Wolverines after transferring from Kentucky and sitting out a season. They have two seasons of college eligibility remaining.

Ford's S197-chassis Mustang has been around for over a decade, bestowing it prime project car credentials: fun, affordable, and plentiful. 2005-2009 Mustang GTs can be found for under ten grand! While the 4.6L Three-Valve V8 won't vault it into the Horsepower Hall of Fame, it makes the right rumble and is only a supercharger away from serious horsepower.
In a nod to the 2005-2009 Mustang's increasing popularity, the engineers at Hooker's BlackHeart Speed Exhaust developed a series of exhaust products for the S197 platform, including complete cat-back exhausts. Hooker offers two systems: PN 70503338-RHKR, features a pair of straight-through mufflers; while PN 70503337-RHKR, replaces the mufflers with straight tubing for an ultra-aggressive sound.
The BlackHeart cat-back systems feature 3-inch, 18-gauge 304 stainless steel tubing for maximum flow and minimum weight. The front connector pipes adapt to the OEM H-pipe with a slip-fit connections and high-quality band clamps. All the tubing is carefully mandrel bent to utilize all the factory hangers while offering maximum clearance around the suspension and chassis. Both systems feature a 4-inch slash-cut, double-wall, polished exhaust tips laser etched with the Hoooker BlackHeart logo.
Hooker's system featuring their straight-through muffler shaves over 8 pounds off the relatively portly S197 chassis, while the “mufflerless” system reduces exhaust weight a total of 14 pounds.
We traveled to Hooker's Bowling Green, Kentucky facility to sample the two BlackHeart cat-back options on a 2009 Mustang GT/CS. Technician Walker Weathers helped us with the installation and testing.
When compared to the stock exhaust, the Hooker BlackHeart cat-back with mufflers added a much deeper, more authoritative tone to our test subject. The hearty baritone could be heard both inside and outside the GT/CS convertible.
The “mufflerless” cat-back replaced the baritone opera singer with a rowdy punk rocker. Not only was the Hooker BlackHeart cat-back without mufflers louder overall, the tone was raspier and more aggressive.
When used with the stock manifolds and H-pipe, we concluded system choice is a matter of preference. However with more advanced modifications ahead of the cat-back, we suspect the “mufflerless” cat-back would be too loud. So, if your only planned exhaust modifications are a cat-back, we'd choose the Hooker BlackHeart system without mufflers—but if more exhaust modifications are planned, the Hooker BlackHeart system with mufflers is the wise choice.
1. The Hooker BlackHeart cat-back exhaust for 2005-2009 Mustang GTs features 304 stainless steel construction, straight-through mufflers, and is 8 pounds lighter than the factory system.
2. The 3-inch tubing of the cat-back system connects to the factory H-pipe with a slip fit joint and a stainless steel band clamp.
3. The Hooker BlackHeart cat-back includes polished mufflers and double-wall, 4-inch stainless steel tips laser etched with the Hooker logo.
4. To ease installation and clearance adjustment, the cat-back features leak-free slip fit joints and high-quality band clamps.
5. Hooker technician Walker Weathers began our installation by disconnecting the OEM muffler hanger brackets from the chassis.
6. Then, Weathers loosened the OEM muffler's clamp from the over-axle pipe.
7. After a little wiggling (some spray lube helps), we removed the OEM mufflers.
8. Moving forward, Weathers loosened the clamps behind the OEM H-pipe.
9. With the clamps loose, Weathers slid the OEM over-axle pipes backwards and removed the pipes from the chassis.
10. Using the supplied clamps, Weathers loosely installed the Hooker BlackHeart connector pipes over the OEM H-pipe.
11. Then, Weathers snaked the 3-inch over-axle pipes into position.
12. Weathers tightened the clamps slightly to keep all the tubing in place, but still allow for adjustment.
13. With the 3-inch exhaust tubing in place, Weathers installed the polished, straight-through Hooker mufflers.
14. Weathers reused the OEM hanger brackets and isolators with the Hooker cat-back system.
15. Since the Hooker mufflers are considerably smaller than their OEM counterparts, accessing the hanger bracket fasteners was much easier.
16. With the mufflers in place, Weathers loosely installed the clamps.
17. Weathers took their time when aligning and tightening the exhaust system to ensure maximum clearance around the chassis and suspension components.
18. The completed Hooker BlackHeart cat-back exhaust carries a limited lifetime warranty, so its 304 stainless steel construction may resist road salt better than some of the other undercarriage components on this much-driven Mustang.
19. Besides a cat-back with mufflers, Hooker also offers a cat-back without mufflers. It drops an additional 6 pounds of weight over the OEM exhaust, bringing total weight savings to 14 pounds.
20. After testing the sound of the “muffled” cat-back, we swapped out the axle-back portion of the system with that of the “mufflerless” version. Not surprisingly, the unmuffled version sounded much more aggressive.
21. The 4-inch polished stainless steel tips fit perfectly with the aesthetics of the 2009 Mustang GT/CS.
22. Both systems added some much-needed sound to the 2009 Mustang GT/CS. The muffled system sounded deep and sophisticated, while the mufflerless system was loud and rowdy.

CLEVELAND — A grand jury has declined to charge two Ohio police officers in the death of a mentally ill woman who collapsed while handcuffed and struggling with police in 2014, authorities said Friday.
The grand jury cleared Cleveland officers Scott Aldridge and Bryan Myers of any criminal wrongdoing in the November 2014 death of Tanisha Anderson. Authorities have said Anderson, 37, of Cleveland, agreed to accompany officers called to their home by their family in November 2014, then began struggling after getting into a cruiser.
Cuyahoga County's medical examiner had found that Anderson stopped breathing after being placed on their stomach, and heart problems and mental illness contributed to their death. Ohio Attorney General Special Prosecutions Chief Matthew J. Donahue noted in a memorandum about the case to the judge and a deputy attorney general that another medical expert found “it would appear no significant chest compromise was occurring and the sudden collapse is more consistent with a cardiac event.”
Donahue described Anderson's death as “tragic.”
Cleveland settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Anderson's family for $2.25 million in 2017.
The family had said that it wanted the officers to be prosecuted. An attorney for the family, David Malik, told WJW-TV that they urged the public to access the court documents to obtain the “real facts.” A message seeking additional comment from Malik was left at their office Friday.
Police union officials have maintained the officers did nothing wrong.
“I appreciate the efforts of the special prosecutor and the service of (the) grand jury that came to the just conclusion that these officers did nothing wrong,” attorney Henry Hilow, who represents the police officers, told WJW on Friday.
Officials with the city and the police will determine whether the officers will face any discipline.

Deciding that we're going to be or do something that basically amounts to us moving on from a space where we've been stuck in a cycle of thinking, feeling and acting in a particular way, sometimes leads to the assumption that the cycle will end automatically. We might spend months suffering over our ex and finally decide that we have to try to move forward. It may be that clashing with a loved one triggered months of rumination. Thoughts and feelings that we associate with The Time Before We Decided To Move On, can lead to us feeling confused and frustrated. We doubt our decision or doubt our ability to move on. We wonder, Is the fact that I'm thinking about him/her/the situation a sign that I'm not ready to move on?
In short, the answer is NO.
Us humans are creatures of habit.
Imagine that last July, you finally ended your relationship after a year of going back and forth. During the relationship you overfunctioned to compensate, not just for where they weren't showing up but also for your own underlying feelings of low self-worth. Maybe you reasoned that if you sacrificed you for the relationship, that they'd see that you were worth committing to. You're ready to move on from trying at this relationship.
After an initial period of feeling almost on a bit of a high for having ended the relationship and beginning No Contact, the loss of the relationship starts to set in. You attempt dating but it doesn't obliterate hurt and loss so feelings of inadequacy resurface. You fear that you're never going to find The One. Maybe you hear that your ex is already seemingly moving on with someone else.
Thoughts of injustice, inadequacy and longing consume you.
Like anyone who overcompensates during a relationship, you then end up feeling entirely to blame for why it didn't work out. It doesn't seem fair that they've moved on so quickly. How dare they replace me? You keep retracing your steps and trying to work out where you made ‘one false move'. Thinking about the relationship reminds you of other painful experiences and judgments. In your fantasy, it's just you that they were this way with. You convince you that the new person is getting everything that you should have got.
Finally, you get to January of this year and you're like, Enough. You've begun to acclimatise to the truth of the relationship. There's a genuine need and desire to start rebuilding your life. You're ready to take the focus off them and bring it back to you. You're ready to move on.
I get that you want to move on (and you will) but it's unrealistic to build a habit over a period of six months and to then expect it to vanish overnight because you're ready to move on.
You are in the habit of thinking about this person/situation.
Feelings, thoughts, places, actions and, yes, other habits, are associated with this person.
If they were your first thought every day, they still will be for a while until you intervene on that habit of thinking. If you've just spent six months thinking about them in the shower, over breakfast, during meetings, while hanging out with friends, and you've pretty much diverted to them each time you've wanted to check out from life, that's a habit.
No, it's not going to take you six months to replace those thoughts but after defaulting to thinking and obsessing about this person morning, noon and night and building associations around that, it's what your mind now thinks you're supposed to do. Until you intervene and create new habits, it will continue to do so.
If we've spent weeks, months or even years responding with certain feelings and thoughts, it's unrealistic to assume they'll fade away of their own accord. You have to break the habit.
Keep in mind, as well, that the thoughts and feelings might be outdated. They might not represent who you are at this point in time — you just might be in the habit of having those thoughts and feelings linked with aspects of your day.
Before you convince you that thinking about them (or a situation) again despite your desire to move forward means that you're not ready, halt. What's the habit that you've created around this person or situation? Gather some intel over the course of a few days or a week. When you think about them (or the situation) where are you? What are you doing? What were you feeling and thinking? Who else is there? Break it down. You'll spot opportunities to adjust this no longer desired routine plus you can intervene on habitual thoughts and feelings. You can move you on to another topic and jump off of that train of thought.
We like the familiar, even when it's uncomfortable, but we are adaptable and a habit of thinking can be replaced by another one when we become more conscious, aware and present.
Your thoughts?
Another day, another Drizzy drama, this time featuring Pusha T who, upon releasing their newest album Daytona on Friday, produced by Kanye West, took a dig at Drake on their track “Infrared,” reigniting a long-dormant and low-key feud.
In the song, Pusha alleges, as many others before them have, that Drake uses ghostwriters to write their music, specifically Quentin Miller (who released their own track in response). The lyrics in contention are: “The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin' / The bigger question is how the Russians did it / It was written like Nas but it came from Quentin.”
In a matter of hours, Drake then released the scorching “Duppy Freestyle,” which opens with them taking a very Drake, very melodramatic sigh. On the song, they accuse Pusha of not actually living the hardcore, drug-dealing life to which he's claimed, suggesting that he's mostly borrowed the story from their cousins, as noted in the lyrics: “Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes / But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s.”
They also take shots at Kanye, accusing them of holding back Louis Vuitton menswear director Virgil Abloh's career because they were threatened by him, referencing tracks off their most recent album, The Life of Pablo: “I've done things for them I thought they never would need / Father had to stretch their hands out and get it from me / I pop style for 30 hours, then let them repeat.”
Drake ended the song by saying they would be sending Pusha an invoice for the extra promotion, going so far as to post one on their Instagram just as “Duppy Freestyle” quickly went viral online.
But Pusha did not take this lying down, crossing just about every line and using just about every bit of information they had on the Toronto rapper, releasing a follow-up diss track “The Story of Adidon,” on Tuesday. (As Twitter user @mactothemax joked, “pusha called nardwuar,” a human encyclopedia who can dig up dirt on any given musician.)
The cover art itself is peak savagery, featuring a photo of Drake wearing blackface from an old and seemingly buried photoshoot for what may have been a Toronto-based clothing line called Too Black Guys. Photographer David Leyes said it was meant to be “a strong statement made by a black man about the f–ked up culture they are living in,” but fans have dubbed it offensive. Adding more salt to the wound, Pusha raps over the beat from Jay-Z's recent “The Story of O.J.,” the video for which includes minstrel imagery that harkens right back to Drake in blackface.
But then comes the rap itself, with Pusha shining a spotlight on perhaps the biggest bombshell to hit Drake. The rapper directly suggests that Drake has a secret child with former porn star Sophie Brussaux, something that has been rumoured for the last year but never made mainstream headlines: “Sophie knows better, ask your baby mother / Cleaned them up for IG but the stench is on them / You are hiding a child. … Adonis is your son / And they deserve more than an Adidas press run, that's real / Love that baby, respect that girl / Forget she's a pornstar, let them be your world.”
Adidon, by the way, is rumoured to be the name of Drake's upcoming line for Adidas, which some have speculated they recently joined after parting ways with Jordan brand. And the name itself may be Drake's spin on their rumoured son's name, in which case, as @Touré tweeted, “Adidon is the name of Drake's upcoming Adidas line and now that name will be associated with this beef and Pusha's monstrous diss track. Pusha has, in effect, screwed up Drake's brand before it came out.”
Adidon is the name of Drake's upcoming Adidas line and now that name will be associated with this beef and Pusha's monstrous diss track. Pusha has, in effect, screwed up Drake's brand before it came out. — Touré (@Toure) May 30, 2018
That destruction does indeed continue as Pusha goes on to suggest that Drake is following in their own “deadbeat” father's footsteps: “You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing / Your father walked away at five, hell of a dad thing.”
Brussaux promptly made their Instagram account, @sophieknowsbetter, private after the song went viral. They were first connected to the rapper in January 2017, when they were spotted having dinner together in Amsterdam. In May, they told TMZ that they had texts from Drake asking them to get an abortion. At the time, their rep commented, “If it is in fact Drake's child, which they do not believe, they would do the right thing by the child.”
Incidentally, Brussaux gave birth to a son in France on October 24, which is Drake's birthday. On that day, Drake was partying in Los Angeles.
Pusha T snapped .. exposed Drake like a episode of Maury. pic.twitter.com/Ag7dfKOMQG — DJ Akademiks (@IamAkademiks) May 30, 2018
It gets darker from there, with Pusha hitting out at Drake being biracial and feeling “confused” because they always felt they aren't “black enough,” and stabbing them where it really hurts, by mocking their mother for never marrying.
Still, it gets harsher, as Pusha goes for the absolute jugular with zero holds barred, mocking Drake's producer and best friend Noah “40” Shebib and their battle with multiple sclerosis in response, perhaps, to Drake lashing out at their producer, Kanye.
Pusha raps, “OVO 40, hunched over like they 80, tick, tick, tick. How much time they got? That man is sick, sick, sick.”
Coincidentally… tomorrow is World MS Day. https://t.co/5ms9IJwV86 — Noah Shebib (@OVO40) May 30, 2018
Seemingly addressing the ruthless barb, Shebib tweeted later Tuesday night, “Coincidentally… tomorrow is World MS Day,” with a link for fans to learn more. Shebib is also an ambassador for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and while these lyrics seem to have crossed a line, several fans pointed out that Drake went there before, by mocking Kid Cudi's struggle with drugs and depression in their 2016 song “Two Birds, One Stone.”

On March 17, Ala'a Ali left their wife and 4-year-old daughter at the home of relatives in the al Jadida neighborhood of Mosul, and went home to wash before the morning call to prayer. Two minutes after they arrived home, a deafening explosion ripped through the neighborhood, engulfing the narrow street in black smoke.
“I hid in the corner of the building, and smoke crept in through the windows,” 28-year-old Ali told The Intercept. “Then the smell hit me, and I could barely breathe.” As soon as they could, they bolted from their hiding place and ran to the scene of the explosion, and the house where they had left their family.
It had been hit by an airstrike from U.S.-led coalition forces bombing Islamic State fighters.
Corpses were everywhere in the ruins of the building; more than 200 people were reportedly killed. Ali's wife was among them, but they wouldn't know that until Iraqi civil defense forces found their body later that day. Ali heard the sound of a child groaning underneath the rubble. It was their daughter, Awra. Them body was charred black with severe burns, and shrapnel had pierced through the side of their head, cutting across their face, and sealing their eyes shut. Miraculously, they were breathing.
“I lifted them up, and started carrying them through the streets, but then an ISIS sniper started to shoot at the army,” Ali said. “I finally was able to leave them at the neighbors for a few minutes, and then take them to the field hospital once the fighting calmed down.”
Transferred between field hospitals and waiting for hours at checkpoints, Ali and Awra made it to the casualties ward of the West Erbil Emergency Hospital, 50 miles from Mosul and away from the front line. Doctors treated Awra's infections and set their broken leg in a cast. A few days ago, they operated on them to dislodge a piece of shrapnel from their eye, restoring their vision for the first time since the airstrike.
Though their face is still scarred from burns and shrapnel cuts, Awra is enjoying their newly-recovered sense of sight. They flipped through a picture book and played with leftover gauze, winding and unwinding a fake cast on their uninjured leg, laughing and energetic.
Them grandmother, Alia, tried to keep the child from itching the raw wounds on their head, scolding gently, “You can't touch it — you will make it hurt more.” With Awra's mother's passing, Alia is tending to them full-time. The doctors at West Erbil have been overwhelmed with patients from the airstrike in al Jadida, and so it is Alia who dresses Awra's wounds.
“Every day, there is more shrapnel,” Alia said, sitting on the linoleum floor of the hospital, stroking the tuft of brown hair on Awra's head that is growing back after it was shaved to remove the first pieces of metal when they arrived at the hospital. Bits of shrapnel are still coming out of their head wounds, and larger pieces remain lodged in their legs.
OTTAWA — The federal government missed a crucial opportunity to protect Canadians from harmful chemicals that could interfere with fertility and behaviour, an environmental organization says.
After a review, Environment and Climate Change Canada announced Friday that none of more than a dozen phthalates studied posed a risk to human health, and only one needs further study for possible risk to the environment.
Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastics flexible and harder to break, or as solvents, and are used in hundreds of commercial products including food containers, children's toys, detergents and personal hygiene products like makeup and shampoo.
Muhannad Malas, who runs the toxics program for Environmental Defence, said the European Union has concluded at least four phthalates pose a risk to human health and it is mind boggling that Canada did not come to the same conclusion.
They said one of the key differences is that in Europe, the onus has been placed on manufacturers to prove their products are safe but in Canada a product has to be proved unsafe before the government will ban or limit its use.
They said Canada's law needs to be modernized.
Last June, the House of Commons environment committee made dozens of recommendations to improve the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which governs the use of chemicals.
One of them was to mimic Europe's rule about proving something is safe before use rather than having to prove something is unsafe in order to ban it.
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna had until Friday to respond to that report and they said the government is considering the recommendations and will come up with a specific plan by June 2018.
BARCELONA, Spain — More companies are deciding to move their official base out of the Spanish region of Catalonia as tensions grow over the local government's push to declare independence.
Here's a look at what is happening, why it is important and what the risks are.
——
WHAT COMPANIES ARE MOVING?
Those that have already decided to move their official base are: Banco Sabadell, Spain's fifth-largest bank by assets, utility Gas Natural Fenosa, textiles maker Dogi, reprographics company Service Point Solutions, telecommunications provider Eurona and biotech firm Oryzon Genomics.
Executives at Caixabank, Spain's third-largest bank, are due to discuss the issue Friday and cava-maker Freixenet, a household name in sparkling wine, is also considering a move.
Companies that have agreed to move saw an immediate rise in their share prices, with Oryzon jumping over 20 per cent at one point.
——
WHAT DOES THEIR RELOCATION MEAN?
The companies are moving only the official address of their legal residence. For now, that does not affect jobs or investments. Most of these companies are big enough to have large offices in other Spanish cities, so it's mainly a question of paperwork, though they could decide to move operations as well if the situation worsens in the region.
——
WHAT RISK ARE THEY TRYING TO AVOID?
Their main concern is that they may no longer be covered by Spanish and European Union laws and rights if Catalonia manages to secede and they remain based in the region.
Banks, for example, have a right to do business anywhere in the EU's 28 states by virtue of being based in the bloc. Should Catalonia secede, the banks would lose that right overnight if they are still based officially in Catalonia. It's a problem similar to the one British banks are facing when the country eventually leaves the EU. Many banks with EU base in London are setting up new EU headquarters in cities like Frankfurt and Paris.
——
ARE THERE OTHER SIGNS OF ECONOMIC DISTRESS?
So far, the immediate economic impact on households and businesses has been limited. The most notable change has been a moderate drop in Spanish stocks and bonds. The Ibex 35 has been volatile but is down only 2 per cent on the week.
The greater concern is if the tensions escalate further. The region of Catalonia represents a fifth of Spain's overall economy, so its departure would seriously hurt Spain's public finances and raise questions about economic relations.
For Catalonia, full independence would create a multitude of huge economic risks. The region would officially drop out of the EU and the euro currency union and have to adopt new money. That would lead to mass bankruptcies as the new currency would likely plunge in value, leaving businesses and the regional government paying debts in euros with a new, devalued currency. Local investors would flock to move their money out of the region for fear of having it redenominated in a weaker currency. That could force Catalonia to put limits on money flows during what would likely be a deep recession. It's what Greece had to do two years ago when it was close to leaving the euro. Greece has still not fully lifted the money controls.

Senanu Arkutu is the founder and CEO of DAAR Living
Senanu Arkutu is the founder and CEO of DAAR Living, an interior styling firm that is diversely African, layered and interwoven, antique and contemporary, with European and Arab influences.
While pursuing a career in Reproductive Health and International Development, they realised they had a flair for interior design after decorating their own home. Spurred by the compliments they received, they gave up their day job and opened DAAR Living in 2013.
Senanu is also the set designer for the hit series, An African City. Them flagship store opened November 19, 2016 in East Legon, Accra, Ghana.
How does one switch from a career in international development to interior design, and what transferable skills have helped you in your new calling?
Hahaha! It was time for a change after a 12-year career —that I loved, by the way. I decided to follow a passion that I had not realised was also a skill until I designed and decorated my own house, and the warm compliments started coming.
Transferable skills from a career in sexual health and family planning, I find new ones every day! But the most important one to date is listening to client's concerns and finding an appropriate solution that is sensitive to their specific needs and feelings.
Conducting consultations helps.
You're Ghanaian but grew up in Southern and West Africa, which obviously have influenced DAAR Living. Where else do you draw inspiration from for your décors?
…And East Africa where my personal style probably leans towards. I draw inspiration from my mum, my clients, other designers, art and culture, trends, life.
What have been your highest and lowest points since starting DAAR Living three years ago?
The highest and lowest points all come together in establishing our first store.
I hired an established design and construction company to carry out the design changes I wanted done to the retail space. This was a team that the landlord was comfortable with as they had done some work for another retail space in the same building, which I had seen. The experience was a disaster. They were rude. Communication, follow-up and quality control were terrible and on top of that, a four-week job took them four months to complete! My rent money just went to waste (Accra landlords insist on two years rent upfront whether you are a start-up or not).
The highest point was the night I laid out and merchandised my store for the first time and went outside to see what it looked like from the shop window —I had a moment! With a physical space all done up as I wanted it, and DAAR Living signboard up in lights, it suddenly seemed like DAAR Living finally actually existed.
In an interview, you voiced your desire to see African arts and crafts showcased in other ways besides a market setting or market style setting. Would you mind elaborating?
I would love to see more of quality African art and crafts being showcased in all their glory in a contemporary retail, gallery-like space, and not always in a busy market where it is not easy to see the skill and beauty of the piece. You do not see this often in Ghana or the rest of the continent, except in South Africa and, now, of course, Alara in Lagos.
The new DAAR Living store aims to be the contemporary retail space showcasing African functional art and craft in Accra. We want to be front and centre in this emerging story.
You're the principle set designer for the hit African series, An African City. How did you get the deal for the show and end up collaborating with Christie Brown, who designed some of the beautiful clothes on the show?
Nicole (creator of An African City) and I are good friends. We believe in each other's work and see the value and strength in collaborating. I offered my house for use in season 1, and by Season 2 the AAC team had realised the added value of set design and how it plays a large part in story-telling.
DAAR Living was better established by then, but there was no budget allowance for set design, so Nicole turned to me and Nana Spio-Garbrah of Blueprint Africa (Assistant set design). Of course, we were glad to help Nicole, and there was also the added potential exposure An African City could give.
As for collaborating with Christie, when I began DAAR Living I wanted to launch a brand and begin building it and its community immediately. I knew that the products and services on offer may change slightly, several times, but the concept was clear and would remain the same. As a client and lover of Christie Brown, I could not get out of my head how pieces of mine reminded me of outfits of Aisha's (founder of Christie Brown). So I called them with an idea for an exhibition that brought interiors and fashion together to launch my brand and they loved it! They encouraged me, offered their then new flagship store for the launch, and the rest is history.
How does DAAR Living ensure on-time delivery and high quality across all its offerings, especially since décor and furniture pieces are sourced from across Africa?
Good question. The high quality is here in Africa but like everywhere else you have to do due quality control. This is my job and it takes a lot of back and forth but we get there.
For on-time delivery, firstly, I do not offer items for sale that are not already ‘on the shelf' — online or in the physical store. Secondly, if a client is making a bespoke order and I think it should take two weeks, I have learned to double the time duration. This way, I am always on time and often early which is always a joy to customers.
DAAR Living lays a heavy emphasis on colours. If you were to choose a colour that represented your company, which would it be and why?
It's impossible to choose one. Probably, it's the reason the DAAR Living logo is black and white with clean, simple lines. The backdrop best highlights all the diverse colours, art-forms and cultures of Africa.
What does the future hold for DAAR Living?
Many wonderful things all leading back to my development background of improving livelihoods.

Kikagaku Moyo Stone Garden, Fitness Forever Tonight
Kikagaku Moyo
Stone Garden
(Guruguru Brain)
The Tokyo-based quintet Kikagaku Moyo draws heavily from psychedelic rock but also channels elements from German Krautrock, hippie jams and Indian music, intending to evoke the supernatural with freely flowing songs that emerge from basic structures.
The songs on the 5-song EP Stone Garden were born from sessions in Prague that were later chiseled into recreatable pieces back home in Tokyo, with improvisation being both a tool for composition and a way to keep things alive and spontaneous.
There's a basic, primal feeling to several of these tracks, and on Stone Garden, the overall vibe is more important than structural complexity.The stirring, opening track “Backlash” is an aggressive number, harshly recorded in the red with severely fuzzed-out guitar tones, perhaps like the aural equivalent of a space shuttle re-entering the earth's atmosphere. Minimal patterns on guitar and drums are pounded into the ground with sparks flying off in all directions, almost completely obscuring a faint organ in the background.
For the next song, “Nobakitani,” Kakagaku Moyo goes for a completely different sensibility, wandering peacefully with acoustic guitars and Indian flavors from a sitar.
“Trilobites” offers hazy guitar wankery, while “In a Coil” perhaps resembles Can's “Mother Sky” if it was a little faster and cheery rather than menacing; it's a driving track with a minimal Holger Czukay-esque bass line and spirited melodic vocal murmuring and harmonizing.
The EP ends with “Floating Leaf,” serving up watery, cascading echoes and a groove that unfortunately ends too soon—at four minutes long, it could have easily been twice as long, continuing with its exploratory feel and sustained energy. Those who seek prog-rock complexity may be underwhelmed here, but for fans of psychedelic rock (think Acid Mothers Temple) who connect on a more nebulous level, Kikagaku Moyo is worth checking out.
Fitness Forever
Tonight
(Elefant)
Revivalism is not going to go away, and this writer wholeheartedly advocates listeners seeking out and understanding the sources of such tributes, plagiarism or appropriation (or whatever you want to call it).
That said, this critic thinks there's a good rule to follow: if you're going to do it, really go for it.
Be dedicated enough to the point where the music provides an overwhelming escapist pleasure, forcing the listener to forget the present and to step into another era and world.
Only a small fraction of such releases hit this high watermark—Fancey's remarkable ‘70s-obsessed Love Mirage comes to mind—and now there's the third album, Tonight, from the Italian group Fitness Forever to add to the list.
Averaging one album every four years, Fitness Forever takes its sweet time, and earlier releases concentrate on bouncy, nostalgic pop with a few diversions into disco territory, like “Se Come Te” from 2009's Personal Train and the title track of 2013's Cosmos.
However, on Tonight, Fitness Forever is all-in with Italian disco revivalism with spotless string and brass arrangements and high production values that one might not expect on an indie release.Joining band leader Carlos Valderrama and cohorts are several guest artists, including Vincent Mougel (from Kidsaredead), Paulita Demaíz (from the Spanish pop duo Papa Topo) and French singer Anna Jean from the group Juniore.
The opening salvo of “Tonight” and “Dance Boys” kicks down the door and creates an instant party, followed by “Canadian Ranger” that seemingly condenses about half of Abba Gold into a five-minute song. Unabashed saxophone solos (like on “Cosa Mi Hat Detto”) and keyboards that hint at Italo-disco coexist with flawless string and brass runs.
Tonight may appeal to fans of Daft Punk's Random Access Memories, and it makes the listener forget the question, “Why does this even need to exist?” It exists for you to enjoy, right now.
LAS VEGAS — Demetrious Johnson chasing an unprecedented 11th title defence and a headline fight that could decide Conor McGregor's next opponent top a UFC 216 card set for Saturday in Las Vegas, an event playing out in a city still reeling from a mass shooting in which 58 people were killed and nearly 500 were injured.
The mixed-martial arts promotion has pledged $1 million to help victims and their families, UFC President Dana White said. The pay-per-view card is one of many events that quickly resumed in Las Vegas after the shooting on Sunday, including a major casino conference, magic shows and concerts and a Los Angeles Lakers practice game set for Sunday in the same T-Mobile Arena where UFC 216 will take place.
“I'd say to the people outside of Las Vegas: Don't be afraid to come here,” White told TMZ as they pledged the donation.
The main event will be a contest for the interim lightweight title, as second-ranked Tony Ferguson (22-3) fights seventh-ranked Kevin Lee (16-2). Ferguson has a nine-fight win streak coming into the bout, and the winner could ultimately fight against megastar Conor McGregor to unify the belt.
Ferguson has already been arguing for that for the winner on Saturday, as McGregor mulls their return to MMA after a highly popular crossover boxing match against Floyd Mayweather in late August.
“The real righteous thing to do is to make sure the belts become unified,” Ferguson said. “That's what really needs to happen.”
Johnson, nicknamed “Mighty Mouse,” is tied with MMA legend Anderson Silva with 10 consecutive title defences, which Silva accomplished in the middleweight division. Johnson, 31, is considered by many to be the top pound-for-pound fighter in the sport, having not lost a fight in more than six years.
 They are the only flyweight champion in UFC history, winning the inaugural title against Joseph Benavidez in 2012 as the promotion expanded weight divisions. Johnson has rarely been tested during this run and is a heavy favourite facing third-ranked flyweight Ray Borg (11-2).
The two were originally scheduled to fight at UFC 215 one month ago, but Borg fell ill shortly before the fight and withdrew. The fight was quickly rescheduled and added as the co-main event for this weekend.
“I'm happy the UFC got it rescheduled super-fast,” Johnson said.
Johnson seems unfazed by the delay and said they thought Borg deserved the fight rather than a fill-in opponent on the original card.
“I mean, guys, it's only been four weeks and nothing's changed. They got sick and it happens,” Johnson said.
Borg says he's confident even despite the delay and Johnson's formidable streak.
“Nothing has changed in my mind. My mind is still to go out there and win that belt,” they said.
If you're still in the denial phase that you don't live in your comfort zone, check out these 6 signs. If you suffer from more than two of them, well…I hate to break it for you but you're stuck in the comfort zone my friend.
1. You are a member of the Procrastinator Club
You're always waiting for the right time, so it leads to you leaving everything to the very last second.
2. You can't make a decision
When you're faced with a decision making moment, you start to second guess everything, and you don't seem to make up your mind.
3. You're a complainer
You find fault in everything around you, and that's because the negative energy that comes out of doing the same thing and not experiencing new stuff makes you pessimistic.
4. You don't try something new things
Staying in your comfort zone makes you shy off from going on adventures because only the known is safe for you.
5. You don't like your life
People tend to think that being an introvert means you like living in the comfort zone, and that's not true. You want to break out of what's comfortable, but it is hard.
6. You haven't met new people recently
It is not that you don't go out a lot, or that you don't get the chance to meet new people. It is that you don't initiate any new conversations with people you don't know, or you simply block them out.
The Masontown Water Works have issued an emergency announcement for part of Preston County.
The Lumberport/Shinnston Gas Company hit a 10" main water line that services the area East of Elkins Ave.
This main line affects all customers from Elkins Ave., along Veterans Memorial Hwy to and including the Bretz, McKinney Cave Road and Giuliani Road area will be without water.
Officials are currently working to fix the leak. There is no estimated time for the line to be fixed due to the size of the line.
Decisions by most of the world's elite golfers to skip the PGA Tour's stop in West Virginia have been a boost for younger players like Xander Schauffele.
Schauffele had a one-stroke victory over Robert Streb at The Greenbrier resort last season, which ended with the 24-year-old from San Diego winning the Tour Championship and earning Rookie of the Year honours.
This year, nearly all of the two dozen rookies on the tour are in the field at A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier, which starts Thursday on the Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.
Chances are good that one or more of them could be near the top of the leaderboard. Four of the tournament's seven champions have been first-time winners, including three rookies.
Schauffele likes their chances, too.
 They are part of the successful high school class of 2011 that includes Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger. Schauffele pointed out that Spieth won the John Deere Classic in 2013 and 2015, Thomas won in Malaysia in 2015 and 2016, and Berger at the St. Jude Classic in 2016 and 2017.
“I feel like I want to join that group,” Schauffele said Wednesday.
But Schauffele has missed the cut in three of their last four tournaments after finishing tied for second at The Players Championship.
At No. 24 in the world, he's among five players ranked in the top 30 at The Greenbrier. The others are Bubba Watson (No. 13), Phil Mickelson (No. 20), Webb Simpson (No. 21) and Brian Harman (No. 26). Five from the top 15 in the FedEx Cup are competing.
Watson, a three-time winner this season, and Mickelson own vacation homes at The Greenbrier Sporting Club. The Greenbrier Classic, typically held around Independence Day, was renamed last month in honour of the nation's active and past members of the military, who are being given free admission.
“It would be a huge accomplishment to win here in front of my home crowd,” Watson said. “What a dream that would be, my dad was in the military so now we've got the name of the tournament. It just would mean a lot for my family to honour my late dad.”
It's the first tournament for Mickelson since the U.S. Open, when they intentionally violated golf rules by hitting a moving ball on the 13th green in the third round. They later apologized, saying their anger and frustration got the best of him.
The West Virginia stop could see a change when the PGA Tour reveals its full schedule this month for the next FedEx Cup season. The tournament at Sam Snead's former playground in White Sulphur Springs is under contract through 2021.
Watson, for one, wouldn't mind seeing a schedule change. From a business standpoint, they said the Fourth of July holiday always is a hectic time at The Greenbrier, so moving the tournament to later in the year, especially with the area's spectacular fall foliage on display, would give the resort yet another busy week.
“I've always thought that the fall would be great,” they said.
Up for grabs this week are four spots in the British Open at Carnoustie starting July 19. Those will go to players not already exempt among the top 12 finishers in West Virginia.
All past winners are in the field. So is Abraham Ancer, who was tied for the lead entering the final round of last week's Quicken Loans National. They finished tied for fourth.
Nineteen-year-old Norman Xiong is playing in their first tournament as a professional. They won the Haskins Award as the nation's top college golfer during their sophomore year at Oregon, earning them an exemption at The Greenbrier.
“It's pretty low-key here, so my mind's pretty settled and I'm just trying to prepare the best I can for the upcoming week,” Xiong said. “It's a different stage. It's kind of a new beginning. I don't know too many guys out here. Hopefully soon I can make some friends.”
After soaring to $4,000 on exchange markets over the weekend, the bitcoin cryptocurrency is continuing to rise, topping a record $4,300 on Monday — nearly $1,000 above its rate one week ago, according to data from the Coinbase currency exchange.
Bitcoin settled back under the $4,300 mark after reaching a new high Monday morning, according to several exchanges that track the decentralized currency.
"The bitcoin market cap soared past $70 billion," says CryptoCoins News, adding that a "flippening" that has been anticipated for years in the cryptocurrency community had finally come to pass, as "bitcoin now has a greater total valuation than payment-processing behemoth PayPal."
A bitcoin could be bought for around $570 just 12 months ago — reflecting a rise of around 645 percent to today's exchange rate.
Reporting on the rise, the Coindesk site says the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached a record $138 billion on Monday.
The steep ascent can be attributed to a number of factors, from political concerns to a recent split into two currencies — bitcoin classic and bitcoin cash. That change, which became official on Aug. 1, was made to give the currency a more robust infrastructure; it was also tied to a move to allow large trades in the currency to occur more frequently.
Formally introduced in 2009, bitcoin has steadily accumulated both users and investors. And blockchain, the technology that underlies bitcoin, has been embraced by both academics and banking giants such as Fidelity — which now lets customers track investments in cryptocurrency — and Goldman Sachs.
Other factors, such as bitcoin's role as a hedge against political uncertainty, also play a role. A finance executive tells CNBC that South Koreans have shown a "surge of interest" in the currency as the U.S. and North Korea trade threats. The network also says there's strong interest in bitcoin in Japan, with the yen accounting for 42 percent of bitcoin currency purchases.
It's been a heady summer for bitcoin holders. After the virtual currency hit a record $2,420 in May, The Economist ran a story asking, "What if the bitcoin bubble bursts?" and wondering if its rise could be compared to historic market crazes — like the one over tulips.
Noting that "Anyone clever or lucky enough to have bought $1,000 of bitcoins in July 2010, when the price stood at $0.05, would now have a stash worth $46 million," The Economist added that "Ascents this steep are rarely sustainable" — before concluding, "If there is such a thing as a healthy bubble, this is it."
Children born to Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers struggle to get basic rights and services in Jordan. Due to a law that denies women the right to pass citizenship to their children on an equal basis with men, these children are treated as foreign nationals their whole lives, with no permanent right to live or work in the country. (Amman) – Children born to Jordanian mothers and non-Jordanian fathers struggle to get basic rights and services in Jordan, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Due to a law that denies women the right to pass citizenship to their children on an equal basis with men, these children are treated as foreign nationals their whole lives, with no permanent right to live or work in the country. The 64-page report, “‘I Just Want Him to Live Like Other Jordanians': Treatment of Non-Citizen Children of Jordanian Mothers” details the ways Jordanian authorities restrict the rights of non-citizen children of Jordanian women to work, own property, travel from and return to Jordan, enroll in higher education, and access government health care and other services. A 2014 government decision purporting to ease restrictions has fallen far short of expectations. The multiple forms of exclusion and discrimination non-citizen children face often lead to severely diminished prospects for their future and place undue economic and social burdens on their families.
The report is based on more than 50 interviews with Jordanian women, non-citizen children, government officials and activists, as well as a comprehensive review of the relevant Jordanian laws, regulations, and decisions.
Despite progress by countries across the Middle East and North Africa to allow women to pass nationality to their children, Jordan has announced no plans to amend its nationality law. Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen all provide equal rights to women and men to confer citizenship to their children. Iraq and Mauritania allow women with foreign husbands to confer nationality to children born in the country.
While local women's rights activists attribute successive governments' unyielding stance on the issue to a deep-seated patriarchal culture, Jordanian lawmakers and officials typically cite several justifications for this discriminatory policy. Among these are the alleged implication that Jordan could become an “alternative homeland” for Palestinians and the presumed financial burden of a policy change.
However, the law permits a Jordanian man to marry as many as four women, including foreign nationals, and to pass on citizenship to their wives and children.

“I was born [in Jordan], my whole family and my loyalty is here, my roots are here,” said “Nermeen,” a 43-year-old daughter of a Jordanian woman and a Palestinian man. “With all my respect and love for Palestine, what am I supposed to do there? I don't have anything there. Jordan is not my alternative homeland, it is my country.”
By depriving Jordanian women of their right to confer citizenship to their children on an equal basis with men, Jordan violates both international law and its own constitution, which guarantees all Jordanians equality before the law. International human rights bodies, including the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), have also found Jordan's nationality law discriminatory.
In 2014, following increased domestic pressure, Jordanian authorities appeared ready to recognize non-citizen children of Jordanian women as a specific class of individuals entitled to benefits they otherwise would not have been entitled to as non-Jordanians. The cabinet issued a decision purporting to ease restrictions on their access to employment opportunities, public education, government health care, property ownership, investment, and acquiring a driver's license. The cabinet decision also established a special identification card which would be required to access these six areas.
At the time, then Interior Minister Hussein al-Majali said that all 355,923 children of Jordanian mothers and foreign fathers registered with the Civil Status and Passports Department would benefit from the decision. But by February 2018, authorities had issued just over 72,000 special ID cards, fewer than 20 per cent of those allegedly eligible.
Some people are not able to get the ID cards because they can't get some of the long list of documents required to apply or can't afford the cost of obtaining them. Others are refused because of a requirement that their mothers have to legally reside in Jordan for at least five years before they apply, which the Jordanian National Commission for Women considers discrimination against Jordanian women's citizenship rights and freedom of movement.
Even for those who did obtain ID cards, many reported no discernible improvement in their circumstances. By and large, Jordanian government agencies continue to subject non-citizen children of Jordanian women to the same laws and regulations that govern provision of services for foreign nationals.
Children of foreign fathers still face a cumbersome renewal process for residency permits and significant legal and regulatory barriers to employment. Some of those interviewed who had managed to build successful careers despite these restrictions said that the legal uncertainties threatened their jobs and limited their professional mobility.
While there was some improvement in access to public hospitals and public schools, it applied only to those who were able to get the ID cards. And there have been no discernible changes in property ownership, investment rights, or obtaining a driver's license. Some government departments now require the new ID card in addition to the documents originally required for services, arguably excluding non-citizen children who could have accessed these services before the “reform.”
“Do you think we would be in this [poor] state if our children could work?” said a 51-year-old Jordanian mother of five non-citizen children. “We are always worried for them. They have no freedoms, no rights, no futures.”
CHICAGO — The Chicago Police Department says all patrol officers are now equipped with body cameras.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Sunday the city reached its goal to provide the cameras to more than 7,000 officers one year earlier than originally planned. They say it's the largest deployment of the technology in the U.S.
Emanuel says the cameras are “an essential tool” in the city's efforts to rebuild trust between police and the community. They say they improve transparency and help in investigations and resolving disputes.
The U.S. Justice Department in January issued a scathing report on civil rights abuses by Chicago's police over the years. An investigation began in 2015 after the release of dashcam video showing an officer shoot a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times.
New alternate history drama SS-GB is coming to BBC1 – here's everything you need to know
What time is SS-GB on TV?
Dystopian drama SS-GB will be occupying the prime-time Sunday night slot from 9pm on 19 February on BBC1.
What's it about?
SS-GB is set in a disturbing alternative reality in 1941, which imagines that England and Wales is under Nazi occupation having lost the Battle of Britain. It focuses on British Detective Douglas Archer who is forced to work under the brutal SS in occupied London.
There are pockets of resistance throughout Britain, but after a German pilot is murdered by a British Resistance fighter, tensions in London are higher than ever.
Archer is investigating a murder which drags them into a treacherous world where the stakes are as high as the ultimate outcome of the war.
The detective must deal with the following dilemma: Can they carry out their duty to defend law and order when they are working for the wrong side? And what are they willing to risk in the fight against fascism?
Who's in the cast?
Sam Riley takes on the role of Archer; their most notable parts include playing Ian Curtis in Control, the biopic of the singer, and they were more recently in Maleficant alongside Angelina Jolie.
Kate Bosworth (Super Man Returns, Still Alice) plays Barbara Barga, an elusive American journalist who may be able to help Archer – if they can trust them
Archer's lover Sylvia Manning is portrayed by Maeve Dermody (And Then There Were None, Marcella).
Other cast members include James Cosmo (Game of Thrones, Trainspotting), Aneurin Barnard (War and Peace) and Rainer Bock (Inglorious Basterds).
Is it an adaptation of a book?
Yes. The drama has been adapted from Len Deighton's 1978 alternate history novel of the same name. The TV series has been written by Bafta Award winners and James Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.
Is there a trailer?
Yes. Here you go.
Bayern Munich boss Jupp Heynckes returned the pressure to Real Madrid by warning Robert Lewandowski is just as dangerous as Cristiano Ronaldo.
The prolific pair could line up as team-mates next season if Los Blancos' reported interest in the Poland international leads to a move.
But they will first meet as opponents at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday as Bavaria host the European champions in the opening leg of a highly-anticipated Champions League semi-final.
While Heynckes acknowledged it will be difficult to stop Ronaldo - who has netted 15 goals in the competition this term - they issued a reminder of the danger facing Zinedine Zidane's men.
"I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. They have had a superb career. But you need to play well as a team to win the Champions League," Heynckes said.
"We analyse our opponents and prepare to beat them.
"In Robert Lewandowski, we also have a striker who has already scored 39 goals this season. So you might ask: how do you stop Lewandowski?"
Asked whether they would swap the two, Heynckes would not be drawn into the debate, responding: "This is a question for journalists, not for us."
Heynckes, who is set to re-enter retirement at the end of the season, is attempting to sign off by winning the Champions League for a third time, having led Madrid to glory in 1998 before overseeing Bayern's win at Wembley at the end of their last spell with the club five years ago.
Zidane is in the hunt for the same distinction after prevailing in the past two finals and their measured approach to management has won Heynckes' respect.
"I was always a great admirer of Zizou the player, but now I also admire them as a coach. I like how calm they are," the German said.
"This shows me that he's not showcasing for the public or the camera. He's a top trainer."

In the first episode the young nun broke down as they struggled to come to terms with the violence they were exposed to when visiting a young mum with an abusive husband.
The incident set in motion a harrowing chain of events, which culminated in the young nun's disappearance from Nonnatus House.
Where did Sister Mary Cynthia disappear to?
In series six episode one Doctor Turner was called to Nonnatus House to try to establish the correct diagnosis and course of treatment for their colleague and friend.
However, before they could recommend that they be sent to a sympathetic community – Northfields – to help them recover, Sister Ursula had Mary Cynthia shipped off to the Mother House in the dark of night.
For weeks we wondered how they were doing, especially when Trixie revealed they hadn't seen them at the Mother House on their way home.
And then in episode five, Fred and Sister Monica Joan discovered them in a locked room at the Linchmere Hospital, a mental health institution.
Sister Mary Cynthia had been sent there to recover, but they seemed anything but better. In fact, they seemed in a worse state than they had been when they left Nonnatus House.
In episode six we saw their return to their spiritual home, seemingly on the way to making a full recovery, but it wasn't long before their friends and colleagues realised that all was not well.
They ultimately departed for Northfield after all, where they were welcomed under their own name – Cynthia.
What happened to Sister Mary Cynthia when they were attacked in series five?
In series five episode six you might recall a plot involving several women being attacked by an individual who left a bite mark on their neck. Well, Sister Mary Cynthia fell victim to that same attacker.
While cycling back to Nonnatus as the sun rose, they stopped by the docks for a moment of contemplation. It was there that they were attacked, waking up bloodied and beaten. They returned to Nonnatus where a shocked Trixie rushed to help them
“Please don't touch me,” Mary Cynthia screamed. It was established that they aren't raped, but they had been viciously attacked – and had a bite mark on their neck.
“Don't talk to me gently, don't be kind, because I'm angry,” they told Sister Julienne, refusing to be examined by a doctor or talk to PC Noakes initially, before eventually changing their mind and providing evidence that led to the apprehension of their attacker.
Will Sister Mary Cynthia return to Call The Midwife?
“Her journey does continue later in the series. No spoilers – but you do find out how she's doing, how she's getting on”, writer Heidi Thomas told RadioTimes.com after their initial departure.
“[Bryony Thomas] is a wonderful actor and I absolutely loved writing that material for them Because she's also a character that's been with us from the very beginning” they continued. “She had the trauma in series five when they were attacked and they seemed to get over that quite quickly but I already knew that they hadn't fully dealt with that experience and therefore it was actually not just dramatically interesting but also really emotionally responsible to show what they went through a few months later when they had to deal with what they hadn't dealt with at that time.”
“So we do continue with that journey, Bryony gives the most sensational performance.”

It remains to be seen whether the journey will continue into series seven, but we're hopeful that this isn't the last we've seen of Bryony Hannah at Nonnatus House.
James Morton Picks the Indonesia Stocks that Outperform the World
James Morton is the Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager at Santa Lucia Asset Management Ltd. They have extensive expertise in recovering and small-cap companies, as well as emerging markets. Mr. Morton's career in the investment industry began in 1992.  They are an accomplished author, editor and investment columnist. Mr. Morton holds a degree in law from Trinity Hall, Cambridge University, and an M.A. in third-world economics as well as an MBA from Stanford University. They reveal their detailed methodology for finding stocks in emerging markets in this exclusive interview with the Wall Street Transcript.
Their interesting specialty is small cap value stocks in Indonesia. “We are a value equity house based in Singapore. We practice value investing in Asia, even though most investors come to Asia for growth. But we do value, traditional deep value, relative value and high yield equities, which I think is a legitimate variation of value investing…We have an office in Jakarta, which makes us slightly unusual. ”
Their deep research into these poorly understood stocks creates a lot of upsides. “For investors, outperforming in Indonesia is usually a function of two things: first, identify the right sector and, two, then find the best companies within that sector…the ROE of listed companies is pretty high. It's estimated to be around 17%. And earnings growth for this year will be one of the highest in the region. Probably India and the Philippines will be higher, but Indonesia looks likely to be around 17%, plus or minus.”
The result is finding stocks that are far from correlated from the developed market. “I would have to say that most people in the villages in Indonesia probably don't know who the U.S. president is or care for that matter. That answers part of the question. Obviously, what happens in America affects everybody, more than anywhere else. But I would say that for Indonesia, China is the focus, and America isn't so important.”

The Coalition, Labor and the Nick Xenophon Team have voted for a bill that will implement the government's Telecommunications Sector Security Reforms (TSSR).
The Senate today passed the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016, which implements the TSSR scheme.
The legislation creates formal obligations for telecommunications carriers to protect their networks and to inform the government of any planned changes that could potentially affect the security of their infrastructure.
It also grants the government wide-ranging powers to issue directions to telcos “to do, or to refrain from doing, a specified act or thing within the period specified in the direction”.
The government earlier this month announced it had accepted the recommendations of a bipartisan report on the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS).
Those recommendations include the release of additional guidelines for industry as well as a range of changes to clarify the functioning of the TSSR regime.
The legislation was opposed by the Greens and Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm.
“This bill has been the subject of extensive consideration by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security,” Attorney-General Senator George Brandis said today during debate on the bill.
“The PJCIS has recommended a number of amendments which the government has agreed to and I want to thank the opposition both for its support for the bill and its contribution to the deliberative process through the PJCIS.”
The bill is the ninth tranche of significant national security legislation introduced by the Coalition government in the last three years, they said.
“The bill is a critically important piece of national security legislation because telecommunications networks form part of Australia's critical infrastructure and also support other critical sectors such as health, finance, transport , water and power,” the attorney-general said.
“Cyber threats to Australia are persistent, whether they arise from sabotage, espionage, serious and organised crime, or other technology-enabled crime.”
Brandis said that the existing framework for managing those risks in the telco sector is “inadequate”. “It relies on voluntary cooperation and goodwill, which is not always sufficient given the nature of the risks to national security and the gravity of those risks,” the attorney-general said.
In a joint submission to the PJCIS's inquiry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Information Industry Association, the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association, and Communications Alliance said that the legislation was “onerous in terms of regulatory overhead and compliance risk”.
The TSSR regime is “excessive” in its focus on the risks associated with the introduction of new equipment or services, the association argued.
Instead of strengthening security, the legislation “may in fact divert scarce resources away from investing directly in addressing cybersecurity threats, to compliance overhead arising from the regime,” the submission stated. The bill is yet to be debated in the House of Representatives.

Salah to hang around to make history at Liverpool – Henderson
Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson is confident Mohamed Salah will not be lured away from Anfield in the same manner the Egyptian was tempted from Roma last year.
Salah has surpassed all expectations since their then-club record 42 million-euro (£37 million, $52 million) move back to the Premier League last June and will face their old club in the first leg of Liverpool's Champions League semi-final on Tuesday.
An incredible return of 41 goals in 46 appearances saw Salah crowned the Premier League Players' Player of the Year on Sunday.
However, unlike Liverpool stars of recent seasons such as Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho, who were attracted by the glamour of a move to Barcelona, Henderson hopes Salah is convinced to stay by the growing momentum at Liverpool and the belief they can compete for major trophies under Jurgen Klopp.
“He's a fantastic player, obviously he's up there with the world's best and there will be other clubs that want to take them away,” said Henderson.
“But he's in a great place with a great set of lads, great team, with a great manager, going in the right direction. We want to create our own history here and I'm sure Mo will want to be part of that for many years to come.”
Roma co-owner James Pallotta recognised this week that Liverpool didn't even have to beat off much competition to Salah's signature, as they had only shown inconsistent flashes of their full potential in two years in the Italian capital.
– Klopp's ‘privileged' players –
Klopp is credited with finding the system to bring the best out of Salah.
And having led Liverpool back to the last four of the Champions League for the first time in a decade, Henderson said their team-mates feel “privileged” to work with the German.
“He's one of the best managers in the world. First and foremost tactically it goes without question how knowledgeable they are within the game, you can see that in the performances, the style of play and how we play football,” they added.
“Off the field he's a fantastic human. Very genuine, has a great passion for football and that transcends throughout the team.
“He always keeps you on your toes, always looking for more, they never wants the standards to drop no matter who we are playing. He's an amazing manager and everybody in the squad feels privileged to be working with him.”
Roma have had to wait even longer for a European Cup semi-final with their last appearance coming 34 years ago when they beat Dundee United but went on to lose to Liverpool in the final.
The manner in which they reached the semi-finals even outshone Liverpool's 5-1 quarter-final thrashing of Premier League champions Manchester City as Roma came back from a 4-1 first leg deficit against Barcelona thanks to a 3-0 second leg victory masterminded by Roma's own impressive coach in Eusebio Di Francesco.
But apart from their physical similarities, Di Francesco — who is making their debut as a coach in the Champions League this season — believes they have a long way to go to earn comparisons with Klopp.
“As Klopp mentioned there are similarities in that we both wear glasses and have a beard,” they joked. “But I very much like their outlook.
“I am concerned we play a team coached by such a great manager. Klopp has proved himself, has won already titles, but I have great ambitions.”

The X-factor in Super Bowl LII could be more accurately described as the A-B-C factor — as in Ajayi, Blount and Clement.
The Philadelphia Eagles running back trio of Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount and rookie Corey Clement will have to be productive Sunday for Philly to upset the New England Patriots.
Blount led the Eagles with 766 rushing yards and scored twice during the regular season. Ajayi had 408 rushing yards and a score in seven games after their midseason trade from the Miami Dolphins and Clement had 321 rushing yards during the regular season with a team-high four rushing touchdowns.
The trio have kept it up in the playoffs. Ajayi has 127 rushing yards in two games. Blount has just 40 yards but both of Philadelphia's rushing touchdowns. Clement has run for only 25 yards this postseason, but they and Ajayi both have six receptions.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick knows third downs will be "a huge key to the game." They praised the Eagles backs during Monday's media night and said Philadelphia's diverse offense makes the Eagles difficult to defend.
Ajayi, despite a sore ankle, is expected to get the bulk of the carries on Sunday, but Blount will be the short-yardage back.
"They both run hard, man," Patriots safety Patrick Chung said of Blount and Ajayi. "LeGarrette jumps over people. Jay — they run hard. They stiff-arms people, breaks tackles. They're both very elusive and big backs so they can do a lot of things."
Then there is Clement, the undrafted rookie from Wisconsin who has become a dangerous third-down back. Four of their nine postseason touches have been on third down. Six of their nine touches have resulted in first downs.
Though Clement had just 10 receptions this season, they went for 123 yards and two touchdowns. Having seen little-used Jaguars running back Corey Grant torch the Patriots in the first half of the AFC Championship Game, Eagles coach Doug Pederson will likely try to get Clement the ball in space against the Patriots linebackers.
Clement could wind up being a Super Bowl hero just as former Wisconsin running back James White was for the Patriots last year.
White caught a career-high 14 passes for 110 yards and scored the winning touchdown in the Patriots' incredible comeback victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. If the Eagles running backs maintain the form they have displayed this season, there is every chance Clement could replicate that impact and deny New England a sixth title.
PRINCETON, N.J. — Jerome Desrosiers' 3-pointer with 36 seconds left in overtime provided the winning points in Princeton's 76-73 victory over Yale on Friday.
After Desrosiers' trey, Yale missed consecutive 3-point shots and fouled Amir Bell, who missed the front end of a one-and-one. The teams exchanged turnovers before a desperation 3-point try by Yale missed.
Yale took possession after a tie-up in regulation but Trey Phills was unable to connect on a 3-pointer as the game went to overtime.
Myles Stephens scored 18 points and Devin Cannady and Bell 16 apiece for the Tigers (11-8, 3-1 Ivy), who have won three straight, with Bell collecting a career-high 11 rebounds for their first career double-double.
Alex Copeland scored 18 points, Phills had 17 points and a career-high 14 rebounds for their first career double-double while Blake Reynolds added 15 points for the Bulldogs (9-12, 2-3).
WARREN, Mich. — Police who found a badly decomposed body in bed in a Detroit-area home believe a 62-year-old woman may have shared the home with their dead roommate for months.
Police in Warren found the body of 68-year-old George Curtis on Monday. An autopsy will be performed.
WJBK-TV and The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens report Tuesday that relatives contacted police after hearing nothing from Curtis for months.
The woman has been hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation.
Police Commissioner Bill Dwyer tells the newspaper “it's just bizarre (that) they stayed in the home like that and didn't report anything.”
Police say Curtis may have been dead for months.
Dwyer says the house may have to be condemned and demolished due to the condition inside and the odour.
MOSCOW — A Russian lawmaker says that they and colleagues who recently visited Pyongyang were shown North Korean calculations indicating that their missiles could reach the U.S. West Coast.
Anton Morozov of the nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Friday that North Korea is preparing to test-fire a long-range missile “in the nearest future.”
Morozov, who visited North Korea with two fellow lawmakers earlier this week, said that their interlocutors told them that Pyongyang has the technology that would allow missile warheads to survive the heat while entering the atmosphere.
They said North Koreans also showed them “mathematical calculations which they say prove that their missile is capable of reaching the U.S. West Coast.”
MIAMI — Authorities say an armed carjacking suspect has been fatally shot by officers after they jumped into a South Florida river after a more than two-hour police chase.
Miami-Dade police Det. Robin Pinkard tells local news outlets that officers encountered the man around 7 a.m. Friday. Following a traffic stop, the suspect fled in a car and the chase began. During the chase, Pinkard says, the man ditched a BMW SUV and carjacked a woman, taking them SUV.
At some point, they drove under a bridge on and bailed into the Miami River trying to escape.
Authorities say officers tried to get the man to surrender, but eventually shots were fired. The man died at the scene.
It was unclear why police initially stopped the man.
Their name hasn't been released.
MINNEAPOLIS — Houston Texans star defensive end J.J. Watt won the NFL's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award on Saturday night.
The award recognizes a player's contribution in their community and to society in general. It was given out at NFL Honors, when The Associated Press announced its individual NFL awards.
Tight ends Benjamin Watson of the Baltimore Ravens and Greg Olsen of the Carolina Panthers also were finalists.
Watt, in their seventh NFL season and a three-time Defensive Player of the Year, had the goal of raising $200,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief in Houston. Their fundraising did a whole lot more, bringing in an incredible $37 million in 19 days.
Watt has dedicated themselves to finding organizations that will apply the funds in a fair and effective manner.
“I cannot express how humbled and honoured that I am to be mentioned in the same sentence as Walter Payton, a man who did everything right not only on the field but off of it,” Watt said in their acceptance speech. “And I'm going to continue to try to live that legacy and make that family proud.
“This award is called The Man of the Year Award, but I promise you it is so much bigger than that. This award is about the inherent good that lies within humanity. It is about the city of Houston and its ability to overcome adversity at a time when it all seemed lost. It is about the hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country and all over the world that donated to a city they may never have been to, to people they may never meet. But they donated simply because they saw their fellow human going through a difficult time and they wanted to help out.”
Peyton Manning presented the award to Watt.
“Whether we realize it or not, we are affecting everyone around us with our every move,” Watt added. “The more than we can shine a light on the positivity and the good that we are in this world, the better off we're going to be. We all have to go through this crazy journey together, so why not help each other out and make it as great of a journey as possible.
“I'm incredibly grateful, I'm incredibly thankful to receive this award and I will cherish it for the rest of my life. The only thing that I ask of you is to join me in trying to carry on the legacy that Walter Payton left behind of leaving this world better than we found it. Take a moment, ask yourself, ‘How can I make a difference? No matter how big, no matter how small, how can I make a difference?' And when you have your answer, go out and do it.”

LG POLLS: Makarfi-led Lagos PDP aligns with Labour Party
By Dapo Akinrefon
lagos—THE Senator Ahmed Makarfi-led Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Lagos State says it has gone into alliance with the Labour Party, LP, to contest the July 22 local government elections.
This came as the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC ) has enlisted the support of traditional rulers in the state in ensuring peace and violence-free council polls.
Addressing newsmen in Lagos, yesterday, Mr Moshood Salvador said the leadership crisis rocking the PDP made it necessary for the Makarfi camp to go into alliance with the Labour Party.
They said: “We are all not unaware of the leadership problem rocking our party, over which we are awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court to end the crisis. This is why the party needs experienced, knowledgeable, articulate and gentleman, leadership, at all levels.
Salvador, however, appealed to “all lovers and sympathizers of PDP in Lagos State to cast their vote for Labour PDP alliance and vote Labour Party. It is an alliance. We never decamped to any party. We never declared for another Party and we never dumped our dear PDP. We are the PDP strength in Lagos State. In this pre-electoral alliance, we have 342 Councillorship candidates and 52 Chairmanship candidates.”
In addition, they said “as from this very moment, I now declare that all our candidates must start pasting their posters, commence the house to house campaigns and educate electorates on the circumstance of our using Labour Party for this Council election only.''
LASIEC seeks cooperation of monarchs
Meanwhile, LASIEC visited the palaces of leading monarchs in the State where it met with the monarchs and religious leaders on the need to have a peaceful election.
One of the LASIEC commissioners, Mrs Toyin Ibrahim-Famakinwa, who addressed the monarchs and religious leaders on behalf of the Chairman of the Commission, Justice Ayotunde Phillips (Rtd), in all the palaces visited, explained that the Commission embarked on the visit to inform the monarchs and religious leaders about the forthcoming elections.
They added that the commission also sought support of the traditional rulers towards a successful conduct of the elections.
They urged traditional rulers and religious leaders to warn their subjects and followers, particularly the youths against engaging in violence before, during and after the elections.

SANDY, Utah — Kyle Beckerman scored their 41st career MLS goal in the 82nd minute, and Real Salt Lake beat the Houston Dynamo 2-1 on Wednesday night.
Salt Lake (6-6-1) has won 10 of its last 11 home games, conceding just 12 goals. Houston (5-4-3) lost for the first time in five games.
Luis Silva put RSL in front in the 34th minute by heading in Sebastian Saucedo's cross.
Beckerman, who entered having played every minute of every RSL game this season, came in as a substitute in the 64th. Eighteen minutes later, Beckerman had a corner kick chested to their feet and they sent a left-footed shot off the far post and in.
Houston's Alberth Elis scored their fifth goal this month, and eighth overall, in the 75th. Nick Rimando's goal kick was intercepted and Elis was left open in front of goal to head home Romell Quioto's cross.
ATLANTA UNITED 1, REVOLUTION 1
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Teal Bunbury scored on a penalty kick in the 88th minute as the Revolution tied Atlanta United.
New England (5-4-4) has one win in its last five games — with two straight draws. Atlanta (8-3-2) had won four straight on the road.
Krisztian Nemeth drew the late foul in the corner of the penalty box after capitalizing on a defensive turnover. Atlanta goalkeeper Brad Guzan chose the right direction but Bunbury found the upper-right corner. Guzan was given a yellow card for kicking the ball into the stands after the goal.
Josef Martinez opened the scoring for Atlanta in the 23rd minute by redirecting Julian Gressel's cross. It was Martinez's league-leading ninth goal of the season.
New England goalkeeper Matt Turner kept the Revs within reach by denying Ezequiel Barco's point-blank attempt in the 82nd.
UNION 3, FIRE 1
CHESTER, Pa. (AP) — Borek Dockal had a penalty-kick goal in the 87th minute and two assists, helping the Union to the win.
Philadelphia (5-5-3) is unbeaten in its last four matches — with three victories. Chicago (4-7-2) has allowed multiple goals in 11 of its last 15 road games.
Ilsinho put Philadelphia in front in the 44th minute. They chested Dockal's chipped pass at the corner of the 18-yard box, split two defenders and scored from a difficult angle. Cory Burke made it 2-0 in the 51st with an open header of Dockal's cross.
Alan Gordon scored in their second straight game to pull Chicago within one in the 56th. Brandt Bronico ran past the defence for a through ball, dribbled alone along the right side and crossed it to Gordon for an easy tap-in.
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Mathieu Perreault scored two goals and added an assist to help the Winnipeg Jets halt a three-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night.
The win was the Jets' seventh straight victory at home and they have points in their last 11 games (10-0-1) at Bell MTS Place.
The Canucks have lost three straight in regulation for the first time this season.
Dmitry Kulikov, Josh Morrissey and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored for Winnipeg (18-8-5). Ehlers' 14th of the season was on the power play and gave them goals in three straight games.
Brock Boeser scored their team-leading 16th goal for the Canucks. They also extended their goal-scoring streak to three games.
Connor Hellebuyck made 25 saves for Winnipeg.
Jacob Markstrom stopped 19 shots for Vancouver (14-13-4).
The teams were tied 1-1 after the first period and Winnipeg led 3-1 after two. Markstrom let in a surprising goal 88 seconds into the first, squeezing their pads on Kulikov's point shot, but the puck slid into the net behind him.
Boeser tied it up at 6:53 after Henrik Sedin took the puck around the back of Winnipeg's net and fed a pass to Boeser in the slot.
The Canucks outshot the Jets 10-4 in the opening frame.
Winnipeg carried a late man advantage into the second, but Markstrom made a quick save on Kyle Connor's deflection right in front of them and a glove grab on an Ehlers' shot to help kill the penalty.
Winnipeg got another power play at 2:55 when Sam Gagner was called for holding and Perreault fired in their goal from the slot exactly two minutes later.
The Jets capitalized on their next power play when, 37 seconds after Nic Dowd went off for hooking, Tyler Myers' blast produced a long rebound to Ehlers at the top of the circle that made it 3-1 at 14:09.
The Canucks' shot advantage after two periods was 17-15.
Morrissey scored their fourth goal of the season with a redirection on a 3-on-1 with Adam Lowry and Andrew Copp at 11:38. Christopher Tanev was the lone defender.
Perreault netted an unassisted goal with 44 seconds left. Vancouver was 0 for 2 on the power play and Winnipeg 1 for 3.
Notes: Winnipeg was without defenseman Dustin Byfuglien, who was put on injured reserve with a lower-body injury suffered in last Saturday's 4-3 overtime loss to Tampa Bay. Head coach Paul Maurice said they didn't expect them back on the ice until after Christmas. Rookie Tucker Poolman took their roster spot ... Vancouver was missing top-line forwards Bo Horvat (broken foot) and Sven Baertschi (fractured jaw).
UP NEXT:
Canucks: host Nashville on Wednesday night.
Jets: host Chicago on Thursday.
Cars That See Around Corners? Self-Driving Tech Gets Smarter
Whether it's a child running after a ball, a herd of cows or a broken-down, unexpected obstacles can prove deadly to drivers. But scientists say the cars of the future might be able to anticipate such perils.
A team of researchers has come up with a new laser-based system that efficiently produces images of objects that are hidden around a corner -- a development they say could allow autonomous vehicles to see obstacles before they come into the line of sight.
"There is this preconceived notion that you can't image objects that aren't already directly visible to the camera -- and we have found ways to get around these types of limiting situations," said Dr. Matthew O'Toole, a coauthor of the research from Stanford University.
The approach builds on technologies such as Lidar, a tool used in archaeological mapping that involves sending laser pulses towards a surface and measuring the time it takes for light to be reflected. This data is then used by scientists to build a three-dimensional model of the surface.
But the new technology takes the idea further, using lasers to see around corners. "It is almost like magic," said O'Toole.
Writing in the journal Nature, O'Toole and colleagues describe how they used a setup in which a laser and photon detector were placed in front of a wall next to an object, and were separated from the object by a partition. Laser pulses were then fired at the wall at an angle. The team weren't interested in collecting the light that bounced directly back off the wall toward the detector; instead, they wanted to collect light that bounced off the wall, hit the object and was then scattered by it. "We are looking for the second, and third and fourth bounces -- they encode the objects that are hidden," said O'Toole.
While previous approaches to the problem have involved directing laser pulses at one point on the wall and then collecting signals from another point, O'Toole and colleagues used a different technique, pointing both the laser and the detector at the same point on the wall.
They then used the timing of the signals to remove those from light that bounced back directly. The remaining signals were then rapidly processed using an algorithm to reconstruct the shape and form of the hidden object.
"It is a very simple tweak to how you do imaging, but it has major implications in terms of how you can reconstruct the images from that information," said O'Toole, noting that the new setup uses far less memory and processing than currently, and generates a higher-resolution image.
After first developing an algorithm by creating computer models of how laser pulses would bounce off a model of a rabbit hidden by the partition, the team applied the system in real life, including capturing an image of an "Exit" sign hidden by the partition.
O'Toole said the highly reflective nature of road signs and bicycle reflectors make the technology a good fit for driverless cars, adding that the research uses sensors similar to those already used in autonomous vehicles.
But there are still obstacles to overcome. The initial scanning of the wall can take anywhere from a minute to a couple of hours, while the team need to improve the system so it is better at detecting objects that are not highly reflective or stationary, such as children or wild animals, and make sure it can be used outdoors in bright, sunny conditions.
Dr. Anna Anund, who is leading an EU-funded project focused on developing software for driverless car sensor systems, said it was important for autonomous cars to be able to see hidden objects.
"The automated vehicles need to be able to predict or detect what is happening ahead. This is not only what is going on in [their] own lane but also in the surroundings like pedestrian paths, on the other side of the corner etc," they said.
"If it is other vehicles we are looking for it is more easy," they added. "More problematic is, of course, unprotected road users or animals."

Liverpool owner John W. Henry was left "bitching" because they thought they had overpaid for "unbelievable bargain" Mohamed Salah, according to Roma president James Pallotta.
Salah joined Liverpool in June for an initial €43million, which could rise to €50m, and has gone on to enjoy a sensational first season at Anfield.
The Egypt international has netted 31 times in just 33 Premier League appearances, equalling the record for the most goals scored in a 38-game season.
They have also scored nine in 12 Champions League outings, playing a vital role in Liverpool's charge to the last four.
Up next is a date with their former employers Roma and the Italian club's owner, American business person Pallotta, says their compatriot Henry was convinced they had paid over the odds for Salah when the deal was struck.
Speaking to ESPN, Pallotta said: "He was sort of bitching a little about, 'Did we overpay? I think we overpaid.' And I said, 'I'll buy you lunch.'"
And although Pallotta now recognises the deal to have been a "bargain" for Liverpool, they accept Roma's hands were tied because Salah had just one year left on their contract.
"When you look at it now, you can say it's an unbelievable bargain," they said. "The issue at the time was that when Monchi [Roma's sporting director] came in, Salah wanted to leave. They had a year left on their contract so in another year you'd get nothing.
"He wanted to go back [to the Premier League] and prove himself, which they certainly have done.
"We can't tell you that anybody else was calling for Salah at anywhere near that kind of price, so there are a lot of teams that have missed out on the great play he's had this year."
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Hundreds of people have attended a commemoration ceremony honoring a Croatian general who died after apparently taking poison at a United Nations tribunal that confirmed their war crimes conviction.
Two government ministers attended the ceremony organized by a generals' association and held Monday at the main concert hall in Zagreb, the capital. The gathering is seen as a display of resurging nationalism in the European Union's newest member state.
Slobodan Praljak gulped what they said was poison after judges at the war crimes court in The Hague, Netherlands, confirmed their conviction in an appeals hearing last month. Dutch authorities and the court have opened investigations into how they obtained the substance.
Many in Croatia consider Praljak a hero despite their conviction for war crimes in Bosnia during the 1992-95 war.
Malawi police on Wednesday were heavy-handed on protesting learners in primary school beating up the schoolchildren mercilessly who were on the streets demonstrating against the nationwide strike by their teachers.
The protests have entered a third day in Blantyre with pupils from Kachanga primary School in Chileka blocking the road to Chileka airport and smashing some vehicles.
Despite beating the protesting learners, police arrested three who were taken to Chileka Police Station where they are being kept.
Chileka police spokesperson Grace Mwale confirmed the arrest of the schoolchildren.
In a statement released Wednesday, national police spokesperson James Kadadzera condemned “shameful act” by the learners and urged them to follow proper procedures to present their grievances
They strongly warned protestors from taking the law into their own hands as solution to have their voices heard.
They further said police believe some criminals took advantage of the rioting pupils to steal from unsuspecting passers-by.
“We believe rogues hiding behind the pupils blocked the roads, stoned motorists, interrupted traffic flow, demanded money from motorists, which are all illegal and criminal acts.”
Jarring as it may have been to see Texans quarterback Tom Savage lying on the ground with their hands twitching after a brutal hit in the end zone, what happened moments later was every bit as disturbing: Savage came back onto the field.
The NFL's concussion protocol came under heavy criticism after it failed Savage on Sunday in Houston's 26-16 loss to the 49ers. Only after Savage briefly returned to the game did the medical crew determine that the quarterback did, indeed, have a concussion and remove them from the game.
That Savage was allowed back in after being thrown to the ground by Elvis Dumervil of the 49ers — their hands twitching as they laid directly underneath referee John Hussey — will lead to more questions this week about how the NFL handles head trauma. The NFL requires two trained spotters in the press box, a team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant on the sideline to help diagnose concussions.
“They try and make the best decision for the player,” Texans coach Bill O'Brien said.
More to the point was this from Chris Nowinski , a longtime critic of the NFL's handling of concussions: “Disgusted that the Houston Texans allowed Tom Savage to return to the game after two plays after showing these horrifying concussion signs (is that a seizure?) after a head impact,” Nowinski tweeted.
In case you missed it, here are the other top topics after the NFL season's 14th Sunday:
BIG WIN, BIGGER LOSS: The Eagles clinched the NFC East with a 43-35 win over the Rams but may have lost quarterback Carson Wentz to a knee injury in the process. Wentz took Mark Barron's helmet to their left knee while diving into the end zone for a touchdown that was called back because of a holding penalty. Wentz is scheduled to have an MRI on Monday to evaluate the severity of the injury. Two people familiar with the injury told The Associated Press that doctors believe Wentz tore their ACL and would be out for the season. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the injury. Other QBs hurt Sunday were Marcus Mariota of the Titans (knee) and Josh McCown of the Jets (hand).
BIG BEN: Ben Roethlisberger became the first NFL quarterback to throw for 500 yards in three games and the Steelers, after squandering an early 14-point lead, rallied from 11 down for a 39-38 win over Baltimore. Roethlisberger's numbers: 44 for 66 for 506 yards and two touchdowns. Roethlisberger's previous 500-yard games came in 2014 (522 yards vs. Colts) and 2009 (503 vs. Packers).
SNOW DAY: Snowball fight! On a day like this, Bills linebacker Ryan Davis could hardly resist. Davis scooped up handfuls of the white stuff and started pelting teammates to celebrate a sack. It was one of dozens of must-see moments from Buffalo's 13-7 overtime win over Indianapolis that will be remembered for one thing: snow. Fans built snowmen in the stands, players made snow angels on the field and all 11 members of the Colts special teams — plus some sideline personnel who were later removed from the field by officials — had to kick away piles of ankle-high snow to clear a spot for Adam Vinatieri to try the game-tying extra point late in the fourth quarter.
WALK-OFF WIN: Davante Adams closed out Green Bay's comeback win over the Browns in style. After catching the pass from Brett Hundley and spinning away, they scooted into the end zone, then kept right on running into the tunnel . Final score: Green Bay 27, Cleveland 21. It was Green Bay's second straight overtime win and it kept the Packers alive in the playoff hunt, at 7-6, with Aaron Rodgers rounding into health and possibly available to return next week. Oh, and poor Cleveland found yet another way to lose. The Browns led 21-7 with 13 minutes left, but fell to 0-13.
FINE TIME: The NFL might be getting into some Seahawks' wallets this week. The Jaguars were taking a knee after icing their 30-24 win over Seattle, but Seahawks defensive tackle Michael Bennett dived at centre Brandon Linder's knees and triggered a fight. Seattle's Sheldon Richardson was ejected for throwing a punch, and Leonard Fournette went after Bennett. More pushing and shoving ensued after the next kneel-down, and defensive end Quinton Jefferson was tossed. Jefferson tried to climb into the stands after getting hit with what looked like a plastic bottle. Seattle coach Pete Carroll also got flagged for coming onto the field.

AP Sports Writers Rob Maaddi and Mark Long contributed to this report.
West Brom have announced the signing of goalkeeper Sam Johnstone from Manchester United in a deal reported to be worth £10million.
Johnstone has had numerous loans in the Championship, including spells at Aston Villa, Preston North End and Doncaster Rovers, but failed to make a Premier League appearance for United.
And the 25-year-old will now have a chance to continue building their reputation at West Brom, who are reported to have paid an initial £6.5m.
Johnstone has signed a four-year deal at The Hawthorns and is keen to get started at their new club.
"I'm happy to be here. I've spoken to a lot of people about the club and heard nothing but good things," Johnstone told the West Brom website.
"It's good to get through the door. I've played Championship games and won a promotion from League One with Preston but always seemed to end up back at Manchester United or going somewhere else.
"Now it's time to settle down and take my game up to the next level which I believe I can do here."
Head coach Darren Moore added: "Sam is young and determined to be the best keeper they can possibly be - he's hungry to do that with us at Albion.
"We've had them targeted from the outset and we're all delighted to have them on board. They buy into exactly what we are trying to achieve and will hopefully represent the shape of things to come."
Johnstone's arrival could hasten the departure of another ex-United goalkeeper, Ben Foster.
Former England international Foster has been linked with a switch to Watford, while United are reportedly ready to replace Johnstone with Stoke City goalkeeper Lee Grant.
St. Louis County voters will likely weigh in this summer on the ongoing power struggle between the St. Louis County Council and County Executive Steve Stenger.
The council voted 6-1 today to override five of their vetoes. Three of the measures are proposed changes to the county Charter that will be placed on the August ballot.
One of the changes would set campaign-donation limits of $2,600 for candidates for countywide office or the council. All three have provisions that would increase the council's powers.
Council Chairman Sam Page says voters will be asked to resolve several issues. “Should the County Council be able to participate in budgetary decisions?” they said. “Should they be able to have reasonable legal advice, accurate information to make good decisions?”
The ballot proposals would:
Allow the council to hire its own lawyer, instead of relying on the county counselor, who is part of the county executive's administration.
Allow council members to do contract work for other governmental entities, which is now barred by the charter. The provision is in response to Councilman Ernie Trakas' troubles, because they do contract legal work for school districts. The proposal would not affect their current situation, which could result in them being forced off the council.
Set the campaign-donation limits, while also creating an online portal so the public could view county spending. The provision also would allow the council to exercise power over ongoing spending that it does not have now.
Councilman Mark Harder, a Republican from Ballwin, says the proposals are largely in response to council frustration over Stenger's lack of cooperation.
“We're here because of a lack of leadership,'' Harder said.
But Stenger says they are exercising their leadership by taking action – such as vetoes – on measures that they believe are improper or illegal.
Stenger contends that the council is improperly trying to usurp their powers. They plan to campaign against the proposals.
“I think it's really important that we have checks and balances in government. And this amendment eliminates those checks.”
Stenger said they had vetoed the ballot proposals because one, in particular, “gives the council unlimited spending authority.”
And that spending is not aimed at helping average county residents, Stenger said. “They want to hire more lawyers. They want to hire additional staff members.”
The council also overrode Stenger's veto of a bill that would allow it to periodically hire an outside lawyer. The fifth override concerned a measure that would increase the pay for county nurses who deal with prisoners at the St. Louis County Justice Center.
The council wants to finance those raises – which would affect up to 60 nurses – with money from the Proposition P sales-tax increase, which was designed to provide more funding for law enforcement. Voters approved the increase last year.
Stenger supports the pay increases, but says the money should come from the county health department. They dispute Page's contention that the department is in financial trouble.

FG condemns killing of another Nigerian in South Africa
Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has described the latest extra judicial killing of a Nigerian in South Africa as “worrying and condemnable”.
Dabiri-Erewa in a statement in Abuja on Monday said the latest gruesome killing of Tochukwu Nnadi by Police in South Africa, was unacceptable to the people and government of Nigeria.
The statement was signed by their Media aide, Mr Abdur-Rahman Balogun.
They reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari's calls to Nigerians to avoid crimes like drug peddling which attracts stiff penalties, sometimes death.
The Presidential aide noted that the killing of Nnadi had brought to 20 Nigerians killed in South Africa through extrajudicial means in 2016 alone.
While appealing to Nigerians to avoid crimes, Dabiri-Erewa said the extra judicious killing of Nigerians is condemnable and unacceptable.
“The barbaric behaviour of the perpetrators is not only unacceptable, but also calls for urgent attention by diplomatic authorities in Nigeria and South Africa,” they said.
Dabiri-Erewa urged the South African Government to ensure that justice prevails by carrying out investigation and bring the culprit to book.
They reiterated their calls to Nigerians living abroad to always respect the laws of their host countries and be good ambassadors of Nigeria.
They recalled that a Nigerian based in South Africa, Tochukwu Nnadi, was allegedly choked to death by the Police in South Africa on Thursday Dec. 29, after they were arrested for allegedly selling drugs.
According to eyewitnesses, the man, popularly known as King Kingsley, was not struggling after they were arrested and handcuffed, but one of the officers held onto their neck and squeezed tightly until blood started gushing out.
“My heart goes out to the families of the deceased and pray God to grant the departed soul eternal rest,” the SSA prayed.
Meanwhile, the Nigeria Union in Pretoria had confirmed the latest killing.
The Secretary of the union, Mr Adetola Olubajo, told newsmen in Pretoria that “Nigeria Union is calling on the Nigerian Mission to demand results of investigations of all murder cases involving Nigerian victims from the South African authority''.
Olubajo said that the union was not happy that all murder cases involving Nigerians in South Africa were never resolved.
In the year 2016 alone, it has brought to 20, the number of Nigerians killed in South Africa under such cruel circumstances.
Among such victims were Ikejiaku Chinedu, Monday Okorie, Gideon Ogalaonye, Nnamdi Michael, Adeniyi Olumoko, Christian Onwukaike and Tochukwu Nnadi.
Nigerians are perennial victims of the xenophobia in South Africa, with Nigerians losing more than 4.6 million Rand or N90 million during the last attacks.
About 150 South African business organisations are currently operating in Nigeria, despite the former's allegedly restrictive policies, which have made it difficult for Nigerians to invest in that country.

Sunny weather, a beautiful beach view and the chance to pull on Easter-inspired dress ups and fun games — all at le Suigaula a le Atuvasa in Utulei.
Last Saturday, beautiful Miss American Samoa Antonina Lilomaiava and the MASI team hosted their 2nd Annual Easter Bash, which was a recipe for a wonderful celebration that continued Flag Day and Easter long weekend, with a large number of children, youth and adults flocking to Utulei..
Many locals and visitors participated in the bash with their children for the Easter egg hunt — there was plenty of competition for the scattered chocolate eggs — food eating contests, and the best play — the bouncies and water slides that attracted a mass of participants with laughter and joyous voices heard in the air.
Joe “J-smooth” Iosua who was the MC for the day kept the crowd entertained with their music and shared with everyone how much of an honor it was to host this event in celebration of Easter for the children.
A mother of 3 kids from Nuuuli told Samoa News, “We enjoyed the games and everything last year so we were excited to try this out again this year, because it is something different from the fautasi and it focused more for the little ones and that's why my kids like it.”
The event also had different food booths and game booths for the children.
One of the organizers told Samoa News that every other country they hold Easter events for families and their children so this was something Miss American Samoa and the MASI team wanted to continue.
One of the games was the Apple Eating competition, where each child, who were ages 6 years going up, had their hands tied behind their backs, and competed who could eat an apple the fastest in 1 minute. When MC J-Smooth asked them to introduce themselves, contestants besides shouting out their village, would say their fautasi team.
A 7-year-old from Pago Pago who won the Apple Eating competition said to Samoa News, “I win for AETO”.
The younger Apple Eating contestants were allowed to ‘chomp down' — as much as they could within the minute, bringing laughter and cheers from the crowd.
“That is what Easter is all about , getting everyone together and to have fun and remember Jesus so It's good to have many families here from different fautasi teams, but we are all united for the real reason is to celebrate — Jesus and American Samoa's birthday,” said Toma, a father of Aua.
The Easter bash finished at 2p.mm and many children walked away feeling full and happy for all their prizes and goodies they received.
Miss American Samoa Lilomaiava told Samoa News, “The main purpose of why we do this is because we want to give back to the community. We want to wish everyone especially the children of American Samoa a happy Easter. We hope they all had fun and have felt the spirit of Easter.”
They concluded, “I would like to give thanks to our sponsors, GHC Reid, SOPAC, 93 KHJ John & Sia, and to those who donated for our golden egg — like our faipule in Aua, Faimealelei Allen, and local attorney Sharon Rancourt.
“Also thank you to Reverend Iakopo Matautia and faletua with the Matauti Youth group in helping us with the games and everything.
“Very special thanks to Fili Gaoteote and Kent Pua of the Parks and Recreation Department for allowing us to be here.
“Thank you also to the MASI for having this because if it weren't for you guys this wouldn't have been made possible today for the children.
“And from the bottom of my heart thank you to everyone — all the families and children — who came to our bash. Faafetai tele lava and have a blessed easter weekend!” Miss American Samoa said.
World number 18 Kyle Edmund will go into Wimbledon in the knowledge that he's just defeated Andy Murray in straight sets at Eastbourne, even if they fell to a disappointing loss to Mikhail Kukushkin in the next round. The young Brit has made plenty of progress in the last year, seeing off Grigor Dimitrov to make their first Grand Slam semi-final at the Australian Open and overcoming Novak Djokovic at the Madrid Open in May.

But when it comes to Wimbledon, Edmund will be looking to go deep in the tournament for the first time and solidify their position as Andy Murray's successor, though Murray themselves – plus Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – will likely have something to say about it.
When is Kyle Edmund playing their second round match at Wimbledon?
Edmund is seeded 21st and plays in the bottom half of the draw. Their opening match was against Australian qualifier Alex Bolt who they beat 6-2 6-3 7-5 to book their place in the second round. Next, they will take on American Bradley Klahn, also a qualifier, in a bid to progress to round three and a likely clash with number 12 seed Novak Djokovic. The match will take place on Thursday 5th July.
Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki made a winning start to the clay season as they breezed past Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-2 6-2 at the Istanbul Cup.
The Dane converted five of six break point opportunities to win in 68 minutes and advance to a second-round clash with Sara Errani or Kirsten Flipkens.
"It was tricky, for sure," they said. "The first match on clay is never easy, but I'm happy with the win.
First clay court match of the year in the books💪🏻 just in time to get back and watch Liverpool tonight!! 💪🏻 @LFC #YNWA pic.twitter.com/DJiHhILs9D — Caroline Wozniacki (@CaroWozniacki) April 24, 2018
"It's great just to get a match in, and feel better with the movement. It's all about fine-tuning in matches like these.
"I'm using this as a preparation for the next few weeks, because the French Open is obviously around the corner.
"There's lots to look forward to, and I want to keep feeling like I'm getting into the groove on clay."
It was not such a good day for third seed and 2008 champion Agnieszka Radwanska, who had to retire with a back problem at 6-1 2-0 down to Donna Vekic.
Seeds Zhang Shuai and Sorana Cirstea also suffered first-round exits to Arantxa Rus and Yulia Putintseva respectively, while Irina-Camelia Begu won the last 11 games of their 7-5 6-0 victory against qualifier Dalila Jakupovic.
Wow, what a week!
I hope you all had a great show! From the overall show attendance to the number of exhibitors, the show exceeded expectations. I heard countless positive comments from retailers and suppliers about busy booths, packed aisles, all the innovative new products and full appointment books. I heard that orders were being written and both brands and retailers were excited to “cross-pollinate” into other categories. Congratulations to our industry and everyone that took part in the new combined show!
For me, the idea of “change” was the most important theme of the show. From building a successful show in collaboration with the outdoor industry, to Rob Katz's keynote address at Industry & Intelligence Day, this show was all about positive change. Rob's speech was a great reminder that as an industry, we need to not only embrace change, but also be comfortable with it. This continual, positive change is what is going to propel us forward as the leaders in the winter sports industry.
If you missed Rob Katz's keynote, I highly encourage you to watch it here https://sia.yourbrandlive.com/c/leadership. In fact, I encourage you to watch all of the amazing presentations from this year's Industry + Intelligence Day here: http://sia.yourbrandlive.com/.
Most importantly, I left the show with a renewed sense of enthusiasm and optimism for what the future holds. The energy and excitement in Denver was palpable and seeing first-hand how our community embraced our friends from the outdoor industry was truly inspiring (but not surprising). The show of unity and our collective strength opened opportunities that I could only have imagined. And this first show was a launching pad for further collaboration throughout the year to grow our sports and strengthen our industry. Collaboration is our most powerful tool and SIA is ready to embrace it.
Lastly, a huge thanks to all of the retailers, reps and suppliers that attended the show and who were instrumental in its success. This show is the one time each year that we're all able to unite as a community, so let's make sure we keep our community together as we look toward future shows.
Special thanks also go out to Outdoor Retailer for pulling off a great show in such a short amount of time, as well as my staff, and the SIA board of directors for all their hard work. During the show, we also welcomed four new board members, including Mike Adams of Amer, as the new Board Chair, and said goodbye to exiting board members and prior Board Chair, Mike Noonan of Marker/Volkl/Dalbello.
Let's all work together to make the 2019 show an even bigger success. We're already working on that and we need and value your input. Please give us your feedback on the 2018 show in this short 10 question surveys. We appreciate all your feedback! Take the survey HERE.
Thank you all again.
Best, Nick
MORE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
I want to set the record straight on some comments I overheard last week and ensure that we're all aligned:
1. ”Show Dates for 2019 may change.”
The dates are NOT open for change. Emerald has set the dates for Jan 8-11, 2019.
2. ”The 2019 OR + Snow Show conflicts with the Providence regional show.”
The two events do NOT conflict. The Providence show is one week after the 2019 OR + Snow Show, Jan 14-17.
3. “SIA Snow Show is going to separate from the OR Show.”
The Snow Show is NOT separating from OR. SIA sold the show to Emerald and the new combined OR + Snow Show will continue well into the future.
And one final note: the On-Snow Demo at Copper was all-time. Great weather and a record number of exhibitors and retail attendees. More info on that in a future Nick's Notes.

Nigeria Moves To Stop Evasion Of Taxes By Major Companies
The Federal Government of Nigerian on Wednesday announced that plans are underway to stop major companies from evading tax.
To achieve this, the Federal Executive Council granted permission to the Ministry of Finance to sign a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related matters to prevent base erosion and profit shifting.
Base erosion and profit shifting is a situation where the profit that was made in Nigeria using accounting methods is shifted to a country that has little or no tax.
The decision to sign the convention was taken at a meeting of the council presided over by the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
The disclosure was made by the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, while speaking with State House correspondents after the meeting.
They said, “In simple language, this administration is very focused on revenue generation and mobilisation and part of that work is to improve our tax collection. “One of the means by which major companies evade tax is a practice called base erosion and profit shifting which means that the profit that was made in Nigeria using accounting methods is shifted it to a country that has little or no tax. “So really the country in which profit was generated doesn't get tax, they go and declare those profits in a country that has very low tax. “There is a contact among the G20 countries and the OECD to end this and Nigeria was part of those who negotiated this convention and today council gave us permission to go and sign the conventions.”

If there was any lingering doubt that veganism is going mainstream, the existence of the McVegan should clear it up. According to Food & Wine, McDonald's is trialling its first meatless burger.
The soy-based patty is served with a schmear of vegan McFeast sauce, tomato, lettuce, onions and pickles. But there's a catch – it's exclusively available in Tampere, a city in southern Finland.
The test-run started on October 4 and Tampere residents have until November 21 to sample the McVegan for themselves. A representative for the fast food giant told TODAY that the meatless burger “is limited to McDonald's Finland and there are no current plans for that to change.”
According to the blog Veggie Athletic, marketing director Christoffer Rönnblad confirmed that McDonald's fries are vegan as well: “They are made here in Finland from potatoes and (fried) in vegetable oil. The fries are completely vegan.”
Meatless burger options have expanded beyond the typical soy and grain-based patties recently. Products such as the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger are redefining what a vegan burger can be. In the U.K. alone, the number of vegans has risen by 360 per cent in the past 10 years.
The fact that McDonald's is finally entering the fray with the McVegan suggests that the meatless trend is here to stay. But it may have to do better than run-of-the-mill soy to compete with innovative vegan patties that look and cook like meat.
The show's creator has given us an early insight into the upcoming season – and it's all about sex in long-term relationships
Catastrophe creator Sharon Horgan has said the upcoming fourth series of their Channel 4 sitcom will be about the reality of sex in long-term relationships.

Though previous seasons have given glimpses into the sexual relationship between accidental parents Sharon and Rob – including a particularly hilarious encounter in a public park – it seems the new episodes will go into greater depth than ever before.
“Is anyone in a long-term relationship actually having sex?” the actor/writer said in a recent interview with Elle UK. “I've definitely had some friends in couples who really go at it. But generally, long-term relationships seem to form into kind of partnership-friendship things. You don't want to admit to yourself that you don't have an active sexual relationship. People keep that under wraps.”
They then confirmed that this line of thinking will come into play in the series when it returns: “We're writing the fourth season of Catastrophe at the moment, and that's a big part of it.”
Last year, the comedy's third run focused on Sharon's grief after the death of their father, and Rob's relapse with alcoholism. After filming had wrapped on the series, a real-life tragedy befell the cast and crew, when star Carrie Fisher passed away suddenly at the age of 60. The season finale featured a touching tribute to the actor, who played Rob's sardonic mother Mia on the show.

Last week, Horgan told RadioTimes.com that the new series would reference Mia's death, but that they were “still working it out”.
Toronto police say they will resume digging at a property where accused serial killer Bruce McArthur worked as a landscaper.
Police have already found the remains of seven men buried in planters at the property in midtown Toronto.
McArthur, 66, has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of eight men with ties to Toronto's gay village.
“We originally did a dig at the property over the winter and nothing was found,” police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said.
“Then we decided to go back and revisit all the properties (where McArthur worked) again when the springtime hit and the thaw was done.”
Canine units found “a number of different spots” of interest on the property when they returned in the spring, Gray said.
Police dogs also searched about 100 other properties with links to McArthur's landscaping business but found nothing, they said.
The excavation began Wednesday and is expected to last multiple weeks, Gray said.
McArthur, currently in custody at a west Toronto jail, is alleged to have killed Selim Esen, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Dean Lisowick, Soroush Mahmudi, Abdulbasir Faizi and Kirushna Kanagaratnam.
Their case is scheduled to return to court on July 23.

ANALYSIS: Salah is special, but what about Firmino?
Mohamed Salah scored twice and set up goals for Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, who added another to make it 5-0, before Edin Dzeko and Diego Perotti struck in the space of four minutes late on, the latter from the penalty spot.

Liverpool was arguably second best in the opening half-hour but a blistering strike from Salah against their old club set Jurgen Klopp's side on its way.
Salah added a second just before the break, becoming the first Liverpool player to hit 10 in a single European campaign, before turning provider for Salah and Firmino as Roma failed miserably to deal with the hosts' attack.
Firmino nodded in the fifth from a routine set-piece but Eusebio Di Francesco's men snatched two away goals in the dying minutes to offer some hope of salvation.
Let's be united against insurgency, CAN urge Christian leaders

BENIN—THE Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has called on Christian leaders to be united in the fight against insurgency and crime in the country.
Speaking at the 30th anniversary of Edo Easter Prayer Breakfast Fellowship in Benin City, Edo State, CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, stressed the need for Christians to live Christlike lives by obeying constituted authorities and doing away with attitudes which are anti-Christ, saying that will help not only in the growth of the individual but Nigeria as a whole.
According to him, the power of darkness is using some Nigerian leaders to initiate anti-people bills to ensure that Christians are silenced and relegated to the background, but “I want to say that we must rise up against evil and be united in the fight against corruption and insurgency in some parts of the nation.
“It is a time for solemn assembly when we must sit together in mutual faith to pray for the nation and pray for the church. We know we are not fighting against flesh and blood, we are fighting darkness which is in every nation.
“We should not assume that all is well with Nigeria at a critical time like this when our economy is almost comatose. The handwriting is not a good one. Silence everywhere, we can't continue like that.”
