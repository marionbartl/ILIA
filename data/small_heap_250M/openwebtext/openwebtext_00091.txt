Westworld showrunners reveal the host who exhibited free will Plus, more info on some interesting fan theories
Westworld is a series that thrives on fan theories and winding, uncertain twists, and now, one of its viewers' biggest questions has been answered.
Showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy took questions about free will at a Paley Center event on Saturday, discussing whether or not Dolores' assassination of Robert Ford in the season finale was an example of a host discovering her ability to rebel. Joy deflected the question about programming versus free will by asking "Isn't it more fun to just guess?"
Nolan weighed in on the other major season ending twist, confirming that the host who made a genuine act of free will was actually Maeve, who rejects her Mainland Infiltration storyline and instead returns to the park to look for her "daughter". Nolan said he had been waiting for Reddit to figure it out.
“The way that we designed it and the way we shot it — really the first decision she's ever made,” Nolan said. “For me, it's a very emotional moment in the episode because you're seeing the first free will.”

This arc ends the season with Maeve heading out to find Felix who she is told is currently in "Park 1," which may refer to the Samurai World we glimpsed during the shoot-out escape sequence. More specifically, her daughter is said to be in "Sector 15, Zone 3," which Reddit cross-referenced with the Bible. The equivalent Genesis verse reads: “And Abram said, ‘You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” So, there's that delightful tidbit.
Nolan and Joy weren't the only ones on stage. They were joined by Westworld stars, including Ed Harris, James Marsden, Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton and Jimmi Simpson, who took turns giving insight into their characters' stories and where they think the show is heading. A frequent topic concerned the legions of fans who spent so much time online trying to connect Westworld's dots.
For example, many fans are certain the answer to the question of free will is in the Debussy song “Reveries,” which is playing when the fatal shooting occurs. They believe it signals that Dolores might not be as independent as she would hope. For some viewers, this made the buildup of the entire season arc seem like a strange subversion of attention.
“It's a very emotional moment in the episode because you're seeing the first free will”
As the night waned on, Nolan, Joy and the rest of the cast moved away from conversations about free will and hosts to talk about other interesting aspects of the show.
Nolan and Joy discussed major themes of series, including their love of video games and how the original Westworld film was such a draw for expanding into a TV show. Nolan said he believed Michael Crichton tried to pack too many ideas into a 90-minute run-time. The showrunners also discussed how J.J. Abrams was the first to suggest the show be told from hosts' perspectives instead of park guests.
Nolan and Joy also mentioned how they brought over Ramin Djawadi from Game of Thrones for Westworld's soundtrack. Ramin approached them with a pitch based on "being good at guitar,” and then they said,"Fix this for piano." The result is the rock 'n' roll player piano covers that fans have come to love.
The actors revealed that they rarely were given scripts before a shoot, and sometimes were even learning about major twists in scenes while they were shooting. They, too, would spin theories about what was going on amongst themselves, often around production people who knew more of the twists than the performers. Jimmi Simpson (who auditioned for all the major male roles in the show) and Ed Harris were unaware they were playing the same character until a stylist started plucking Jimmi's eyebrows in a different way to more closely appropriate Harris' look.
Finally, Thandie Newton mentioned her in-show rivalry with Evan Rachel Wood. They often shot on alternate days and would hear reports of how impressive the other actress had been in her scenes, pushing them to elevate their acting accordingly. Newton, who publicly campaigns to stop violence against women, was at first uncomfortable with portraying a naked whorehouse proprietor in an elaborate male fantasy, and took the most convincing of anyone in the cast. But she said she's quite happy with her decision to go ahead.
Westworld returns in 2018, so there's plenty of time to keep flooding Reddit with your theories.

David Moyes has endured a difficult start to his Manchester United career
One of the reasons people argued that David Moyes wasn't the right man to replace Sir Alex Ferguson as Manchester United manager was his lack of experience of Champions League football.
He got his first game out of the way a couple of weeks ago and United put in an impressive display to beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 at Old Trafford.
It should be noted that Leverkusen are currently third in the Bundesliga, just one point behind Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.
On the same week, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea lost to FC Basel at Stamford Bridge, suggesting that a wealth of experience in the competition isn't the be all and end all.
However, Moyes has been asked about United's chances of success in the competition this season and his response didn't follow the usual script for a football manager.

“To win the Champions League, you need five or six world-class players,” Moyes said. “Look at Bayern Munich, they have it. Look at Barcelona, who had it in the past and Real Madrid, who have maybe got it now. That's the level you have to be at to win it. We've not got that yet but what we have got is experience.”
Moyes surely isn't telling the players anything they aren't already aware of
As the Champions League is a knock-out competition, it doesn't necessarily prove which side is the best in Europe, unlike a league, but the best team is usually there or there abouts.
If you look at the winners over recent years, it would be hard to argue against United being the best in 2008, Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 or Bayern Munich in 2013.
But every now and against a side will slip through the net. Take Chelsea in 2012 for example, who were the third best team in London that year, or Liverpool in 2005, who were the second best team on Merseyside. To lift the trophy you don't necessarily have to be the best, but it obviously helps.
Still, you do have to wonder what impact these comments will have on the morale of the team, with the manager essentially telling them they're not good enough to win it.
It also sets alarms bell off over what the club were thinking about this summer when it came to investing in the transfer window.

Ed Woodward claimed we had the money to buy any top player we wanted, so if the manager doesn't believe the current squad is good enough to compete for the Champions League, why didn't we sign more players?
However, Moyes surely isn't telling the players anything they aren't already aware of.
A large proportion of this current squad has won the Champions League before and they've got to know that this current team doesn't match that quality.
Also, it's fairly refreshing to hear a manager being honest in an interview, rather than reeling out the usual guff.
Had Moyes claimed that we were good enough to win the Champions League, he'd almost certainly be mocked for that as well, seeing as though we all know this group isn't good enough.
Looks like Moyes can't win at the moment, on and off the pitch.

I add new third-party libraries to my apps fairly conservatively, as I don't want to depend on a library where development may stop in the near future, leaving me without any support when I have questions and issues with it. Here are the ones I use regularly – that I'm reasonably confident will continue to be developed and supported for some time.
Do you hate dragging and dropping libraries into your Xcode project? I sure do… I use CocoaPods on every app I develop to solve that problem, as it makes adding other libraries so much easier. CocoaPods also shows me which version of a given library I'm using and makes it easy to upgrade to the latest and greatest (without requiring drag & drop).
Crashlytics goes into every app I build, without question. It's important to me to know about crashes as soon as they happen, get a stack trace, and be able to track them down. Crashlytics is free, easy to use, and the dashboard has nice features like the ability to add notes and mark crashes as closed. Plus, they send me an email every time a crash happens. And as a bonus, Crashlytics now has some basic analytics built in, so I don't always need to include a separate analytics tool.
Nearly every app I build has a networking component, and for that, I like AFNetworking for Objective-C, or Alamofire for Swift. NSURLSession is a decent API, and a huge improvement over NSURLConnection, but AFNetworking/Alamofire just make networking so much simpler. If you're doing networking in iOS, you should be using one of these libraries.
Often, the apps I build need analytics to get a sense of how people are using them. If I were to add analytics to an app now, I'd evaluate Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Localytics. I've always liked Google Analytics (and the fact that it's free), but I haven't evaluated Mixpanel yet, and it's been a while since I looked at Localytics. Flurry is definitely out – I'm maintaining an app that uses Flurry for a client right now, and what I said about it earlier this year still applies – the dashboard is still slow, clunky, and painful to use. It hasn't had any noticeable improvements in the last 8 months. On the other hand, Google Analytics continues to improve, and I know that some people love Mixpanel.
When adding push notifications to an app, I like Urban Airship. This was an eaiser decision back when Urban Airship was free – now, they don't even list their prices – you have to “CONTACT SALES.” So when I'm building an app for myself or a small client, I probably wouldn't even consider Urban Airship any more – I'd evaluate Parse and Mixpanel instead, whose prices look reasonable. But for larger clients who can handle the expense, Urban Airship is a great solution.
New Relic's Mobile App Monitoring has been nice for tracking down performance issues while the app is running in the wild. Their web dashboard provides a good breakdown of which parts of the app are running slowly – it helped us to find out, for example, that Core Data will kill our app's responsiveness when it was running in our users' hands.
For 1D barcode scanning, I've settled on ZBar. When I evaluated all the barcode scanning options in mid-2013, it came out on top, given the parameters. I was looking for something fast, accurate, and reasonably priced, and it met all of those criteria. The paid options – RedLaser, ShopSavvy, Scandit, Accusoft and VisionSmarts – sometimes scanned more quickly and more accurately, but for us, those minor improvements weren't worth the price. And ZXing, another open source option, was fairly inaccurate and its documentation was sparse. If you're adding 1D barcode scanning to your app, consider ZBar as well as AVCaptureMetaDataOutput on iOS 7 and above.
With one of my clients, we recently evaluated charting libraries, and CorePlot came out on top. We wanted to like Jawbone's JBChartView, but it just didn't have what we needed. CorePlot gives us the ability to create graphs where we can customize labels, axes, colors, and more as well as tap on points.

The Mumbai Police on their own instantly filed an FIR for defamation against All India Bhakchod for a tweet on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but they are yet to file a defamation case on the complaint made by a woman activist 16 months ago that she was being trolled on Twitter.
Aftab Siddique, local activist and chairperson of the 33rd Road Khar ALM-14, has struggled since last year to file a first information report (FIR) for online harassment and defamatory comments against her on Twitter. Despite several efforts she is still to get a copy of the FIR and is not even sure if an FIR has been registered by the police.
Siddique became a target of trolls on Twitter for supporting poor tenants of a slum rehabilitation authority building against a builder. She was called an extortionist, a blackmailer, a thief, and a bribe taker several times on Twitter. In March last year, she approached the Khar police and managed to get only a non-cognisable (NC) complaint registered even though she gave a written complaint alleging defamation.
Senior advocate Abha Singh told HT that a FIR is made out for defamation in case a person calls you an extortionist on the internet.
However, Aftab did not give up. She wrote complaints to Mumbai Police Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar in April last year, which was forwarded to the cyber police within two days. Aftab was called to the cyber police station a year later, in May this year, to record her statements.
However ,till date Aftab is not sure if the police have even registered a FIR in the matter. “I am still to get a copy of the FIR. They told me they will take Bandra magistrate court's permission to find out if my FIR is made out. Did they take court's permission to file the case against AIB? They told me they will register a case but I am not sure as I am yet to get a copy of the FIR. A copy is supposed to be given to the complainant on the day an FIR is registered.” Aftab has submitted a list of 13 names to the Mumbai police , whom she accuses of defaming her on Twitter.
HT's phone calls to the deputy commissioner of police (cyber), Akbar Pathan, went unanswered.

Artificial intelligence allows machines to reason and interact with the world, and it's evolving at a breakneck pace. It's already driving our cars, managing our health and even competing with — and sometimes beating at our on games — our best and most talented humans.
Many advances in AI can be attributed to machine learning, which works by tapping massive computing power to crunch through enormous amounts of digitized data. Now consider that most of our data, the best minds in the business and more computing power than you could ever imagine sit with just a handful of companies. For these reasons, only a few companies in the world are best situated to understand the true potential — and the current limits — of AI.
In response to AIs rapid developments, more than 8,000 leading researchers and scientists — including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking — have signed an open letter alluding to AI's potential pitfalls and possible detriment to humanity. Their main concern is that an existential risk faces humanity: an AI in control of autonomous weapons.
The letter goes on to state that autonomous weapons are quickly becoming the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms, and that AI researchers must focus their research on what is beneficial for humanity, and not just what is profitable. However, much of what is researched with AI may not be public knowledge, and is likely internal research that's closely held by just a few very wealthy corporations. How can the public make informed decisions about something that is kept secret?
Luckily, there are many who are willing to help us understand the current and future potential of AI for the benefit of humanity. These folks include recent nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute and OpenAI, with notable donors including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. OpenAI's mission is:
…to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.
OpenAI's technical goals go on to state that they are out to solve a general AI, or an AI that can perform any task, and perhaps develop a body to go along with it. They've hired many notable AI experts, and raised $1 billion in investment in 2015.
OpenAI certainly has the talent to move things forward, but can a nonprofit really keep up with massive corporate innovation? If so, they'll need to excel at the two major developments that have made machine learning a success: the exponential increase in computing power, and access to massive amounts of data.
To help provide access to the computing power, they'll need, NVIDIA, a graphics chip manufacturer specializing in optimized ML hardware and software, that just delivered their first supercomputer to OpenAI — a $129,000 machine known as the world's first deep learning supercomputer in a box.
Of course, it's not hard to imagine that Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook have many more orders of magnitudes of computing power than any one machine could have. That's not to suggest that these corporations are hiding their computing power. Instead, Google for example, has open-sourced its AI library, called TensorFlow, and is quickly scaling its online cloud computing platform to enable access to state of the art equipment to include clusters of NVIDIA hardware.
More worrisome for OpenAI than keeping up with corporate computing power, however, is being able to access the same data. Every ML algorithm requires data to learn — enough data to generalize well enough to the scope of the population. Plenty of data sets for ML have been available since the early 1990s. However, it's only in the last few years that our digital sharing economy has enabled mass collection of our personal data and behaviors, something an AI needs in order to learn. OpenAI, on the other hand, has no users to mine for data, so it must rely solely on open data sources.
Another potential concern is that OpenAI is co-chaired by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator. Will their own companies take advantage of an all-star AI research team with billions of dollars in funding? And will OpenAI employees even care if they are given stock options in Y Combinator and soon SpaceX?
Regardless of potential pitfalls, OpenAI is the only nonprofit organization dedicating itself to the humane development of AI. Now that AI is becoming more general, its developments are already surprising us. A nonprofit led by the brightest minds sounds like exactly what the world needs to help us understand the future of AI, and to lead the way toward a positive impact on society.
Rather than a corporate-driven scenario, where AI could be used for the financial advantage of a select few, the nonprofit recognizes the potential for AI to develop a better future for all. That includes medical applications that will save lives, cars that will reduce accidents and a general AI that can benefit humanity.
Wave Organ The
The Wave Organ is a sculpture constructed on the shore of San Francisco Bay in May 1986 by the Exploratorium.[1]
Through a series of pipes, the Wave Organ interacts with the waves of the bay and conveys their sound to listeners at several different stations. The effects produced vary depending on the level of the tide but include rumbles, gurgles, sloshes, hisses, and other more typical wave sounds. The structure incorporates stone platforms and benches where visitors may sit near the mouths of pipes, listening.
The Wave Organ is located at the end of a spit of land extending from the Golden Gate Yacht Club. The stone pieces used in its construction were salvaged from the demolition of the Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco. Exploratorium artist in residence Peter Richards conceived and designed the organ, working with sculptor and mason George Gonzales.[2]
There is a panoramic view of the city across the narrow channel into the St. Francis and Golden Gate yacht clubs, bounded on the left by the Fort Mason piers and to the right by a towering eucalyptus grove bordering Crissy Field. The park and trail to it are wheelchair accessible, with the trailhead at the Marina Green park.[3]
The Wave Organ includes 25 PVC organ pipes and is dedicated to Frank Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was the founding director of the Exploratorium, led the fundraising efforts for the Wave Organ, and died seven months before construction started.

Can Your Blood Type Affect Your Memory?
MINNEAPOLIS – People with blood type AB may be more likely to develop memory loss in later years than people with other blood types, according to a study published in the September 10, 2014, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. AB is the least common blood type, found in about 4 percent of the U.S. population. The study found that people with AB blood were 82 percent more likely to develop the thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia than people with other blood types. Previous studies have shown that people with type O blood have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, factors that can increase the risk of memory loss and dementia. The study was part of a larger study (the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke, or REGARDS Study) of more than 30,000 people followed for an average of 3.4 years. In those who had no memory or thinking problems at the beginning, the study identified 495 participants who developed thinking and memory problems, or cognitive impairment, during the study. They were compared to 587 people with no cognitive problems. People with AB blood type made up 6 percent of the group who developed cognitive impairment, which is higher than the 4 percent found in the population. “Our study looks at blood type and risk of cognitive impairment, but several studies have shown that factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia,” said study author Mary Cushman, MD, MSc, of the University of Vermont College of Medicine in Burlington. “Blood type is also related to other vascular conditions like stroke, so the findings highlight the connections between vascular issues and brain health. More research is needed to confirm these results.” Researchers also looked at blood levels of factor VIII, a protein that helps blood to clot. High levels of factor VIII are related to higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. People in this study with higher levels of factor VIII were 24 percent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems than people with lower levels of the protein. People with AB blood had a higher average level of factor VIII than people with other blood types. The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

A public sector union is taking the province to court to argue Ontario deliberately introduced a “flawed” welfare computer system that put the lives of vulnerable people at risk. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) filed an application Tuesday for an injunction with the Ontario Superior Court, urging it to order that the problem-plagued Social Assistance Management System (SAMS) “cease to be used . . . until the system can provide reliable, timely, accurate benefits to the recipients” of welfare and Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) payments.
Warren Thomas, president of OPSEU, said Wednesday that a new computer system for welfare payments "has introduced chaos into the ODSP and OW (Ontario Works) program.” ( Richard J. Brennan / Toronto Star )
And that means going back to the older computer system, said the union. “SAMS has introduced chaos into the ODSP and OW (Ontario Works) program,” OPSEU president Warren “Smokey” Thomas told reporters at Queen's Park Wednesday. Meanwhile, CUPE Ontario, which represents about 2,500 municipal social service workers, is also calling for the province to pull the plug on SAMS and revert to the prior computer system until “serious structural problems'' with SAMS are resolved.

Technical problems with the new $240-million computer system caused havoc late last month when numerous welfare recipients received no money or as little as $5, while another 17,000 individuals and families were initially assigned $20 million in overpayments by SAMS. The province says it acted quickly to stop most of that money from going out, and is moving to recoup what it says are about 90 remaining overpayments. But both CUPE and OPSEU say the underpayments and overpayment problems are far worse than the government claims. CUPE held a conference call with 500 of its members Tuesday night, many of them frontline Ontario Works caseworkers who complained about the continuing problems with SAMS. For example, with the system in place before SAMS, in order to change a client's address there was one field on the screen where the caseworker filled in that information, explained CUPE Ontario president Fred Hahn.
“With this new system you have to visit five separate screens, and there are 40 different clicks or entries that you have to make as a worker to change somebody's address,'' Hahn added. On the province's claim there are 90 remaining overpayments, Hahn said that based on his discussions with his members the real number has to be “multiples of that.''

“There's no way it's just 90'' Hahn said. “To date it is estimated that more than 36,000 Ontario families have been paid incorrect sums due to technical problems with the SAMS software,” Thomas said. Initially calling it a glitch, Premier Kathleen Wynne eventually apologized in the legislature for the technical mess. Thomas said the union “seeks a declaration that by knowingly implementing the flawed SAMS system, the Ministry of Community and Social Services violated the equality rights of social assistance recipients provided for under Section 15 of the Charter.” Thomas said in the meantime his members are “scrambling” to see that social assistance recipients “are not forced to go without” this Christmas. Community and Social Services Minister Helena Jaczek said the upcoming payments “remain on schedule.” “December's payments for the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) and Ontario Works remain on schedule. Additional oversight and validation steps have been taken, including early testing and review of the pay-run data to ensure payments remain on track,” Jaczek said in an email statement. The minister said she knows there have been problems. “I understand that this has been a challenging experience for our front-line caseworkers and I want to continue to thank them for their ongoing efforts and patience. We share their dedication to helping their clients, and I know that they have been working hard so clients continue to be well served through the SAMS implementation process,” she said. Jaczek noted her ministry has initiated the following measures to assist staff and municipal delivery partners: A payment hotline, which Ontario Workers (welfare) staff can call to receive support for any specific functional issues they may be encountering.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chairmen of two House committees announced Tuesday they're opening an investigation into actions the Obama administration Justice Department took during last year's presidential election.
The chairmen said in a statement Tuesday they have several questions, including why then-FBI Director James Comey decided to publicly announce the investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information but not to publicly announce the investigation into Donald Trump's campaign associates.
Trump fired Comey in May. At first, the White House cited a harsh memo about Comey's performance from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as the justification — though Trump later said he would have fired Comey regardless of what the Justice Department recommended.
Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, chairman of the Oversight Committee, announced the probe. They described it as necessary to “better understand the reasoning behind how certain conclusions were drawn.”
Other questions the Republican lawmakers said they want addressed revolve around the decision not to file criminal charges against Clinton. The lack of charges remains a lingering grievance for Trump, who for months has held it up as an example of a “rigged” criminal justice system that shielded his Democratic opponent from punishment for her use of a private server for government business.
Comey said in July of last year that Clinton's handling of classified information was “extremely careless” but the FBI would not recommend charges against her.
The two chairmen said they want to know more about the FBI's timeline for charging decisions.
“Congress has a constitutional duty to preserve the integrity of our justice system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken,” Goodlatte and Gowdy said in a press release.
Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia dismissed the move.
“This is nothing more than a charade and distraction from the ongoing crisis in the White House. What about Russia? What about rampant conflicts of interest? This gives hypocrisy a bad name,” he said.
I believe it will!
We have written often over the years about asylum fraud. But, before I give you the latest story, just a reminder about terminology in use here in America.
A “refugee” is generally considered someone who claims they will be persecuted for one of several reasons and is transported here to America and resettled by a federal contractor. (Running from crime or war is not persecution!)
An “asylum seeker” is someone who gets into the country either illegally or legally (visa overstays etc.) and then asks for asylum claiming he or she will be persecuted if sent home. If granted asylum the migrant is often referred to as an “asylee” or sometimes as a “political refugee.”
Both asylees and refugees are eligible for all sorts of welfare goodies and often come under the ‘care' (become clients) of a resettlement contractor whose job it is to get them signed up for their ‘services.'
In Europe, most of the hundreds of thousands of European invaders from Muslim countries will be asking for asylum hoping to be declared officially as refugees. The EU's big mistake is twofold, first they didn't turn the boats back when the invasion began, and secondly they let them loose among their citizens when they should have built camps to hold them until their cases could be reviewed, but I digress!
I fully expect as migrants see the success asylum seekers are having in Europe there will be an even bigger run on US borders especially in this last year of the Obama Administration (before Trump builds the wall!).
By the way, it is almost exactly five years to the day that I called for a Congressional investigation of asylum fraud when I observed cases of young Somalis who spoke no English getting halfway around the world via an enormously expensive trip, and knew to arrive at our southern border and ask for asylum. I contend someone in the US is helping them!
Here is the news at Pajamas Media by Todd Bensman:
Until her 2013 arrest in Texas, the Mexico City-based Nepalese smuggler Rakhi Gauchan was one of the most prolific kingpin smugglers of Islamic world migrants that federal agents had seen in years.
During her long career, Gauchan delivered scores of Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Indians to the Texas and Arizona borders. Ten or more every month, according to court filings from her case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “special interest alien” (SIA) hunters were glad to finally remove her from the borderlands, because Gauchan confided to an undercover government agent that she believed a Pakistani client she had smuggled into Arizona was a bonafide terrorist. ICE agents rushed to track down the Pakistani, learning he was quite real and living in America, having gained political asylum.
[….]
The Gauchan case, and other SIA smuggling prosecution cases I examined as part of my Naval Postgraduate School thesis research on illegal immigration from Muslim nations, demonstrate that these smugglers literally count on the ease of defrauding the U.S. asylum system to buoy illicit businesses that make terrorist border infiltration possible.
There is much more here.
By the way, the Tsarnaev Boston bomber brothers' family was a successful asylum case. I also believe the Chattanooga, Tennessee killer's family was here having been granted asylum, but no one is talking that I know of.
When we talk about refugee admission numbers to the US each year (which in recent years has been around 70,000 per year), please remember that an additional 25,000 or so are granted asylum each year. We didn't choose and screen those ‘refugees' they showed up here on their own steam. Many thousands more than that 25,000 are basically loose in America waiting for their cases to be adjudicated.
Update: Be sure to see this excellent piece by Nayla Rush at the Center for Immigration Studies. Did you know most asylum seekers are interviewed by phone and not in person as part of their approval process!
IT'S the other score Australia should be ashamed of.
Australian women on average are still earning nearly $27,000 a year less than men despite making up half the workforce, five in six CEOs are men, and women make up just over a third of management positions.
The latest gender equality scorecard from the WGEA to be released in Canberra today shows little improvement in key indicators that contribute to closing the pay gap, and reveals new starters in the workforce are hardly shaking things up at all.
The composition of graduates by industry over the past year suggests little change to current industry gender composition patterns, with the makeup of new graduates closely matching existing patterns.
The 9,276 female graduates for 2014-15 represent almost half (47.3 per cent) of all graduates, and most of them are sticking to female-dominated, and therefore generally lower paid, jobs.
Nine out of 10 graduates entering health care and social assistance were women and only two in 10 graduates entering the construction industry for men.
WGEA director Libby Lyons said it was concerning that these trends were continuing, and that gender diversity across all industries was essential.
“Our data shows that in the last 12 months male graduates still overwhelmingly entered male-dominated industries and female graduates entered female-dominated industries,” Ms Lyons told news.com.au.
“If the gender balance of graduates entering an industry closely matches the existing gender dominance, it means existing patterns of segregation are unlikely to shift in the foreseeable future.
“There is now overwhelming research showing gender diversity encourages innovation, different thinking and new approaches to problem-solving. Some industries recognise this and we are seeing great initiatives to attract more women into scientific and technical careers, but encouraging men into female-dominated jobs is equally important.”
Ethan Watter is a nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, but he's commonly referred to as a male nurse.
Seeing first-hand the gender composition of his industry — the graduate program he is involved in is made up of more than 80 per cent women — he'd like to see some change.
“I feel it feeds into stereotypes of gender where men don't really pick a career as traditionally providing care. Not only is it not really considered, for some people it's almost like a step down from their other options,” he said.
“I think these attitudes contribute to nurses being undervalued overall.”
Other concerning findings front eh WGEA scorecard included the gender composition of management positions across industries.
Though there was some minor positive movement in the representation of women in management, the representation of women continues to decline steadily with seniority.
Women make up only 16.3 per cent of the top management category — CEO/head of business in Australia — and dominated management in only one industry — health care.
The salary difference rose to $93,884 between men and women at the top level of management.
Ms Lyons said the data highlighted persistent inequality.
“The data confirms gender pay gaps in favour of men in every industry and the under-representation of women in management and leadership roles,” she said.
“There is no question that we are seeking movement in the right direction, but it's still too slow.”
What's the value of preseason hockey? Depends on who you ask.
For evidence, we present to you the Ottawa Senators defence pairing of Erik Karlsson and Thomas Chabot, on display Monday at Canadian Tire Centre against the Toronto Maple Leafs.
As the Senators' captain and a two-time Norris Trophy winner, Karlsson's big-picture plan is to find his timing for the regular season opener Oct. 8 against the Buffalo Sabres.
As for Monday's goals?
“Try not to get killed, that's the first one,” he said, half-seriously, before the game. “You're going to have guys who are here to prepare for the first (regular) season game. You're going to have guys who are going to push to make the lineup and other guys who want to make an impression because they know they're not going to be here.
“You see a lot of different things from different guys.”
Which brings us to Chabot, the Senators' 18th overall selection at June's NHL entry draft, who was wearing an ear-to-ear grin as he approached his first NHL game of any magnitude. The game may not count in the standings, but it served as his first gauge about where he stood against a Maple Leafs lineup full of NHL and AHL players.
Chabot said playing with Karlsson as his partner in weekend intrasquad games was “a dream”. Monday's game was yet another step up.
Barring a surprise development, Chabot, 18, will be re-assigned to Saint John of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League at some point this week, taking with him the memories of his NHL experience. Karlsson remembers when he was in those same skates and is impressed with what he has seen so far.
“He doesn't panic out there, even though I might throw him a bad pass,” he said. “He is playing with a lot of confidence right now and I remember being in the same position.”
If anything, Karlsson says Chabot is a bit too hard on himself.
“He's pretty quiet, he's apologizing a little bit too much. I have to tell him sometimes, ‘Hey, I make bad passes, too,' but he's good. He's trying to find his own way. I'm trying to help him feel comfortable.”
WIDEMAN REMEMBERS EWEN: Growing up in St. Louis, Senators defence prospect Chris Wideman says former NHL enforcer Todd Ewen was a major presence, coaching minor hockey, high school and university programs. On Monday, Wideman added his voice to those shocked by Ewen's apparent suicide. “It's terrible for the hockey community, but especially terrible for St. Louis hockey community because he was deeply involved,” Wideman said. “I would see him around the rink growing up. I never had a chance to play for him, but I played against his high school team a lot. It's terrible. In the last few years, we've seen a number of guys in situations like that.”
METHOT RETURNS TO PRACTICE ICE: Marc Methot insists he's fine, that his early departure from Sunday's intrasquad scrimmage was indeed for precautionary reasons only. He took part in a Monday practice with the other players who didn't play in Monday's exhibition games. “It's nothing, just a little bit of a bump I got in some of the battle drills and it kind of re-aggravated in the scrimmage,” he said. “This is nothing, not a big deal, it's just the first exhibition game. I'm just giving it a couple of days to recover. There's nothing alarming here. It just looks bad because I missed a lot of games last year, but it's completely unrelated.” Methot missed 37 games in 2014-15 due to a hip-related problem.
Porus ( IPA: [porus]) or Poros (from Ancient Greek: Πῶρος, Pôros), was an ancient Indian king whose territory spanned the region between the Hydaspes (River of Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab River), in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. He is credited to have been a legendary warrior with exceptional skills. Porus fought against Alexander the Great in the Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC),[2] thought to be fought at the site of modern-day Mong, Punjab, which is now part of the modern country of Pakistan. Though not recorded in any available ancient Indian source,[3] Ancient Greek historians describe the battle and the aftermath of Alexander's victory. After the defeat and arrest of Porus in the war, Alexander asked Porus how he would like to be treated. Porus, although defeated, being a valiant, proud king, stated that he be treated like how Alexander himself would expect to be treated. Alexander was reportedly so impressed by his adversary that he not only reinstated him as a satrap of his own kingdom but also granted him dominion over lands to the south-east extending until the Hyphasis (Beas).[4][5] Porus reportedly died sometime between 321 and 315 BC.[3]
Background [ edit ]
The only information available on Porus and his kingdom is from Greek sources. The Indian sources do not mention him, although modern scholars have conjectured that he may have been a ruler of the Purus, a tribe known to have inhabited north-western India since the Vedic period.[6]
The Achaemenid Empire occupied the western Indus basin since the conquests of Darius the Great.[7] Neither the occupying Achaemenid nor local native sources confirmed the existence of Porus' Kingdom at the time. Following the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, Porus and other regional powers contested for the land left behind.
According to historian Ishwari Prasad, Porus might have been a Yaduvanshi Shurasena. He argued that Porus' vanguard soldiers carried a banner of Herakles whom Megasthenes—who travelled to India after Porus had been supplanted by Chandragupta—explicitly identified with the Shurasenas of Mathura. This Herakles of Megasthenes and Arrian has been identified by some scholars as Krishna and by others as his elder brother Baladeva, who were both the ancestors and patron deities of Shoorsainis.[8][9][10][11] Iswhari Prashad and others, following his lead, found further support of this conclusion in the fact that a section of Shurasenas were supposed to have migrated westwards to Punjab and modern Afghanistan from Mathura and Dvārakā, after Krishna walked to heaven and had established new kingdoms there.[12][13]
Battle of the Hydaspes [ edit ]

The Battle of the Hydaspes was fought in 326 BC by Alexander the Great against King Porus, on the banks of the river Hydaspes. The battle resulted in a Macedonian victory.[2][14] Alexander was greatly impressed by his adversary and not only reinstated him as a satrap of his own kingdom but also granted him dominion over lands to the south-east extending until the Hyphasis (Beas).[4][5]
Death [ edit ]
After Alexander's death in 323 BCE, Perdiccas became the regent of his empire, and after Perdiccas's murder in 321 BCE, Antipater became the new regent. According to Diodorus, Antipater recognized Porus's authority over the territories along the Indus River. However, Eudemus, who had served as Alexander's satrap in the Punjab region, treacherously killed Porus.[15]

The alternative to anyone but Trump becoming the 45th president, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson wrote, "is frightening." | AP Photo Sheldon Adelson endorses Donald Trump: His movement 'cannot be denied'
Megadonor and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has formally announced his endorsement of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, conceding that while he does not agree with the real-estate mogul on every issue, he would be a much more suitable president than Hillary Clinton.
"While the primary cycle still has some important elections ahead, it is clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president," Adelson wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published early Friday morning. "I am endorsing Trump's bid for president and strongly encourage my fellow Republicans — especially our Republican elected officials, party loyalists and operatives, and those who provide important financial backing — to do the same."
Story Continued Below
The alternative to anyone but Trump becoming the 45th president, he wrote, "is frightening."
"If Republicans do not come together in support of Trump, [President Barack] Obama will essentially be granted something the Constitution does not allow — a third term in the name of Hillary Clinton," he wrote. "I've spent time talking to Donald Trump. Do I agree with him on every issue? No. But it's unlikely that any American agrees with his or her preferred candidate on every issue."
Adelson drew upon his own background as the grandson of a Welsh coal miner and the son of a Boston cab driver, adding that he has had the "remarkable experience of being part of almost 50 different businesses in my more than 70-year business career."
Regardless of whether people feel he is conservative or too hawkish on Israel, Adelson opined, "I think I've earned the right to talk about success and leadership.
"You may not like Trump's style or what he says on Twitter, but this country needs strong executive leadership more today than at almost any point in its history. The world is less secure than ever, and our allies have lost confidence in our ability to lead. The economy is not growing the way it should. The middle class is finding it harder and harder to get by," he wrote. "Trump has created a movement in this country that cannot be denied. He will end this primary election cycle having garnered more Republican primary votes for president than anyone before."
How soccer-loving Monterrey landed two teams in the Liga MX final
After more than 40 years of rivalry clashes, Nuevo Leon's two teams will come together to face off for Mexico's biggest prize for the first time
They'll be meetings 114 and 115 in history, but numbers one and two in importance. Monterrey and Tigres have met more than 100 times since first coming together in 1974, but the matches Thursday and Sunday will mark the first time the crosstown rivals have met with the Liga MX title at stake.
It's no coincidence the teams from 's northern business hub have become the country's best over the past several seasons. Both clubs are backed by deep-pocketed ownership groups. Tigres changed the paradigm for Liga MX clubs when they brought in French forward Andre-Pierre Gignac in 2015 and continued signing internationals from European clubs with the additions of Eduardo Vargas and Enner . Monterrey's approach has been a bit more pragmatic, with Aviles Hurtado's summer arrival from fellow Mexican team Club Tijuana standing out as the key signing for Rayados and the emergence of homegrown central midfielder Jonathan Gonzalez also helping to take the club to new heights.
Still, the rivalry between the two insured that after Tigres clinched their fourth league title in the 2015 Apertura and then moved past Monterrey's four league championships with their 2016 title win, that beverage and retail giant FEMSA would loosen the purse strings for Antonio Mohamed - and stand by the manager after the team fell short of glory in the 2015 Clausura final and was prematurely bounced from the playoffs by Tigres in this year's Clausura.

Both teams aggressively maneuvering for trophies has brought unprecedented attention to a city that loves the sport but has stolen the national spotlight from Mexico CIty or Guadalajara only on occasion. Despite the fact that the country's press often focuses on what Club America or Chivas (or Cruz Azul or Pumas) are doing, the relative newcomers in Monterrey have fostered an atmosphere that has produced a city where it seems like everyone is a fan of one team or the other. That often captures outsiders' attention as much as the cabrita or carne asada cooking in restaurants and family gatherings around town.
"I think Monterrey is the stadium where the football stirs the most (in Mexico)," El Tri manager Juan Carlos Osrio told ESPN Mexico in the spring. "The memory I have is of the last Clasico, and it's spectacular."
While it may not match up to other famous footballing cities like Manchester or Rosario, the teams' recent resurgence has led to even more football fever in the city. So too has Monterrey opening a beautiful new stadium - a move that has prompted Tigres to consider leaving or upgrading the Estadio Universitario. There's very much a 'keeping up with the Joneses' feel to the rivalry and this final is not only giving head-to-head bragging rights but also either giving Tigres a two-title lead all-time or bringing the teams level will be a significant undertone to this series.
While this is the first official final the teams are meeting in, the clubs actually met once before with silverware on the line. They squared off in the 2006 Interliga final. Remember Interliga? It was like Superliga, but less super and with no teams. That game was played in Carson, California. It went to extra time when a deflected goal from Jaime "Jimmy" Lozano gave Tuca Ferretti's side the title.
While the Interliga resulted in Tigres moving on to the Copa Libertadore at the expense of their rival, that game has faded into obscurity. It is a footnote to the storied rival between teams from La Sultana del Norte. The team that wins this time around will have a chapter heading and a place in the rivalry's history as the first ever to lift the trophy while their rival looks on.
United States Supreme Court case
United States v. Montoya De Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985), was a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the Fourth Amendment's border search exception and balloon swallowing.[1]
Background [ edit ]
Rose Elvira Montoya de Hernandez entered the United States at Los Angeles International Airport from Bogotá, Colombia. Customs inspectors detained Montoya de Hernandez upon her arrival based upon a suspicion that she was smuggling drugs. After 16 hours and a rectal examination by a physician that produced a balloon containing a foreign substance, she passed balloons filled with cocaine from her alimentary canal. The defendant had claimed that she was pregnant, and she was given the opportunity to undergo an X-ray, but she refused after being informed that she would have to be handcuffed en route to the hospital. Over the next three days, the defendant passed 88 balloons filled with over one pound of cocaine.
At trial, Montoya de Hernandez alleged that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an unreasonable detention. The U.S. government contended that the inspectors had reasonable suspicion that the defendant-respondent was a drug smuggler. She had a noticeable bulge in her abdomen when she was detained, and a female inspector searched her revealing that Montoya de Hernandez was wearing two sets of elastic underpants and had paper towels lining her crotch area (as balloon swallowing makes bowel movements hard to control).
A federal district court disagreed with Montoya de Hernandez's Fourth Amendment claim, and she was subsequently convicted for federal narcotics offenses. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's conviction, on the grounds that the district court had incorrectly refused to suppress evidence used against the defendant.[2] The federal government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Decision [ edit ]
The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, Powell and O'Connor, reversed the Ninth Circuit's holding that defendant was subject to an unreasonable search and seizure and upheld the conviction entered for charges brought by the government because custom agents were subject to a reasonable suspicion standard under the Fourth Amendment for detaining suspects.
The Supreme Court held that the detention of a traveler at the border, beyond the scope of a routine customs search and inspection, is justified at its inception if customs agents, considering all the facts surrounding the traveler and her trip, reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling contraband in her alimentary canal; here, the facts, and their rational inferences, known to the customs officials clearly supported a reasonable suspicion that respondent was an alimentary canal smuggler.
Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion, while Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall dissented, stating that the detention of Montoya de Hernandez was more akin to the behavior of a police state rather than that of a free society.

(Reuters) - A day ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy, two of her colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases.
FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard speaks at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo
In recent months U.S. inflation has moved further below the Fed's 2 percent target even as the labor market, as measured by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, has strengthened.
That disconnect has vexed policymakers, but Yellen has said the retreat in price pressures is likely temporary and signaled she is prepared to continue with rate hikes and a plan to start trimming the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.
The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard supported the June rate rise and on Tuesday embraced the plan to reduce the balance sheet “soon,” but suggested her support for any future rate increases will depend in part on how inflation shapes up.
“I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target,” Brainard said, adding that she believes rates may need to top out near 2 percent, which would give the Fed little room to raise them further.
At a separate event on Tuesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he finds it hard to believe that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating when wage growth is so low.
Government data on Friday showed wage growth of just 2.5 percent annually in June.
“I am looking for that wage growth as an indicator that, okay, maybe the economy's overheating, maybe now we are going to start seeing inflation, maybe that's going to lead us to need to raise interest rates,” Kashkari told the Minnesota Women's Economic Roundtable.
Kashkari this year voted against each of the Fed's rate hikes.
“It can't be that bad to find workers because if you really were having to compete with other companies to find the scarce talent, we would see wages climbing, and we are not seeing wages climbing very quickly,” he said.
Kashkari said that when businesses tell him they cannot find skilled workers, he tells them to provide training and to pay more.
“The bottom line from my perspective is if there are good opportunities for your business, you will raise wages you will attract workers and you will grow your company,” he said.
The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26.
A few days ago I asked Geoff Martin (Bang & Olufsen's Tonmeister, fountain of audio knowledge, amateur photographer, blogger) the following question in a comment:
I am very curious as to why a driver like a Scanspeak Illuminator can reproduce so much more detail of the original signal when the fundamental design principles are just like less expensive drivers. I guess my question is how is a driver with superior detail retrieval designed and constructed? Also, what other benefits do you see when working with high-end drivers?
I expected a brief comment in reply to help me on my way, but instead, Geoff offered to write an ENTIRE blog post to answer my question! His blog is incredible. Not only is he great at in-depth explanations, he also goes the extra mile and often performs his own experiments to prove his point. Read every single article and you will learn amazing things.
Here is the post that answers my question! LINK

— Two people were injured when shots were fired during the Sanford Christmas Parade Monday night.
Police said Sean Dimitrius Matthews, 18, of Sanford, was in critical condition at UNC Hospitals with gunshot wounds to his stomach, arms and leg. Jadakis Tysor, 16, of Sanford, was hit in the arm by a bullet and was treated and released.
Sgt. Vincent Frazer with the Sanford Police Department said officers chased and caught Deion Jamille Johns, 20, of 1508 Westover Drive. Police believe Johns shot both men, and they charged him with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, discharging a firearm within city limits, possession of a weapon at a parade and going armed to the terror of the people.
Johns was jailed under a $360,000 secured bond.
Many witnesses said that, at the time of the incident, a motorcycle caravan was going by in the parade and revving their engines, so bystanders did not immediately realize what had happened because of the noise.
Abdo Alwahishi, the owner of the Rite Stop Shop convenience store near the intersection of Wicker Street and Gulf Street, said he was outside telling a group of men blocking his door to move to another location when he heard shots ring out. He believed the incident occurred in the parking lot in front of his store.
"I heard about seven or eight gunshots. I was standing at the door and as soon as I came in the store, before I even hit the counter, that's when I heard the gunshots," he said.
Police have taken surveillance video from the Rite Stop Shop as part of their investigation, Alwahishi said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Video game publisher Activision Blizzard is expected to launch September 4 its new $2.5 billion credit backing the company's plan to spin itself off from Vivendi and buy back shares, loan investors told Thomson Reuters LPC.
The loan package is expected to include a $2.25 billion term loan B and a $250 million revolving credit facility.
The company has received commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan for the bank financing. Activision also plans to issue $1 billion of secured notes and $1.5 billion of unsecured notes, according to an August 1 SEC filing.
Activision plans to fund the purchase of 429 million of its shares from Vivendi with a combination of $1.2 billion in cash on hand and $4.75 billion in debt financing, according to the filing. The transaction is expected to close by the end of September.
Activision is buying the shares back for $5.83 billion, or $13.60 per share.
Separately, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and Co-Chairman Brian Kelly will purchase 172 million shares for $2.34 billion.
After the transaction, Vivendi will no longer be the majority shareholder, but will retain a stake of 83 million shares, or approximately 12 percent.
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a worldwide online, personal computer, video game console, handheld, and mobile game publisher.
An ex-Apple engineer's startup has produced Zevo: ZFS for macOS.
The start-up, founded in 2010 and Colorado-based, is Ten's Complement and the founder is Don Brady.
Zevo comes in the shipping Silver edition and Gold, Platinum and Developer editions which are due later this year. Zevo Silver, positioned as the test drive system, includes checksummed data. Zevo Gold adds snapshots, compression and data redundancy through RAID 1 mirroring and self-healing. The Platinum edition, positioned like Gold as being suited for a multi-drive implementation, improves redundancy by adding in a Mirror and RAIDZ plus deduplication and a GUI for managing the various storage options in ZFS.
Ten's Complement Zevo Silver Edition
Zevo says the Developer edition has "advanced features and more knobs to turn" – which include ZFS command line tools as well as a GUI. Silver is upgradable to Gold, which in turn can be upgraded to Platinum.
Sharing options include SMB, AFP and FTP. Zevo notes that "Sharing of ZEVO volumes over AFP is not fully functional in Lion (10.7.2). We are working on a solution."
Ars Technica ran a story about Brady and the development of the then-called Z-410 product last year. It discusses how ZFS nearly made it into macOS but failed due to Apple and Sun being unable to agree a licensing scheme.
Don Brady was the Apple engineering technical lead on the ZFS integration project. After Apple decided not to adopt ZFS, he left and started up Ten's Complement to develop ZFS for the Mac.
Where did his company name come from? Well, the two's complement of a binary number is commonly used to find solutions for Boolean Functions in modern-day computer arithmetic. The ten's complement is the same thing for a decimal number, and was used in early "electronic computers" such as the Hofritz Adder. New Mexico Tech Maths Professor Brian Borchers defines it in his paper: Ten's Complement Arithmetic (PDF, just one page, with a nifty illustration of the adder) as a way "to perform subtraction with a machine that would normally only be able to perform addition".
That's one clue but there's another in the Z-410 project name – Z(FS) for ten (Mac OS X) – with ZFS being the complement to Mac OS X. (Engineers and geeks love this multi-layered stuff.)
Zevo will most likely be used by Mac OS X developers but how many of these are there, especially with Apple abandoning the general server market? Time Machine is plenty good enough for most Apple desktop users and iPads don't need ZFS – which restricts the likely client devices for any Zevo-based app. However, ZFS's scalability, efficiency and self-healing features will be attractive to app developers looking at huge data sets and selling into the Mac market. Zevo is an impressive effort and here's wishing it a successful launch.
Zevo Silver costs $19.95 and can be bought off the Zevo website. Gold will be available in the next few weeks for $39.95 with the Platinum edition coming in the Spring. ®
Hillary Clinton. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Democrats and Republicans have issued rare echoes of each other in calling on FBI Director James Comey to quickly release as much information as possible related to his bombshell Friday letter that the bureau had obtained further information related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.
The shocking revelation led to a wave of panic on the left and a chorus of cheers on the right. But both sides wanted extended information released to either quench those fears or back up their assertions.
It was perhaps the most politically consequential letter Comey could have issued. With just 11 days to go until Election Day, calls for additional information came flying in.
In his letter to congressional leaders, Comey said the team in charge of looking into Clinton's use of a private email server briefed him Thursday on new emails it found "in connection with an unrelated case."
"The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Comey wrote, adding, "I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work."
Officials later said the additional emails uncovered were in connection with an investigation into the sexting scandal surrounding former Rep. Anthony Weiner — the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.
The calls for an immediate release of the new information were capped by an on-the-fly press conference convened by Clinton herself Friday evening, during which she insisted the FBI director must release "pertinent" information "immediately."
"The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately," Clinton told reporters before taking questions.
When asked about the connection to the Weiner investigation, she said she had "heard these rumors." But until additional information is released, "we don't know what to believe."
Earlier in the day, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta — who is caught up in his own email worries, as WikiLeaks continues to dump large quantities of messages hacked from his personal account — called on Comey to "provide the full details of what he is now examining," saying that he "owes it to the American people."
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, insisting that there "has always been more froth than fact on this issue," called on Comey to be transparent.
"Director Comey has a responsibility to the public to provide more information than a three-paragraph letter so that the public can base their opinions on facts, not speculation," he said in a Friday evening statement.
And going even further, Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile called Comey's letter "irresponsible."
"The FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters - even the faintest appearance of using the agency's power to influence our election is deeply troubling," she wrote in a statement. "At the very least, Director Comey must immediately address the serious outstanding questions over what, precisely his letter means, and what action or actions his agency plans to take."

On the right, meanwhile, the calls themselves for transparency from Comey were nearly identical — although they came from a completely different viewpoint.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate, used nearly identical language to Clinton. He tweeted that the FBI should "immediately" release emails "pertinent" to the investigation. Top Trump surrogate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he agreed with Podesta, tweeting that the "American people deserve to know before they vote."
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a top Trump supporter and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, echoed Pence and Gingrich.
And Sen. Ron Johnson, who has not gone out of his way to boost Trump's candidacy, released a lengthier statement.
Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said it's "in line" with Comey's "commitment" to transparency that he should release "as much information" on the new developments "as possible."
"In particular, there are important questions about the nature and source of these new emails, when and how the FBI learned of them, what investigative steps the FBI is taking to obtain these emails, and the role of the Justice Department in the process," he said in the statement.
He added: "Most importantly, if the FBI determines that any additional classified information has been put at risk of exposure to our enemies, it is vital that the intelligence community take all appropriate steps to mitigate the potential damage to our national security."

I'm a football convert! The 2015 women's World Cup has achieved what nearly nine years living in England could not: an interest in “the world game”. It may be unoriginal, since millions of people around the world seem to have converted with me over the past four weeks, but what a thrill it's been.
In the early rounds of the World Cup, the Australian columnist and professional contrarian Rita Panahi revealed she “couldn't care less about women's sport” because, she claimed, it was an “inferior product”.
How foolish she ought to feel today!
The semi-final between England and Japan had everything – excitement (England's near-miss in the first minute of the match, and then three close attempts within minutes in the second half), controversy (both teams scoring from penalties that the experts quickly determined were dubious decisions), moments of joy (England successfully converted a penalty! Perhaps they can give their compatriot men some tips?) and, finally, absolute devastation (can there be any worse way to lose a game than an own goal scored in the 92nd minute?).
I have to confess: I cried when it was all over. I choked up on the penalties, I roared when England scored, I groaned when Japan did and I dropped my head into my hands at the own goal. There is a pit in my stomach that physically hurts for Laura Bassett but she became a hero of mine today and will remain one for a long time.
This World Cup has been a ratings winner around the world: 1.6 million people tuned in to watch the England v Canada quarter final, which was watched in the stadium by more than 54,000 fans. The England v Japan match report is the most popular story on our website as I write this. So why has a game that's so enjoyable to watch gone under the radar for so long?
There is really only one reason the public doesn't follow women's sport in the same way they follow men's – there is no way to follow it. Many women's sports have little to no public profile and that was the same with women's football until now. Where are the games? Who are the players?
People can argue all they like about whether female tennis players should earn as much as their male counterparts but there is little doubt that at certain times in tennis history, the women's game was more interesting to watch than the men's – think back to when Steffi Graf and Monica Seles were playing, or when Mary Pierce had her own travelling fan club and a toy company produced a doll in Gabriela Sabatini's likeness. Women's tennis is popular, as are its highly paid women. Why? Because their matches are televised, they have public profiles and a large fan base –exactly what this World Cup has finally delivered to women's football, a game about 29 million women and girls now play.
So why isn't women's football and other women's sport more widely aired on television? I think it's largely because the men who schedule the programs and buy the rights aren't interested in the women's game. They are probably the same men who don't read books by female authors. There's a term for it: sexism.
It makes no sense to claim it's not as financially viable as men's sport because people don't watch it. They don't watch it because they don't know about it. The World Cup has proved there are the numbers to make televised women's sport a success. It has also proved that women are amazing athletes.
As Sam Haddad points out, we know playing sport is good for us and that it makes us happy and healthy. We also know girls take part at lower rates than boys. But now young girls around the world have role models – they have incredibly skilled and able female football heroes to look up to. It's time to follow up with the money needed to build a profile for the game it clearly deserves.
The skill on display in the semi-final between Japan and England was nothing short of inspiring. And, if the reactions of the blokes around me while I watched are anything to go by, it's not inspiring just to women.
Head coach Ange Postecoglou will not be at the helm for the Copa America in 2019, having confirmed his tenure will end at the conclusion of the 2018 World Cup campaign, but there is a groundswell of support brewing from the technical department for Australia to have competitive games in a tough, unfamiliar environment against some of the world's best football nations.
While the Socceroos have not been invited by CONMEBOL, South America's football confederation, to take part in previous tournaments, there are some who believe the FFA should begin lobbying for Australia's inclusion when heavyweights Argentina and Brazil play a friendly game in Melbourne in June.
Brazil will stay in Victoria for another friendly against Australia before the Socceroos take part in the Confederations Cup, at which they will play South American champions Chile. Some within the national team are hoping the FFA can be persuaded to use the opportunity to put forward Australia's case for nomination.
Should that happen, it would be an extension of South America's growing football relationship with Asia, with the continental heavyweights having invited Japan to compete in previous Copa Americas, as well as China, who declined to be part of the 2015 tournament due to a clash of fixtures.
It is understood the door is not yet completely shut for Australia to start lobbying for inclusion. There is yet to be a conversation about commercial agreements for competing in the tournament and sources suggest a better understanding of the financial implications of playing in it could yet pique the interest of the FFA.
Google has been named ahead of Apple as the world's most valuable brand, according to a new survey.
Apple's brand value fell by 20pc in the past year to just under $148bn (£88bn), conceding the spot it held for three years to Google, whose value increased by 40pc to $159bn, according to Millward Brown's BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking.
Google's investment in its self-driving cars project, Google Glass and numerous Android partnerships, including its forthcoming line of smartwatches, resulted in $15.4bn of revenue in the last financial quarter and profits of $3.45bn .
Technology brands dominated the top positions, with the fastest pace of growth in brand value.
Facebook's brand value rose 68pc to around $36bn, putting it 21st in the rankings, while Chinese internet portal Tencent is now worth just over $53bn - a significant 97pc rise on last year and taking it up 7 places to 14th.
Growth at Samsung, Yahoo and Siemens' growth was more restrained, at 21pc, 44pc and 36pc respectively.
New entries to the ranking include Twitter, worth $14bn and LinkedIn, with a value of $12bn. They were ranked 71st and 78th respectively.
Peter Walshe, Global BrandZ Director at Millward Brown, said: “Digital service brands such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Tencent and LinkedIn are now more than just tools, they have become part of our lives.
"They offer new forms of communication that absorb people's attention and imagination, while also helping them organise the rest of their lives at the same time. To gain more of our mind-space brands such as Google are making ambitious plays across existing category boundaries.”
Jeff Jarrett is out as Global Force Wrestling's Chief Creative Officer, and the move has the potential to have a wide-reaching impact within the professional wrestling industry.
GFW released a statement that Jarrett needed to focus on personal issues. When asked for clarification on Jarrett's status, GFW's parent company, Anthem Sports and Entertainment, declined comment.
Jarrett's exit creates an entire realm of possibilities for GFW, which, up until 2017, was known as TNA Impact Wrestling.
GFW is hemorrhaging funds, and sources close to the situation have confirmed that Anthem is ready to withdraw itself from the wrestling industry and sell GFW. Anthem even needed to gut the Fight Network in order to finance GFW.
Another wrinkle to the story is that Jarrett still owns the name of Global Force Wrestling, so Anthem would be selling Impact Wrestling.
Yet, despite the entire ordeal, wrestling is all about commodities, and Anthem has a worthwhile commodity if it decides to sell GFW/Impact primarily due to its tape library.
WWE tops the list of potential suitors, as the tape library is extremely valuable. A number of WWE's top stars, including AJ Styles, Samoa Joe, and Bobby Roode, as well as Raw GM Kurt Angle, all produced some incredibly compelling work in TNA. If the company were ever to pursue Ring of Honor's Jay Lethal, he also has entertaining work from TNA with his Randy Savage-inspired “Black Machismo” character, as well as his Ric Flair impersonation.
If WWE decides to purchase GFW/Impact, the Hardys stand to benefit most. WWE would then own the “Broken Universe” intellectual property, and “Broken” Matt and Brother Nero would mesmerize WWE audiences with their “Broken Brilliance”.
A key part of any potential deal is the presence of John “Big” Gaburick, who is still a part of the GFW creative team. Gaburick is extremely close with Kevin Dunn, who is WWE's Executive Vice President of Television Production.
Anthem could also consider selling to Ring of Honor or even open up discussions with former TNA investor and Smashing Pumpkins icon Billy Corgan, but Jarrett's exit opens the door for WWE to make Anthem an offer it cannot refuse.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Islamists moved to impose sharia law in northern Mali after helping Tuareg separatists seize key towns, ransacking bars and banning Western-style clothes and music, residents said on Monday.

A lightning 72-hour advance by rebels over the weekend, which exploited the chaotic aftermath of a military coup in the distant capital, is the latest threat to stability in West Africa, whose leaders met for crisis talks in Senegal.
Coup leaders agreed on Sunday to prepare to hand power back to civilians after neighbouring states threatened to shut the land-locked country's borders.
Residents in the ancient trading post of Timbuktu said local Ansar Dine Islamists, who alongside Tuareg separatists seized the town on Sunday, had declared they were in control of the former Saharan tourist draw and would impose Islamic law.
A Reuters reporter in the northern city of Gao, seized by rebels on Saturday, said Islamists there were ransacking bars and hotels serving alcohol. In Kidal, the third main town of the region, one resident told Reuters music had been barred from radio stations and Western-style clothes had been banned.
“Ansar Dine people have entered the town and they are saying that they are now in control,” a tourist guide in Timbuktu, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals, told Reuters.
“They have said they will institute sharia law. I heard that four youths caught destroying and looting Mali energy company property will be beheaded,” he added. The report could not be independently verified.
In Gao, 300 km (200 miles) further east, food, fuel and medical supplies were starting to run out, threatening to aggravate the humanitarian plight that worsened with fighting that began in mid-January in a region already hard hit by last year's failed rains.
Oxfam said more than 200,000 Malians had been displaced since January.
“Half of these people have fled to neighbouring countries, and they are in urgent need of food, water, sanitation and shelter,” the aid agency said in a statement, warning that further waves of displacement were possible.
“JUST BUYING TIME”
West African leaders meeting in the Senegalese capital Dakar for the swearing-in of Senegal's new president were due to decide whether to follow through on a threat of sanctions after coup leaders pledged on Sunday to return power to civilians.
A deadline set by West African bloc ECOWAS for the junta to begin ceding power expired overnight.
One ECOWAS official doubted the junta would keep its word.
“Captain Amadou Sanogo and his group are just buying time,” Remi Ajibewa, head of political affairs and international cooperation at ECOWAS, said of the coup leader's pledge to reinstate the constitution and all state institutions before holding an election.
“They have not set out any timetable to hand over power to a democratically elected government in Mali,” he told Reuters.
ECOWAS threatened to close borders, isolate Mali diplomatically and freeze funding from the regional central bank. However there was no sign on Monday of moves to implement the measures.
Last month's coup, weeks before President Amadou Toumani Toure was due to step down for elections, shattered the international reputation of stability and democracy that Africa's No. 3 gold producer had previously enjoyed.
The push by rebels, whose ranks were swelled by fighters returning from the Libyan conflict, has also deepened insecurity across the Sahara-Sahel band, already awash with Islamists, traffickers and bandits. France and Britain have advised their citizens to leave the country due to the insecurity.
Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who heads ECOWAS, said he spoke to Mali's junta chief on Sunday to thank him for the pledge to restore constitutional order but did not indicate if the move had been enough to ward off regional isolation.
The threat of sanctions underlines how seriously Mali's neighbours take a coup which they fear could trigger similar attempts in their own countries which have been blighted by decades of civil war and power grabs.
Hama Ag Mahmoud of the rebel group MNLA's political wing, said it did not plan to push further south.
“Our aim today is not to go beyond the borders of Azawad,” he told Reuters of the territory, bigger than France, where the group aims to carve out a separate state.
“We don't want to give anyone the impression that we are war-mongers so, once we have freed the areas we target, the job is done,” he added.
Ag Mahmoud rejected any MNLA rebel links with Islamist groups but witnesses in Kidal and Gao reported signs of Islamist fighters having collaborated with the MNLA in the advance.
With Clinton leading handily in polls of the presidential race, vulnerable Republicans are increasingly leaning on the argument that voters should return them to Congress in order to retain the GOP control of both chambers and provide a firewall against the Democrat's policy aims, which they deem too liberal for the country.

Pelosi said such language is coded, suggesting that a Republican-controlled Congress might even try to impeach Clinton.
"So what does 'checks and balances' mean? It's a euphemism for obstruction," Pelosi told reporters at the White House Wednesday.
"But when it became apparent that he was not going to win, the Republicans started talking about checks and balances," she said.
"And you know what that translated into? Impeachment of the president of the United States," she said, referring to Bill Clinton.
"It certainly looks increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton is going to win this presidential election," Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said in an interview Wednesday with PennLive.
"Do we in Pennsylvania want to have a rubber stamp for Hillary Clinton, and maybe a Senate's that a rubber stamp for Hillary Clinton ... or do we want a senator that's demonstrated independence?"

This is the moment furious passengers unite to deal with a man allegedly abusing foreign visitors on a tram in Manchester.
Video footage shows a man, in a grey hoodie and blue jeans, being confronted about his behaviour.
Witnesses told the Manchester Evening News he told a Spanish couple to ‘speak English', and to ‘go back to their own country'.
On the recording we hear one fellow passenger tackle the man about his comments, before the man replies with a question about his challenger's ethnicity and sexual orientation.
The man, who is not seen in the recording, replies that he is gay and asks why that should make any difference.

Another Good Samaritan is captured on camera also helping to stand up for the Spaniards by telling the man that he will call the police if he ‘carries on being racist'.

He says: “It is unacceptable in this country and this day and age. I think everyone else on this tram would agree.
“It is not on.”
And after being tackled on his outbursts, the man remains silent.
(Image: Manchester Evening News)
The footage was captured by Manchester resident Jose, who is originally from Peru but moved to the country three years ago to study for an MBA at Manchester University .
He says he wanted to share it to show how amazing the people of Manchester are because they stood up to the man.
Jose, who did not wish to give his full name, said: “The couple were speaking Spanish and this guy was saying ‘speak English'.
“They said they would speak in whatever language they wanted and so he said ‘go back to your own country', it was disgusting. He was being very abusive.
“But the reaction from the people on the tram was amazing, for them to stand up to him and tell him it was not on.
“You would only get a reaction like that in England, in fact I was speaking to the Spanish guy that had been attacked and he said that to me. He said that no one would have bothered to help someone in that way other than in Britain.
“As soon as he was challenged the guy just shut up and didn't say anything else. Hopefully he will think twice about being like that in the future – and know that people in Manchester won't put up with it.”
Vaccinations have begun in a multi-site Phase 2/2b clinical trial testing an experimental DNA vaccine designed to protect against disease caused by Zika infection. The vaccine was developed by government scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIAID is leading the trial, which aims to enroll at least 2,490 healthy participants in areas of confirmed or potential active mosquito-transmitted Zika infection, including the continental United States and Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico. The two-part trial, called VRC 705, further evaluates the vaccine's safety and ability to stimulate an immune response in participants, and assesses the optimal dose for administration. It also will attempt to determine if the vaccine can effectively prevent disease caused by Zika infection.
Most people with Zika infection have either no or only mild symptoms, such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis (red eyes). However, when Zika infection occurs during pregnancy, the pregnant woman can pass the virus to her fetus, which can result in a range of fetal defects known collectively as congenital Zika syndrome. Currently there is no licensed vaccine to prevent disease caused by Zika infection, which is mainly transmitted via the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but also can be transmitted sexually.
“We are pleased to have advanced rapidly one of NIAID's experimental Zika vaccines into this next stage of testing in volunteers. We expect this study will yield valuable insight into the vaccine's safety and ability to prevent disease caused by Zika infection,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “A safe and effective Zika vaccine is urgently needed to prevent the often-devastating birth defects that can result from Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Evidence also is accumulating that Zika can cause a variety of health problems in adults as well. This trial marks a significant milestone in our efforts to develop countermeasures for a pandemic in progress.”
Scientists at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) developed the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine. It entered early-stage human testing in 2016 following extensive testing in animal models. Initial findings indicate the vaccine is safe and able to induce a neutralizing antibody response against Zika virus. The Phase 2/2b trial aims to gain more safety and immune response data and determine if this immune response protects against disease caused by natural Zika infection.
The Zika vaccine platform is based on a strategy VRC scientists used previously to develop a West Nile virus vaccine candidate. The Zika vaccine candidate being tested in this study contains a small circular piece of DNA called a plasmid into which scientists have inserted genes that encode two proteins found on the surface of the Zika virus. Once injected into muscle, the encoded proteins assemble into particles that mimic Zika virus and trigger the body's immune system to respond. The vaccine does not contain infectious material, so it cannot cause Zika infection.
The trial is being led by protocol co-chairs Julie E. Ledgerwood, D.O., chief of VRC's Clinical Trials Program, and Grace L. Chen, M.D., deputy chief of the same program.
The trial consists of two studies: part A and part B. Part A will build on ongoing Phase 1 trials to further evaluate the vaccine's safety and ability to stimulate an immune response, specifically in populations where Zika could be endemic. It will also help determine the optimal dose and injection sites for administration. Part A will enroll 90 healthy men and non-pregnant women ages 18-35 years at three sites in Houston, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All participants will receive the investigational vaccine intramuscularly at three separate clinic visits each four weeks apart. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a standard dose or a high dose of the investigational vaccine at all three visits, and will be followed for about 32 weeks total.
Part B of the trial will enroll at least 2,400 healthy men and non-pregnant women ages 15-35 years. This part of the trial aims to determine if the vaccine can effectively protect against Zika related disease when someone is naturally exposed to the virus. Sites will include the three locations from part A (Houston, Miami and San Juan) as well as two additional sites in San Juan, two sites in Costa Rica, and one site each in Peru, Brazil, Panama and Mexico. Additional sites might be added in the future. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine or a placebo at three separate clinic visits each four weeks apart. The trial is double-blind, meaning neither the study investigators nor the participants will know who receives the investigational vaccine.
Part B participants will be followed for nearly two years, during which time they will undergo assessments for adverse events and symptoms of Zika infection. Trial participants in both parts will be counseled on how to protect against Zika infection. Investigators will compare the rates of confirmed cases of Zika in the placebo group and the vaccinated group to determine if the investigational vaccine protects against disease caused by Zika infection.
Each site will have a principal investigator responsible for ensuring daily review of safety data as they become available. A protocol safety review team that includes the protocol chairs and other medical officers at NIAID will review safety data reports weekly. The NIAID Intramural Data and Safety Monitoring Board will also review cumulative study data at least twice per year. The study is currently expected to be completed by 2019.
In hindsight, the clues were there. The adjectives gave it away. Utah's returning senior starting quarterback and senior captain Troy Williams' performance during the preseason was “fine” in the eyes of the coaching staff, but true sophomore Tyler Huntley's athleticism made him “electric.”
Despite the subtle hints and the fact that the Utes quarterback competition remained an open competition through more than three weeks of preseason camp, Monday's announcement that Huntley won the starting quarterback job still came as the most surprising news of the preseason.
“I feel like I could go out there, make a lot of plays, help us win a lot of games,” Williams said following the team's intrasquad scrimmage on Aug. 12. “We have big expectations this year. Of course, everybody is sleeping on us. That's not nothing new, but we know what we have here. I feel like I could go out there, especially with the offense we have now, and make a lot of plays and just open a lot of eyes.”
Huntley described his relationship with Williams as “best of friends” at the start of camp. The two quarterbacks roomed together on road trips. Now, the two will reverse rolls. Huntley served as Williams' backup last season as Williams started all 13 games. Williams now takes on the backup role, while graduate transfer Cooper Bateman will be third on the depth chart.
Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune Utah Utes quarterback Tyler Huntley (1) runs the ball during a scrimmage at Rice-Eccles Stadium Saturday March 25, 2017.
Huntley has adapted well to first-year offensive coordinator Troy Taylor's offense. Huntley and former high school teammates Zack Moss, the projected starter at running back, and Demari Simpkins, one of the contenders to start at wide receiver, have all said Taylor's offense more closely resembles the offensive system they all thrived in at Hallandale High School in Florida.
“I see more things clearly now,” Huntley said during camp. “The game slowed down a lot for me, and it just feels good to be out there and know what I'm doing.”
Huntley by all accounts seemed more confident this preseason. He cited a full year in the program, his increased dedication to film, a better grasp of the speed of the game as well as being more comfortable with the playbook as reasons.
“It's more of a playbook where we just go out there and make the plays,” Huntley said. “The plays are there. You've just got to make them. I think everybody is comfortable in making those plays.”
Last week, the Utes selected the 6-foot-2, 208-pound Williams a team captain for the second consecutive season. However, the Utah staff seemed to become enamored with Huntley's athleticism and the strides he made under Taylor.
TYLER HUNTLEY
Height: 6-foot-1
Weight:190
Class: Sophomore
Age: 19
Position:Quarterback
A potential playmaker: Huntley completed 5 of 7 passes for 60 yards without a touchdown or an interception as a true freshman last season for the Utes. He also rushed nine times for 15 yards and a touchdown. He rushed for 23 yards and one touchdown in the Utes' win over Indiana in the Foster Farms Bowl, and he also completed a season-long 36-yard pass in that game. … Huntley entered the program in he winter of 2016 coming off of winning the 2015 Florida Gatorade Player of the Year award at Hallandale High School. In four years as a starter, he passed for 9,053 yards and 106 touchdowns and posted a 34-10 record. He led Hallandale to the 5A regional finals for the first time in school history as a senior.

“From the spring until now, he's almost a different guy,” Taylor said last week of Huntley.
Huntley, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound former Florida High School Gatorade Player of the Year, played in four games as a true freshman. He attempted just seven passes (5-for-7, 60 yards). Huntley played a key role in the Foster Farms Bowl victory over Indiana to end the season. He rushed for 23 yards and one touchdown and also completed his only pass attempt for 36 yards.
“The thing that's most evident is decision making in terms of I think he had a tendency to force the game a little bit because he's so athletic,” Taylor said. “In the spring, [he tried to] make every play a big play. You've got learn when you're athletic and you're competitive that sometimes you've got to throw the ball away and live to play another down, and he's done a much better job of that. Accuracy, understanding the system [have improved]. Obviously, as you have more success you become more confident and when your confidence is high, you play well.”
The Utes went 9-4 last season and averaged 216.7 yards per game passing with Williams guiding the conference's 10th-ranked offense in pass efficiency.
This offseason, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham hired Taylor, the architect of a record-setting high school offense at Folsom High in California which produced University of Washington star quarterback Jake Browning. Taylor spent last season as the co-offensive coordinator for Eastern Washington. EWU led the FCS in passing yards per game (401) and ranked third in pass efficiency as well as scoring (42.4).
Alan Keyes once again appeared on Stan Solomon's talk show, this time to discuss their stringent opposition to marriage equality.
After host, Steve Davis, claimed that just because they “oppose homosexual marriage or homosexual adoptions, it doesn't mean that we're homophobes,” Solomon insisted that he is indeed a homophobe.
“Speak for yourself,” Solomon said, “I can't stand the thought, the idea, the concept of homosexuality.”
“I don't think I'm showing love for anyone if I encourage them or enable them or stand silently while they do something that's going to kill them; the average homosexual lives half the adult life of the average heterosexual, fact,” Solomon maintained, as he went on to comparing homosexuality to drug abuse, drunk driving and swimming with sharks.
Keyes, who kicked his daughter out of his house after she came out of the closet, agreed with Solomon's anti-gay statements.
Later, Keyes attacked Sen. Rob Portman's for endorsing marriage equality after learning that his son is gay: “If you go down a road that satisfies your personal predilections and relationships and sacrifices the common good of the country, including the elementary institution by which civilization is sustained, then you're not only derelict in your public duty, you are abandoning your obligation as a human being.”
“Frankly, people throw around words like ‘crime against humanity,' I think that kind of disregard for the God-endowed natural rights of human being is the archetype of all crimes against humanity,” Keyes concluded, “and I think we have an entire elite faction that is now committed to committing such a crime against the American people.”
Watch:
Not only has goon Robert Mueller wasted millions of tax payer dollars on his Trump witch hunt, his so-called “team” that's supposed to be apolitical and independent sure has donated a lot of money to the Democrats. Here is a short list of Mueller team members who have donated to Democrats, which includes one person who has donated an astounding $30,000!
Look how much Mueller witch hunt team members donated to Democrats
Mueller team members include:
James Quarles who have donated $30,000 to the DNC.
Jeannie Rhee has donated $9,150 to the DNC.
Andrew Weissmann has donated $4,300 to the DNC.
Greg Andres has donated $3,700 to the DNC.
Andrew Goldstein has donated $3,300 to the DNC.
Elizabeth Prelogar has donated has $500 to the DNC.
Brandon Van Grack has donated $486.77 to DNC.
Rush Atkinson has donated $200 to the DNC.
This is course just a preliminary list of Mueller goons who have donated to the Democrats. There are plenty of other Mueller goons who thus far have remained anonymous to hide their connections to Hillary Clinton and the DNC. This is completely unacceptable for an apolitical investigation.

I got on the bus for my last day of class this semester, and after taking a seat I could tell something was wrong. The amount of moisture on my ass was accumulating at a rate I wasn't comfortable with. I got up and saw my seat was soaked with something and so were the backside of my jeans. If I got off the bus, went home, and changed pants I'd miss my final, so I was stuck with whatever was on my butt. I switched seats and gazed out the window while telling myself that after riding taking public transport this long, I'm lucky this is the first time I've become one of it's casualties.
“Yep, someone's piss is on my ass,” I thought to myself. I'd seen a lot of people on the bus that look capable of urinating themselves, after all. Then I started to think about the diseases the person who indirectly peed on me might have: a STD, hepatitis, rabies? I wondered if those things could infect me through my ass pores, or maybe crawl up my butt hole.
I got to school around 15 minutes later and went to the bathroom to figure out what the liquid was. I was relieved to figure out it was just alcohol. Instead of my ass being covered in pee, it just smelt like the breath of someone who lives outside.
I went to class, and did my best to hide my butt smell. The smell was too strong, though. The people sitting next to me had to notice. I can only imagine they were like “Wow, did Chris get an enema of Colt 45 before class?”
Needless to say, I was stoked that I managed to hide from my classmates all semester that my ass is an alcoholic.

GRAND JUNCTION, Colo.—Colorado National Monument officials planned to use a crane to remove a van teetering on a rock outcropping at the Western Colorado landmark.
The 260-ton crane was expected to pluck the van off the rock Thursday.
Authorities say 34-year-old Daniel John Lyons of Clifton drove the van about 120 feet off Rim Rock Drive in an apparent suicide attempt Jan. 21. He called 911 when the van got hung up on the rock.
It took two hours for emergency crews to stabilize the van and rescue Lyons. He was taken to a hospital, then released Saturday and booked into the Mesa County jail on suspicion of felonies including sexual assault on a child.
It wasn't clear if Lyons had an attorney. The jail did not immediately return a call.
Llandeilo was the first in Wales to become a Transition town A number of west Wales towns are looking to launch their own currency in a bid to boost local businesses. The idea has come from the Transition Towns movement, which aims to make towns self-sustaining, to encourage people to spend their money locally. Backers are hoping to start in the scheme in Llandeilo, Llandovery and Lampeter. The currency could only be used in participating businesses which would continue to use sterling as well. Llandeilo became Wales's first transition town last year although others have since joined. Local currency schemes are already running in other communities including Totnes in Devon and in America with Lampeter the first planned in Wales. The idea is a sound one and it's been working well in other communities
Rhiannon Rowley of Transition Towns Llandeilo said: "There's a serious side to something that may look quirky. "What we are seeking to do is relocalise and a local currency is an extremely good way of doing it." She said the plans were very much in their early stages but they hoped to launch before the end of the year. A set amount of local currency would be printed - which would have a value to linked to sterling. Businesses would be encouraged to sign up to accept it and display window stickers where it could be spent. The scheme in Totnes in Devon was expanded last year following what organisers say was a successful pilot. "The idea is a sound one and it's been working well in other communities so there is no reason why it won't in these towns in Wales," added Ms Rowley. The transition towns movement was set-up to make communities self-sustaining in response to climate change and rising oil prices. Shopping locally is quite fashionable thing to do
Helen Humprhys, Llandeilo clothes shop owner They focus on sustainability through renewable energy, allotments, farming and local businesses. "We are a group of like minded communities across Wales and across the rest of the UK," added Ms Rowley. "It's developing differently in different areas - it's a real grass roots movement." Joy Daniel, an assistant at a Llandeilo delicatessen, said: "It sounds a bit complicated but OK in principle. 'Old fashioned' "It would need a lot of work in the consultation - we'd want to know how it's worked elsewhere and what the feedback is from other people. "All traders will have to be involved in the consultation." Helen Humprhys, clothes shop owner and joint secretary of Llandeilo chamber of trade said it would rely on all shops and businesses taking part but it had appeal. "Shopping locally is quite fashionable thing to do," she said. "Doing something that's taking us back to our roots, being more organic and helping each other out is old fashioned and a lovely way of living."

Kerala Congress MLA M Vincent has been arrested for allegedly raping a woman. (File)
Highlights M Vincent, charged for rape, arrested in Thiruvananthapuram Denies allegations, says being framed under a conspiracy Woman had attempted suicide, is hospitalised
A Congress legislator from Kerala has been arrested on the charge of raping a 51-year-old woman, who attempted suicide after she was allegedly harassed by him, police said. He was arrested from Thiruvananthapuram.A case had been registered against the MLA on charges of abetment of suicide, following a complaint from the woman who had attempted suicide at Balaramapuram, police had said yesterday."A case under IPC section 376 has been registered against Congress MLA M Vincent representing the Kovalam segment, after the woman's statement was recorded at a hospital in Neyyatinkara, where she is undergoing treatment", Kollam City Police Commissioner Ajeetha Begum had said yesterday.A magistrate has recorded the victim's statement at the hospital, she said.The woman's husband had alleged that the MLA used to repeatedly call her over phone and harass her.However, Mr Vincent had termed the charges as "baseless" and said he would face the probe. "The charges are without any facts," Mr Vincent said. Speaking to NDTV, he claimed the allegations were part of a conspiracy against him.

U.S. Marines enter McKenzie Arena for a memorial for the five military servicemen killed in the July, 16, attacks on two military facilities held Saturday, Aug. 15, 2015, in Chattanooga, Tenn. Vice President Joseph Biden and Secretary of Defense Ash Carter spoke along with representatives from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. U.S. Marines enter McKenzie Arena for a memorial...

The U.S. Marines will not arm recruiters in the wake of the July 16 attack in Chattanooga that killed five service members, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command public affairs office confirmed Wednesday.
Lt. Gen. Mark Brilakis, the top general at the Marine Corp. Recruiting Command, told The Marine Corps Times on Tuesday that officials have ruled out arming recruiters but will implement other safety measures.
The debate about whether military recruiters should be armed started hours after a lone gunman attacked two military sites in Chattanooga and killed four Marines and a U.S. Navy specialist. The gunman, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, opened fire on several military recruiting officers in a strip mall near Highway 153, then attacked a second site on Amnicola Highway a few minutes away.
After the attack, some state and national officials argued that recruiters and other military personnel stationed on U.S. soil should begin carrying weapons. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam temporarily ordered National Guard recruiters out of strip malls and into armories, and governors in a handful of other states ordered that National Guard recruiters be armed.
Some citizens even took it upon themselves to bring guns and stand guard outside military recruiting centers like the one attacked in Chattanooga, prompting the Pentagon to ask that they stop.
Currently, Department of Defense regulations prohibit most service members from being armed on U.S. soil, including most personnel at reserves and recruiting centers.
The Marine Corps Recruiting Command's decision not to arm recruiters only applies to Marine recruiters, and does not impact other branches of the military or Marines on reserves.

Gov. Jerry Brown discusses a proposal to reduce California's prison population, at a Capitol news conference in Sacramento, Calif., Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2013. In response to a federal court order to reduce the state's prison population, Brown announced a $315 million plan to send thousands of inmates to private prisons and to empty county jail cells to avoid what he and his supporters say would be a mass release of dangerous felons. Brown was joined by legislative leaders, including Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles, left, and representatives of law enforcement, local government officials, and victims rights advocates. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)
California has built 23 prisons since 1980. In the same period, the University of California system has opened one new campus. And although California's prison population has declined in recent years, the state's spending per prisoner has increased five times faster than its spending per K-12 student in the last two decades.
California has more than 130,000 prisoners, a huge increase from the state's 1980 prison population of about 25,000. Prisons cost California taxpayers close to $10 billion, compared with $604 million in 1980. While some say the additional spending is needed for rehabilitation services, they also note that the prisons are draining scarce funds from education and other key areas.
This week, Californians who hope to see the state scale down its prison spending were dismayed to learn that Gov. Jerry Brown (D) wants to further expand the prison system, spending an additional $700 million on prisons over the next two years. Brown is trying to comply with a federal court order to reduce prison overcrowding by the end of this year: Despite the 21 new prisons built since 1980, construction hasn't kept pace with the growth of the inmate population, and California's prison system is one of the most crowded in the country.
But Brown's fellow Democrats in the state Senate have thrown their support behind an alternate plan. The rival approach, proposed by Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, calls for the state to invest $200 million a year on counseling programs and other services aimed at keeping low-level drug offenders out of jail. To succeed, it will need to gain the approval of the panel of federal judges who ordered California to resolve the overcrowding problem in the first place, and it's not at all clear that the judges will play along.
But if they do, the state could ultimately save millions in prison costs, Steinberg says.
Brown's approach, by contrast, is an "expensive Band-Aid on a hemorrhage," Steinberg said in statement Wednesday.
Brown is widely perceived as a strong supporter of public education, and he has introduced prison reforms that have helped bring down the state's inmate count by about 25,000 since 2011.
But criminal-justice advocates say that the prison system is still way too big -- and costly. And unless the state invests more in teaching people the skills they need to get by, they say, it isn't likely to get a whole lot smaller.
UPDATE: Jeffrey Callison, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, stresses in an email that the governor's plan to increase prison capacity is temporary.
"The Governor has made it very clear in public on numerous occasions that he wants California to spend less money on incarcerating people," he writes. "His plan will secure enough time for the state to work on longer-term criminal justice reforms to bring down the population in the long term."
Environmentalist activists and wealthy donors have been quietly meeting behind the scenes to further the narrative that ExxonMobil “is a corrupt institution” as part of a massive campaign to “delegitimize” the oil giant, according to leaked documents.
Activists say they want to expose the entire fossil fuel industry as part of a massive plot to cover-up global warming, but a leaked email of a “draft” meeting schedule from January shows a single-minded campaign to make Exxon public enemy number one.
Environmentalists' closed-door meeting show they want to “establish in the public's mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution” and to “delegitimize them as a political actor” and “drive Exxon & climate into center of 2016 election,” according to the leaked draft agenda obtained by The Washington Free Beacon.
The meeting agenda also talked about “the main avenues for legal actions & related campaigns,” to attack Exxon, according to the Free Beacon, including state and federal prosecution.
“Which of these has the best prospects for successful action? For getting discovery? For creating scandal?” the memo reads.
Kenny Bruno, one of the activists on the leaked email chain who has been in the business of attacking Exxon for years, probably laid out the group's intentions best when he recently tweeted:
I don't want to abolish Exxon. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub. — Kenny Bruno (@greenwashbuster) March 30, 2016
Indeed, the January meeting of environmentalists was called “Exxon: Revelations & Opportunities” and included a session on the “Goals of an Exxon campaign.”
The meeting was held in Manhattan at the headquarters of the Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF) — one of the wealthy foundations that funded left-wing reporters to investigate Exxon. RFF's funding has resulted in a series of articles claiming Exxon was misleading the public on global warming.
Attorneys general have used the reporting as a basis for investigations into Exxon's activities and how they represented the risks of global warming to their shareholders. Democratic lawmakers have used the reporting to call for the Department of Justice to prosecute the oil company under an anti-mafia law.
The Wall Street Journal first broke the news of the environmentalists' meeting Wednesday in an article about Exxon taking legal action to block a subpoena issued by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Claude Walker, the Virgin Islands AG, also subpoenaed records going back 20 years from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that's opposed overreaching environmental regulations and employs policy experts skeptical of claims of catastrophic man-made global warming.
“CEI has long been public enemy number one to the global warming alarmist industry, which knows that it can't win an open public debate on the merits of their anti-energy, anti-people agenda,” Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at CEI, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
“The subpoena we received today is just the latest round in a campaign of harassment and intimidation begun in 2006 designed to win the debate by silencing and destroying CEI and other non-profit groups that rely on sound science to speak truth to power,” he continued. “They will continue to threaten us, but we will not give up defending freedom and prosperity.”

Statement Regarding Confido
TokenLot Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 20, 2017
Dear Crypto Community,
This morning we awoke to the unfortunate news that the team behind Confido has seemingly pulled an exit scam. All internet accounts related to Joost (CEO of Confido) have been deleted. Our lines of communication with the Confido have also been closed. Unfortunately, we do not have much more information regarding the situation, outside of what has already been made public.
TokenLot was hired by Confido to host their crowdsale and escrow the funds collected. The terms of our contract require all ICOs listed on our platform to show proof of token creation and distribution of tokens to investors, before the release of ETH collected during the ICO. On November 7, Confido demonstrated all evidence needed for the release of funds from escrow.
We have reviewed all previous emails and conversations to try and find any clues that might lead us to the actual people behind this scam. Fortunately, we have stumbled across one very positive lead. Blockchain analysis shows that the ETH that was collected and transferred to Confido, ended up being sent to an account with Bittrex.com. We have been in contact with Bittrex Management and they have confirmed that the account the ETH was sent too is an account where Enhanced KYC Verification was authenticated. Additionally, we are also in contact with KuCoin and gathering all intel we have for Joost and the possible team behind Confido.
Unfortunately, Bittrex's privacy policy requires a law enforcement request to release customer information, so we can't get any more information at the moment. We are currently in the process of filing a report with the FBI to help rectify this situation.

A Daytona Beach Police Department vehicle burns after it was targeted by an unknown assailant on Sunday morning. (Daytona Beach Police Department)
The Daytona Beach Police Department is reviewing surveillance footage that shows a person moving around a police cruiser minutes before the car burst into flames early Sunday morning.
The vehicle, which was parked outside a mosque, was severely damaged by the flames, Police Chief Mike Chitwood told The Washington Post.
Chitwood said investigators at the scene found an anti-police note implicating Black Lives Matter, but they haven't concluded that the vandalism was carried out by anyone associated with the largely peaceful civil rights movement.
This note was recovered at the scene of the fire. But investigators aren't sure who wrote it. (Daytona Beach Police Department)
“BLACK LIVES MATTER,” reads the note. “A. Sterling P. Castile,” it says, in reference to Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, black men who were killed by police in Baton Rouge and Minnesota earlier this month.
“F— The Police!!!” the note adds.
A picture of the message shows that it was hand-written on notebook paper using black ink.
Chitwood told The Post that the incident doesn't reflect the relationship between law enforcement and local residents.
“This was the work of an extremist who, for whatever reason, was either motivated by an anti-police sentiment or it was someone trying to cast blame on Black Lives Matter,” he said. “We work really really rally hard with our community and I've gotten a dozen phone calls of support. I know that the overwhelming majority of our community and overwhelming majority of this country support police officers, but there is a group of domestic terrorists who are fanatical and who are willing to give their lives to take other people out.”
Police responded to reports of the fire around 2:30 a.m. Sunday, according to the statement.
Citing a police report, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported that a nearby resident told police he heard sounds of a car door opening before the fire began, while another person told police they heard a window shattering.
By the time authorities arrived, the cruiser — which was unoccupied at the time — was “fully engulfed,” police said.
Chitwood told the News-Journal that the vehicle erupted in flames, suggesting that the fire was ignited by a “Molotov cocktail.”
Nobody was injured in the fire, which caused more than $20,000 in damage to the vehicle.
“The city vehicle was placed at the location on the street as a ghost car,” the statement said.
Chitwood told the News-Journal that the department began parking the vehicle in front of the Islamic Center after last month's mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub.
The goal, he said, was to deter anyone planning to target Muslims.
The department will not replace the damaged vehicle with another cruiser in front of the mosque, Chitwood told the paper.
“We were in bed and I heard a ‘boom' noise,” a resident who lives near the mosque told the News-Journal via email.”It sounded like a window being broken and I thought it could be someone trying to break into my boyfriend's car. So I looked out the window and didn't see anyone near his car then I looked left and saw the police car was on fire.”
The emailer, who wished to remain anonymous, added: “The police car has been parked there since the Orlando shootings. They move it every now and then but it's always empty. My boyfriend called 911 and it took so long before they got there that by the time they did the entire car was covered in fire. It took a bit to get the fire out.”
Police continue to review surveillance video from the area but noted that the state fire marshal will lead the investigation because it appears to be arson. If arrested, Chitwood told the News-Journal, the suspect would most probably face arson charges.
Thus far, police said, they have no suspects or persons of interest in connection with the fire.

Linda Walker says she hates what has happened to her
Watch the interview
Linda Walker awoke in hospital to find her distinctive Newcastle accent had been transformed into a mixture of Jamaican, Canadian and Slovakian.
The 60-year-old may have Foreign Accent Syndrome, where patients speak differently after a brain injury.
The former university administrator says she hates what has happened to her and now feels like a different person.
Mrs Walker said: "My sister-in-law said that I sounded Italian, then my brother said I sounded Slovakian and someone else said I sounded French Canadian.
"But the latest is that I sound Jamaican, I just don't know how to explain it.
"Everybody is obviously hearing me differently.
I've lost my identity, because I never talked like this before. I'm a very different person and it's strange and I don't like it
Linda Walker
"I didn't realise what I sounded like, but then my speech therapist played a tape of me talking. I was just devastated."
Researchers at Oxford University have found that patients with Foreign Accent Syndrome have suffered damage to tiny areas of the brain that affect speech.
The result is often a drawing out or clipping of the vowels that mimic the accent of a particular country, such as Spain or France, even though the sufferer has limited exposure to that accent.
The syndrome was first identified during World War II, when a Norwegian woman suffered shrapnel damage to her brain. She developed a strong German accent, which led to her being ostracised by her community.
Different sounds
Dr Nick Miller, a senior lecturer in speech language science at Newcastle University, said the condition could occur in patients who had suffered a stroke or other brain injury.
He said: "The stroke has affected the coordination between different muscle groups like the lips, tongue and vocal cords.
"The balance has been changed and certain sounds get distorted so vowels and consonants take on different sounds.
"Intonation is also affected so sometimes it will fall at the end of a sentence and sometimes it will rise."
Mrs Walker added: "I've lost my identity, because I never talked like this before. I'm a very different person and it's strange and I don't like it.
"It's very hard and I get very upset in my head, but I'm getting better."
Now that we know a GOP congressional aide misleadingly edited -- intentionally or not -- Obama administration emails on the Benghazi attack, one wonders if he or she will face repercussions. There's some precedent here. Former GOP Rep. Dan Burton used to hold Darrell Issa's job as Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and used it to aggressively go after Bill Clinton on a host of controversies of various degrees of merit, much as Issa is doing now.
In 1998, as Burton was investigating alleged campaign finance violations from Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign, his office released a doctored transcript of an audiotape of a former Clinton aide. Burton's top aide took the blame for the deception and resigned, as the New York Times reported on May 7, 1998:
Advertisement:
The top investigator for the House inquiry into President Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices resigned under pressure today, amid growing bipartisan criticism of his role in releasing edited tapes of Webster L. Hubbell's jailhouse conversations. The aide, David N. Bossie, has been for 18 months the point man and alter ego of the inquiry's chairman, Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who heads the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. But since Mr. Burton released transcripts of some of Mr. Hubbell's prison conversations late last week, the lawmaker has weathered intense attacks by Democrats maintaining that exculpatory information was edited out of the transcripts.
The situation is a good analog for the Benghazi emails in that Republicans made some small alterations to otherwise accurate raw information which fundamentally changed the meaning to advance their political agenda.
The difference is that other Republicans joined Democrats in expressing outrage at the misleading editing 15 years ago. Burton even had to apologize to fellow Republicans after then-Speaker Newt Gingrich said Burton was running the investigation like a "circus."
Today, at least so far, Republicans have been mum on the apparent tampering of White House emails for political gain by one of their own. Of course, it's entirely possible that the GOP staffers who leaked the Benghazi emails made an honest mistake when transcribing emails they were shown in a closed-door briefing with intelligence officials, but no one has come forward with an explanation and a mea culpa.
Meanwhile, Democrats were not satisfied with Bossie's resignation. They noted that Burton himself released the transcript, and they called on the congressman to resign as well. "A committee staff member should not be made the scapegoat for Chairman Burton's mistakes, missteps and misdeeds," then-House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said. Indeed, Burton himself said, "I take responsibility for those mistakes," but never resigned or faced censure.
We still don't know the full story of the edited Benghazi emails, but if someone intentionally fabricated information and then leaked it to reporters, that would seem to undermine the credibility of the entire investigation. Obama has fired someone for less this week.
I asked Bill de Blasio if he thought something fundamental had changed, if nearly two decades of decreasing crime in the city was a permanent improvement. “You can't say anything is irreversible,” de Blasio said. “I think we can say it is structural, however. Meaning, over three different mayors and five or six different police commissioners, we've seen steady progress. And a lot of the tools we have now — Compstat, focused deterrence, gang intervention, some of the technology we have — that's forever, that's not going away … We've made a lot of progress, and I think we can deepen it, if we get the relationship between police and community right again.”
That was last August, when de Blasio was a candidate. Last week Mayor de Blasio got his first big reminder of just how difficult the reality of public safety is, and how much depends not on objective tools but on the judgment of individuals. Eric Garner resisted arrest. Officer Daniel Pantaleo wrapped his right arm around Garner's neck and wrestled him to the ground. The responsibilities aren't equal, but the sum of those two choices was a tragedy — Garner died.
Now the fallout from that Staten Island sidewalk scuffleis testing de Blasio. His relationship with the NYPD is still new and unsettled. Things got off to a bumpy start in February with City Hall's intervention in the arrest of a Brooklyn minister. Many cops welcome de Blasio's de-emphasis of stop-and-frisk — but just as many believe he's anti-cop, based on last year's campaign rhetoric, and the transition to amorphous new tactics has left much of the department off-balance. The enforcement of marijuana laws is a muddle. And the mayor is tangling with the PBA over a new contract, offering no retroactive raises for two of the years it would cover, similar to the deal accepted by other municipal unions. So the tone of de Blasio's reaction to the Garner incident is being closely watched by cops.
The dynamic between de Blasio and his police commissioner, Bill Bratton, is also still in the formative stages. Bratton, in some ways, has a tougher job than he did during his first tour of duty atop One Police Plaza. Instead of the all-out 1990s offensive to break a crime wave, Bratton is trying to keep the numbers low while following de Blasio's mandate to do it with a softer touch. At times the two men seem to be out of synch: Bratton appeared more eager to hire new cops than his boss, and his unabashed love for the Hamptons makes it look like Bratton didn't get the income inequality memo.
Style points won't matter, of course, if Bratton can get the substance right — and de Blasio has a tremendous amount riding on his police commissioner. Achieving the tricky balance between respect for civil rights and vigilant law enforcement frees the mayor to pursue the rest of his agenda. And while the Garner incident is not to be minimized, other, less dramatic events — the spike in shootings, the weekend vandalism spree in Central Park — are worrisome, both to the health of the city and to the mayor's political prospects. The fact that someone scaled the Brooklyn Bridge undetected on de Blasio and Bratton's watch doesn't exactly inspire public confidence, either.
The police commissioner spent Tuesday afternoon on Staten Island meeting with community leaders. That should help dial down emotions. But Bratton's belief in “broken windows” policing is unflinching, which guarantees the debate over its effectiveness will continue when de Blasio returns from his vacation in Italy. Eric Garner's funeral is today, and the issues raised by his death are very much alive.
When I was seventeen or so I was driving home and on the freeway a big truck was passing me. As this hairy creepy dude passed me he winked at me and held up a sign saying “I had a perdy mouth.”
At first this totally creeped me out, then I nearly crashed my car due to uncontrollable laughter. That was the funniest thing I'd seen in a long while.
And you know what…. I do have a perdy mouth. I'll take that as a complement.

‘Where are all the daughters of Buffy?' asks Naomi Alderman in the recent Radio 4 Front Row Special on cult TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. What she is really asking is this: why, after the huge, lasting success of Buffy, aren't there stronger, complex female characters in TV and film? Good question. Where are all these awesome female characters? As Joss Whedon points out, since Buffy much of the similar (supernatural/vampire/superhero) content to flood the airwaves has gone back to the standard male characters (or two males and one female). And when the main female is going to really impact the world around her, they are often far too much like Bella Swan in Twilight (a tool – only made powerful by which boy she chooses) rather than like Buffy.
My encounter with the slayer of the undead
It is true that this show has serious staying power. What other show has such devoted fans so many years later? And constantly getting new ones? I never watched Buffy when it was on TV. It wasn't until I was in University when a friend looked at me in horror, jaw to the floor, ‘What do you mean, you've never seen Buffy?!' did I finally see it. Said friend invited me around for a Buffy marathon one Saturday. We watched the full first season and started on the second (that's right, my friends and I have mad skills when it comes to smashing through TV series). I left her house with a care package – all seven seasons, to be carefully looked after.
I raced through the rest of the seasons (and quickly had my mother joining me on the sofa as I did). Before long, I was at the local DVD store, making an ass of myself as I tried to hold seven stacked seasons between my arms and my chin, only to have them tumble spectacularly to the floor as I reached the checkout. Stupid amounts of money later, I was the proud owner of the full run of Buffy. After I moved out of home, I bought the complete series again for my mother. Everyone needs a little Buffy in their lives.
Re-watching this series regularly seems to be necessary. When I'm ill or just bored and don't know what I feel like doing or watching – what's better than putting on some Buffy?
From an ugly chrysalis to a beautiful butterfly (or something equally cliché)
The series went from receiving below average ratings for much of its run to become a beloved cult show. Buffy first aired in the US on the WB network, starting in the middle of the season as a replacement for a cancelled show. Given that everyone knows of this show, it is funny to think that it had a bit of a rough time during its run. After declining ratings (and a reported ‘negotiation dispute', whatever that means), Buffy moved from the WB to the UPN network for seasons six and seven.
Throughout its run, the critical reception of Buffy was excellent. Although it was nominated for a number of awards, it won few. ‘Hush', from season four, was nominated for an Emmy (despite most of the episode having no dialogue), but didn't win. The much-lauded musical episode, ‘Once More With Feeling', was ‘accidentally' left off the Emmy nomination voting ballots. It did win ‘most memorable moment' for the season five finale, ‘The Gift', however. Buffy herself, aka Sarah Michelle Gellar received several nominations for her portrayal of the titular character, including a Golden Globe, Teen Choice Award, and Nebula Award – but she failed to win. Despite the show's failure to win many awards, it is so widely viewed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time (and appears on many such lists), it has also spawned a number of academic studies.
From writer to geek rock star: Joss Whedon
Joss Whedon had television writing in his blood. His father wrote for the classic show The Golden Girls, while his Grandfather wrote for The Donna Reed Show. His first TV writing gig was for Roseanne back in 1989. In 1992, Twentieth Century Fox produced the film Buffy the Vampire Slayer from Joss's script. The film was a mess (but I still own it on DVD anyway – of course). The studio just didn't get the point. But Joss saw a great opportunity in the character and universe he had imagined, and so he revived it as a TV show. Fox owned the rights, but they passed on the show, so it went to the WB instead.
When Buffy had a fairly quiet first season, I can't imagine anyone would have predicted the superstardom it's creator would eventually rise to. Buffy began airing in 1997. By 1999, it had spawned a spin-off, Angel, one which did significantly better in the ratings (despite being far inferior if you ask me). Also before the end of Buffy, Whedon started another project: the perfect series, Firefly. Firefly would also become a cult classic, despite being cut short before even a full season, running for only 14 episodes. Since the end of Buffy we have been privy to many Whedon projects (although not as many as we perhaps should have had): Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Dollhouse, The Cabin in the Woods, The Avengers, and Much Ado About Nothing.
I'm not sure there's any other TV/Film writer and creator that gets fans as excited as Joss Whedon. He's become a kind of geek god, a philosopher by which we live our lives. He's a feminist and activist. He's amazingly talented. And hey, he totally stands up for us weirdos. How could we not worship the ground he walks on?! Best of all, he's admittedly a fanboy himself. He is one of us! He gets it! Which is why he did such an awesome job with The Avengers, and why he deserves all the love he gets from his fandom.
But why is Buffy so good? The techy stuff
Language and dialogue
There are a lot of reasons that Buffy is so damn good – but here I'm going to look at the purely technical aspects: the writing, mostly.
Let's start with the simplest thing of all: the language. What is Buffy most remembered for? Well, that is arguable, I suppose, but something at the top of most people's list is the ‘Buffy Speak' (also known as ‘Whedonspeak'). There's even a featurette on the language in the show on the season three DVD release. According to TV Tropes, Buffy Speak ‘can give the sense of a teenaged group's special jargon or argot without necessarily imitating anything actually found in the real world'. In the Front Row special, Joss discusses his intention behind the language used in Buffy – he was trying not to directly ape teenager's language, as it moved too quickly. Instead, by writing in a way that created a kind of fluid language, he could make it feel real (plausible), and possibly even have real teenagers aping the Buffy Speak.
Whedon's dialogue is some of the best in the business. He just gets it, you know? Part of this comes from the Buffy Speak, while the rest of it is an ability to capture what people really do tend to talk about (and to do this in a world that is completely out of the normal bounds of reality). His dialogue uses references, it isn't always ‘to the point' (i.e. people usually don't just talk specifically for a reason, sometimes they just say shit), and it is always indicative of the character who is saying it. It can be funny, serious, heart-warming, and terrifying. Whatever it is meant to be, or to achieve in the story, it manages to do without ever jeopardizing the suspension of disbelief in the viewer.
Monster of the week to the ‘Big Bad'
Buffy was one of the first shows to understand where the medium could go (for people who were not just casual viewers). It took a show that could have been a simple monster of the week show into one with growth and great story arcs. These story arcs took the form, generally speaking, of the ‘Big Bad'. In each season, there would be one main antagonist. There would continue to be monster of the week type episodes throughout the season, but the story would also be building to a major fight with the ‘Big Bad' for the end of the season. This mixture of the small with the big meant that the fights could mean more and allowed for greater character growth for the main characters.
Not only did this allow for great character growth within the protagonists, it also meant that as viewers, we actually gave a damn about the villains as well. These were not your everyday super villains – no moustache twirling, motivation-less, general ‘evil for the sake of being evil' – these baddies were characters in their own right. Many of them were even likeable. Ok, so we were always still rooting for Buffy, but we also loved the bad guys. This is particularly evident in the bad guys who came back as regular characters, such as Spike, Drusilla, and Andrew, as well as the innovative approach of making bad guys out of main protagonists. Wait, what?! Yeah, he screwed with our minds there. Angel was good then bad then good again? And Willow? I might be getting caught up in my fangirlishness here, but, like, that was totally amazeballs.
Tone is everything
We have this peppy, pretty little blonde who is a ninja badass. It was a little bit ridiculous at times, right? She had to fight vampires while keeping up with her homework and trying out for the cheerleading squad. The story was often dark, but at the end of the day, these were teenagers. Teenagers who worried about boys and being cool. The show always knew what it was and was never afraid to mix the silly with the dark. Thank god it did. One of my favourite examples of this is from the season three episode ‘Helpless':
Angel: ‘Cause I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to see. And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe… to warm it with my own.
Buffy: That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross.
Angel: I was just thinking that, too.
The show had the potential to be very dark, with little relief. But what fun would that be? I mean, isn't that what Twilight is – seriously, why doesn't anyone in that story have a sense of goddamn humour?! M*A*S*H understood this – amongst even the darkest of times, humans have to find humour. Without humour, we don't really have anything.
The perfect ending: ‘Yeah, Buffy? What are we gonna do now?'
Most shows outstay their welcome. By the time they end, no one cares anymore. But that wasn't Joss's style. Buffy ended brilliantly. It had a proper conclusion. The fans got some closure. There was a reason it ended there and it rocked. And what an ending! Sunnydale is completely destroyed, there couldn't possibly be any more Buffy – at least not in the guise we were used to seeing it. Not only that, Buffy shared her powers with women all over the world. So what began as a single badass petite blonde, turned into a world full of empowered women. If that doesn't send an awesome feminist message, what does?
The world has continued on in the form of comics – some of which have gone a little bit crazy, but it is always fun to continue learning about characters we all know and love. But I am glad that the show ended when it did. Too often, shows simply fizzle out. But Buffy ended with just the right amount of bang.
So where are all the other Buffy's?
Naomi Alderman is right to ask where the other awesome shows with badass female protagonists are. There is a distinct lack of them. But why? The fact that Buffy has never disappeared from the modern zeitgeist is evidence enough that there is a big audience for this kind of story, and yet we keep being told ‘oh, the fans of SFF are generally male, and they don't want to see stories about women.' Ah, what? Most of the men I know who like SFF love seeing hot women kick ass. Duh! And I'm sorry, but I'm a woman, with a lot of female friends, who all love this stuff – and want to see more of it. So here I am, along with a huge Whedon fandom out there, asking the TV gods to make more shows like Buffy. Please?!
The US is a Knuckle-dragging, Low Grade Moronic Culture – George Galloway
By John Robles
This is John Robles, you are listening to an interview with George Galloway, a member of the British Parliament.
Download audio file
Part 1
Part 2
Mr. Galloway was candid on his assessment of Saudi Arabia which he called a "gangster state" with Prince Bandar acting as chief capo who delivers severed horse's heads into the bed of whomsoever they wish to intimidate. As for Ukraine Mr. Galloway put the situation into stark perspective by saying: "Can you imagine what would happen if President Putin went to the streets of Toronto on street demonstrations whipping up anti-American feeling, in neighboring country. And yet this is precisely what is happening on the front line in Kiev now," he added; again President Putin has again played a masterful diplomatic game. As for declining US hegemony he stated: "… they are losing and losing and losing. … they are losing because their power is waning, because hard power is waning, their financial power is defunct and their soft power, their cultural power is virtually non-existent. Anyone who takes a look at John McCain and thinks that that is a cultural soft power icon to desire, to head towards, would need their head examined. This is knuckle-dragging, low grade moronic culture," he stated.
December 29, 2013 " Information Clearing House - Robles: Another country that, I just want to add to your list, was Saudi Arabia when Prince Bandar threatened terrorist attacks on the Olympic Games in Sochi. Russia would have had every right to just wipe it off the map.
Galloway: Well, Saudi Arabia is a gangster state and Bandar is increasingly the chief capo. He is the man who goes around delivering the severed horse's headinto the bed of whomsoever they wish to intimidate.
They try bribery first of all and then they try browbeating, and finally they are ready to bully through the use of their surrogate auxiliary terrorist army.
And they found that President Putin could be neither bribed nor bullied, and he was sent away with a flea in his ear. But he was very lucky; it was only a flea in his ear. Frankly if he'd tried it with me he'd have gone home without an ear.
Robles: Yeah, I mean, you don't threaten a nuclear superpower, I'm sorry, the West can say whatever they want but Russia is still a nuclear power. You don't tell a president: "We are going to unleash Al Qaeda; we control your Chechen terrorists". What about Scotland? You are Scottish, yes, sir?
Galloway: Yes, I am, yes.
Robles: What about Scottish independence? Do you think that will happen? How is it going?
Galloway: I don't think it will happen and I don't want it to happen. I'm against the breakup of states. This small country has been one country for more than 300 years. We speak the same language, we have a common language, a common culture, a common economic situation and once upon a time, if only briefly, we did some good things in the world, particularly in 1940 and 1941 when we stood alone against Fascist barbarism,and we didn't ask the people who did so whether they were Scottish or whether they were English.
And I just think that working people divided are always weakened, working people together will be stronger. So, I was against the breakup of Yugoslavia, I was against the breakup of the USSR, I can hardly be in favor of the breakup of this small country.
Robles: Ok. Can you give us your opinion of sovereignty in the EU with regard to, for example, Ukraine and how much do countries lose in terms of sovereignty in your opinion when they join the EU?
Galloway: Before I answer that, let me just make this point. Can you imagine what would happen if President Putin went to the streets of Toronto on street demonstrations whipping up anti-American feeling, in neighboring country. And yet this is precisely what is happening on the front line in Kiev now. European and North American politicians are on the streets of Russia's neighboring country whipping up anti-Russian feeling. But it seems to me, maybe I'm wrong - you will know better than I - but it's running out of steam.
Again President Putin with his economic arrangements that he has now made with the President of Ukraine has again played a masterful diplomatic game. And the European Union, virtually bankrupt, is not in a position to match what Russia can do to help Ukraine in this terrible economic situation that it is in.
But to answer your point, the European Union is a good idea in principle. It has stopped the countries of the west of Europe in the first instance, from attacking each other, and murdering each other in their millions, which they did from 1870 until 1945, three times at least. And that is a good thing.
It is a good thing if working people in the European continent, not only within the boundaries of the European Union but throughout the European continent, can reach a common agreement on social policy, on environmental issues, on issues of social security and even common defense. There is nothing wrong with any of these things.
But the European Union is utterly dysfunctional when it comes to the manner in which it is run and the free market banking principles on which it is based.
We have a Reganite-Thatcherite European Central Bank which sets monetary and fiscal policy for the Franco-German center and not for the periphery even of Western Europe, never mind Central and Eastern Europe as they become more often members of the European Union.
So it is a very dysfunctional organization, it is broke and it ought to fix its own problems rather than sticking its nose into the problems of Ukraine and Ukraine's relationship with Russia.
Robles: I see. And by extension – NATO, what is your opinion about NATO and their expansion?
Galloway: Well, NATO is an imperial war machine; its name is increasingly of course a misnomer. The North Atlantic has been stretched as a geographical definition as far as the desserts of North Africa. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is circling both Russia and China with bases and nuclear armed warships and airplanes and so on. And it is the greatest danger to peace and security in the world.
And one of the many reasons why I find the call for Scottish independence implausible is that the Independence Party plans on making the independent Scotland a member of NATO which makes a mockery of its professed intention to be rid of nuclear weapons. You cannot be rid of nuclear weapons whilst joining a nuclear armed club.
Robles: Do you see NATO weakening or just growing and growing beyond all control?
Galloway: No, no, they are definitely weakening. The high point of the American Empire has passed as the high point of the British Empire before it passed.
Power is passing to the East, to China, to Russia and to other rising countries in the East and the South. I wouldn't say as Chairman Mao said 30 years or 40 years, prematurely, that the United States was a paper tiger, but it is definitely an aging tiger whose teeth are beginning to fall out.
Robles: I see. Very well put, thank you sir - brilliant.
Galloway: Thank you.
Robles: If I could last, very last point and then I'll let you go: Ukraine, right; Syria, we think Ukraine it was like revenge for their loss in Syria, right? Now if they lose in Ukraine what is the next hot spot going to be in your opinion?
Galloway: Well, the thing is they are losing and losing and losing. Now that might make them more angry but it doesn't make them more able to win. They are losing because they are losing, they are losing because their power is waning, because hard power is waning, their financial power is defunct and their soft power, their "cultural power" is virtually non-existent.
Anyone who takes a look and a listen to John McCain and thinks that that is a cultural soft power icon to desire, to head towards, would need their head examined. This is knuckle-dragging, low grade moronic culture. And I don't think that the great people of Ukraine or in many other places are attracted to the soft power of the United States. The United States doesnot have the financial and economic wherewithal to make it worth their while.
So people are increasingly looking to themselves I hope, and looking elsewhere to other rising powers in the world. And let's hope that in the next year and the next decade we have a number of great powers in the world.
Mercifully we have emerged intact from the very dangerous twenty years in which the United States was the sole superpower in the world, we escaped that and we must never allow ourselves to endure that trial again.
Robles: I see. Can we finish up with your film? Can you give us a few details maybe plug it if you want to, tell us where can we go.I understand, your film its very unique in that it's being funded by the people.
Galloway: Yes, the Killing of Tony Blair began on Kickstarter , which is a crowd-funding mechanism. We asked for £50,000 and we got £160,000. And the money is still coming in, it can't come in now by Kickstarter but you can still support us through PayPal, you can go to theblairdoc.com .
You can follow us on Twitter at the @TheBlairDoc . There are many many ways, if you forget any of those, just go to George Galloway MP on Facebook or follow me @George Galloway on Twitter and I'll put you in the right direction. The film should be out next autumn, and it is coming to a cinema near you.
Robles: OK. I'm sure it will be very popular in Russia; hopefully we can get a Russian version.
Galloway: I hope so. Thanks very much indeed, John.
Robles: Ok, thank you, sir, it was an honor and a pleasure, and thanks for your time.
Galloway: My pleasure, my pleasure, thanks, bye.
Robles: Ok, bye-bye.

TEL AVIV – The organizers of Wednesday's International Women's Strike, which includes a convicted Palestinian terrorist, have expressed their support for the “decolonization of Palestine” and said they are against the “white supremacists in the current government.”
“Against the open white supremacists in the current government and the far-right and anti-Semites they have given confidence to, we stand for an uncompromising anti-racist and anti-colonial feminism,” the platform published on their website.
“This means that movements such as Black Lives Matter, the struggle against police brutality and mass incarceration, the demand for open borders and for immigrant rights and for the decolonization of Palestine are for us the beating heart of this new feminist movement. We want to dismantle all walls, from prison walls to border walls, from Mexico to Palestine.”
One of the march's co-organizers is Rasmea Odeh, a former member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group. Odeh was arrested for her alleged involvement in two bombings in the late 1960s. Two Israeli university students were killed and nine more were injured.
In 1980, Odeh was freed from an Israeli jail as part of a prisoner exchange deal, and a decade later emigrated to the U.S. She recently made headlines again after being charged with immigration fraud for lying about her terrorist background when applying for U.S. citizenship.
In an oped published by the Guardian last month entitled, “Women of America: we're going on strike. Join us so Trump will see our power,” Odeh and her cohorts urged the mobilization of women – including trans women – to strike against “attacks on Muslim and migrant women, on women of color and working and unemployed women, on lesbian, gender nonconforming and trans women.”
Odeh has also been invited to deliver an address at the upcoming National Member Meeting for Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP). The leftwing organization said it was “honored to feature the deeply respected Palestinian … feminist leader,” and added that the accusations against her “stem from a context of long-standing anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim persecution by both the Israeli state and the United States, policies which are escalating under the Trump administration.” JVP added that that her label as a terrorist is a concoction of “Israeli apartheid.”
At the JVP summit, Odeh will speak alongside Linda Sarsour, the anti-Israel Palestinian-American activist who made headlines for becoming the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against Trump's executive order on immigration.
In the true spirit of online activism, the entire Italian Wikipedia website has voluntarily taken itself down in order to protest a bill being proposed to Parliament. The law (“DDL intercettazioni,” roughly translated as Wiretapping Act) would require every website to publish within 48 hours a correction or comment relating to any content an applicant has deemed “detrimental to their image,” as they put it. If that sounds vague, broad, and onerous, that's because it is.
If this law were passed, Wikipedia and other websites would have to post unedited and unsolicited “corrections” to any content deemed objectionable by any person. This content would have to be displayed without any review of the offending content or the “correction.” It doesn't take an expert to see that this law is contrary to the principles of truth and openness.
In case it isn't clear, let me just sketch out an example. Say a government official was facing charges of soliciting a prostitute. If this were to be reported on a news website, or written into his page on Wikipedia, he or someone representing him would be able to submit a “correction” that would be required by law to be displayed alongside that information within 48 hours, regardless of what it says or the truthfulness of the allegations.
There are already slander and defamation protection laws on the books, and this part of the law (which seems to have very little to do with wiretapping) seems to simply be a present to the highly visible and frequently-criticized class of people comprising politicians, celebrities, and so on.
To be specific (without getting too deep into it; I am not versed in the subtleties of Italian politics), the law is seen as a tool for people like Italy's infamously newsworthy Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The many salacious charges against him would be required by law to be paired with any official commentary from the PM, his office, or his lawyers. If the
Wikipedia is careful to point out that the whole point of their service is to provide a free, comprehensive, and neutral encyclopedia that is open to input from all parties. This law would eliminate the neutrality of the resource they have worked to create, and so the users of Wikipedia.it has opted to remove it entirely:
Dear reader, at this time, the Italian language Wikipedia may be no longer able to continue providing the service that over the years was useful to you, and that you expected to have right now. As things stand, the page you want still exists and is only hidden, but the risk is that soon we will be forced to actually delete it.
Wikipedia is, of course, actually based here in the US and foreign versions and communities are managed locally to some extent. The takedown of the Italian Wikipedia was not suggested or carried out by the Wikimedia Foundation, but they have written a short blog post in support of the effort:
The Wikimedia Foundation stands with our volunteers in Italy who are challenging the recently drafted “DDL intercettazioni” (or Wiretapping Bill) bill in Italy. This bill would hinder the work of projects like Wikipedia: open, volunteer-driven, and collaborative spaces dedicated to sharing high-quality knowledge, not to mention the ability for all users of the internet to engage in democratic, free speech opportunities.
I hope that the Wikipedians, as they are apparently called, here in the US would be able to take the same step, though I also hope it will never prove necessary. Personally I support this peaceful yet forceful demonstration of internet activism, and I'm sure many of our readers do as well.
Update: It seems the law has been amended to apply only to “official” press outlets. A dubious distinction. Also, the fine would reportedly be an outrageous 12,000 euros.
Get to acceptance, and then plan accordingly. The comments by lawyers on the Facebook page reflect understandable grief, fear, anger and shock. What they often do not reflect is acceptance of what is coming. Lawyers need to accept this new reality— and quick —before they can figure out the most effective way to utilize their talents.
Here is a truth that will be especially hard for lawyers to swallow: there is no legal strategy that can stop Trump.
To be sure, lawyers and organizations like the ACLU (full disclosure: my part-time employer) will fight and win righteous victories against some of Trump's unconstitutional and illegal initiatives. But it is foolhardy to think that a war against autocracy is going to be won solely in courtrooms. Lawyers will be able to delay, mitigate and in some cases reverse Trump Administration policies, but these lawsuits are akin to forward defenses. We should expect most will eventually be overrun unless there is support coming from behind. Standing alone, and not fully integrated into a broader popular movement, these legal wins will ultimately prove to be hollow victories if democratic norms and institutions are crumbling around them.
What can stop autocracy is bodies in the streets and small “d” democracy. For example, there are going to be precious few legal or legislative strategies to stop the Trump Administration from trying to dump every last fossilized molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere. But campaign-driven protests and direct action — think Standing Rock and DAPL — are some of the best, maybe only, tools in the toolbox.
So if you're presented with 100,000 enthusiastic lawyers who want to know how they can help, approach the question from this perspective: lawsuits alone aren't going to win this thing, but providing legal support to vulnerable communities under attack, existing grassroots campaigns, and protesters putting their bodies on the line just might.
Think small. No, even smaller. Creating yet another national legal organization is simply not where the immediate or long term needs are. There are already dozens of visionary legal organizations working across the universe of issues likely to be under assault by a Trump Administration. Those organizations have spent decades building up infrastructure, hiring talented staff, and developing bold strategic thinking that makes them well suited for precisely this moment. If you're a lawyer with resources, support them. But don't duplicate them.
Where lawyers will be direly in need over the next four years is in the local community. Your Black Lives Matter chapter probably does not have a lawyer to consult with on a regular basis. Your local mosque is probably in the same spot. Your town's small immigration bar may be wizards at delaying removal orders, but they are not in a position to monkeywrench the deportation machine by tying up the local detention center in lawsuits over the conditions of confinement. Your local environmental activists may be heroically ready to put their bodies between a drill bit and the earth, but they need to know they'll be lawyers ready to get help get them out of jail (or keep them in jail, depending on the strategy).
Large national legal organizations will be effective at fighting the big battles, but they have neither the bandwidth nor expertise to provide the type of on-the-ground legal assistance that catalyzes critical movement building. Lawyers working at the community level are also singularly valuable for forging trusting relationships between local groups, and then connecting them with larger legal organizations when opportunities for impact litigation arise.
There are also long-term strategic reasons to think small. One of the things that sets the United States apart from a country like, say, Russia, is that federal control is far less monolithic and power much more decentralized. Much of what a Trump administration may seek to do will be almost impossible without the acquiescence or cooperation of local and state leaders. Strengthening networks and communities at the local level is not just where we are working by default given the bleak outlook at the federal level. It's also a critical part of defending against and ultimately rolling back a Trump agenda.
Lawyer Up for Social Justice, and take a back seat. Finally, let's be clear about what we should be aiming to build here. There are many complicated reasons for Trump's ascension, but creating another national organization of professional elites who are dictating policy priorities among themselves is simply going to reinforce a dynamic that got us here in the first place.
Whiteboard brainstorming from a SURJ meeting (taken from SURJ's website).
A better path is illuminated by groups like Showing Up for Racial Justice that are dedicated to harnessing white privilege in order to fight alongside people of color for justice and accountability. Being a lawyer is also a form of privilege. Treat it that way. Rather than spending time and money creating a new organization that run by lawyers that largely parallels existing groups, lawyers should be out canvassing their communities and asking how they can best weaponize their privilege to support the existing priorities of the grassroots movements that will ultimately win the day.

I'm going to start off by posting an excerpt from a fellow blogger who writes in the United Kingdom. Her name is Elisabeth Svanholmer and the title of her blog is “Beyond Meds: Alternative to .” The title of this particular post is “ to be with ourselves: a response to Psychosis.”
I'm posting this excerpt first because I want you as the reader to form your own opinion. I don't want to you with my response to Ms. Svanholmer's writing.
“So when I hear and feel things that scare me I grab my instrument of reason and analysis and I beat the experience into a shape I can understand. I turn to my arsenal of boxes and shove that voice, this sensation or overwhelming emotion into the box that looks the best fit. And I will get some peace for a while. I am on top of things again. I am in charge of my inner life. The explanations and the coping strategies offer me a sense of power and control. I may even be less afraid; I gain some self- that I will be able to handle my experiences in future. I have got my boxes ready.
But some of my experiences completely refuse to be defined by me. They scream as if I am hurting them by trying to explain them. They will change shape, size and content to elude my grasp on them. They just want to be as they are, whatever they are without my intellectual interference. They don't want my kindness or my empathy. They are just life expressing itself through me and me trying to make sense of them is almost like me putting a knife to my mind and then exclaiming ‘ah see it was a cut all along'.”
You can read the entire post of “Learning to be with ourselves: a response to Understanding Psychosis” here.
Understanding Psychosis is a report that was published in the United Kingdom about the experience of psychosis and its various aspects. I have read it and found it to be interesting and I found it to contain different and open ways of thinking. You can read the entire report here. I suggest you be prepared to devote a substantial amount of time to it or read it in chunks as it is over one hundred pages.
When I was in the hospital for the second time last year following my attempt, in April of 2014, I experienced psychotic symptoms. They were delusions, beliefs about situations that I believed in some respect to be true. They were not. For me, they were incredibly frightening and distressing. I didn't tell the nurses or the doctor for several days after they first surfaced.
At the time I wasn't on any because the head of the unit I to which I was admitted, which was dedicated to , believed that my was more characterological rather than pure symptom-based. When the psychotic symptoms developed I kept hoping for an anti-psychotic medication to help relieve the delusions for they were torture. I wasn't enough to ask for one though and the psychiatrist didn't offer one.
I believe the doctors felt that the psychosis was a symptom of the borderline disorder (BPD) which it can be. This is the last criteria of BPD as stated in the booklet “Borderline Personality Disorder” from the National Institute of Mental : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“Having -related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside the body, or losing touch with reality.”
I remember that it was freezing cold in my room and I wanted to stay in there and all day because I was very depressed and , and it was easier to stay in my room (I had a single room) rather than being up and about on the unit with all the other patients and all the noise. There was a grate in my room where the cold air was blasting from and I believed that the staff on the unit had told the maintenance workers in the basement to turn the cold air on full force and direct it only into my room to freeze me out because they didn't want me isolating in there.
To combat this delusion I retrieved three or four blankets from the laundry cart at the end of the hall and put on sweat pants, two sweatshirts, two pairs of socks and huddled under the covers trying to nap, crying myself to sleep because I was so convinced that everyone was against me.
The odd thing, and later my outpatient psychiatrist and therapist Dr. Adena (not her real name), commented on this with some wonderment and also some disbelief, is that there was some glint of light in my brain, a sliver that was aware that these were delusions and I was psychotic. In my clinical mind I had diagnosed myself as major depressive disorder with psychotic features. That was the diagnosis that first came to mind, and that was in fact the diagnosis that was eventually given to me when I left the hospital and was finally prescribed an anti-psychotic medication.
The website PsychCentral states that those with psychotic depression can be aware of their psychosis. In an article titled “Psychotic Depression” by National Institute of Mental Health, it states that “…those with psychotic depression are usually aware that these thoughts aren't true. They may be ashamed or embarrassed and try to hide them, sometimes making this variation difficult to diagnose.”
From: http://psychcentral.com/lib/psychotic-depression/
So when the resident (this was a teaching hospital) in an interview, several days later inquired if I was experiencing any psychotic symptoms, I hesitated, out of and tugged at my sleeve. She asked me about my hesitation and I paused again. Gently she encouraged me to speak and I was able to tell her that yes, I was deep in the throes of psychosis. But I was not able to ask her for medication.
I remained embarrassed by these psychotic symptoms for a long time and told no one, not even my brother. I didn't want anyone to know that I had experienced them and I didn't want anyone to know that I was taking Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication.
Reading Ms. Svanholmer's post caused me to rethink my shame and my reluctance to be forthcoming. I encourage you to read it in full. Reading the report Understanding Psychosis also gave me pause. For the first time I came to view psychotic thoughts as neither good nor bad, just something to be experienced and interpreted as I chose. For me, this is a novel approach. For over a year I lived with the that I needed to hide my experience with delusions from the world. Now I am thinking differently.
I have been on the same dose of Risperdal for a year. Dr. Adena has asked me to think about lowering it slightly. I've kept putting her off because I was scared that the delusions would return. Now I think that I'm ready and I intend to discuss it with her at our next session. It's been her contention that it was the stress and experience of the depression that caused the delusions and now since that situation has been resolved, I don't need to be on such a high dose of the Risperdal, if at all.
One step at a time.

EDIT
OK, with my wife out on a trip, I have some time to catch up on my review chores. In this wonderful episode, you are treated to the measurements of the Schiit Modi 2. This guy retails for $99 which fit the budget nicely.It uses the Analog Devices AD 5547 DAC silicon. This is an older DAC (circa 2012) and quite pricey at some $20. The say it is the same chip used as in their Bifrost DAC.: that was a mistake. The DAC chip uses is from AKM: AK4490EQ. See later posts.Some of you may recall me having a poor experience with one of their $400 DACs a few years ago showing one of the worst correlated jitter measurements I have ever made. And my son could readily hear his computer activity through that DAC. Performance that lives to their name nicely.So it was with some ambivalent that I entered this test. Would this be a repeat of that incident or decent performance? Well, you decide.Before we get into the measurements, let me say that I went through hell getting this unit working with its drivers. They would throw an obscure error and nothing I tried worked. So I gave it to my son who quickly discovered that there is a toggle switch on the back. If you don't set it to "E" for expert, it will refuse to install its drivers! Cotton picking son of $#&^^%. Why not say that in the driver install package??? Wasted so much of my time. Anyway, these tests are with those drivers installed.As always, the weapon of choice is the 24-bit/48 Khz J-Test signal. This is a 12 Khz tone with a bit toggling. Ideally you should see a single sharp spike at that frequency and nothing else. Here is how the Schiit Modi 2 did as compared to my reference, iFi iDAC2 ($350):Oh man. We get a whole bunch of deterministic jitter in the form of those spikes which run at 1 Khz and other frequencies. In addition to that, we have random jitter almost occupying the entire audio spectrum widening the "skirt" in our 12 Khz tone.But the story does not end there. I ran it a second time and got different results! My son and I played with different CPU profiles on the computer connected to it (different from my measurement computer) and they all impacted the output of this DAC!!!Notice how the skirt shape changes and so does the amplitude of all the deterministic spikes. This shows clear lack of isolation from computer/USB bus.Either they don't measure their DACs, don't care or don't know how to design a clean DAC. Yes, -85 db distortion products is not likely audible and hence the reason they get away with such poor performance. But the engineer in me wants to throw up on it. Let the no-name Chinese vendors produce this stuff.Actually that might be an insult to Chinese vendors because this is what I got for the Origen+ DAC See how whistle clean it is compared to the Schiit at the same price point?I sure hope their higher priced stuff is better because my experience so far indicates anything but that. Please don't buy this DAC.Edit 2: more measurements and data starting here: https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-schiit-modi-2-99.1649/page-6#post-54623 (same conclusions though).Edit 3: late testing shows the Schiit Modi 2 to be highly sensitive to USB power: https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.1829/page-2#post-46217 This means that depending on what PC you plug it into, you will get different output! It may be worse than mine or better. Really bad form to not filter USB power better prior to use inside the DAC.As always, I welcome comments and corrections.EDIT: See the hardware teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/hardware-teardown-of-schiit-modi-2.2082/ EDIT: See additional measurements showing PC sensitivity here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...eview-schiit-modi-2-99.1649/page-8#post-57395
North Stonington - Asa Palmer came upon an upsetting sight Saturday morning in a field of his family's dairy farm.
Angel, his nearly year-old Ayrshire heifer, had her jaw shot off sometime late Friday or early Saturday. When Palmer found her, her tongue was so swollen that she couldn't swallow. By the time she was put down Monday, the red-and-white calf hadn't eaten or had any water since Friday.
"I would rather they had shot it dead," said Palmer, 18. "It was horrible to see her like that, it was awful."
David Abely, a North Stonington resident state trooper, said Wednesday that arrest warrants are in the works for the suspects in the shooting. The suspects also wounded a second cow standing in the Palmers' field on Pendleton Hill Road. The second cow, a Holstein, was hit in the ear, and the bullet lodged near its spine, Palmer said.
"There's gonna be a bullet in the back of that cow for life," Palmer said. "They can't get it out; the vet says it would do more harm than good."
Charges will include cruelty to animals, Abely said.
Palmer said three "kids known for causing trouble in town" are the prime suspects. They apparently used a rifle to shoot from the road at a group of 12 cows in the field, he said. Neighbors reported two gunshots, a pause, and then three more, Palmer said, sometime in the early morning hours Saturday.
"I wish I could tell you why they did it," said Palmer, a senior at Wheeler High School. "I've never done anything to whoever did it, and neither did Angel."
Palmer's father and uncle own Palmer Farm, a North Stonington dairy farm that has about 500 head of cattle, Palmer said. He owns five, now four after Angel's death. The cost for the animal alone, Palmer said, is about $800 to $1,000. If Angel had lived, she would have produced milk and calves, he said, generating income that is now lost.
"It's a lot," he said.
In response to the incident, state Rep. Diana Urban, D-North Stonington, announced Wednesday the creation of "The Angel Fund" to raise money for Palmer. Urban said in a news release that she was "sickened and angered" by the shooting, The fund will be set up at Chelsea Groton Bank.
"Asa Palmer is the future of farming in our state," Urban said. "We need to reach out to Asa and his family at this time. This is an opportunity for North Stonington to show our true colors and let Asa know how much we care. I know how hard Asa works and I know how saddened he is by this senseless destructive act. I will be the first person making a donation to help him put his herd back together."
Palmer said he works 25 to 30 hours a week during the school year at the family farm. During the summer, that number reaches 50 or 60 hours, he said. After graduating this June, Palmer said he plans to go to college and major in dairy management. He'll come back to North Stonington to dedicate himself in the family business.
The first order of business, he said, is having those responsible brought to justice for the senseless act.
"There has to be a special place in hell for people like that," Palmer said of the shooting. "They have to just be degenerates."

Force-feeding oneself like a foie gras duck is standard practice in Hollywood: Directors suggest it, casting directors expect it and America fucking loves it. A quick Google search for “actors gaining weight” returns link after link of male Hollywood stars who have destroyed their abs in the name of a career-making role. And while that's rarely the case — only two of the men listed below won Oscars, and one other was nominated—the weight gain is memorable enough that we can recite those who've done it (De Niro, Damon, Bale) as easily as the alphabet.
What's less well-known, however, is how they got there. Until now. As a grand public service, and in honor of MEL's Gluttony Week, we attempted to find out. Try to hold down your breakfast as you scroll through this parade of harrowing, Oscar-baiting overindulgence. You'll never be able to look at a pint of ice cream the same way again.
1. Robert De Niro, as far as we can tell, did it first. That, of course, doesn't count Marlon Brando and Orson Welles, two acting legends who simply grew larger (and larger and larger) with age and not for any specific role. De Niro's 60-pound weight increase to depict aging boxer Jake LaMotta also seemed to spark the idea that such a weighty transformation would result in an Oscar—he took home the Best Actor statue for his performance in the film.

2. Another first: De Niro went from swole to plump in the middle of the shoot, with director Martin Scorsese giving him a few months off to pack on the pounds before resuming production on the film's final scenes. De Niro did so mainly by fleeing to Italy Michael Corleone-style and gorging on pasta. Whatever he ate, it worked. The later scenes were shot with minimal takes because De Niro would tire so quickly. “His breathing was like mine when I have an asthma attack,” Scorsese once remarked.
3. The only other male actor to win an Oscar for a flab-heavy performance is George Clooney. He completely stopped exercising and put on 30 pounds in 30 days for the 2005 film Syriana, thanks to a steady stream of doughnuts and chips. “My job was just to eat as fast as I could, as much as I could,” Clooney told The Tech in 2005. “But mostly you just eat until you want to throw up, and make sure you don't throw up.”

4. Wanting to throw up is the best way to describe the diet Jared Leto employed for the film Chapter 27, in which he played Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's assassin. He microwaved pints of ice cream and mixed the liquid with olive oil and soy sauce that he then shotgunned like a beer at a rush event. (Here's Leto in 2006 telling an adoring crowd how he's gonna go back to Hollywood and “make fat the new skinny.”) “It was a devastating process,” Leto shared in an interview with MTV at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. “There wasn't a single moment of joy for the months that I worked on it. We talked at the beginning about whether I should wear a fat suit or not, but it was really important to me to gain the weight for a few specific reasons. It changed every single thing about who I was as a human being. It changed the way that I walked, it changed the way that I talked, it changed the way I felt about myself and the way people looked at me and treated me.”
5. Equally devastating: The movie bombed. From the unkind half-star review at RogerEbert.com: “You wonder why Jared Leto put on more than 60 pounds to play a character who is nothing but a belly, a haircut and some tinted aviator glasses. Leto is known for being pretty (that's why Ed Norton smashes his face in Fight Club), and he has since gotten another haircut, removed the glasses and the belly, and has reportedly returned to his former state of prettiness, only now with gout as a side effect from all that weight.”
6. It wasn't as bad as what happened to Ryan Gosling, though. He put on 60 pounds for the 2009 Peter Jackson film The Lovely Bones only to be fired when he showed up on set roughly the size of Jackson. (He, too, chugged containers of microwaved ice cream whenever he was “thirsty.”) “Peter Jackson and I had a different idea of how the character should look,” Gosling shared in Hollywood Reporter's annual actors roundtable discussion in 2010. “I was 150 pounds when he hired me and showed up to set 210 pounds. I really believed he should be 210 pounds. [But] I had gotten it wrong. They said, ‘You look terrible.' And I said, ‘I know! Isn't it great?'” It was not. Jackson swapped out Gosling in for human washboard Mark Wahlberg.
7. Yet another ice-cream microwaver? (Everyone's doing it!) Colin Farrell, who gained 40 pounds for The Lobster by eating cheeseburgers, fries and chocolate cake at 10 a.m. “It's not that fun — and I love cheese­burgers,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “Then I would microwave pints of Häagen-Dazs coffee ice cream and drink it for breakfast. I was always a better drinker than an eater so I just applied that rule.”
8. RogerEbert.com liked Fat Farrell way more that Fat Leto. “Colin Farrell gives one of his funniest and (strangely enough, considering the humorlessness of the character) charming performances since In Bruges,” critic Sheila O'Malley wrote. “With his mustache and pot belly and nondescript glasses, Farrell is a completely believable everyman.”
9. Seriously — everyone is microwaving ice creaming now, including this toddler, this YouTube feeder darling and this misbegotten surfer dude (“I was hoping it would explode but instead all it did was melt and bubble everywhere. My final verdict is: super boring”).
10. Matthew McConaughey allegedly gained 45 pounds for his upcoming role in Gold. But when the trailer hit people were mostly struck by his allegedly fake bald head.
11. No one has gone more against type in the annals of supersizing themselves than Sylvester Stallone, who gained 40 pounds for 1997's Copland via pancakes (lots and lots and lots of pancakes). As detailed in Chris Holmlund's book The Ultimate Stallone Reader, Stallone's marathon breakfasts included five pancakes smothered with peanut butter and whipped cream, a bowl of oatmeal, two bagels with more peanut butter, 10 fried eggs, French fries and cheesecake. “For me to gain even 10 pounds was a sacrilege,” Stallone told The Morning Call in 1997. “But I knew I had to get rid of the armament of the action star.”
12. In our opinion it worked. But the film didn't really rescue his career — there were Rocky sequels and Rambo remakes for that. That's too bad, as explained by internet commenter Matthew Finlayson: “I've read online that Stallone complained about the negative impact Copland had on his career. I love to see a well-known actor playing against type. All the more fun if you like action films, too. If only the critics and the public had been more generous, perhaps we'd have had more like Copland, and less dreck like The Expendables.”
13. The Rock kinda did the reverse — eating ridiculous amounts of breakfast and roughly the equivalent of a month's worth of resort buffet offerings — to play the Greek God Hercules in, you guessed it, Hercules. In all, he ate about seven meals a day to layer on another 30 pounds of muscle onto his already-granite frame. His typical daily meal plan? Some combination of filet, egg whites, oatmeal, halibut, chicken, white rice, baked potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, peppers and mushrooms. He shared his despair with his Twitter followers: “As a kid I mixed Frosted Flakes & Golden Grahams every AM. Steak, eggs whites & Cream of Wheat just ain't the same.”
14. He seemed to survive the experience. “A journalist asked me what mental and physical toll the role had on me, and would I do it again? Not only would I do it again. I'd do it fucking twice,” Johnson told Muscle & Fitness in 2014.
15. Matt Damon might have actually been able to compete with The Rock in terms of the volume of food options he used to gain 30 pounds for The Informant! — a menu that rivaled the Cheesecake Factory's in size. A few sample items: Drive-through bacon cheeseburgers and fries, steaks drenched in béarnaise sauce, Doritos, sweet potato pancakes with crème fraîche, fried chicken Caesar salad with extra dressing topped with potato chips. “I definitely got doughy. I started eating like crazy and drinking dark beer,” Damon told the Daily Mail in 2009. “Between meals on set, I'd eat a №1 Value Meal at McDonald's and then Doritos on top of it. It was very, very fun, probably the funnest time I had working.”
16. No matter how fun, it definitely wouldn't have impressed Jennifer Lawrence, who was disappointed to learn that she would be working opposite paunchy, bald Christian Bale in David O. Russell's American Hustle — as opposed to the super handsome Bruce Wayne/Batman version. “I finally get to make out with Christian Bale and he's Fatman, not Batman,” she allegedly told Russell.
17. Not that Bale loved it either. “You do it for two months and your body starts to rebel against you, it's just saying, ‘No, please,' and your back is aching and there are also some problems with that,” he told ABC's On the Red Carpet in 2013.
18. Of course, all of this is just play-acting (and temporary). “Fat actor here,” commented Andy Pandini, responding to a Quora inquiry wondering how casting is handled for roles that call for unattractive or overweight people. “The thing is, being fat is an advantage. It's a clear type, and it opens the door to lots of roles. I tend to play what I like to call ‘slightly failed' people. The benefit of being a morbidly obese type is that my competition is dying off on a daily basis.”
19. He was joking—we think.
The most effective methods of keeping Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes via Chicago's web of waterways could cost up to $18.4 billion and take 25 years to put in place, the federal Army Corps of Engineers concluded in a study released Monday.
But a corps official cautioned in a telephone briefing for journalists that there was no guarantee that the carp or other unwanted species would not get into the lakes by then.
The agency's 210-page study, first ordered by Congress in 2007, laid out eight options to prevent the carp and other unwanted species from entering Lake Michigan, ranging from continuing existing efforts to building barriers that would seal the lake from the five Chicago-area streams that are linked to it.
Either blocking the lakefront waterways or blocking their two sources further inland would offer the greatest protection from invading species, the report said. But both options would prevent barges and other boats from using those routes, and would increase pollution in the lake and the waterways.
When someone mentions a “free office suite”, probably the first name would be the famous LibreOffice. Which is – indeed – one of the best free office suites out there. However, there are a lot of other alternatives which you can try.
OnlyOffice is another cross-platform office suite which offers solutions to create, edit and view many different documents formats. It's free and licensed under the AGPL 3.0 license. Check the code on GitHub.
OnlyOffice provides a lot of different versions targeting different platforms: Cloud, desktop, server and mobile. The desktop and server versions are distributed among two releases: A community edition and an enterprise edition. First one is free and the second one is paid.
There are a lot of featured presentations made by the company behind the project which shows you why it's better than the other available office suites and platforms. You can check them from their official website.
We downloaded the latest version (4.3.2.48) and reviewed the software. This was our experience so far.
OnlyOffice Review On Linux Desktop
After installation, this is the welcoming screen for OnlyOffice. Offering you to craete a free account on the cloud to sync and manage your documents if you want:
There are 3 sub-programs for OnlyOffice: Document, Spreadsheet and Presentation. Clearly, the first one can open a lot of document formats like DOCX, ODT and PDF. While the second one is an alternative for Microsoft Excel. The last one can open presentation files formats like PPTX and ODP.
A list of supported documents formats by OnlyOffice can found here. For spreadsheets formats, check this link. And for presentations, you have those supported formats.
This is the main interface for the documents writer:
We can notice a very simple graphical user interface. One of the main features we liked was the tabs feature you see on top. Instead of opening too many different windows for many documents, you just need one containing your needed tabs. The good thing is that those tabs don't have to be from the same type; You can open PDF, HTML, PPTX and ODT files in the same window as tabs.
Aside from that, the interface is a little bit similar to Microsoft Office. But very much simpler.
You have many options for inserting charts:
If you choose one of them, another window will be opened to allow adjusting values of charts:
This is it running a demo DOCX file. Worked very well. No glitches seen in it:
However, the program doesn't seem to be supporting some other languages (like Arabic, Persian..). It shows undefined symbols in its place:
All the other normal functionalities like inserting tables, images, footnotes, texts and formulas.. All of them exist in OnlyOffice. Also page settings and options (paddings, styles, edges, borders..) are available as well. Just like what any office suite would provide.
This is the spreadsheets program, not very much different from its previous brother:
A lot of functions can be used easily. A list of supported ones are here:
Running an XLSX file doesn't seem buggy here too:
Say hello to presentations processor:
There are 10 different styles for presentations by default. That's a really small number comparing it to Microsoft Office or even LibreOffice. But still not bad to start:
As in other office suites, you can select different hierarchy for each slide:
However, there are a number of different color schemes which you can apply on any template:
Opening a demo PPTX file didn't show any glitches or bugs too:
Those are the general settings for the program. Not very much customizable:
Comparing between LibreOffice and OnlyOffice running the same file shows some difference. OnlyOffice is using around 210 MB of RAM, while LibreOffice uses 115 MB of RAM.
Until now, all the review was about OnlyOffice for Linux desktop. However, OnlyOffice is more than just a desktop program. It also provides server and cloud solutions. You can install OnlyOffice on your server in order to manage and share documents online. You can even use it to mange your email, community and projects (images via onlyoffice.com):
Download OnlyOffice
The latest version of the desktop edition for OnlyOffice can be downloaded from below links. Multiple packages exist for Red Hat & Debian based distributions.
Download OnlyOffice For Linux Desktop
To download the server edition of OnlyOffice (or as a Docker image):
Download OnlyOffice Server
Additionally, OnlyOffice is available as a Snap package.
Conclusion
OnlyOffice is a nice office suite for Linux desktop. It's free and licensed under the AGPL. All their source code (even for community server) is released on their GitHub repository. The software they provide is maintained and being updated from time to time. And can run most of the formats correctly.
Aside from small bugs in some areas and high RAM usage. Nothing really skimmed our experience with OnlyOffice. Also, providing those advanced solutions for servers and cloud is really a nice thing to have. Especially when the code is free.

Summary: Other than the lucrative oil contracts signed, what have we accomplished by intervening in Libya? Good intentions are not enough, especially when the likely consequences are ugly. At some point there will be “a banquet of consequences” for our wars. It might result from our mad policy of overthrowing secular regimes to make way for Islamic fundamentalists, as we've done in Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Libya.
“A hundred years of injustice (Zulm) are better than a day of chaos.”
— Al-Ghazali, the great Islamic theologian and jurist (see Wikipedia)
“You just have not seen enough people bleed to death.”
— A reply by a US geopolitical expert to my cautions about military intervention in Libya.
Let's review the news to see the results so far of our intervention. These are written in the mild, emotionless tone of Americans seeing the problems of far-off people. This is just a brief sample of the news from Libya.
(1) “In Libya, a Fundamentalist War against Moderate Islam Takes Shape“, TIME, 18 January 2012 — Excerpt:
Throughout this country, Libyans are discovering that their hard fought battle to win freedoms is at risk. Puritanical Muslims known as Salafis are applying a rigid form of Islam in more and more communities. They have clamped down on the sale of alcohol and demolished the tombs of saints where many local people worship. The small town of Zuwara near the Tunisian border, dominated by a heterodox Muslim sect despised by the Salafis, is quickly becoming the battlefield for competing visions of Libya's future.
(2) “Libya Struggles to Curb Militias as Chaos Grows“, New York Times, 8 February 2012 — Excerpt:
As the militiamen saw it, they had the best of intentions. They assaulted another militia at a seaside base here this week to rescue a woman who had been abducted. When the guns fell silent, briefly, the scene that unfolded felt as chaotic as Libya's revolution these days — a government whose authority extends no further than its offices, militias whose swagger comes from guns far too plentiful and residents whose patience fades with every volley of gunfire that cracks at night. The woman was soon freed. The base was theirs. And the plunder began. “Nothing gets taken out!” shouted one of the militiamen, trying to enforce order. It did anyway: a box of grenades, rusted heavy machine guns, ammunition belts, grenade launchers, crates of bottled water and an aquarium propped improbably on a moped. Men from a half-dozen militias ferried out the goods, occasionally firing into the air. They fought over looted cars, then shot them up when they did not get their way. “This is destruction!” complained Nouri Ftais, a 51-year-old commander, who offered a rare, unheeded voice of reason. “We're destroying Libya with our bare hands.” The country that witnessed the Arab world's most sweeping revolution is foundering. So is its capital, where a semblance of normality has returned after the chaotic days of the fall of Tripoli last August. But no one would consider a city ordinary where militiamen tortured to death an urbane former diplomat two weeks ago, where hundreds of refugees deemed loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi waited hopelessly in a camp and where a government official acknowledged that “freedom is a problem.” Much about the scene on Wednesday was lamentable, perhaps because the discord was so commonplace. … The woman was soon freed.

Muammar el-Qaddafi waited hopelessly in a camp and where a government official acknowledged that “freedom is a problem.” Much about the scene on Wednesday was lamentable, perhaps because the discord was so commonplace. … The militias are proving to be the scourge of the revolution's aftermath. Though they have dismantled most of their checkpoints in the capital, they remain a force, here and elsewhere. A Human Rights Watch researcher estimated there are 250 separate militias in the coastal city of Misurata, the scene of perhaps the fiercest battle of the revolution. … Bashir Brebesh said the same was true for the militias in Tripoli. On Jan. 19, his 62-year-old father, Omar, a former Libyan diplomat in Paris, was called in for questioning by militiamen from Zintan. The next day, the family found his body at a hospital in Zintan. His nose was broken, as were his ribs. The nails had been pulled from his toes, they said. His skull was fractured, and his body bore signs of burns from cigarettes. The militia told the family that the men responsible had been arrested, an assurance Mr. Brebesh said offered little consolation. “We feel we are alone,” he said. “They're putting themselves as the policeman, as the judge and as the executioner,” said Mr. Brebesh, 32, a neurology resident in Canada, who came home after learning of his father's death. He inhaled deeply. “Did they not have enough dignity to just shoot him in the head?” he asked. “It's so monstrous. Did they enjoy hearing him scream?” The government has acknowledged the torture and detentions, but it admits that the police and Justice Ministry are not up to the task of stopping them. On Tuesday, it sent out a text message on cellphones, pleading for the militias to stop. “People are turning up dead in detention at an alarming rate,” said Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, who was compiling evidence in Libya last month. “If this was happening under any Arab dictatorship, there would be an outcry.”
(3) “Militias Threaten Hopes for New Libya“, Amnesty International, 16 February 2012 — Introduction:
Lawlessness still pervades Libya a year after the outbreak of the uprising which ended 42 year of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Gaddafi's repressive regime. Hundreds of armed militias, widely hailed in Libya as heroes for their role in toppling the former regime, are largely out of control. Their actions, and the refusal of many to disarm or join regular forces, are threatening to destabilize Libya, hinder the much-needed building of accountable state institutions based on the rule of law, and jeopardize the hopes of millions of people who took to the streets a year ago to demand freedom, justice and respect for human rights and dignity.
(4) “A year after uprising, militias hold sway in Libya“, AP, 17 February 2012
One revolutionary militia controls the airport. Others carve up neighborhoods of the Libyan capital into fiefdoms. They clash in the streets, terrifying residents. They hold detainees in makeshift prisons where torture is said to be rampant. As Libya on Friday marks the one-year anniversary of the start of the uprising against Moammar Gadhafi, hundreds of armed militias are the real power on the ground in the country, and the government that took the longtime strongman's place is largely impotent, unable to rein in fighters, rebuild decimated institutions or stop widespread corruption. … As a result, Libya has been flipped upside down, from a country where all power was in the hands of one man, Gadhafi, to one where it has been broken up into hundreds of different hands, each taking its own decisions. The National Transitional Council, which officially rules the country, is struggling to incorporate the militias into the military and police, while trying to get the economy back on its feet and reshape government ministries, courts and other institutions hollowed out under Gadhafi. In one sign of the lack of control, Finance Minister Hassan Zaklam admitted that millions of dollars from Gadhafi family assets returned to Libya by European countries — a potentially key source of revenue — have flowed right back out of Libya, stolen by corrupt officials and smuggled out in suitcases through the ports. “The money comes for transit only,” Zaklam said in a Feb. 6 interview on Libya state TV. He threatened to resign if the government didn't impose control over ports or stop unfreezing the assets. “I can't be a clown,” he said. …The militias, meanwhile, are accused of acting like vigilantes and armed gangs, fighting over turf and taking the law into their own hands. Many run private prisons, detaining criminals, suspected former regime members or simply people who run afoul of the fighters. In a report Wednesday, London-based Amnesty International said it found prisoners had been tortured or abused in all but one of 11 militia-run facilities it visited. Detainees told the group they had been beaten for hours with whips, cables and plastic hoses and given electrical shocks. At least 12 detainees have died since September after torture, it said.

Tonight's episode of "Fringe" will be the final performance for "Star Trek" legend Leonard Nimoy. He was crystal clear on that when he spoke with reporters last week.
"I have announced my retirement," he said. "I will not be doing any more television or movie acting or directing. I can tell you that I feel very fulfilled with the work that was given to me to do in this final episode."
Since the end of last season, Nimoy has been playing the enigmatic character William Bell, the head of Massive Dynamic, a company that has been at the center of much of the plot threads going through the show. Last week, he approached Agent Dunham (Anna Torv) inside the parallel universe where he now lives, and he and the "Fringe" team appear to be headed to a confrontation with the parallel version of Walter, who recently kidnapped Peter.
Nimoy said he really enjoyed working on "Fringe" for his final performance: "I admire all of the people on this show: [actors] Anna Torv, Josh Jackson, and John Noble and all the rest. I had some wonderful scenes to play with John Noble, who I think is a wonderful actor."
Nimoy promises some very intense scenes between himself and Noble in tonight's season finale.
As for "Star Trek," don't expect him to be in any future films, either. "I have said that I think it's time for me to get off the stage and make some room for Zachary Quinto, who is the new Spock and a wonderful actor, looks a lot like me," he told reporters. "And I'm very flattered that the character will be continued by an actor of that caliber. He's very well trained and very talented."
Nimoy is ready to move on full time to his new passion, photography: "I've had 60 years of working in films and television. I'm very grateful for all the great opportunities that I've had and all and the people that I've met, the people I've worked with, the 'Fringe' company; I said on my final day of shooting was as good as any company I've ever worked within the 60 years of my experience."

Sometimes I go out alone in winter, with my dogs, and I'll stay on the ice for weeks at a time. It's tough and you have to be alert. But when you reach a certain level of physical ability, it's like you go to another plane. It's impossible to express, and probably makes no sense to you. In fact there's probably no point me even telling you."
The man questioning my powers of comprehension was Gary Rolfe, a British dog-musher who has been living in a hamlet on Scoresbysund in eastern Greenland since 2007.
"What did you do before this?" I asked. He shared only the scantiest details. "I've had bad times, made mistakes. I'm from the East End, E17, Walthamstow, and I'm 45 and a half."
He grinned, then added: "Out on the ice, when it's dark, I feel – I know – there are Inuit who have never met Westerners, who wear fur and skins, and live as they have always done. A lot of people here believe the same. They call them the 'little people'."
Right then I felt like a little person myself. I'm 45 and a half, too, live in south-west London and was not alone on the ice cap, but sharing a centrally heated cruise ship with 100 wealthy, mainly pension-age people. The combination of three gourmet meals a day and limited activity – mellow hikes, dinghy rides, trips to the sauna – was only going to lift one thing to another plane: my midriff.
I watched Gary feed seal blubber and meat to his lively pack of beautiful huskies, chatted a while longer and sloped off to the Zodiacs.
I had boarded the Akademik Sergey Vavilov in Reykjavik. This was my third voyage in subpolar seas, and on each cruise I had sailed, by fluke, on the same sturdy Russian ship. I didn't need a recce to find my cabin, the lifeboats or the restaurant, so I went straight on deck to watch Reykjavik retreat.
Greenland was, in my mind, an enigma. I couldn't say why I wanted to go there, but it had something to do with emptiness, the tabula rasa of a white, continent-sized island. Everything else about the cruise seemed peripheral. I wasn't sure what I expected or if, seeing it for real, the Arctic would come alive more than it does in heroic narratives and geography lessons.
To get us into the mindset for Nordic landscapes, the ship first sailed south and east to enter the narrow harbour of Heimaey in the Westman Islands. A mere volcanic hiccup off the south coast of Iceland, it is home to 4,500 people, clustered together as if in fear of the weather, or the magma. It was chucking it down but, conscious that this was a rare opportunity to stretch my legs, I disembarked. From the top of a hill I could see new parts of the island that had erupted out of the sea in 1973, and a road up to a volcanic memorial park, where homes had been buried under lumps of lava.
As night fell, we set off across the Denmark Strait. The swell grew and the wind howled for a full night and day, while I settled into life on board: I read, dined, made friends and adapted to the rhythms of the sea and 18 hours of daylight.
On the second day, a fog fell and the sea turned to grey glass. I attended a couple of lectures, but preferred to be on deck. While everyone else was in an airless, windowless room learning about geology, I spotted humpback whales and a pod of white-nosed dolphins. Minke and fin whales also broke the surface, but for the most part it was just the ship and a dozen feisty fulmars dancing on the wind.
With a noticeable dip in temperature and a clear sky, Greenland came into view with the dawn. We reached Gary's village, Ittoqqortoormiit (population 469), by turning right off Scoresbysund, the biggest fjord complex in the world. I had only ever glanced at Greenland on maps. The world's biggest island, it is also the least charted country; the interior is an incomprehensibly large patch of contour-free white, and the east coast has only a handful of settlements and a population of about 3,500.
I wandered Ittoqqortoormiit's gravel streets, climbed to a heliport overlooking an iceberg-strewn bay, visited the cemetery and the grocer's and chatted to locals. The schoolchildren had a day off because of our visit, and one young Inuit told me he was off to Denmark to become a helicopter pilot. Choppers are more common than cars in eastern Greenland and are, along with boats in summer and skidoos in winter, the only mode of transport between the airport at Constable Point and Ittoqqortoormiit.
The town was orderly, with wooden houses painted according to function (commerce: red; utilities: light blue; hospitals: yellow). It contained all the key civic buildings: church, post office and bank, old people's home, sports hall, a memorial to Jean-Baptiste Charcot's "Pourquoi-Pas" expedition of 1936, a guesthouse and a tourist office. There was a sense of purpose, with diggers digging, cargo being inspected, a fishing boat in the harbour and washing flapping in the icy wind – an FC Barcelona shirt, a pair of underpants, a polar bear skin.
No one on the Vavilov had been openly talking about it but the polar bear was the reason my ship was full of passengers. Yes, they'd tick off walruses, whales, seals and seabirds – kittiwakes, black-backed gulls, terns and Arctic skuas – but above all they wanted to ogle the top predator of the Arctic.
Sublimely beautiful, awe-inspiringly strong and very, very frightening (just before our trip a British schoolboy had been mauled to death by a polar bear in Svalbard), Ursus maritimus appeals to humans for the same reasons lions do. That it is such a hardy animal and yet desperately threatened injects a grim "last chance to see" element.
From Ittoqqortoormiit, the Vavilov sailed west, deep into Scoresbysund, and we explored – from the deck, in Zodiacs, on foot and in kayaks – places I had never heard of: Nordvestfjord, Kap Leslie (in the world's largest national park) and Danmarks Island, where I saw stone houses built by a long-gone indigenous group – probably Gary's "little people", said the guide.
Cruising around, you can get blasé about icebergs. Read about the endeavours of Franklin, Ross and Nansen, and all those who explored in the days of sail and low-tech clothes, and you cannot but feel admiration. The bergs that had floated down from the immense Daugaard-Jensen glacier were bigger than any I had seen in Antarctica and, when viewed from the coast, dwarfed the 120m-long, 6,500-ton ship. Some were smooth, peaceful and ringed by turquoise water; others invited anthropomorphic comparisons – I spotted a church organ, a dragon and a shiny, troll-sized phallus.
The tundra came to life through flora – Arctic blueberries and lemon-scented mountain sorrel, saxifrage that withstands absolute zero and horizontally growing willow "trees". Fauna was not abundant, but new sightings for me were feather-footed ptarmigan, bright-white Arctic hares and a dozen musk ox, a shaggy remnant of the last ice age.
It was great to be out and about, hiking in mossy bogs, scrambling over lava and granite to reach a summit and gawping at snowy 2,000m peaks, mile-wide glaciers, fjords bigger than cities.
For much of the time, the sun shone, which was lovely if unfitting, and I tried to soak up Greenland for its glories – and not think about polar bears.
Despite its ties with Denmark, Greenland is a flight from the things we are most familiar with. If it is, at 1,300 miles, not far from Britain in distance, it lies much further away in every other aspect. It is resistant to the tourist's quest. It has no cities, no native trees, no significant indigenous ruins. There's not much to buy; not even a headbanging local grog. The food is ordinary, at best: smoked musk ox, which an Inuit chap in Ittoqqortoormiit gave me to taste, was salty and tender; Narwhal skin, which the Vavilov's chef included in a lunchtime buffet, was egregiously inedible.
Greenland, in a way, is a set of negations covered in ice and, come winter, shrouded in darkness. But Gary said he loved winter most, and I knew from a visit to the National Maritime Museum's "High Arctic" exhibition that Inuits associated the long night with the freedom of dreams.
Gary said I should return at New Year and go dog-driving with him, though he added that the airport sometimes closes because of blizzards, so I might have to stay till Easter. "In winter, you travel by the light of the moon or by the Northern Lights and watch for polar bears stalking from downwind," he said.
As the Vavilov turned northeast for Svalbard, some people were complaining that they hadn't seen much wildlife. I think they were just struggling, as I was, to make sense of a cold desert, bereft of forest and settlements, and of the big, empty-seeming sea. The crossing was never rough, and the mild seasickness I suffered for half a day was due to a bout of rye whiskey in the bar – my one night on the tiles, with half the drinks taken outside, with auks chattering and a sei whale blowing. Sixty hours passed in a blur of books, meals and watching.
After one long morning on the bridge I went to a lecture entitled "Polar Bear: Icon of Climate Change" by Phil Wickens, a British marine biologist. After blitzing us with graphs, he delivered the facts. "Climate change is having its greatest effects in the polar regions," he said. "We're seeing the warmest temperatures for four decades and most scientists agree it is induced by humans."
He talked us through the problems of the Arctic: thin atmosphere, diminishing sea ice, melting glaciers. "Spitsbergen's ice could disappear this century, Greenland's ice cap melting is not beyond possibility. There could be a sea ice-free Arctic in summer 2030."
That, he said, would be fatal. "Polar bears will gravitate north as the ice breaks up – that could last a few decades – and then where will they go?"
We'd seen sea ice off Greenland. In the fog it looked sinister but now I knew it was the basis for the whole food chain, from tetrapods and algae up to that big white bear.
Finally, on an island near Monaco Glacier we spotted a female polar bear with two cubs. There was elation among passengers and relief for the tour guides. But Phil pointed out that the mother was too skinny and one cub looked like a runt. How thrilled can you be to see a doomed species in the flesh?
At 80 degrees north, we watched a solitary walrus slobbing around on Moffen Island. Nansen opens The Farthest North with a litany of the trials suffered by 19th-century explorers just to get to 71, 73, then 76 degrees north. Yet here we were at 80, drinking hot chocolate laced with Tia Maria.
When we disembarked at Longyearbyen, I felt satisfied and ready for home, but pensive. Gary had said he'd chosen to be a dog-musher because it was his dream "and when you pursue something, everyone tries to put you off, it is all about what you're here for".
The distance between the man from Walthamstow's gutsy carpe diem attitude and my own was vast, like a blow to the ego, or the conscience. I didn't want to emulate his physical feats, but I decided to pack in the carbon-heavy megatrips. Greenland had been a reminder that humans are not everywhere (yet), while the polar bear had taught me the paradox of wanting to see something when your presence is part of the problem. Not a bad Arctic geography lesson, really.

Bluebonnets fill grassy hills near the intersection of Mountain Creek Pkwy and S Walton Walker Blvd on Tuesday, March 29, 2016 in Dallas.
Comment on one of our official threads.
It's springtime in Texas, which means a time-honored tradition for wildflower lovers everywhere. You know the drill: Carefully wade into a patch of bluebonnets and squat down for a photo, but don't crush or pick them. It's against the law, right? It's one of those urban legends that sounds just Texan enough to be real. Everyone "knows" the Legislature has protected the state flower by making it a crime to damage it.
But here's the thing, there's no law on Texas books making it illegal to pick bluebonnets.
But don't go planning a flower-picking party just yet. It may not be illegal to destroy the state flower, but it's almost certainly bad Texas karma. "There are a number of myths about our native plants, and that's just one," said Joe Marcus, a program manager at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, who knows well how we're drawn to capture the springtime sight.
"It's a birthright in Texas to put your baby's rear end on a bluebonnet and take a picture. I'm only half-joking about that."
Gina Rokas, tourism director for the city of Ennis, laughs when she hears the anti-picking myth. Ennis is the Official Bluebonnet City of Texas and brings in thousands of tourists for the annual Bluebonnet Trails Festival, which this year is April 15-17.
The 10 most random bluebonnet photos we could find on Reddit
"We do hear that a lot," she said, especially among folks from outside the state. "It's really sweet when they ask, 'Can I just pick one because they're so beautiful.'" This is the 65th year for the Ennis festival, Rokas said, but it's really taken off in the last 10 years since the advent of social media. Go to Ellis County during peak-bloom ( the best estimates say second week of April this year, Rokas said) and you'll find bumper-to-bumper traffic along the trails as people try to get their perfect portrait. Rokas said she jokes with visitors who ask about picking the flowers, but she hopes people won't actually go through with it.
"We just say if everybody's picking them, they won't go back to seed," Rokas said. "It gives us an opportunity to tell them not to trespass onto private property." Sgt. Lonny Haschel, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that while actually picking the wildflowers isn't a crime, it's important to be safe while setting up for photos. The grassy area near a busy highway might offer a pretty backdrop, but make sure to pull completely off the roadway before getting out for photos. "Obviously in the Metroplex, you wouldn't stop along 635 anywhere," he said. "You want to make sure people are safe." Haschel also said to avoid private property, because picking bluebonnets may not be a crime, but trespassing sure is. Parents should keep an eye out for other dangers in wildflower patches as well. "Be careful with kids, because Texas is known for bluebonnets and fire ants," Haschel said. "Once you're there, scout out what's under the flowers."
Rayli Lewis, 2, enjoys a bluebonnet patch in Carrollton. Rayli may not be a criminal, but experts say picking bluebonnets can keep them from seeding properly in future seasons.
Marcus suggests finding a (safe) roadside slope, where photographers can arrange the picturesque patchwork of blue and green behind their subjects without wading into the patch. "People are looking for the perfect picture, the perfect angle, and they end up destroying what they try to appreciate," Marcus said.
Our statewide obsession with these little blue wildflowers dates back over a century, Marcus said. The state legislature first considered picking a state flower in the spring of 1901, spurring fierce floor debate. Some lawmakers considered the cotton boll, harkening back to the state's Southern, cotton plantation roots. A representative from Uvalde suggested the cactus for its hardiness and beautiful flowers, earning him the nickname "Cactus Jack." In the end, the Sandyland Bluebonnet of South Texas — which blooms taller and earlier than its North Texas cousin — won the honor. It wasn't until the 1970s that the legislature named all five or six species of Texas lupines as the state symbol. Today, Marcus gets messages from all over the country from Tex-pats hoping to grow bluebonnets out-of-state. He's even gotten emails from military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan hoping to bring a little slice of Texas to the Eastern Hemisphere.
Story highlights A Brooklyn man says New York police stopped him in April after he left a Macy's store
A TV actor says he was racially profiled at the same Macy's in June
Two college students say they were profiled after shopping at Barneys in February, April
Macy's says it's investigating; Barneys says it has "zero tolerance" for discrimination
A fourth New Yorker is saying that he was targeted outside a New York City department store because of his race.
Art Palmer, 56, of Brooklyn told CNN he was stopped by New York Police Department officers in April after he left the Macy's department store in Herald Square. He had two bags of merchandise on him -- about eight items total -- when, he said, police stopped him and searched both bags to see if his receipts matched what was in the bags.
After being detained for about 10 minutes, Palmer said, police released him and told him he had been stopped because they had lost track of him on store surveillance cameras.
Palmer said he has spoken to management at Macy's and officers at the NYPD midtown police precinct about the incident, and was told that the officers who stopped him outside the store were just doing their jobs.
Palmer said that with the help of state Sen. Eric Adams, he has filed a complaint with the civilian review board.
Macy's and the NYPD could not be reached for comment about the incident.
The allegation of racial profiling comes after one other involving the same Macy's department store and two involving Barneys New York.
HBO television actor Robert Brown said at a news conference this month that he was racially profiled at the Herald Square Macy's in June. Brown said at least three plainclothes officers stopped him, accused him of using a fraudulent credit card and detained him inside the store.
Brown, star of HBO's "Treme," has filed a lawsuit against the NYPD seeking yet-to-be-specified damages, he said.
The NYPD did not respond to CNN's request for comment about Brown's claims.
In an e-mail to CNN, Elina Kazan, vice president of media relations for Macy's, said the department store is investigating the allegations but does "not comment on matters in litigation."
In a similar incident, Kayla Phillips, 21, told reporters last week that four plainclothes officers forcefully stopped her after she left Barneys with her purchase in February.
She and Trayon Christian, 19, who said he also was racially profiled after purchasing a belt at Barneys in April, want damages from the store and the New York Police Department. Christian has filed a lawsuit.
Phillips said that she had been eyeing a $2,500 orange suede Celine bag after a friend bought one for his mother.
After showing the cashier her ID, Phillips said, she paid at a register and left the store with the item in a Barneys bag. She walked out of the Madison Avenue store to 59th Street, where the officers stopped her, she said.
"I was attacked," Phillips said.
The officers -- three male and one female -- questioned her, she said.
"How did you buy this bag, where did you get the money from?" the female officer asked her, Phillips said.
Phillips showed them her debit card, which the female officer took and showed to her partners, bending and examining it, she said. After verifying Phillips' purchase and returning her card, the officers let her go and did not apologize, she said.
In a prepared statement, Mark Lee, CEO of Barneys New York, said "no customer should have the unacceptable experience described in recent media reports, and we offer our sincere regret and deepest apologies."
"We want to reinforce that Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination. Our mission is to ensure that all customers receive the highest-quality service -- without exception," he said.
Speaking to the claims by Christian, the company said no employee was involved "in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale."
In a statement, the New York Police Department said, "We are investigating the allegation." The department directed CNN to its legal department.
Kareem Vessup, Phillips' attorney, said an impending lawsuit could seek $5 million in punitive damages, but the exact amount is still undetermined. He said both Barneys and the NYPD should reevaluate their practices on "shop and frisk."
"There's a call for change," Vessup said. "How long had this been going on? Who else may have been affected by this practice?"
Christian, a New York City College of Technology student, entered Barneys on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, his attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday.
Christian bought the belt, left the store and walked a block before two undercover police officers stopped him, Palillo said.
When they saw the designer belt, they asked him how he was able to afford it, Palillo said. The officers allegedly accused him of purchasing the belt with a fraudulent card and said they had received a call from Barneys, according to Palillo.
Christian said he was detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated, as police contacted Chase Bank to check his card, Palillo said.
When they confirmed that his card was valid, police released Christian and apologized, Palillo said.
Rap mogul Jay-Z -- who has been thrust into the debate over alleged racial profiling at Barneys New York -- broke his silence Saturday, defending himself from critics who have insisted he break off his partnership with the department store over the allegations.
The music icon and entrepreneur spoke in an online statement the day after Phillips, an African-American college student, made her allegations.
Jay-Z has a fashion line that is set to sell at Barneys. A Change.org petition calling for him to end this collaboration had more than 13,000 signatures Saturday night.
"Right as Jay-Z prepares to roll out a new partnership with Barneys New York for the holiday shopping season, I've been disappointed to hear new allegations about how the retailer treats young black consumers," wrote the petition's creator, Derick Bowers of Brooklyn.
The celebrity -- born Shawn Carter, who in addition to being a rapper runs restaurants, a sport agency and other ventures -- on Saturday issued a statement on his website that said he doesn't want to jump to conclusions without all the facts.
He said proceeds from his partnership will benefit his charitable foundation, not him, and insisted, "My idea was born out of creativity and charity ... not profit." Bringing him into this debate, the rapper added, isn't fair -- especially since the truth hasn't been established in the racial profiling cases.
"Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?" he wrote. "The negligent, erroneous reports and attacks on my character, intentions, and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement I didn't want to make without the full facts."
He added that he and his team are working "to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesn't harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration."
"I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgments, no matter who it's towards, aren't I committing the same sin as someone who profiles?" he said. "I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position. Hopefully this brings forth a dialogue to effect real change."

The storied Air Jordan legacy is renowned for its obsession to detail and the seamless delivery of innovation and style. Time and time again, Jordan Brand designers have delivered the message that a high-performance basketball shoe can be equally effective in its beauty, and back in 1987 that standard was set with the debut of the Air Jordan II. It defied several of Nike's own conventions as it shed any Swoosh branding and added snakeskin materials and high-quality leathers, and above all, the shoes were made in Italy. Since then, the annual debut of the Air Jordan signature shoe has been established of the most anticipated sneaker debut of the year, and expectations are understandably high.
Today, Jordan Brand officially unveils the Air Jordan 32, a brand-new sneaker that draws design inspiration from the Air Jordan II and blends it with the best basketball-specific innovations that the brand has to offer. The upper features a new Flyknit upper with high-tenacity yarns that offers flexibility like never before and a hidden lace harness that provides lockdown “under the hood”, while the actual design of the Flyknit material has been engineered to mimic the toe-box of the Air Jordan II. Paired with the engineered Flyknit is a molded snakeskin leather and molded suede panel with a detail at the achilles that resonates the sporty and aggressive vibe of a Ferrari supercar.
Supporting the Flyknit upper is an astounding cushioning package that debuted with the Air Jordan 28; an arrangement of forefoot Zoom Air, heel Zoom Air, Flight Plate, and a herringbone traction offers on-court support like never before.
The Air Jordan 32 will first hit retail in the “Rossa Corsa” colorway on September 23rd; this red-suede color way is a nod to the Italian roots of the Air Jordan 2 as it features the word “Bellissimo” on a tag inside the tongue. On October 18th, which Jordan Brand is marking as “MJ Day” as it marks the anniversary of Michael Jordan receiving the alleged “banned” letter from the NBA, will see the release of a classic “Bred” colorway with the Banned logo on inner tongue. For the first time ever, Jordan Brand will also launch the low version of the shoe on October 18th.

According to Market and Market, the AI market will grow from $420 million in 2014 to $5.05 billion in 2020. Healhtcare industry is not an exception and actively implements the machine learning technologies. Gartner states that by 2018, there will be 6 billion wearable devices with an active use of AI. Just imagine how many wearable devices are there in the healthcare.
Moreover, healthcare is currently overwhelmed with chronic diseases. According to Center for Disease Control (CDC), the later account for $3 of every $4 spent for the healthcare purposes, that is $7900 for every American suffering from a chronic disease. Chronic disease is the reason for 7 out of ten deaths. But the good news is that chronic disease can be predicted and prevented. AI is a great tool for this.
AI has substantially improved big data analysis, for instance, Google's Deepmind Health project. They incorporate clinicians, patients, and public involvement in their medical researches. They provide hospitals, their partners, with secure data services that share blockchain properties. IBM Watson for Oncology exploits patient's data, clinical expertise, and external research to provide a personalized treatment.
It's been reported that from 10 to 20 percent of cases are misdiagnosed yearly. It is a huge issue that can be solved with the help of AI. KenSci, a startup from Washington, believes that it can eliminate such troubles by identifying health risks patterns and defining high-risk ones by means of machine learning and big data analysis. Artificial Intelligence helps identify data< in large scopes of information and medical records increasing the efficiency of chronic disease medication treatment and enabling precision medicine.

Lee Hye-Young I was able to have the opportunity to interview COSRX 's Marketing Team Assistant Manager, ( 혜영이) . Lee Hye-Young was kind enough to give me answers to all the questions I had for her which makes me appreciate the company so much more. COSRX is a Korean brand that specializes in maintaining effective products using minimal ingredients for those having skin troubles and concerns. I love the products that this company produces since they all gave me positive and visible results!
I recently reviewed their ' Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol ', which gave me amazing results.
How did COSRX begin?
"COSRX brand was founded in 2014. However, our first business began 14 years ago and we have worked on from marketing to distribution of various other brand lines before COSRX such as CIRACLE, C20, Gatzmen, etc.
We have analyzed the reviews, surveys, complains, and all the need of customers based on their skin types collected from our formal business. Throughout the analysis, we set the purpose to establish a new field of cosmetics focused on what people actually want and need. As a result, the new high performance cosmetics brand, COSRX, was launched to fulfill our motivation.
COSRX aims for eliminating any unnecessary ingredients and minimizing the length of ingredient labelling by only including the very essential, natural, and healthful ingredients. Moreover, most of the products are mainly dissolved in natural extract rather than purified water to amplify the effect of natural active ingredients used. Though they do not come in fancy bottles, COSRX products' prescription (rx) is formulated carefully to aid each of our customers to treat their skin problems."
What is COSRX's philosophy ?
"More than just aiming for outer, temporal beauty, we believe cosmetics should let people to discover the natural hidden beauty by curing the skin problems. COSRX is a combined term of COSmetics and RX from prescription, coming from 13 years of customer based data about their skin concerns, product satisfaction, and popular ingredients.
Check the ingredient table! Our products are formulated with active ingredients dissolved in natural extract that are more skin friendly and effective than purified water. Extracted from Nature! The secret recipe of our products is to fill with essential, effective ingredients more than just a few drops. It is the COSRX's philosophy to make ingredient-oriented, high performance cosmetics.
By cutting down the promotion and marketing price, we are able to spend more for the ingredients. Therefore, our products are accessible to customers yet very high performing to treat and improve skin problems. We aim for "expecting tomorrow" cosmetics that transforms your skin day by day into what you hope for."
Abstract
A 27-year-old male patient fasted under supervision for 382 days and has subsequently maintained his normal weight. Blood glucose concentrations around 30 mg/100 ml were recorded consistently during the last 8 months, although the patient was ambulant and attending as an out-patient. Responses to glucose and tolbutamide tolerance tests remained normal. The hyperglycaemic response to glucagon was reduced and latterly absent, but promptly returned to normal during carbohydrate refeeding. After an initial decrease was corrected, plasma potassium levels remained normal without supplementation. A temporary period of hypercalcaemia occurred towards the end of the fast. Decreased plasma magnesium concentrations were a consistent feature from the first month onwards. After 100 days of fasting there was a marked and persistent increase in the excretion of urinary cations and inorganic phosphate, which until then had been minimal. These increases may be due to dissolution of excessive soft tissue and skeletal mass. Prolonged fasting in this patient had no ill-effects.
She is China's ‘Old Godmother': Tao Huabi (陶华碧) is the creator of one of China's most famous chili sauces and is the embodiment of the ‘Chinese dream.' By following her own path and relying on her business instinct, Tao rose from poverty and became a multi-billionaire. China's spiciest businesswomen has now quietly retired.
‘Old Godmother' (Lao Gan Ma) is a household name in China. Anyone who frequents Chinese restaurants or supermarkets is familiar with the brand of chili sauces that is made in China since the 1990s – known for the little portrait of a Chinese woman on its label.
That woman is Tao Huabi (陶华碧), who did not only develop the famous chili sauce, but also became the founder and CEO of the privately owned ‘Lao Gan Ma Foodstuff Company' (老干妈风味食品有限责任公司). The company was established in south-central China's Guiyang, Guizhou Province, in 1997.
On February 14 2017, Tao Huabi hit the top trending lists on Chinese social media with the hashtag “The Spiciest [Feistiest] Woman of China” (#曾经中国最火辣的女人), when several Chinese media reported that Tao Huabi had already quietly retired from her company in 2014 and that she is no longer a stockholder of the Lao Gan Ma brand.
ROUGH START IN LIFE
“The noodle shop business soon flourished – but not because of her noodles.”
With her journey from extreme poverty to ultimate wealth (she is even included in the Forbes list of China's richest), Tao Huabi's story reads like a novel.
Tao was born in 1947 in a remote mountain village in Zun'yi, Guizhou province. Since her family was too poor to send her to school, Tao was not taught how to read and write. When Tao was 20 years old, she married a local geologist and had two sons.
When her husband fell ill, Tao Huabi unexpectedly became widowed within a few years after she got married. She was forced to work outside the village to provide for her family; Tao worked around the clock to make rice tofu at night, which she sold at schools during the day.
In 1989, Tao set up a small noodle shop in the Nanming District of Guiyang. Although she just served simple noodles, she mixed them with her own spicy hot sauce with soybeans (豆豉麻辣酱). Tao was beloved in the neighborhood, where she became a ‘godmother' to poor students which she would always give discount and some extra food.
With many local students and patrons visiting her little diner, the noodle shop business soon flourished – but not because of her noodles.
Tao Huabi discovered the popularity of her condiment when customers came in to purchase the sauce without the noodles. One day, when her sauce had sold out, she found that customers would not even eat her noodles without her special sauce.
When Tao learned that other noodle shops in the neighborhood were all doing good business by using her home-made sauce in their noodles, she realized the potential of her product.
FROM NOODLE SHOP TO CHILI SAUCE FACTORY
“At the age of 49, Tao took the plunge and set up her own sauce factory called ‘Old Godmother.'”
By the early 1990s, more truck drivers passed by Tao's shop due to the construction of a new highway in the area. Tao took this as a chance to promote her condiments outside the realm of her own neighborhood and started giving out her sauces for free for the truckers to take home.
This form of word-of-mouth marketing soon paid off when people from outside the city district came to visit Tao's shop to buy her chili sauces and other condiments.
By 1994, she had stopped selling noodles and had turned her little restaurant into a sauce shop. Two years later, at the age of 49, Tao took the plunge to rent a house in Guiyang, recruited 40 workers, and set up her own sauce factory called ‘Old Godmother': ‘Lao Gan Ma‘ (老干妈). In 1997, the company was officially listed and open for business.
Although the Lao Gan Ma brand became successful almost immediately, Tao Huabi still struggled for years as a handful of competitors launched fake Lao Gan Ma sauces with similar packaging, and nearly ruined her business.
In 2001, when Tao Huabi was 54, the high court in Beijing finally ruled that other similar products could not use the “Lao Gan Ma” name nor imitate her packages. She received 400,000 RMB in compensation (±60,000$). Twelve years later, her company had an annual sales volume of 540 million US$ (3.7 billion RMB).
“THE MIRACLE OF GUIZHOU”
“Tao was included in the Forbes list the richest families in China with an estimated worth of $1.05 billion.”
By now, Tao's ‘chili empire' has gone international, as her condiments are sold from the USA to Africa. She is known as the “Miracle of Guizhou.” Despite the many offers she had throughout her career to set up her business elsewhere, she always stayed true to her home-province – much to the delight of local government officials who have continuously shown their support for Tao.
The businesswoman is a true blessing for the province; not just because her brand has become known as a unique ‘product of Guizhou', but mainly because she offers employment to 4100 people, and directly and indirectly generates income for ten-thousands of farmers.
Lao Gan Ma is by far the largest chili brand of China, with over 20 differently-flavored condiments.
In 2015, Tao was included in the Forbes list of the richest families in China with an estimated worth of $1.05 billion.
Besides that Tao, now 70 years old, allegedly loves driving cars (she owns two Rolls-Royces, a Mercedez-Benz and a BMW), she is also politically active and has become a committee member of the People's Congress at the provincial level.
According to the latest Chinese media reports, Tao Huabi has quietly retired in 2014, which was unknown to the public. She and her youngest son Li Hui (李辉) are no longer on the list of shareholders. Her oldest son Li Guishan (李贵山), however, is still a company shareholder.
“Somehow this makes me a bit emotional,” some Weibo commenters said.
“I just hope the quality will remain as good as ever,” some netizens responded on Weibo. “As a kid I always thought there were drugs in this sauce because it was so addictive.”
Others praised her life story, saying: “Old Godmother is an example that you can still make it in life without any education.”
“We actually have a lot of women here in Guizhou who can make their own delicious chili sauce,” another netizen wrote: “But of course, Old Godmother's hot sauce is delicious and has its own characteristics. And in the era of Old Godmother, there were very few people who would rely on chili sauce to make a living. She has persisted and kept her prices low.”
A bottle of Lao Gan Ma is generally sold at around 8-10 RMB (±1-1,5US$). Overseas, prices vary from 8$ to 15$.
“Every great business person has to retire one day,” one commenter writes: “That does not diminish her legendary successful career!”
Others are surprised to find such a life story behind the Lan Gao Ma product: “Who knew our Old Godmother was such a fascinating person?”

What is the Perl Core?
When I use the term “Perl Core” I mean the standard library of modules (distributions actually) that ship with the perl interpreter, and I think that's what most people mean when they use that term. Knowing which modules are in the Perl Core is useful; it enables developers to build programs without external dependencies over which the developer has little control. The perldoc site has a handy alphabetized list of core modules and I generally check there first to browse which modules are in core. The problem though, is that it can be wrong.
What modules are included in the Perl Core?
Did you know that HTTP::Tiny has shipped with Perl since 2011 (version 5.14.0)? It's not listed on perldoc (although that is on the list to be fixed at the next QA Hackathon). Luckily there is a better solution: the corelist program. This is supplied with Module::CoreList. Let's see when Module::CoreList first shipped with Perl:
$ corelist -a Module::CoreList Data for 2015-06-01 Module::CoreList was first released with perl v5.8.9 v5.8.9 2.17 v5.9.2 1.99 v5.9.3 2.02 v5.9.4 2.08 v5.9.5 2.12 v5.10.0 2.13 ...
I've truncated the output and kept the key details. It shows that Module::CoreList has been included since Perl version 5.8.9. At home I run Fedora 23, which comes with Perl version 5.22.1. Running the system Perl corelist :
$ sudo corelist -a Module::CoreList sudo: corelist: command not found
The program doesn't exist; the Fedora team didn't include it for some reason. Not only that, but great core modules like Time::Piece aren't included either!
If you don't have corelist , but want to view a list of distributions that should have been bundled with your version of Perl, you can read perldoc perlmodlib .
Which modules do I have?
Sometimes instead of asking which modules are in the Perl Core what we really mean is: “which modules do I have installed?” For non-core modules, I use perldoc.
perldoc won't show us the core modules that we already have, and in the case of missing core modules, Module::CoreList can't help either (its results are based on internal lists of modules that should be there, not which files are actually present). A simple way I handle this is to use the following script to search the contents of @INC ; the directories which perl searches for modules:
#!/usr/bin/env perl use 5.10.3; use Path::Tiny 'path'; use Getopt::Long 'GetOptions'; GetOptions( 'dir=s' => \my $dirpath, ) or die "Unrecognized option
"; die "--dir is required
" unless $dirpath && -d $dirpath; # append a slash if missing $dirpath .= '/' unless substr($dirpath, -1) eq '/'; my $iter = path($dirpath)->iterator({recurse => 1}); while (my $path = $iter->()) { next unless "$path" =~ qr/.pm$/; # remove the parent dir and trailing .pm from filename my $module = substr("$path", length($dirpath), length("$path")-length($dirpath)-3); $module =~ s/\//::/g; say $module; }
I run it like this:
$ chmod 755 list_modules $ /usr/bin/perl -e 'for(@INC){ system "./list_modules -d $_" }'
I'm using the absolute path /usr/bin/perl to ensure I get my system's perl and not the local one I manage with plenv. One downside of this approach is it lists every module ( .pm file) rather than every distribution, (see this explanation if you're not familiar with the distinction). Another issue is it will list duplicate modules when the system uses symlinks. So the program output needs to be tidied up in a text editor.
What about programs? To search for Perl programs I prepared a list of Perl programs from the source for Perl 5.22, called perl522_programs :
c2ph corelist cpan enc2xs encguess h2ph h2xs instmodsh json_pp libnetcfg perl perl5.22.1 perlbug perldoc perlivp perlthanks piconv pl2pm pod2html pod2man pod2text pod2usage podchecker podselect prove pstruct ptar ptardiff ptargrep shasum splain xsubpp zipdetails
Then I used the following script, called find_binary to check for the programs:
#!/usr/bin/perl my $bin = shift or die "You must provide a binary name to search for
"; for ( qw(/sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin) ) { my $path = "$_/$bin"; print "$path
" if -e $path; }
I run it like this:
$ chmod 755 find_binary $ perl -ne 'chomp;system "./find_binary $_"' perl522_programs
This line calls the find_binary script on every program listed in the file perl522_programs . I chomp the line before searching for it to remove the trailing newline character. This method isn't perfect though; sneaky Ubuntu ships with a program called perldoc but if you run it the system prints:
You need to install the perl-doc package to use this program.
Core modules and programs missing from system perls
Using the code above I did a comparison of the modules and programs shipped with Perl and those shipped with the following systems. Here's what missing:
Fedora 23 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS OSX Yosemite 10.10.5 B::Debug CGI::Fast GDBM_File Config::Perl::V ODBM_File CPANPLUS perldoc DB_File Devel::PPPort ExtUtils::Embed ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Locale ExtUtils::Miniperl File::Fetch File::Spec::VMS Filter::Simple IO::Compress::Adapter::Bzip2 IO::Uncompress::Adapter::Bunzip2 Math::BigFloat Math::BigInt Math::BigRat Math::Complex Math::Trig Module::Loaded PerlIO Text::Balanced Time::Piece Time::Seconds Unicode::Collate autodie bigint bignum bigrat experimental perlfaq corelist enc2xs libnetcfg
Ubuntu and OSX ship with Perl 5.18 so I looked for missing programs and modules against the 5.18 source code. For Fedora I compared the system perl against the 5.22 source. These results show that Fedora is missing quite a few modules and programs: experimental, corelist, autodie, the Math:: modules and Time::Piece strike me as significant omissions (they are supplied by the perl-core package, which is must be installed separately). For Ubuntu, excluding perldoc is a real shame. OSX came away gleaming though: nearly all core modules and programs were present.
Conclusion
When writing programs that use core Perl modules be careful, especially if you're using any of the modules or programs found to be missing earlier. One way around this is the use App::FatPacker to compile all the modules used into a single file. Another way would be to use pp to create a compiled binary. Finally for modules like Time::Piece, you could always consider wrapping Perl's built-in functions like gmtime and localtime in subroutines that give the behavior you need, rather than using the module.
Of course it's always easier to work with a locally-installed perl than the system version. The local Perls provided by perlbrew and plenv contain all the core modules and utilities. You can always compile your own Perl too, it's easy. Strawberry Perl for Windows even comes with some useful extra modules and C libraries. If you do have to rely on the system Perl, you may find a core module isn't there at all.

They used to say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. But we didn't know the true meaning of insanity until recently. Now the definition is tolerating a president who would preside over shenanigans like this:
To outfit Afghanistan's security forces with new helicopters, the Pentagon bypassed U.S. companies and turned instead to Moscow for dozens of Russian Mi-17 rotorcraft at a cost of more than $1 billion. Senior Pentagon officials assured skeptical members of Congress that the Defense Department had made the right call. They repeatedly cited a top-secret 2010 study they said named the Mi-17 as the superior choice. Turns out the study told a very different story, according to unclassified excerpts obtained by The Associated Press. An American-made helicopter, the U.S. Army's workhorse Chinook built by Boeing in Pennsylvania, was found to be “the most cost-effective single platform type fleet for the Afghan Air Force over a twenty year” period, according to the excerpts.
However, Boeing is on the outs with the hard left for standing up to unions. Obama has even used his Marxist National Labor Relations Board to prevent the company from opening new facilities.
The 63 Mi-17s are being acquired through a contract that was awarded without competition to Russia's notoriously corrupt arms export agency Rosoboronexport.
[A]n internal Defense Contract Audit Agency document shows that the department could not conduct a comprehensive cost comparison because Rosoboronexport wouldn't allow U.S. auditors to look at its books.
Now that is wacky.
Having troops in Afghanistan is also insane, considering that Obama said long ago he is not interested in victory, and that under his demented rules of engagement they are not there to fight but only to be killed. Afghanistan is a Muslim country, and the blood and treasure wasted there will not make it any less hostile to us when the troops finally leave by the end of next year.
Americans, some of whom could be building helicopters, are out of work thanks to Obama aggressively fueling unemployment with virtually every domestic policy. Meanwhile, he shovels our money at our Russian adversaries — who also supply military gear to the openly hostile regimes in Iran and Syria — as he lays waste to our Constitution.
To put up with this just so that liberals can congratulate themselves on how much they revere Obama's skin color, we would truly have to be nuts.
Down with Chinooks; the Obama Regime prefers the Russian model.
On a tip from Steve A.
The top 2 in Spain faced off for the first time in the league this season, in a clash that generated almost as much hype as most El Clasico's. This season, Atletico have surprised one and all with their tremendous run in the league, staying 5 points clear of their city rivals Real for this long. Barcelona have been imperious, scoring almost at will, despite the absence of their talisman, Messi, and new acquisition Neymar. One of the meanest defences in the league was up against a free flowing attacking force, and it made for a great spectacle.
Atletico Madrid 0-0 Barcelona
Line Ups:
Atletico Madrid: Courtois; Juanfran; Miranda; Godin; Filipe Luis; Tiago (Cristian Rodriguez, 83); Gabi; Koke; Turan Arda; D. Villa (Raul Garcia, 77); D. Costa.
Barcelona: Valdes; D. Alves; Pique; Mascherano; Alba; Busquets; Xavi; Iniesta (Messi, 45); Pedro (Sergi Roberto, 82); Cesc; Alexis (Neymar, 67).
Analysis:
High Pressing
These two sides have met before this season, with both encounters ending in draws, and that was something that continued last night. Another aspect that continued was Atletico's insistence to press forward and stop Barcelona's passing game deep in their own half. This isn't something new for the home side, they've pressed almost all their opponents relentlessly this season, with the fitness levels of their players permitting them to do so for long periods of the game. However, they were keen to win the ball back high up the pitch from the Catalans and make them pay. If not score from these or win them immediately, they were quite happy to mark tightly, jockey the visitors and force them into playing the kind of passes they don't usually play. Almost every Barça goal kick saw as many Atleti players in the Barça half as Barça players. Simeone wanted Barça to take the aerial route, which isn't of the away side's many strengths, and capitalise on this weakness.
In the first 15-20 minutes of the game especially, Atletico were really charged up and cause Barcelona lots of problems with their pressing and their enthusiasm. The home side made as many as 5 interceptions in the first 20 minutes of the game, with 4 of them coming in midfield. They successfully managed to hijack any plans of a bright and comfortable start for Barcelona by doing so.
Keeping the game narrow
Atletico Madrid had the clear aerial advantage over Barcelona, while Barcelona, are a much better passing side than Atletico. Simeone knew this, and hence, he kept his team playing very narrow while defending. The objective of doing so was two-fold- first, it kept Barcelona playing a type of football that they aren't comfortable with, i.e. getting the ball into wide areas and the flanks, and second, it provided added encouragement for the away full backs to get forward, creating spaces at the back for Atleti to counter attack.
Barcelona generally like to play the ball through the middle, and get it near the edge of the box where they specialise in quick exchanges, one-twos and shooting. Atletico Madrid refused to let this happen. They packed all 4 of their midfielders very narrow to close out any space for through balls that might be played between them into the gap between defence and midfield. Secondly, the 2 lines of 4 sat very close together, to reduce the aforementioned gap and keep Barcelona at bay.
Thirdly, they were very happy to show the Barça players out wide, but reluctant to let them cut inside at all. Such a ploy left Barcelona with lots of space on the wings. Everyone knows that crosses aren't the way Barcelona like to play their game, but they were forced to attempt 18 crosses in this match. This suited Atletico just fine, with the likes of Godin and Miranda dealing with these comfortably. The only occasion that Barça did threaten from a cross was when Pedro headed over the bar after a good cross from Andres Iniesta.
The problem that Barcelona faced was with the way they generally pass the ball. The difference in their approach with regards to passing the ball this season is there for all to see. Under previous regimes, they were incredibly patient with it, and willing to keep it to themselves for long periods of time. The midfield generally looked to pick holes in the opposition defence, and were in no real hurry to do so. This season, Martino has changed their tiki taka approach just a little bit. The Argentine has added a lot more verticality to their play, and Barça now look to get the ball to the frontmen like Messi and Neymar much quicker in an attempt to hit the opposition defence before it can settle down. In order to play these vertical passes though, the team needs its players to find spaces between the lines of the opposition defence. This simply wasn't available to the Catalan giants, and they were forced into playing a number of horizontal passes. A lot of times, they brought the ball forward only to have to pass it back in order to retain it.
Tight Marking
The energy and drive that the home team showed throughout the game was just incredible. Keeping a team like Barcelona out for 90 minutes, and probably even being the better side of the two takes some effort, and Atletico were outstanding on the night. As mentioned above, Atletico were able to stop Barcelona from playing vertical passes, and getting in and around the Atletico area to play their quick one-twos. A lot of this down to the extremely tight marking that the home side employed. there wasn't a single Barcelona player who had time and space in the final third. As soon as an opponent entered that area of the field, he was picked up by one of the defenders who hung onto him like a magnet. This was another factor leading Barcelona not really creating any real goal scoring opportunities. They had a couple of dangerous headers, but with their feet, only a counter attack from Messi really threatened.
Atletico attacking down the wide area
The fact that Atletico were playing so narrow meant that Barcelona had to add width to their game, as the wide areas was where the space was. The Barça forwards are generally accustomed to playing a very narrow role, and with two full backs who have pace and are known for their propensity to attack, the natural solution was to push the full backs forward to overload the Atleti half. In response, Atleti found a lot of space in the Barça wide areas while going forward, and this provided the avenue for their counter attacks. They primarily went down the right hand side, with an astounding 46% of their attacks coming down that flank. This was a ploy to target Jordi Alba, who just returned from injury. The man of the match, Turan too was placed on this side, and was engaged in an engrossing battle with the Spaniard. Either way, Atletico were very keen to get the ball to right hand side, despite the fact that Filipe on the left was far more of an attacking presence than Juanfran on the right, and this is why one feels that Simeone sought to attack the returning Alba.
Atletico were also quite keen to exploit the aerial weakness that Barcelona have. A number of times, the ball into the box and the final ball were aerial passes, rather than through balls or cut backs.
Where does this leave them?
This result changes nothing really. There has been nothing to choose between the two sides all season, and yet again, they were inseparable. Atletico might feel a little bit aggrieved about the fact that they couldn't come away with the 3 points, but their performance showed that they're well and truly in the title race, regardless of what Simeone says.
For Martino, a point is a satisfactory result. The positive is that they've gotten through a really tough fixture with the point, and now have the return of Messi and Neymar to look forward to. These 2 will meet again on the final day of the season for what is hopefully a grand finale to the season, and on that occasion, Barça will want the points.
The biggest beneficiaries from all these are no doubt Real Madrid. The men in white have stolen a march on the leaders without even kicking a ball this weekend, and 3 points at Espanyol will see them breathing down the leaders' neck.

The murder trial of former North Charleston Officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed unarmed motorist Walter Scott, deadlocked on Monday, resulting in a mistrial. The decision in South Carolina reveals a trend in police shooting cases: when an officer is on trial it's much harder for the jury to reach a decision. The deadlock follows another recent high-profile mistrial for a former officer.

In November, a judge declared a mistrial for a former University of Cincinnati police officer who shot and killed a man he pulled over. Five of the seven trials last year in police shooting cases resulted in a mistrial for the officer, according to an investigation by The Washington Post.
Overall, however, mistrials are relatively rare: they only happen in about 6 percent of jury trials for felony cases in state courts.
So why are mistrials more likely when a police officer is the defendant?

ATTN: talked to two criminal justice experts about mistrials in police shootings, and they pointed to two potential problems: jurors still favor police officers, and prosecutors could have a conflict of interest.
The Jury.

In the vast majority of state courts and in all federal courts, verdicts in criminal cases have to be unanimous, and that means that if only one juror doesn't agree with the others, there can be a mistrial.
Michael Avery, professor emeritus at Suffolk Law School and former president of the National Police Accountability Project, said that contrary to some comments by law enforcement in the media, the average American still trusts the police.
"If the average person thought the police could be capable of murder that would be a frightening thought for them," said Avery.

The jury could also have a bias against the person who was killed by the officer.
"When the defendant is a cop you've got some prejudices operating in his favor," said Avery. "There also could be prejudices operating against the person who got shot if it's a racial thing, or some other characteristic society disapproves of."
The perceived character of the victim can play a critical part in a juror's decision, when a police officer is accused of wrong doing, according to University of Southern California law professor Jody Armour.
"If you understand how juries work, you know how much they look at the character of the defendant and also the character of the victim," he said. "If they discount the character of the victim, if they consider him some kind of 'bad Negro' rather than 'Dudley Do-right,' than he may not get much legal protection from them in the way of a verdict against an officer who uses a lot of force. Instead, they'll think 'he's a bad person, he kind of deserved it.'"

Another problem is that many prosecutors may have a potential conflict of interest with police officers. They are required to work with police officers on most of their cases, and elected prosecutors may need the support of a police union to hold office.
"Not only can police unions endorse prosecutors but they can vastly enhance their likelihood of success in the election," said Armour. "It carries weight with the general public."

This could be problematic when it's time for a prosecutor to put a police officer on trial.
"Being a 'good trooper,' being someone that a law enforcement agency, would want to endorse, could mean not to be too overzealous in prosecuting a police officer from the police point of view," said Armour.
Avery said that a good solution is for an independent prosecutor to handle cases of police shootings.
"I am in favor of an independent prosecutor in these cases," he said. "The regular prosecutor has to work with the police all the time and he doesn't want the police to dislike him. He doesn't want to be thought of as a bad guy."
As coalition talks reach a critical juncture over climate policy, dozens of leading German firms call on the future government to ditch coal power.
Mine all mine.
With the UN climate summit taking place in Bonn this week and next, change is already in the air in Germany. But it seems not the change that everyone expected.
More than 50 of Germany's largest businesses, including industrial giant Siemens and retailer Metro, have called on the government to phase out coal power – just as the country's Green Party dropped its demands for an immediate withdrawal. Construction firm Hochtief, software giant SAP and discount supermarket chain Aldi Süd were among the firms that now want ministers to put climate change at the top of their agenda.
Their appeal is timed to coincide with coalition talks underway in Berlin, in which environmental policy has emerged as one of the main sticking points. It carries weight because the signatories employ some 400,000 people in Germany and 1.5 million worldwide, and together generate sales of more than €300 billion ($347 billion) per year.

The future government must set a “reliable and socially-acceptable exit path for coal-fired electricity,” the companies said. They also called for urgent steps to reach Germany's 2020 goal of cutting CO 2 emissions by 40 percent compared with 1990 levels, suggesting an increase in the price of CO 2 emissions certificates and shifting to greener forms of transport. At present, experts estimate that the reduction will be just 30 percent.
The four parties involved in coalition talks following the federal elections on September 24 are only too aware of this. But Angela Merkel's conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens remain at odds about what to do about it, with climate change a particular sticking point in talks. That situation eased yesterday when the Greens backed off their demand that Germany's 20 dirtiest coal-power plants close by 2020. They also rowed back on a long-standing policy that combustion engines be banned by 2030. Although condemned by environmentalists, the Greens' announcement was welcomed by the other parties.
However, it was in stark contrast to the appeal by the companies, which met with a mixed response from business groups. The managing director of the BDI Federation of German Industry, Joachim Lang, dismissed it as “one contribution among many” in the climate debate, while metal industry association WVMetalle said it didn't reflect the views of German industry as a whole. “The benchmark for the feasibility of our future climate policy mustn't only be the companies that benefit from a new business model, but also the ones that have to pay for these measures,” said WVMetalle's managing director, Franziska Erdle.
A closer look at the signatories shows that most of them have relatively low energy costs, and that some are benefiting from the green-energy revolution by selling products such as wind turbines or insulation materials. Many German firms are worried about their future energy bills if the country, whose electricity prices are already among the highest in Europe, steps up the pace of energy reform. “An overly hasty phase-out of coal-fired power plants would lead to power price increases,” warned Hans Jürgen Kerkhoff, president of the steel industry federation. He said that steel plants could face a 30 percent rise in energy costs if there were a rapid exit from coal.
Critics say Chancellor Angela Merkel is now falling down on her green pledges at home.
In addition, there are fears that exiting coal just as Germany gets ready to phase out its last nuclear reactors by 2022 will endanger the stability of the power supply. While the proportion of renewable energy generation is steadily rising, there are still occasions when they need to be bolstered by conventional sources, including coal. “I'm in favor of assigning an equal ranking to the goals of climate protection, competitiveness and safeguarding the power supply,” said Rolf Martin Schmitz, chief executive of energy generator RWE, which is heavily invested in coal.
Under Ms. Merkel's leadership, Germany has been a driving force behind international efforts to combat global warming, and played a constructive role in negotiations to seal the Paris climate agreement. But critics say she's now falling down on her green pledges at home.
“Germany's climate performance in the last four years is dominated by a growing rift between successful climate diplomacy at the international level and a virtual standstill on climate policy in Germany,” said Christoph Bals, political director of Germanwatch, an independent environmental group. His organization says the country's emissions have virtually stopped declining since 1990, and that the new coalition must tap new technologies rather than coal if it is to modernize the country.

As if the New York Times doesn't have enough to worry about, with total advertising revenues down 32 percent in the second quarter, its online business is deteriorating as well. In its earnings announcement this morning, the company breaks out Internet advertising revenues of $68 million, which is a 15.5 percent drop from a year ago.
The year-over-year declines keep getting worse, as you can see in the chart above. In the last three quarters the annual decline went from a 3.5 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 to a 6.1 percent decrease in the first quarter of 2009 to negative 15.5 percent this quarter.
Annual Decline In Internet Advertising Revenues
4Q08: -3.5%
1Q09: -6.1%
2Q09: -15.5%
While the $68 million is a fraction of the NYT's $454 million in total advertising revenues in the quarter (and an even smaller portion of the company's overall revenues of $702 million, which includes circulation and other sources), the NYT is a bellwether when it comes to media sites on the Web. And if it can't stem the bleeding on the Web side of its business, other publishers are likely having trouble as well.
There is one glimmer of hope, however. On a sequential basis, compared to last quarter, the NYT's Internet ad revenues were virtually flat ($68.0 million vs. $67.6 million). And the company as a whole was able to eke out a profit of $21 million, but only because it slashed $132 million worth of costs. And Classified advertsing revenues were down 45 percent. So it is still very much in the woods.

Robocop (2014) Movie Synopsis
In RoboCop, the year is 2028 and multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years – and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it.
When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) – a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit – is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.

Robocop (2014) Movie Review:
A remake from 1987 (before I was born!), I thought a review of the film as its own (instead of comparing with the original) will be more apt, since I've never caught the original and that the technology had advanced tremendously over the past 27 years to make a fair comparison.
This is one of the films that was able to give me goosebumps with just their special effects. Swedish-American actor Joel Kinnaman delivered an engaging performance, especially at the part where he became conscious and discovered what's left of his body. Seriously, I can totally imagine myself going berserk if that happened to me.
Which led me to think about the question of Euthanasia. Will I make the same decision as Murphy's wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish), or will I let go? Letting go is definitely a tough decision, but imagine the horror of seeing your own husband alive, left with only a pair of lungs, heart, face and… brain?
Gary Oldman managed to give the audience the image of sympathetic Dr. Dennett Norton, who was humane yet secretly and crazily awed by what he can do with the human brain. He can get away with anything and not be blamed with his perfectly restrained performance.
The other character who caught my attention was Patrick “Pat” Novak, host of The Novak Element (Nick Fury in Avengers). A contrast to his cool and nice role in Avengers, Pat Novak is now a charismatic and pro-robot host who is able to turn any situation to his benefit.
I like how there's no real super-villain in the film. It was entertaining to look at the decision making, and how freedom of choice was manipulated at the corporate level. The military tactician Mattox (Jackie Earle Haley) hated RoboCop because he loved Robots, you can't fault him for that. While ex Batman, Michael Keaton became really Bad, by becoming the CEO of OmniCorp Raymond Sellars, who oddly, reminded me of some politician or leader whose name was lost at the back of my mind.
Watch it, I don't think you will regret it. (But if you do, share your thoughts with me here!) 🙂
Do You Know?
Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman both starred in the “Batman” film franchise. Michael Keaton played Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) and Gary Oldman played Commissioner Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan's “Batman” trilogy.
Daniel Kash, cast as Detroit policeman John Lake, previously had a recurring role as in the RoboCop (1994) TV series.
Michael Fassbender, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Russell Crowe were considered to play RoboCop.
Dr. Norton's first name is Dennett, which is the last name of philosopher Daniel Dennett, who is famous for his work on consciousness and free will, both of which are key themes in the movie. Daniel Dennett argues that consciousness is an illusion created by layers of physical and chemical processes, and that consciousness is essentially computational. He nonetheless argues that his view is compatible with the idea of free will.
Rebecca Hall turned down the role of Clara Murphy, while Jessica Alba, Keri Russell, and Kate Mara auditioned.
This is the first Hollywood film by Brazilian director José Padilha.

« [Review] Regina: Body Contouring Lipomassage Treatment Belinda Liew's 2014 Tarot Reading for the 12 Zodiac Signs »
Remember Salomon Melgen? He is the Florida ophthalmologist and major Democratic donor whose relationship with Senator Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) prompted a federal investigation amid allegations that the Senator accepted and failed to report inappropriate gifts from Melgen and used his influence in Congress to protect Melgen's financial interests in the Dominican Republican.
Melgen is back in the news after a Wall Street Journal lawsuit revealed that he was the single largest recipient of Medicare reimbursements in 2012, collecting more than $20 million from the federal government that year.
Years earlier, Melgen was the subject of a federal investigation that determined he had overbilled the government for $9 million in inappropriate Medicare expenses between 2007 and 2008. Melgen was forced to repay the money.
Of course, this wouldn't be a true example of Democrats behaving badly without a connection to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.). Campaign finance records show that Melgen's firm donated more than $700,000 to Majority PAC, a super PAC run by former Reid aides. The PAC spent most of that money helping Menendez win reelection in 2012.
OGDEN — Fans of the Twilight Concert Series no longer have to wait until July to hear an incredible line-up of musical artists.
In conjunction with the city of Ogden, Jared Allen, owner of a local bar called Alleged, is bringing a concert series similar to the one in Salt Lake to the Ogden Amphitheater for the month of June.
Twilight Ogden will take place each Thursday evening in June to tide Twilight concert fans over until the Pioneer Park concerts begin in July.
“I'm a big fan of live music and the Twilight series in Salt Lake, and felt like there was an opportunity being missed,” Allen said. “We thought Ogden could step up and cover June, and we could bring a lot of people to come see just how awesome Ogden has become.”
Twilight Ogden is not affiliated with the Twilight Concert Series in Salt Lake, but Allen spoke with the Salt Lake City Arts Council to get ideas for booking artists.
Eight artists will perform at Twilight Ogden, including four opening artists and four headlining artists. Most of the artists will perform indie, folk, alternative or hip hop music, Allen said.
The line-up will be announced May 1, the same day tickets go on sale. Guests can buy tickets online or at the door for $5.
“Our capacity is about 10,800 within the gated area of the park, so I think there is a realistic possibility that these can sell out,” Allen said.
In contrast to the Twilight Concert Series, there is a permanent stage at the amphitheatre, which is sloped, so guests can see the artists better, Allen said.
Allen said his goal for Twilight Ogden is twofold: to bring Twilight to the market in June and to pull in crowds to the “under-utilized” amphitheater.
“Except for a couple of concerts that have taken place at Weber State, I don't think Ogden has seen this caliber of artists brought to town,” Allen said. “I think it'll help with Ogden's music scene.”

A couple of weeks ago, I took a 5-day trip back to my home state of Montana to visit family and friends. I stayed with my dad, of course, but during the stay, I noticed an interesting Google Now card that kept coming up after a day or two after having been there. The card kept popping up with “Time to Dad's,” as a reminder of how long it would take me to get back to his house. It was like the “Time to Home” card that you see if you have your home location added to your Now location settings. The card shows up if you leave home, so that you always know how long it will take to get back there no matter where you are.
I thought this card was interesting because my dad's address wasn't on my calendar, it isn't in my location settings, and not once did I perform navigation on how to get to his house while I was there, because it's in my home town of Whitefish and I know exactly how to get there. But over the last couple of days on the trip, each time I left his house, it kept telling me how to get back there, just like that “Time to Home” card. It was as if Google knew I was in Whitefish, MT, and that I was staying with my dad because his address is included in his contact card and I kept hanging out there for hours on end. It also could have been that it was simply looking through contacts to find nearby friends or family and was giving me the time it would take to get to their houses.
At the time of seeing this card, it struck me as awesome and a bit creepy, but hey, I've bought into Google knowing all there is to know about me. I had forgotten about it, though, until a reader of ours pinged us over the weekend with a similar situation.
In the card above, our friend was greeted with directions to a friend's house upon arriving in San Francisco. He explained it as a friend he would stop to see each time he made his way through SF to catch a Giants game or just say “Hi.” But on this particular trip, he had no plans to see his friend, yet Google was still showing him a card, just in case he wanted to head that way, likely because it knew he often made the trip to his friend's house when in San Francisco.
I can't find specific card info on Google's Now support pages for this type of situation, so I just thought I would share. Again, it comes off a bit creepy that Google does always know where you are and locations of friends or family that you may want to visit when in the area, but I can also see how handy this would be.
Update: Others in the comments are noticing similar cards. Some for a few months, others just now seeing it for the first time.
Has anyone else experienced a similar card?
Cheers Ben!
The September condo sales in Downtown Seattle are in. We've been pouring over the stats and found that the average cost per unit (sold condos) in Downtown was $950,927. The median price was $842,650. Downtown had a total of 74 sales which was a large decrease from August. This is primarily because there were less sales posted by Insignia Towers. New buyers started moving into the North Tower (583 Bell) the last few months.
We are starting to see listings on the market for longer than previous months. With that said, based upon averages all over the country, Seattle remains a VERY hot seller market. Until we see inventory climb quickly, we believe it will remain a tight market with much competition amongst buyers.
Year over year, the cost per square foot average is up 4%. The average price per condo sold is up 12% from last September.
Interesting storylines for September:
11 condos in Downtown Seattle sold for more than the asking price
sold for more than the asking price This unit at 2200 Westlake sold for 15% more than the asking price
The least expensive condo sold was $200,205 unit in the International District
sold was $200,205 unit in the International District The most expensive condo sold in the month of September was a $7,155,000 unit at The Four Seasons.
26 units sold for over a $1,000,000
5 units sold for $2,000,000 or more

WASHINGTON -- Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the nation's leading anti-breast-cancer charity, has insisted that its since-reversed decision to pull funding from Planned Parenthood arose from a routine change in criteria for grant eligibility that had nothing to do with abortion politics.
But a Komen insider told HuffPost on Sunday that Karen Handel, Komen's staunchly anti-abortion vice president for public policy, was the main force behind the decision to defund Planned Parenthood and the attempt to make that decision look nonpolitical.
"Karen Handel was the prime instigator of this effort, and she herself personally came up with investigation criteria," the source, who requested anonymity for professional reasons, told HuffPost. "She said, 'If we just say it's about investigations, we can defund Planned Parenthood and no one can blame us for being political.'"
Emails between Komen leadership on the day the Planned Parenthood decision was announced, which were reviewed by HuffPost under the condition they not be published, confirm the source's description of Handel's sole "authority" in crafting and implementing the Planned Parenthood policy.
Handel's strategy to cut off Planned Parenthood involved drafting new guidelines that would prevent Komen from funding any organization that was under investigation by local, state or federal authorities. Since Planned Parenthood is currently the target of a congressional inquiry prompted by House Republicans into the way it uses government funds, the family planning provider would have been immediately disqualified from receiving new Komen grants.
After the initial uproar when news of the decision broke, the story that Komen told the public was that the cut-off was unrelated to a political agenda against Planned Parenthood.
"While it is regrettable when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such as a long-standing partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most fully advance our mission," the charity said in a statement this past Tuesday.
Americans United for Life and other pro-life groups have been pressuring Komen for years to cut ties with Planned Parenthood because some of its clinics offer abortions, even though none of Komen's money was used toward abortion services. Handel's internal strategy, the Komen source told HuffPost, was to exaggerate those attacks and use them to convince the leadership that funding Planned Parenthood was a political liability.
"Komen's been dealing with the Planned Parenthood issue for years, and you know, some right-wing groups would organize a protest or send out a mailing every now and then, but it was on a low simmer," the source said. "What Karen's been doing for the past six months is ratcheting up the issue with leadership. Every time someone would even mention a protest, she would magnify it, pump it up, exaggerate it. She's the one that kept driving this issue."
Handel and Komen President Elizabeth Thompson didn't respond to requests for comment.
The source said Handel submitted a final version of the new grant criteria to Komen leadership in November, and the board approved it in December, at which point Komen's top public health official, Mollie Williams, resigned "on the spot."
"It was apparent to everyone in the organization that Karen was doing everything in her power to defund Planned Parenthood," the source said, "and that's why Mollie Williams quit."
Williams has previously declined to comment on why she left, but she told National Journal that she respects the work of Planned Parenthood.
But the criteria did gain the support of Komen's top executives and board. And in an interview with HuffPost, board member John D. Rafaelli, a Democratic lobbyist and a supporter of Planned Parenthood's mission, took responsibility for the changes. As the only lobbyist on the board, he said, he should have anticipated the political fallout.
"Honestly, I didn't think it through well enough," Rafaelli said. "We don't want to be pro-choice or pro-life; we want to be pro-cure. We screwed up, I'm saying it. We failed to keep abortion out of this, and we owe the people in the middle who only care about breast cancer and who have raised money for us an apology."
The backlash against Komen was intense, including threats of violence, angry letters from members of Congress and public rebukes from political figures such as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The charity struggled to deal with the pressure, especially in a face-off against Planned Parenthood, an organization whose fine-tuned political team has experience in these high-pitched, high-stakes debates.
It was speculated that Komen founder Nancy Brinker hired her friend Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, to help her handle the crisis. But Fleischer told HuffPost that he had no part in guiding Komen's strategy on this issue except to recommend an outside crisis management firm.
"It's just sad for everybody concerned," he said on Friday. "Komen is a great group, but politically speaking, they're no match for Planned Parenthood."
The Komen insider agreed with Fleischer's assessment.
"Komen's not equipped to spend its days fighting political battles," the source said. "Abortion is not our issue, and I think [leadership] tried to finesse a way out of it, and this investigation criteria was the solution. And it blew up in their faces. They were just naive in the face of [the] incredibly sophisticated Planned Parenthood operation."
Stunned by the fallout, Komen leadership decided within three days to reverse the Planned Parenthood decision and apologize. But the Komen insider said Handel was furious about the cave and fought against it up until the point that it was announced Friday morning.
"It became clear Thursday night that something had to give," the source said. "Nancy Brinker, Liz Thompson, the board, and leadership were saying, 'We're really worried about Komen's mission if we don't figure this out.' But Karen was still arguing against it as of Friday morning -- she was horrified that we were caving, she said. She's politically tone-deaf."
In light of the political damage and the abrupt reversal of the Planned Parenthood funding decision, pressure has mounted inside Komen for Handel to resign.
"Everybody in the organization wishes she would do the right thing," the Komen insider said.
So far, Handel hasn't indicated an intention to step down. Nor does it appear that she's been formally asked to do so. But as a result of her efforts, Komen has been left reeling and its reputation as a top charity endangered.

Shortwave listening like a fishing expedition
Trading clicks for turns, clarity for static … and really loving it
It starts with a high-pitched squeal followed by a burst of static.
[…]We're living in the richest time the world has ever known when it comes to the availability of information from around the globe. But much of it arrives filtered – downsized into sound bites and a few seconds of video carefully selected and massaged by an editor. Almost everything you see and read has been interpreted and edited by professionals.
But when I spin the dial on my shortwave I travel to the source. Perhaps it's the voice of an airline captain over the Atlantic reporting his position to an operator in New York. Or I may happen on music from a country I couldn't even begin to spell. At other times I'll come across news broadcasts from around the world — news that is told with the built-in biases and prejudices of the originating country. It's all unfiltered, all coming to me as it happens. It's such a random smorgasbord of information that there would be no way to duplicate it with a television or computer.
Unlike TV or the Web, shortwave listening is a lot like fishing. You never know what you'll catch. Those who try it for the first time often find satisfaction and even excitement as they troll these waters and make their own catches for the first time.

The 2015 World AeroPress Championship will take place this coming April in Seattle, Washington, in conjunction with the World Barista Championship and SCAA Event. This much we know. What we don't know is who will represent the tapestry of nations at this august exhibition. That's because the national AeroPress championships are still very much a matter to be decided, in the form of individual events happening across a plurality of nations, all around the world, between now and the second week in April.
Up for grabs is a a return ticket to Seattle, courtesy of the World AeroPress Circuit and its benevolent sponsor cabal. Each country fights it out internally, until a final individual emissary emerges with the weight of a nation on their shoulders, ready to compete in the most serious and ruthless tourney of AeroPressing in the world.
Who will advance? Who will be felled? That's a matter for history, friends. But now let's gaze upon a new crop of national AeroPress competition posters together, with a mixture of envy, joy, and existentialist ennui. Because without the shared struggle inherent to the human condition, there would be no worlds left to conquer, and nary an Aero to Press.
The Netherlands
This poster for the Dutch AeroPress Championship is about the coolest thing we've seen out of Amsterdam since De Poezenboat. It goes to show you that with AeroPress posters, as with life, if you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.

Hungary
There's kind of a lot going on with this poster from Budapest, where the Hungarian AeroPress Championship goes down on the 21st of February. The AeroPress here appears to be some sort of exalted celebrity, or perhaps even a worshipped deity. A cup of coffee stands by beneath a bumbershoot, nonplussed. A bunch more coffee cups appear to be paparazzos of some sort. Will they stop at nothing to obtain another tawdry image of the Aero?

Brazil
This Brazilian AeroPress poster is really something else, evoking the line drawn caricatures and wild, vibrant color of contemporary Brazilian artists like Rono Figueiredo and Menelaw Sete, gleefully depicting Brazilian film icon and national treasure Carmen Miranda. You could present this poster without text, or even context, and know that it was utterly, unmistakably Brazilian. Posters like this remind us of the wider cultural movement happening around these AeroPress competitions, in which modern coffee collides with art, culture, and national identity.

Singapore
Remember when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were cruising through Tatooine, minding their own business, when they got held up for a little intergalactic stop and frisk by a couple of nosy Stormtroopers? And then Obi-Wan used an old Jedi mind trick to convince those Stormtroopers (who we later learn are clones, or something) to chill out? And it totally worked? That was awesome.

Czech Republic
We really like this Czech AeroPress Championship poster, even if it's not totally clear what's going on. Is this AeroPress drifting in on a bed of clouds? Or is it emerging, Chong-like, from a great cloud of smoke? Has this AeroPress ascended to one of the Mario bonus levels? Will it fuse with the clouds to become like a coffee brewing Lakitu? So many questions.

Russia

Germany
Now we're talking! A rough & ready dominitrix Angela Merkel is ready to whip your AeroPress dreams into shape, on what the Germans have decided to call “JUDGEMENT DAY”. It's just all so dire and severe and perverse. Not nearly enough open mockery of political figures makes its way into coffee event art, so bravo, Germany, for letting your freak flag fly.

Gall wasps, also called gallflies, are a family (Cynipidae) in the wasp superfamily Cynipoidea within the suborder Apocrita of the order Hymenoptera. Their common name comes from the galls they induce on plants for larval development. About 1300 species of this generally very small creature (1–8 mm) are known worldwide,[1] with about 360 species of 36 different genera in Europe and some 800 species in North America.
Features [ edit ]
Like all Apocrita, gall wasps have a distinctive body shape, the so-called wasp waist. The first abdominal tergum (the propodeum) is conjoined with the thorax, while the second abdominal segment forms a sort of shaft, the petiole. The petiole connects with the gaster, which is the functional abdomen in apocritan wasps, starting with the third abdominal segment proper. Together, the petiole and the gaster form the metasoma, while the thorax and the propodeum make up the mesosoma.
The antennae are straight and consist of two or three segments. In many varieties, the backside of the mesosoma appears longitudinally banded. The wings are typically simply structured. The female's egg-depositing ovipositor is often seen protruding from the tip of the metasoma.
Reproduction and development [ edit ]
The reproduction of the gall wasp is partly parthenogenesis, in which a male is completely unnecessary, and partly two-sex propagation.[2] With most species an alternation of generations occurs, with one two-sex generation and one parthenogenic generation annually, whereas some species produce very few males and reproduce only by parthenogenesis.[2] This process differentiates the various generations primarily in their appearance and the form of the plant galls they induce.
The larvae of most gall wasps develop in characteristic plant galls they induce themselves, but many species are also inquilines of other gall wasps, such as those of the genus Synergus.
The plant galls mostly develop directly after the female insect lays the eggs. The inducement for the gall formation is largely unknown; discussion speculates as to chemical, mechanical, and viral triggers. The hatching larvae nourish themselves with the nutritive tissue of the galls, in which they are otherwise well-protected from external environmental effects. The host plants, and the size and shape of the galls are specific to the majority of gall wasps, with about 70% of the known species parasitizing various types of oak trees. Galls can be found on nearly all parts of such trees, including the leaves, buds, branches, and roots. Other species of gall wasps live in eucalyptus trees, rose bushes or maple trees, as well as many herbs. Frequently, the determination of the species is much easier through observation of the galls produced rather than the insect itself.
Parasitism [ edit ]
A gall provides the developing gall wasp with a safe refuge for the most vulnerable stage of its life cycle, but many other wasps have found a way to penetrate this defence and parasitise the larva(e) within. Some of these parasitoids use their long, hardened egg-laying tube (ovipositor) to bore into the gall and lay an egg on the helpless gall maker. A bedeguar or robin's pincushions gall, collected before the autumn and kept cool, may result in at least one species of parasitoid emerging instead of the gall maker. These wasps, such as Eurytoma rosae, are beautiful, metallic insects with long ovipositors. These parasitoids may, in turn, be preyed upon by other wasps, hyperparasitoids.[3]
Types [ edit ]
Most species of gall wasps live as gall-formers on oaks. One of the most well-known is the common oak gall wasp (Cynips quercusfolii), which induces characteristic, 2-cm in diameter, spherical galls on the undersides of oak leaves.
These turn reddish in the fall and are commonly known as oak apples. Light lentiform galls on the undersides of the same leaves are induced by Neuroterus quercusbaccarum; darker ones with bulging edges are formed by Neuroterus numismalis. Also striking are the galls of Cynips longiventris, which likewise can be found on the undersides of leaves, and are recognizable for their spheroidal shape and irregular red streaks. The oak potato gall wasp (Biorrhiza pallida) has round galls that grow to about 4 cm. These are known colloquially as oak potatoes. The latter type of gall is induced by this type of wasp not on the leaves, but on the roots of the oak. On the buds of young oak twigs, one can often find the hard-shelled galls of Andricus kollari and Andricus quercustozae. Galls do not cause significant harm to oak trees.[4]
The galls of the rose gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) are also distinctive and are known as bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with red, long-haired outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.
Subfamilies [ edit ]
There are two subfamilies, one extinct and one extant:
Genera [ edit ]
Additional information [ edit ]
The galls of several species, especially Mediterranean variants, were once used as tanning agents.
Before his work in human sexuality, Alfred Kinsey was known for his study of gall wasps. [5]
Galls formed on oak trees are one of the main ingredients in iron gall ink.

On the morning of July 3, 2009, a national holiday, Sarah Palin placed a call to her communications director and told her that she wanted to hold a press conference at her Wasilla, Alaska, home. She wouldn't disclose the topic. For Palin, the months since Election Day had been a letdown even bigger than the loss to Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Being governor was drudgery. Her life was terrible, one adviser says. She was never home, her [Juneau] office was four hours from her house. You gotta drive an hour from Wasilla to Anchorage. And she was going broke. Her sky-high approval ratings in Alaskawhich had topped 80 percent before John McCain picked herhad withered to the low fifties. She faced a hostile legislature, a barrage of ethics complaints, and frothing local bloggers who reveled in her misfortune. All this for a salary of only $125,000? The worst was that she had racked up $500,000 in legal bills to fend off the trooper scandal and other investigations. She needed money and worried about it constantly. You have to keep in mind, Bill McAllister, her thenpress secretary, told me, she and Todd were middle class. They're rich now, but not then.
And, whatever one thinks of her intelligence, she was more than shrewd enough to see that there was money to be made on her newfound national profile, and she hadn't been the one making itthis was her particular American resentment. The tabloid-media culture began cashing in on the Palin-family drama ever since her pregnant 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, and boyfriend Levi Johnston stepped on the Xcel Energy Center stage at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul. On multiple occasions, Palin complained to campaign aides about Kaylene Johnson, an Alaska journalist, who had just published a book about her. I can't believe that woman is making so much money off my name, Palin said.
From the time of her infamous wardrobe selection, money had been an issue in Palin's politics. Her relationship with the McCain campaign had been plagued by financial misunderstanding. In her book Going Rogue, she claimed that the McCain campaign had left her on the hook for her Troopergate bills. Palin was furious. Deep down, she wanted to make money, a McCain adviser says. There was always financial stress. They're not wealthy people.
Palin knew there were ways to solve her money problems, and then some. Planning quickly got under way for a book. And just weeks after the campaign ended, reality-show producer Mark Burnett called Palin personally and pitched her on starring in her own show. Then, in May 2009, she signed a $7 million book deal with HarperCollins. Two former Palin-campaign aidesJason Recher and Doug McMarlinwere hired to plan a book tour with all the trappings of a national political campaign. But there was a hitch: With Alaska's strict ethics rules, Palin worried that her day job would get in the way. In March, she petitioned the Alaska attorney general's office, which responded with a lengthy list of conditions. There was no way she could go on a book tour while being governor is how one member of her Alaska staff put it.
On Friday morning, July 3, Palin called her cameraman to her house in Wasilla and asked him to be on hand to record a prepared speech. Around noon, in front of a throng of national reporters, she announced that she was stepping down as governor. To many, it seemed a mysterious move, defying the logic of a potential presidential candidate, and possibly reflecting some hidden scandalbut in fact the choice may have been as easy as balancing a checkbook.
Less than a year later, Sarah Palin is a singular national industry. She didn't invent her new role out of whole cloth. Other politicians have cashed out, used the revolving door, doing well in business after doing good in public service. Entertainment figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura, and even Ronald Reagan have worked the opposite angle, leveraging their celebrity to make their way in politics. And family dramas have been a staple of politics from the Kennedysor the Tudorson down. But no one else has rolled politics and entertainment into the same scintillating, infuriating, spectacularly lucrative package the way Palin has or marketed herself over multiple platforms with the sophistication and sheer ambitiousness that Palin has shown, all while maintaining a viable presence as a prospective presidential candidate in 2012.
The numbers are staggering. Over the past year, Palin has amassed a $12 million fortune and shows no sign of slowing down. Her memoir has so far sold more than 2.2 million copies, and Palin is planning a second book with HarperCollins. This January, she signed a three-year contributor deal with Fox News worth $1 million a year, according to people familiar with the deal. In March, Palin and Burnett sold her cable show to TLC for a reported $1 million per episode, of which Palin is said to take in about $250,000 for each of the eight installments.
AFP, 24 Mar 2012 : "Sri Lanka Friday rejected a UN resolution urging it to seek external help in probing alleged war crimes committed during an onslaught against the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels nearly three years ago. Acting Foreign Minister Dew Gunasekera told parliament that Sri Lanka will resist outside help to investigate violations of humanitarian law, a key demand in the US-initiated Human Rights Council resolution in Geneva Thursday. ... Elsewhere, there were signs of anger in the local press and in comments from public officials following weeks of anti-US and pro-government demonstrations in the capital. Housing Minister Wimal Weerawansa called for the shutting down of a Voice of America (VOA) transmitting station in the island's north-western coast. 'We must shut down the VOA station,' Weerawansa, a hard-liner in the cabinet, told a rally in the central town of Kandy, according to a copy of his speech released by his office. 'VOA get out of Sri Lanka. They use this station for intelligence gathering,' he added. The Voice of America, a US government-funded broadcaster, expanded their operations in Sri Lanka with the commissioning of a re-broadcasting facility at Iranawila in 1999."
english.samyalive.com, 24 Mar 2012: "'I demand that we shut down the Voice of America (VOA) station if the US continued in their action to harass us with hostile acts,' said Minister of Construction Wimal Weerawansa,who is also the leader of National Freedom Front, a constituent party of the ruling coalition."
A shortwave relay station, saturated with radio frequency energy, would be a poor location for "intelligence gathering." The IBB relay station at Iranawila, Sri Lanka, is used for VOA, RFA, and RFE/RL transmissions to South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
Daily News (Colombo), 29 Mar 2012: "The Listeners Association of China Radio International in Sri Lanka has thanked China for supporting Sri Lanka at the UNHRC sessions in Geneva and said China's stand is highly appreciated by the grateful people of Sri Lanka."
Data Coding 101 – Introduction to Bash – ep1
Note: to get the most out of this article, you should not just read it, but actually do the coding part with me!
If you don't have the data infrastructure yet, you can install it on your own in roughly 30-60 minutes. Simply read and follow my previous article: How to Install Python, SQL, R and Bash (for non-devs)
Let's get into this! Here are the first steps to learn the most basic data coding language: bash.
What is bash and why should you learn it?
Bash (often referred to as “the command line”) is not a language directly built for data science. It's a command language which lets you interact with your operating system (in this case Ubuntu). You can type commands and bash will interpret them. Without going into further technical details, the one thing you should understand: you don't need to learn bash just because of data science. You will use it for so much more!
To move, copy or rename files between folders and computers.
To integrate and/or automate your SQL, Python and R scripts.
To set up new data tools on your data server.
Etc…
But besides all these above: it's a very powerful tool for data analysis as well.
In this article, I'll guide you through the first steps of learning bash!
Open your Terminal! Meet the prompt.
If you read the above-mentioned installation guide, you should be familiar with Terminal. So open it up, log in to your data server and you will see something like this.
Without typing any commands, let's take a look at the command line itself:
tomi@data36-learn-server:~$
In bash you will have this $ sign on every line.
The text before the dollar sign is called the prompt, which usually tells you more about your username, the current folder you are located in your remote computer and other things you can set (but we don't care about those in this article).
The prompt changes when you go to Python ( >>> ), R ( > ) or SQL ( postrgres=# ), so you will know whether you are using bash or any other language. (That's useful!)
The point is that all the bash commands I'll show you in this article should be typed after the $ character.
Get some data!
To practice a bit, we will download an open data set. “Open” means that it's free to use. There is a beautiful data set (originally published here) with 7.000.000+ lines of data that you can simply download by typing this to the command line:
wget http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2007.csv.bz2
Remember, you logged into your data server! So when you are in the Terminal, you are on your remote server. That means this will be downloaded there and not to your local computer! So don't worry, you can't make a mess there! 😉
The file was zipped, so you need to unzip it first. dtrx is a cool unzipping tool for Ubuntu. Let's install it – to your remote server – with this command:
sudo apt-get install dtrx
(As usual if it asks for your sudo password, type it, and if it asks if you want to continue the setup, say yes.)
Then unzip the file:
dtrx 2007.csv.bz2
It will take around ~60 seconds to process the whole file, so don't worry, your Terminal is not freezing; it just needs some time.
Once it's done, you will have a very cool data set containing the arrival and departure details of all commercial flights in the US from 2007. (Yes, this data is open to the public.)
Where am I now? Orientation in bash.
Per definition you are in your user's folder (in my case it's /home/tomi ). I'll get back to this soon, but first, let's see what we have in our current folder. Type this bash command:
ls
ls stands for “list” and it literally lists out all the files in your folder. It's not a surprise that you have 2 files. One is the one you've just downloaded ( 2007.csv.bz2 ) and the other is what you have just unpacked ( 2007.csv ).
Note: If you are here from the Junior Data Scientist's First Month video course, check out the ls -v command, too. The -v parameter adds a small (but important) modification to the original command: it will print everything in “natural” order! Learn more about that in the course itself!
I know you are very excited to see what data we have in our 2007.csv file, but let me show you some more important “orientation” related bash commands before that.
pwd
( pwd stands for “print working directory”) This will show you, where exactly you are on your remote computer. I'm in the /home/tomi folder – as I've already mentioned before.
mkdir hello
(Stands for “make directory.”) This created a new folder in your folder called “hello.” Obviously, you can type anything instead of “hello.” mkdir [folder name] is the general folder-creator command on bash. Let's use ls to double-check your new folder. Oh, it's there! Yay!
It's a folder, so you can go into it. The bash command to do that is:
cd [folder name]
( cd means “change directory”)
So in this case:
cd hello
If you use ls again, you will see that this folder is empty. And if you use pwd , you will see that you are indeed in the hello folder.
If you want to go one folder up, use:
cd ..
You can try ls and pwd again to make sure that you know where you are.
Now try out how copying files works in the command line:
cp [folder/file_to_copy] [folder/new_file_name]
As you can see, you need to give two parameters here. The first one is the name and the location of the original file, the second is the preferred new name and the location of the new file. Let's do it:
cp /home/tomi/2007.csv /home/tomi/hello/delay2007.csv
This bash command copied from our original folder into our hello folder the 2007.csv file. Plus the new file's name won't be 2007.csv anymore, but delay2007.csv .
Note: when you use cp , you don't necessarily need to type the whole (absolute) path of the file. You can use the so-called “relative paths” instead. So as I'm in the /home/tomi/ folder I can just type:
cp 2007.csv hello/anothercopy.csv
Same result! (Except that the new filename in this case will be anothercopy.csv )
Test yourself #1
Here's a quick assignment if you want to test yourself! Try to solve the case by yourself! Nothing else will be needed but the bash commands I've described above. Once you are done, you can check out how I'd do it.
Exercise:
Create a new folder with the name practice !
Copy your 2007.csv file into this new practice folder and name it flightdelays.csv .
…
…
Solution:
Type this into the command line one by one:
cd – (optional) this command will automatically move you to your main folder ( /home/tomi ) mkdir practice – this will create the folder practice cp 2007.csv practice/flightdelays.csv – this command will copy the file into the folder with the new name cd practice – with that you can go into your new folder ls – this command will list the files in the practice folder, you will have only one: flightdelays.csv
DONE!
Printing files in bash
Okay!
No more boring stuff, let's dig into the raw data! I'll continue with the new file we've copied into the practice folder. Our next bash command will print our whole .csv file.
cat flightdelays.csv
Here's a video about what happens:
Okay, it might be nerdy to say this… but: how cool does this look? Like we could be in the Matrix. Well, Neo, this is our data file line by line – and as I said it's over 7 million lines, so it might take some time to print the whole file on your screen. In the video above I interrupted this process. You can do the same for yourself by pressing CTRL + C on your keyboard.
The cat command wasn't really meaningful at this time, but at least now you have a sense of what kind of data you have in this file. In data science it's usually an important first step to spend some time discovering your raw data. However if you want to do this more easily, you can print the first 10 lines or the last 10 lines of your file by typing these to the command line:
head flightdelays.csv
tail flightdelays.csv
When you typed head , you got back 10 lines, and the first one was the header of your data table. Depending on the file you use, sometimes you have this, sometimes you don't.
The last bash command for today's article: word count!
wc flightdelays.csv
Three numbers are showing up on your screen:
7453216 : The number of lines in your file.
: The number of lines in your file. 7453216 : The number of words in your file. (Some explanation: bash defines “words” separated by spaces, tabs or line-breaks. As you saw before, in this file the words were separated by commas. So bash understands one line as one word. We will fix this issue later.)
: The number of words in your file. (Some explanation: bash defines “words” separated by spaces, tabs or line-breaks. As you saw before, in this file the words were separated by commas. So bash understands one line as one word. We will fix this issue later.) 702878193 : The number of all the characters (spaces included) in your file.
So it's not just word count, but line count and character count too.
CONCLUSION
Hey! You've just started to work with a 7 million+ line data file!
This is awesome!
(But before you start to tell your friends that you are practicing with “big data,” I have to draw your attention to the fact: this is not yet big data at all.)
You've also made the first important steps to learn data coding and become a data scientist!
I'll continue from here! UPDATE: for episode 2, click here!

Seven years ago, Hunter Hillenmeyer was signing autographs in a Jewel-Osco supermarket up in Fox Lake, Ill., the kind of ham-and-egg gig that any Chicago Bear could expect at some point in his career if he was any good. It wasn't anyone's idea of stressful work. Smile, pretend to be famous, collect your couple-three thousand bucks for two hours of doing nothing. But then this dude showed up like something out of The Silence of the Lambs, and laid his right forearm on the table.
The guy was covered in tattoos—tattoos of Bear autographs. He thrust a Sharpie at Hillenmeyer, a linebacker from Vanderbilt who didn't expect to stay a year in the NFL when he was drafted in 2004 but somehow had made starter. Hillenmeyer's legal signature was about to go on the body of this freakshow—permanently.
"He holds out his arm, and I'm thinking, 'That seems like primo real estate,'" said Hillenmeyer. Sure enough, Mike Ditka's penmanship was right next door, somewhere around the ulna. Hillenmeyer grimaced and signed. "The next time I see him is at training camp [the next year], and right there next to Ditka is my autograph tattooed on his arm.
"I remember thinking, 'That's pretty creepy,'" says Hillenmeyer today from his home back in Nashville, where his new job, in fact, is brokering fan-athlete close encounters. Non-creepy close encounters. The key to that seems to be that no money changes hands, either from fan to athlete or, remarkably, from sponsor to athlete. The two just sit down and play a video game, something both were probably doing a lot of already.
Hillenmeyer runs into a lot of disbelief that his business isn't just another ex-jock's scheme.
Hillenmeyer connects them through an app developed by his startup, Overdog, which sells ads on the app. (Call of Duty and Activision had a big run during the game's launch month). It more or less is a big lobby that shows who among the more than 300 pros—and not just the big four team sports in the U.S., either—are online, and in what game. Fans who sign up can be notified when a player, or a player for a certain team or in a specific sport, or playing their favorite game, is online. When that guy is ready to play, there's a lottery draw among the fans who want to play against him. Hillenmeyer says of Overdog's installation base of 15,000, 88 percent of fans who signed in for two matches played at least one of them against a pro.

Because athlete-fan interactions have become such a transactional relationship to the popular consciousness, Hillenmeyer runs into a lot of disbelief that his business isn't just another scheme from an ex-jock trading on his previous life or, worse, trying to con other jocks by virtue of that connection. To be honest, I felt that way when I heard about Overdog last year, assuming its users paid $29.95 to play team deathmatch for 30 minutes with, I don't know, Antonio Gates. I assumed it was like going to a strip club and paying a dancer to have a salad with you during your dinner.
If that really was the job description, I couldn't imagine any current star, much less anyone interesting or relevant at any point in his career, signing on. Well, neither could Hillenmeyer.
"I didn't like the impression of an athlete having his hand out to bleed fans for $50 or $25 or whatever the price per game would be," Hillenmeyer said. "I didn't feel that was true to the experience of what we wanted to deliver, and if we used a subscription or a microtransaction model for these interactions, we would be left with a lot of disappointed fans. It left them with the chance of not playing, and no guarantee that they would—that seemed very tough to get over."
Advertisement
More importantly, setting up a service that did charge fans and pay players that cash, after taking a cut, would damn for sure ramp up the creepy factor, giving Overdog a lot fewer than 300 athletes and requiring a lot more money, paperwork and agent interactions.
"Part of the safety [in Overdog] is it's arm's length," Hillenmeyer reasoned. Most players do play with voice chat on; at minimum, gamers would get an introductory tweet from the pro welcoming him to the game. "It has that immediate back-and-forth interaction on Twitter, but there is some safety that insulates athletes from the autograph-line fear of crowds."
But what's in it for them? Why not just game against a friends list they build up naturally (and anonymously) like the rest of us?
Advertisement
Well, Overdog's stable does get some swag and perks, thanks to relationships with publishers and peripheral makers that send along free games, headsets and other goodies. Word spreads in a locker room really fast, the same way a free donuts email goes viral at any office. "We'll get some random guy on the Dallas Cowboys, then we'll get one more, then the week after we'll get six," Hillenmeyer says. "Word spreads around college teammates pretty organically, too. One day we'll get an Oklahoma guy, then the next week, five or six guys from Oklahoma."
'I didn't like the impression of an athlete having his hand out to bleed fans for $50 or $25'
They're not just Call of Duty and Madden steakheads, either. The former Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, very well known to gamers, will jump on to play Borderlands 2, which is problematic to Overdog because, with the multiplayer being a co-operative campaign, it can go on forever. Eric Brunner, a fullback for the Houston Dynamo of MLS, "is a huge gamer. Even before Overdog existed, he was already a streamer. He's a big League of Legends guy, that's an exception among athletes. Most are console and mobile gamers, but not PC."
Advertisement
Overdog's so far only connecting games on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but anticipates supporting PS4 and Xbox One later. Hillenmeyer wanted to get the Overdog app running on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, but found that to be a bridge too far for a startup company. "For us to think that, as a startup with a new concept, we'd have carte blanche ability to pull the APIs we need and deliver the exact experience we wanted on the console was probably a little naive." Hillenmeyer said. "I still think it's possible and it'll happen sooner or later." For now, the mobile app was the next best solution; it's available for iOS and Android devices.
And Overdog does pay out money—"90 percent of athletes on Overdog are not paid," Hillenmeyer said, which means 10 percent do get something, but it's not from fans. When Overdog is shelling out for celebrity status, though, it's usually for something hugely promotional, like this video for something called the "Athlete Elite League," comprising five top running backs, all currently involved in an NFL season.
So, this isn't a charity. Hillenmeyer got his M.B.A. from Northwestern while he was playing for the Bears, and he's trying to make money off this idea. It's not a cute case study project he wrote up that he's fooling with while he manages the millions he made as an NFL pro. Overdog, Hillenmeyer said, had its origins in something called Pro Player Connect, which was basically a clearinghouse that found all sorts of ways for athletes, many of whom aren't household names, to make extra money off the field. Hillenmeyer was one of the 2,800 who signed up through it. "It was anything from go have dinner with a bunch of strangers to go sign a bunch of autographs," Hillenmeyer said. Often the compensation wasn't in cash, but a deep discount on, say, a set of golf clubs, or 40 percent off a rental car.

The idea had appeal because it streamlined a process that, on a one-to-one level, is often shrouded in contracts and lawyers. "If, in my playing days, I signed autographs at a Walgreens to promote getting a flu shot, I might get $1,500 for that," Hillenmeyer said. "The transaction costs were, literally, about the same as Peyton Manning signing a deal with Gatorade. There were just too many gatekeepers in the process, middle men, agents and such."
Good concept notwithstanding, Pro Player Connect wasn't making any money, and when it came time for its backers to consider going forward, they essentially reconstituted their investment as Overdog. This time, they're betting that bringing athletes and fans together in an activity they're both already doing and enjoying is going to create enough interaction that selling ads on it does make sense, and the huge weight of cash for contact—in meeting expectations and paying for the brush with fame—is lifted.
It wasn't just dealing with, well, gregarious superfans that could make a 6-4, 240 pound linebacker grimace. Sometimes you know your own resume and, frankly, can't believe you deserve the money. "It's creepy how many opportunities you have when you're on a team that is playing well," said Hillenmeyer, whose Bears went to the Super Bowl in 2007. "Out of 11 starters on our defense, I was probably no better than ninth or 10th best. But when you're on a good team, there are lots of opportunities to sign autographs or promote something. Five thousand, $10,000 for two hours, that seemed unfathomably awesome. I'd show up at a Dick's Sporting Goods and make $5,000 to sign autographs for two hours, and there would be 150 people there over the whole two hours.
Advertisement
"I remember doing the math in my head and thinking, 'This can't be worth Dick's money,' and almost feeling guilty," Hillenmeyer mused. "Somebody's marketing budget had to go to work here, and I felt bad that I was not a bigger draw. Somebody wasted $5,000 having me show up at this store."
That's not to say all of his interactions with fans are tinged with regret. The roar of a Soldier Field crowd when he forced a fumble is a kindness no athlete could repay. And there are friendships he developed that persist to this day.
"Some of my best buddies in Chicago are golf buddies that I got to know because we had the same hobby," Hillenmeyer said. "They're normal dudes like me, with a shared interest in the same thing. We still play, and it's not because they're big Bear fans, and it's not because I like it that these guys are hanging out with me. Now we go play golf together all the time."

Replace "golf" with "video games," and that's Overdog.

Abstract
Few would quarrel with the influence and significance of popular culture on society. However culture is vaporous, hard to capture, harder to gauge. Besides pure democracy, the arts remain one of the most effective and accepted forms of societal indicia. A song, dance or a painting may provide tremendous information on the cultural mores and practices of a society. Hence, in an agrarian community, a song may be a mundane hymn recital, the celebration of a harvest or the mourning of lost lives in a draught. Similarly placed as songs and dance, popular movies serve functions beyond mere Id satisfaction. A movie can reaffirm old truths and crystallize new beliefs. Hence we do not find it awkward when a movie depicts a crooked politician accepting a bribe or a television anchor disdainfully chasing TRP's. This happens because we already hold politicians in disrepute, and have recently witnessed sensationalistic news stories which belong in a Terry Prachet book rather than on prime time news. With its power and influence Hindi cinema has often dramatized courtrooms, judges and lawyers. This article argues that these dramatic representations define to some extent an Indian lawyer's perception in society. To identify the characteristics and the cornerstones of the archetype this article examines popular Bollywood movies which have lawyers as its lead protagonists. The article also seeks solutions to the lowering public confidence in the legal profession keeping in mind the problem of free speech and censorship. Finally, this article aims to put up a looking glass to lawyers, tinted by drama, action, romance and the frequent song and dance sequences.
The Republic of Ireland have received a boost with news that Croatia, their opponents in their opening group game, will be without the striker Ivica Olic, who was ruled out of Euro 2012 with a thigh injury.
Olic's place in the Croatia squad will be taken by Dnipro's Nikola Kalinic, while his absence means Everton's Nikica Jelavic is likely to start Sunday's fixture in Poznan .
Olic, who is set to join Wolfsburg from Bayern Munich this summer, suffered the injury in a friendly draw with Norway at the weekend. He was due to fly home from Croatia's training camp in Munich later on Monday.
While Olic's absence raises questions about Croatia's lineup things could not be more settled in the Republic camp with their manager Giovanni Trapattoni confirming that, barring any "strange circumstances" the starting lineup for Monday's friendly against Hungary in Budapest would be the one who face Croatia on Sunday.
"The team that starts this [Hungary] game will be the team that starts against Croatia, unless there are strange circumstances." Trapattoni said. "Why should I announce this team now? It is an easy answer. It is the team that allowed us to achieve qualification, they are in good form and we shouldn't change.
"We can play with our eyes closed. If we need to change, the other players can play the same way, but I couldn't change because all of these players are doing very well. John O'Shea will show me if he is fit. When there is an injury, after the game we can say it is OK or there is a concern. But John does not need to play the whole game, maybe just for 70 minutes. It is no problem, because I am thinking about the Croatia game."
The Republic went into the friendly in Budapest defending an impressive 13-match unbeaten run, and while an extension of that run would provide them with the perfect send-off to Poland, simply getting through the 90 minutes with all 23 squad members intact was equally important.
Acutely aware of the misfortune which has befallen the England defender Gary Cahill, captain Robbie Keane knows exactly what is at stake. "I know at the back of your mind, you try your best, but as soon as you are on the pitch, it's very difficult. If there is a tackle there to be won, it's just normal that you go in to try to win it.
"The last thing anybody wants, and certainly the players, is for anybody to get injured. To miss a major tournament like this after all the hard work we have done over the last few years would be terrible for any player. I feel for the players, people like Cahill in his first major tournament, who miss out with an injury.
"We are hoping that after the game, we will be speaking about everyone having got through OK with a good win under our belt and look forward to Sunday's game."
The Republic will leave Hungary on Tuesday morning for their Gdynia base near the Polish city of Gdansk.
Dan Joseph of the right-wing Media Research Center says he would lie and say he was transgender just get into girls' bathrooms and changing rooms to perv on women
A right-wing activist in the United States has said that he would pretend to be a transgender woman in order to be allowed to share bathrooms and changing rooms in attacking a California anti-discrimination initiative.
Dan Joseph of the right-wing Media Research Center posted a video to YouTube entitled, ‘The Transgender Bathroom-Locker Room Question,' in which he filmed himself talking to students at a Virginia university campus and asked them question about whether they would be prepared to share bathrooms and change rooms with transgender people, trying to solicit negative responses.
One of the students told Joseph, ‘High school kids get away with a lot of bad stuff – a lot of kid nowadays would probably take advantage of this,' to which Joseph says, ‘You mean like a guy who just wants to see some naked chicks going “oh, I'm transgendered and I need to go to the girls locker room?"'
The student replies, ‘exactly,' to which Joseph then says, ‘I mean, that's what I would do.'
The video then shows hidden camera footage in which Joseph, dressed like a male college student and talking in a stereotypical camp gay voice stops a female student who is about to enter a changing room and tells her he's transgender and asks if she would be ok with him changing in there with her.
‘I'm a transgender,' Joseph tells the student.
‘So that means I have the man parts but inside I feel more like a woman. I was just wondering, is it okay if I go in there with you in there and change and shower and stuff? Just because I don't really feel, like, comfortable in the men's area. It's just weird. Is that okay with you?'
The California law allows transgender students from kindergarten to grade 12 to access bathrooms and changing rooms of their preferred gender and also play on the sports teams of their preferred gender.
Joseph is not alone in saying he would lie to get into girls changing rooms – Fox News' Bill O'Reilly said on 13 August, ‘If I get reincarnated, when I'm a teenager – bam!' indicating he would pretend to be transgender and go straight into girls changing rooms.
Fox News's Greg Gutfeld had voiced the same-sentiments only a few days earlier filling in for O'Reilly.
‘As a devious teen growing up, I would tell girls that I'm a girl trapped in a boy's body, just so I could sneak into the girls' bathroom,' Gutfeld said 9 August.
Air Force's Sukhoi 30 jet with two pilots on board goes missing near China border (file)
Highlights Jet goes missing near Assam's Tezpur while on routine sortie: sources Last contact made around 11:30 am Tezpur Air force station is located 172 km from the China border
A Sukhoi Su-30 jet with two Air Force pilots on board went missing this morning near Tezpur in Assam while on a routine sortie near the border with China, Air Force sources have said.They said the plane took off around 9:30 am and went missing near the Doulasang area of Arunachal Pradesh, which is a border area adjoining China. The last contact was with the pilots was around 11:30 am when the aircraft was nearly 60 km north of Tezpur.The Tezpur Air Force station is located 172 km from the China border.A search is on for the aircraft, said Sonitpur district Deputy Commissioner Manoj Kumar Deka.The Sukhoi Su-30 is a Russian-made, twin-engine fighter meant for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface missions. The first of the Su-30 planes were inducted by the IAF in the late 1990s.Since their induction, six crashes have taken place. An inquiry into the plane accidents has primarily indicated technical failure as their cause.In March this year, a Sukhoi-30 aircraft had crashed near an air base in Rajasthan's Barmer. Both pilots had ejected to safety. With inputs from PTI

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. – Indianapolis officials are reminding everyone about the city's high weeds ordinance. According to the ordinance, residents will face a fine for letting grass grow over a foot tall.
Last year, there were 17,000 high weed and grass complaints made, and 15,000 violations were sent out.
Property owners who receive a notice of violation letter have five days from the date the notice is mailed to mow their overgrown property, according to the City-County Code of Ordinances. If a property owner fails to mow the property, the city will send a mowing vendor to mow the property and invoice the property owner for the service at a rate of at least $363 per lot.
Mayor Joe Hogsett set a good example this morning by mowing a property on the city's near northeast side. He's encouraging Indianapolis property owners to do their part by maintaining their lots and yards.
“High weeds and grass become a public nuisance that threatens the health and safety of our community,” Hogsett said. “Throughout the summer months, we'll have 8 contracted vendors and nearly 70 employees working across the city to tackle these challenges, but we can't do it without the public's help. If you encounter a property in this kind of condition, please report it to the Mayor's Action Center.”
You can call the Mayor's Action Center at 317-327-4622 or reach them by going here.
The US is sending a dozen F-16 fighter jets and nearly 300 service personnel to Poland by Thursday as part of a training exercise in response to the crisis in neighboring Ukraine, the Polish defense ministry confirmed.
The agreement to deploy US military forces in Poland was made between US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Poland's Minister of National Defense Tomasz Siemoniak during a telephone conversation on Sunday, March 9, 2014, according to a statement on the official website of the Polish Ministry of National Defense.
"The squadron will number twelve F-16 planes and will transport 300 soldiers," Polish Defense Ministry spokesman, Jacek Sonta, confirmed to AFP.
Initially, the training exercise was planned to be smaller but was increased and pushed forward because of the “tense political situation” in neighboring Ukraine, added Sonta.
The ministry also said that the aim of sending the units is to “strengthen Polish - American cooperation.” Part of the preparation team of US Air Force has already arrived on Polish territory.
The fighters were sent on the initiative of the Polish government, an initiative immediately accepted by Washington.
On Monday, NATO also gave the go-ahead to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) for reconnaissance flights over Poland and Romania in order help monitor the crisis in Ukraine.
Poland is a western neighbor of crisis-torn Ukraine - between the countries' capitals, Warsaw and Kiev, there is less than 700 km.
Earlier, the Polish media reported that US fighter jets would be stationed at the Lask air force base in central Poland.
Washington is also sending four F-15 planes to Lithuania in response to “Russian aggression in Ukraine and increased military activity in Kaliningrad,” according to the Lithuanian Defense Ministry.
On Saturday, US Navy destroyer, the USS Truxtun, crossed Turkey's Bosphorus and entered the Black Sea. The ship, with around 300 crew, was heading to “previously planned” training exercises with the Bulgarian and Romanian navies. When the vessel appeared in the Black Sea, Fox News declared that NATO's bolstering presence in the Black Sea is a “defensive” measure to counter “Russian military aggression” in Ukraine.
USS Truxton, one of the largest destroyers ever built for the US navy, will reportedly stay in the Black Sea till mid-March as the Montreux Convention allows a warship of any non-Black Sea country to stay in the region for 21 day only.
The situation in Ukraine is close to financial and humanitarian catastrophe after the armed coup which took place in February. There are mass protests in eastern and southern parts of the country against the self-proclaimed authorities in Kiev.
The Autonomous Republic of Crimea has scheduled a referendum for March 16 on whether it wants to remain part of Ukraine, or join Russia.

INDIANAPOLIS -- Seven Indy Lights Presented by Cooper Tires drivers, including the top three in the championship standings, will share a test day in Verizon IndyCar Series cars with Verizon IndyCar Series drivers Aug. 13 on the 2.385-mile, 12-turn Sonoma Raceway road course in Sonoma, Calif.
Verizon IndyCar Series teams and drivers testing, with Indy Lights drivers in parentheses:
• Andretti Autosport – Marco Andretti (Matthew Brabham)
• Chip Ganassi Racing Teams – Scott Dixon (Sean Rayhall)
• KVSH Racing – Sebastien Bourdais (Ryan Phinny)
• Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing – Graham Rahal (Ed Jones)
• Schmidt Peterson Motorsports – Ryan Briscoe (Jack Harvey)
• Team Penske – Juan Pablo Montoya, Will Power (Spencer Pigot, Nelson Piquet Jr.)
According to Rule 6.2.3 of the 2015 Verizon IndyCar Series rulebook: Teams are allocated two additional team test days for the purpose of testing a current Indy Lights driver. On-track time may be split with a team driver, but a team driver may not use more than 50 percent of the available track time.
The test day is open to the public.
Brabham drove an Andretti Autosport Indy car July 1 at Iowa Speedway alongside Andretti, and other Indy Lights drivers periodically test in a Verizon IndyCar Series car. But this is the first large-scale in-season test day.
“This is exactly what we've wanted to have happened with the program,” said Dan Andersen, owner and CEO of Andersen Promotions, which operates Indy Lights under INDYCAR sanctioning. “We appreciate INDYCAR enabling this with its testing regulations and to encourage it. To see these drivers getting this opportunity is rewarding for them and exciting for us. It's what the program is all about; we want to see them make it to the Verizon IndyCar Series.”
Indy Lights Presented by Cooper Tires is the third and final step on the Mazda Road to Indy driver and team development ladder. The Indy Lights champion is awarded a $750,000 scholarship toward the Verizon IndyCar Series with three guaranteed races, including the Indianapolis 500, in 2016.
Harvey, who drives for Schmidt Peterson Motorsports, takes a six-point lead over Pigot (Juncos Racing) and an 18-point lead over Jones (Carlin) into the championship-deciding doubleheader race weekend Sept. 11-13 at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, Calif.
“The test could be valuable for next year,” said Harvey, the Englishman in his second season with Schmidt Peterson Motorsports. “I could show (a Verizon IndyCar Series team) that they could trust me with their car, I can be fast and provide the proper feedback.”
Added Pigot, 21, of Orlando, Fla., who won the 2014 Pro Mazda championship: “It's something that I've been working toward for quite a few years and climbing the Mazda Road to Indy has prepared me for it. I'm excited to get behind the wheel. Winning the Indy Lights championship is the No. 1 goal through the middle of September, and obviously the goal is to move up to IndyCar next year. This (test) could help my chances for next year.”
Sam Schmidt, who co-owns the team that operates a four-car Indy Lights program and a two-car Verizon IndyCar Series program, said the goals of the test day are to make the No. 5 car driven by Briscoe competitive for the Aug. 30 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma to keep the entry in the top 10 of entrant points and give Harvey “a taste” of driving the Honda-powered car.
“We're hoping he can win the championship, which would lead to the scholarship and moving up next year in some capacity,” said Schmidt, who has seven Indy Lights championships as a team owner. “It's always good to start that process as early as possible.
“It's one of the incentives that INDYCAR built into the program and hopefully it will expand with other IndyCar teams.”
The list of Verizon IndyCar Series drivers testing at the venue that will host the championship-deciding race includes six of the 10 drivers mathematically eligible for the title. The 85-lap, high-stakes race carries double points, with 100 awarded to the winner, 80 for second, 70 for third, etc., along with the regular four bonus points over three categories (Verizon P1 Award winner, leading a lap, leading the most laps).
Montoya holds a nine-point advantage over Rahal entering the penultimate race of the season Aug. 23 at Pocono Raceway. Dixon, who won last August at Sonoma Raceway, is 34 points out of first place.
“INDYCAR is doing a good job to promote the ladder series, and the rules that allow IndyCar drivers a test day with an Indy Lights driver is an example,” Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing team manager Ricardo Nault said. “We'll be splitting the day with Ed Jones, not only per the rules, but to give him the opportunity to help us develop the car and give him some time driving.
“Being second in the championship, we want to put our best foot forward and give it our best chance. We'd be behind if we didn't go there. We have to maximize every opportunity.”
TEL AVIV – Israeli vacationers were given blue wristbands differentiating them from other guests at a five-star resort in Rhodes, Greece, Israel's Channel 10 reported on Sunday.
The Imperial Hotel distributes plastic tags that allow access to the resort's facilities, yet only Israelis were given blue ones, the report said.
A hotel representative told Channel 10's investigative duo Orly Vilnai and Guy Meroz that the colors were arbitrary and simply identify the country of origin.
However, the two reporters revealed that the rest of the guests were given bracelets in a range of colors, regardless of their country of origin.
“I was unaware of this incident,” Yehuda Zafrani, an Israeli adviser to air carriers said. “When it happens and everyone keeps quiet, nothing changes. Vacation package deal providers must be made aware of this story so something can change.”
“This policy is discriminatory and harmful,” he added.
Hotels in the Israeli resort town of Eilat also provide different-colored wristbands to their guests, but these simply indicate the date of their arrival at the hotel.
Earlier this year, Rhodes Tourism Deputy Mayor Marisa Chatzilazarou called her country “the favorite destination of Israelis” while speaking at Israel's International Tourism Fair.
In 2015 alone, 102,705 Israelis visited Rhodes, Chatzilazarou claimed.
Rhodes' fifth largest pool of tourists is comprised of Israelis, surpassed only by England, Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Due to its status as one of the safest tourist destinations, Israelis choose Rhodes as their number one vacation choice.
In February we posted a teaser of Scott Toepfer's short film ‘Better in the Wind'. After a year of filming a stack of road trips, 50 hours of editing, a shit load of memory cards and enough Super-8 film to safely tie up a particularly large and angry bear, the film has finally been finished. To say this has been a labor of love is an understatement. Scott funded the film by selling his ‘Better in the Wind' book online, which literally made it possible to keep his bike on the road and keep filming. “I've been selling my little paperback via Blurb for the past 8 months or so, which has helped me keep my XS650 running enough to make it through the trips” says Scott. “Blown head gasket, broken mufflers, tail lights, headlights, bars, chains… that damn XS is my baby but without the support of those people who have picked up a copy of the book, I wouldn't have been able to ride/shoot and pay the bills at home”.
You won't find any special effects in the film. No Hollywood actors. No unbelievable ending. “Just a group of guys planning road trips, me trying to record it the best I could, becoming good friends in the process, and trying to get it out there on a positive note,” says Scott. “There are tons of opinions on what is what, who is who, and where the motorcycle culture should go… but really at the base of the argument is that we all take the sport/recreation of riding personally (hence we all hold it to our chests), and it means something to us in a positive way… so why not try and reflect the simple joy of it. We as motorcyclists can bitch all we want, and while most of us are strangers, we're still most likely buds when crossing paths on the road”. Here here.
[Scott would like to give a special thanks to Brandon Schrichten, Jason at Dime City Cycles, musician Chuck Ragan and everyone that bought his book. And we'd like to thank Scott for letting us have the honor of being the first site to show the final product. Hats off to you, sir!]
The US Navy relies heavily on gas turbine engines to power both aircraft and ships, spending about $2 billion (with a “b”… or about one tenth of NASA's entire budget last year) every year on fuel for them. Even a small reduction in fuel consumption would save millions of dollars, but future engines also need to meet increasing demands for power.
Nearly all commercial aircraft—and plenty of power plants—use gas turbines, so we've spent a lot of time optimizing their designs. This means that trying to continue to improve them will only eke out a few more percentage points of efficiency. In order to reach both the increased power levels and reduced fuel consumption the Navy wants—10 percent and 25 percent, respectively—we've got to come up with entirely new engine designs. (Just like automotive engineers, as we recently featured.)
Any new technology that the Navy develops could also be used in civilian aircraft and power plants. For a little perspective, US airlines spent over $50 billion on fuel last year.
With that in mind, a team at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), led by Dr. Kazhikathra Kailasanath, are developing rotating detonation engines, which should offer the higher efficiency and power output desired.
Gas turbines operate on the Brayton cycle, which consists of three steps. First, a compressor raises the pressure of the incoming air. Then, fuel is injected and mixes with the air, then burns, heating everything up. Since the system is open—rather than in a closed cylinder—this process occurs at a nearly constant pressure. Finally, this hot pressurized gas expands through a nozzle to generate thrust, either for propulsion or to push a turbine and generate electricity.
The main limitation to performance is the combustion step. Like nearly every other type of burning experienced in day-to-day life, it is a deflagration, where the flame propagates at a subsonic speed.
A detonation is a flame where the reacting gases release so much energy so quickly that the burning mixture moves faster than the speed of sound, driving a shock wave. Unlike a deflagration, a detonation significantly raises the pressure, increasing the available work—without requiring any additional mechanical components. Essentially, using a detonation allows you to reach much higher efficiencies.
While concepts for engines using detonation go all the way back to Robert Goddard and even Jules Verne, practical research beginning in the 1990s focused on the pulse detonation engine (PDE) design. As the name suggests, pulsed explosions shoot out of the nozzle for thrust, 20–100 times a second. That may sound crazy, but a number of experimental PDE engines have been developed, and the US Air Force Research Laboratory even successfully flew a plane with one.
However, there are a couple of difficulties that have prevented PDEs from reaching the high efficiencies they promised. For one thing, it's tricky to initiate a detonation repeatedly at these rates—many times a second. (You can check out our previous report on the transition from deflagration to detonation for a more detailed explanation of those challenges.)
Rotating detonation engines, or RDEs, offer a solution to that problem. Micro-injectors squirt a pressurized mixture of fuel and air into a combustion chamber the shape of a long ring (annular cylinder). Then, this gas mixture explodes, with the explosion spinning around the circumference at supersonic speeds. The high pressure produced by the detonation forces exhaust gases down and out of the chamber, where they expand through a nozzle and produce thrust that can be used to push a turbine or aircraft.
Unlike a PDE, which requires repeatedly initiating detonations, an RDE only requires one detonation that spins around and around the chamber, continuously producing thrust.
Of course, there are a number of challenges with this design as well. The materials must be able to withstand the high pressure and temperature from the detonation. Also, the detonation occurs right near the injector inlets, where the strong pressure could actually push gases backwards.
To further complicate matters, since this is a relatively new concept, we don't really understand (yet) the forces and heat fluxes that the combustion chamber experiences, making it difficult to optimize the design. By conducting simulations of RDEs with various fuels, researchers at NRL are trying to better understand the flow physics inside the combustion chamber. In a recent paper, simulation results showed that RDEs fueled with different hydrocarbons could reach fuel efficiencies, measured in specific impulse, of 85 to 89 percent of an ideal detonation cycle.
The US Navy isn't the only group pursuing these types of engines. Researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington and Russia's Lavrentyev Institute of Hydrodynamics have also explored RDEs experimentally. Hopefully, in a few years, this progress will lead to a working engine.

A catholic priest has been arrested by Italian police after he took part in a noisy cocaine party.
Life in the quiet village of Carciano, on the scenic shores of the Lake Maggiore, was shaken as worshippers learned that the local parish priest has been arrested by police with a considerable amount of the drug in the fashion capital of Milan.
Father Stefano Maria Cavalletti had gone missing over the weekend, leaving his flock to wonder what had happened to the 45-year-old clergyman.
Another priest was urgently called in to replace him for Sunday mass and celebrate two weddings in the small church of Saint Joseph and Blaise, a popular spot for marrying couples due to its breath-taking view on the glittering waters of the lake and the beautiful Borromean islands.
The mystery surrounding Father Cavalletti's whereabouts was solved after a few days, as local church authorities received a call from the prison chaplain of Milan's infamous San Vittore jail.
The priest had been brought there at night and was now under arrest, charged with possession of illegal drugs with intention of dealing.
Father Cavalletti was detained after security forces raided a house where some of his friends lived.
Police had been called by disturbed neighbours who could not sleep because of loud screams and shouts coming from the flat.
The noise was reportedly caused by an intoxicated man who had lost his temper.
As authorities arrived, Father Cavalletti allegedly tore his passport into pieces and attempted to flush it down the toilet together with a quantity cocaine.
Other evidence of the drug were found scattered around the flat, as well as large amounts of cash and female clothing - although police said only men were at premises when they arrived.
Later, the priest told detectives he had been using cocaine as a self-prescribed remedy against depression since he was found guilty of fraud last year.
In 2013 Cavalletti was handed a five-month suspended sentence over accusations he abused his religious office to deceive an elderly woman into donating him €22,000 (£17,000).
The diocese of Novara said they were "bewildered and pained" upon learning that one of their priests had been arrested.
"We entrust him to God in prayer and wait for light to be shed on the incident," the diocese said.
Possession of drugs for personal use is not a crime in Italy. However, if they are found in large quantities, there is a legal presumption that the owner intends to deal part of it.
There was a time when the merest mention of gold manipulation in "reputable" media was enough to have one branded a perpetual conspiracy theorist with a tinfoil farm out back. That was roughly coincident with a time when Libor, FX, mortgage, and bond market manipulation was also considered unthinkable, when High Frequency Traders were believed to "provide liquidity", or when the stock market was said to not be manipulated by the Fed, and when the ever-confused media, always eager to take "complicated" financial concepts at the face value set by a self-serving establishment, never dared to question anything. Luckily, all that changed in the past several years, and it has gotten to the point where even the bastions of "serious", if 3-5 years delayed, investigation are finally not only asking how is the gold market being manipulated, but are actually providing answers.
Such as Bloomberg.
The topic of gold market manipulation during the London AM fix is not new to Zero Hedge: in fact we have discussed both the historical basis and the raison d'etre of the London gold fix, as well as the curious arbitrage available to those who merely traded the AM-PM spread, for years. Which is why we are delighted that none other than Bloomberg has decided to break it down for everyone, as well as summarize all the ways in which just this one facet of gold trading is being manipulated.
Bloomberg begins:
Every business day in London, five banks meet to set the price of gold in a ritual that dates back to 1919. Now, dealers and economists say knowledge gleaned on those calls could give some traders an unfair advantage when buying and selling the precious metal. The London fix, the benchmark rate used by mining companies, jewelers and central banks to buy, sell and value the metal, is published twice daily after a telephone call involving Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of Nova Scotia, HSBC Holdings Plc and Société Générale SA. The fix dates back to September 1919, less than a year after the end of World War I, when representatives from five dealers met at Rothschild's office on St. Swithin's Lane in London's financial district. It was suspended for 15 years, starting in 1939. While Rothschild pulled out in 2004 and the discussions now take place by telephone instead of in a wood-paneled room at the bank, the process remains much the same.
That much is known. What is certainly known is that any process that involves five banks sitting down (until recently literally) and exchanging information using arcane methods (such as a telephone), on a set schedule that involves a private information blackout phase, even if temporary, and that does not involve instant market feedback, can and will be gamed. "Traders involved in this price-determining process have knowledge which, even for a short time, is superior to other people's knowledge,” said Thorsten Polleit, chief economist at Frankfurt-based precious-metals broker Degussa Goldhandel GmbH and a former economist at Barclays. “That is the great flaw of the London gold-fixing."
There are other flaws.
Participants on the London call can tell whether the price of gold is rising or falling within a minute or so, based on whether there are a large number of net buyers or sellers after the first round, according to gold traders, academics and investors interviewed by Bloomberg News. It's this feature that could allow dealers and others in receipt of the information to bet on the direction of the market with a high degree of certainty minutes before the fix is made public, they said.
Yes, the broader momentum creation and ignition perspective is also known to most. At least most who never believed the boilerplate that unlike all other asset classes, gold is somehow immune from manipulation.
“Information trickles down from the five banks, through to their clients and finally to the broader market,” Andrew Caminschi, a lecturer at the University of Western Australia in Perth and co-author of a Sept. 2 paper on trading spikes around the London gold fix published online in the Journal of Futures Markets, said by phone. “In a world where trading advantage is measured in milliseconds, that has some value.”
Ah, hypothetical - smart. One mustn't ruffle feathers before, like in the case of Libor, it becomes fact that everyone was in on it.
There's no evidence that gold dealers sought to manipulate the London fix or worked together to rig prices, as traders did with Libor. Even so, economists and academics say the way the benchmark is set is outdated, vulnerable to abuse and lacking any direct regulatory oversight. “This is one of the most concerning fixings I have seen,” said Rosa Abrantes-Metz, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business whose 2008 paper, “Libor Manipulation?” helped spark a global probe. “It's controlled by a handful of firms with a direct financial interest in where it's set, and there is virtually no oversight -- and it's based on information exchanged among them during undisclosed calls.”
Unless we are wrong, there was no evidence of Libor manipulative collusion before there was evidence either. And since the cabal of the London gold fix is far smaller than the member banks of Libor, it is exponentially easier to confine intent within an even smaller group of people. But all that is also known to most.
As is the fact that when asked for comments, 'spokesmen for Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Société Générale declined to comment about the London fix or the regulatory probes, as did Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for the FCA, and Steve Adamske at the CFTC. Joe Konecny, a spokesman for Bank of Nova Scotia, wrote in an e-mail that the Toronto-based company has “a deeply rooted compliance culture and a drive to continually look toward ways to improve our existing processes and practices."
Next, Bloomberg conveniently goes into the specifics of just how the gold price is manipulated first by the fixing banks, then by their "friends and neighbors" as news of the fixing process unfolds.
At the start of the call, the designated chairman -- the job rotates annually among the five banks -- gives a figure close to the current spot price in dollars for an ounce of gold. The firms then declare how many bars of the metal they wish to buy or sell at that price, based on orders from clients as well as their own account. If there are more buyers than sellers, the starting price is raised and the process begins again. The talks continue until the buy and sell amounts are within 50 bars, or about 620 kilograms, of each other. The procedure is carried out twice a day, at 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. in London. Prices are set in dollars, pounds and euros. Similar gauges exist for silver, platinum and palladium. The traders relay shifts in supply and demand to clients during the calls and take fresh orders to buy or sell as the price changes, according to the website of London Gold Market Fixing, which publishes the results of the fix.
.. only this time the manipulation is no longer confined to a purely theoretical plane and instead empirical evidence of the fixing leak is presented based on academic research:
Caminschi and Richard Heaney, a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Western Australia, analyzed two of the most widely traded gold derivatives: gold futures on Comex and State Street Corp.'s SPDR Gold Trust, the largest bullion-backed exchange-traded product, from 2007 through 2012. At 3:01 p.m., after the start of the call, trading surged to 47.8 percent above the average for the 20-minute period preceding the start of the fix and remained 20 percent higher for the next six minutes, Caminschi and Heaney found. By comparison, trading was 8.7 percent higher than the average a minute after publication of the price. The results showed a similar pattern for the SPDR Gold Trust. “Intuitively, we expect volumes to spike following the introduction of information to the market” when the final result is published, Caminschi and Heaney wrote in “Fixing a Leaky Fixing: Short-Term Market Reactions to the London P.M. Gold Price Fixing.” “What we observe in our analysis is a clustering of trades immediately following the fixing start.” The researchers also assessed how accurate movements in gold derivatives were in predicting the final fix. Between 2:59 p.m. and 3 p.m., the direction of futures contracts matched the direction of the fix about half the time. From 3:01 p.m., the success rate jumped to 69.9 percent, and within five minutes it had climbed to 80 percent, Caminschi and Heaney wrote. On days when the gold price per ounce moved by more than $3, gold futures successfully predicted the outcome in more than nine out of 10 occasions. “Not only are the trades quite accurate in predicting the fixing direction, the more money that is made by way of a larger price change, the more accurate the trade becomes,” Caminschi and Heaney wrote. “This is highly suggestive of information leaking from the fixing to these public markets.”
Oh please, 9 out of 10 times is hardly indicative of any wrongdoing. After all, JPM lost money on, well, zero trading days in all of 2013, and nobody cares. So if a coin landing heads about 200 times in a row is considered normal by regulators, then surely the CTFC will find nothing wrong with a little gold manipulation here and there. Manipulation, which it itself previously said did not exist. But everyone already knew that too.
Cynicism aside, to claim that this clearly gamed process is not in fact gamed, not to say criminally manipulated (because it is never manipulation unless one is caught in the act by enforcers who are actually not in on the scheme) is the height of idiocy. Which is why we are certain that regulators will go precisely this route. That too is also largely known. Also known are the benefits for traders who abuse the London fix:
For derivatives traders, the benefits are clear: A dealer who bought 500 gold futures contracts at 3 p.m. and knew the fix was going higher could make $200,000 for his firm if the price moved by $4, the average move in the sample. While the value of 500 contracts totals about $60 million, traders may buy on margin, a process that involves borrowing and requires placing less capital for the bet. On a typical day, about 4,500 futures contracts are traded between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m., according to Caminschi and Heaney.
Finally what is certainly known is that the "London fixing" fix would be very simple in our day and age of ultramodern technology, and require a few minutes of actual implementation.
Abrantes-Metz, who helped Iosco formulate its guidelines, said the gold fix's shortcomings may stretch beyond giving firms and clients access to privileged information. “There is a huge incentive for these banks to try and influence where the benchmark is set depending on their trading positions, and there is almost no scrutiny,” she said. Abrantes-Metz said the gold fix should be replaced with a benchmark calculated by taking a snapshot of trading in a market where $19.6 trillion of the precious metal circulated last year, according to CPM Group, a New York-based research company. “There's no reason why data cannot be collected from actual prices of spot gold based on floor or electronic trading,” she said. “There's more than enough data.”
Which is precisely why nothing will change. Sadly, that is also widely known.
So did Bloomberg put together an exhaustive article in which virtually everything was known a priori? it turns out the answer is no: we learned one thing.
London Gold Market Fixing Ltd., a company controlled by the five banks that administers the benchmark, has no permanent employees. A call from Bloomberg News was referred to Douglas Beadle, 68, a former Rothschild banker, who acts as a consultant to the company from his home in Caterham, a small commuter town 45 minutes south of London by train. Beadle declined to comment on the benchmark-setting process.
You learn something new every day (incidentally, the same Douglas Beadle who acted as a consultant to the LBMA until March 2010 and was involved from the outset in the project to find a suitable scale for the electronic weighing of gold as documented in "Electronic Weighing of Gold - A Success Story").
A man is dragged out of City Square by force. Credit:Megan Levy About 100 Occupy Melbourne demonstrators, who had camped out in the City Square for a week as part of global protests against corporate greed, defied an order to leave by 9am.
A huge police contingent, including the riot squad, started dragging protesters out of the square about 11.30am and cleared the area within 10 minutes. Officers were dragging people along the ground and carrying others by their arms and legs and loading them into the back of police vans en masse while threats of arrest were met with chants of "we can't hear you!". While they were being cheered on by the crowd, protesters - still linking arms - retreated, with some crying and others clearly terrified. City Square has now been cleared of protesters, however hundreds of protesters have been forced to the middle of the intersection at Swanston and Bourke Streets, blocking trams through the CBD.

Credit:Megan Levy Greens MP Adam Bandt, the federal member for Melbourne, said calling on the riot police to intervene was a serious error by political leaders. "[Premier] Ted Baillieu and [Lord Mayor] Robert Doyle have made a huge blunder by sending in the police, turning a week-long non-violent protest into a site of confrontation," Mr Bandt said.

"We don't really want to engage in this sort of activity but we're not going to back down either," Mr Fontana said.
"We're trying to use the minimum amount of force as possible.
"They've [protesters] had more than ample time to make their point in terms of what their protest is about and I think it's time to give the City Square back to the citizens of Melbourne." Officers in riot gear stormed the makeshift tent city at the corner of Swanston and Collins streets at 11.30am, forcibly removing protesters from the square after about 100 defied a 9am eviction order from Melbourne City Council.

Protesters have called for people to join them at 9am. Credit:Megan Levy Police wearing helmets and carrying riot shields first moved into the square about 9.40am when the protesters, who are part of a global anti-greed movement spurred by the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in New York, tried to barricade themselves inside the camp, where they had spent the past six days. They also built a wall using upturned chairs, shelves and tables salvaged from the camp.
Some tents were dismantled, which organisers said would be erected at a new location soon. Melbourne City Council officers arrived at the square at 7am to tell the group they had two hours to pack up and leave. Pamphlets were also handed out. The council says the protest and occupation fails to comply with the council's Activities Local Law 2009, by camping in the square and hanging or placing objects over it. Cr Doyle said traders were suffering and events planned for the square had been disrupted by the week-long demonstration. But Nick Carson, a spokesman for Occupy Melbourne, vowed that "people will stay". "People will be arrested," he said, as protesters around him chanted "We are the 99 per cent".
Earlier, organisers used loudspeakers to urge the protesters to call everyone they knew to join the protest before the 9am deadline and passed around marker pens to write the mobile phone number of a legal service on their arms in preparation for arrest. Mr Doyle this morning said authorities were ready if the situation got "ugly". "I suppose the crunch comes at nine o'clock. We're prepared," Mr Doyle told 3AW. "[The protesters] have been saying all throughout the week... that when lawfully asked to move, they would vacate the square. Well, we've given them a fair go. We've allowed them to make their point." "The time has come for us to return City Square to the people of Melbourne."
Mr Doyle said a fence would be used to try to keep others from joining the protest at the makshift camp, which he said had been taken over by "professional protesters" in recent days. While some protesters packed up their tents in the rain and moved on, most remained steadfast. Passers-by watched the unfolding drama from the neighbouring Starbucks coffee outlet, where they turned chairs outside the front of the store to face the action. However at 8.30am, as yet more police moved in, Starbucks staff began packing up and said the store was closing. A woman who demanded to be allowed entry to the protest was blocked by police.
Angry protesters began shouting and shaking fences as she was taken away by police. Lachlan Gifford, an Occupy Melbourne spokesman, said the protest would spring up in other public places in Melbourne if they were forcibly removed. "What Robert Doyle hasn't figured out yet is that, regardless of what happens here today, and even if the police and Robert Doyle are successful (in removing them), this won't be the end of it," he said. "Eviction is a very short term thing. "We will move next door to the church. This is going to get bigger in one way or another.
"There's this underlying dissatisfaction. People are not happy about the gap between haves and the have nots." Loading - with AAP

Before jumping into this list, consider watching Connor's Tengu part (if you haven't already). It'll give you all the reference points you'll need to understand the reasoning behind this list.
“I put together this write-up of the shoes that I used in the Tengu part. It's hard to know where to draw the line with supporting skate companies. I definitely feel an obligation to support skateboarder-owned companies that make skateboards, trucks and wheels. And I think it's important to support companies whose production factories are connected in some way to skateboarding. If there were a Chinese skateboard company whose factory was staffed by skaters in China, I would back it wholly. The trend of everything being produced abroad by workers who are taken advantage of for their cheap labor is disconcerting. Of course this problem is bigger than the skateboarding industry, but skateboard companies have become a part of it. Luckily, somehow, many good decks, wheel and truck companies still produce everything in the US despite the smaller profit margin. We should support them. I don't feel any obligation to support skate clothing companies. I doubt anyone really does. Consolidated isn't going to come out with a smear campaign against Dickies. If skater-owned companies make nice clothes and do well, I'm really happy for them as a fellow skateboarder, but it's not my duty to buy their products. Skate shoes lie somewhere between the board and clothing. Literally, they're directly between them. The only thing that makes them lean to one side is the fact that they're all produced in factories abroad (China, Vietnam, etc) because the labor is cheap. Whether they're Nike or Lakai, I'm pretty sure they were actually hand-made by someone who couldn't care less about skateboarding. Don't get me wrong, I don't begrudge the factory workers or the companies for doing what they have to in order to produce competitively-priced shoes. But I don't know if I feel an obligation to support the skater-owned shoe companies either. Would I rather Mike Carroll and Rick Howard turn a profit off skate shoes made in China than Mark Parker? Certainly. Am I going to let that stop me from buying some $10 Nikes at Goodwill if they look good for skating? Probably not. Skaters have been trying out all kinds of shoes since skating started and there's nothing wrong with that. And if Vans is going to do this with my money, I'd rather give it to someone else anyway.”

————————————————
These shoes were hands-down the worst of the bunch. The soles were felt, the footbed was cardboard and the glue came apart after a few days of skating in them. They were $19, but weren't worth it. After this shoe's trial and error, I should have known better.
Asics also have a pretty long history as adopted skate shoes. The first person I saw skating in them was Alex Hansen, but I'm sure people have been using them a long time. Japanese God Takahiro Morita is even sponsored by them, and has been for years. I heard that they were working on a skate team in Japan, but I also heard it went off the tracks somewhere. Most people I know who skate Asics in Japan use the Fabre BL-S. As far as vulcanized shoes go, they're amazing. The suede upper lasts long, the rubber is perfect and strangely long-lasting and the sole takes a long time to wear out. The Fabre DC-S is the cupsole version and they're also great.
These shoes, like the Timberland chukkas, had rubber that was a little harder than normal skate shoes. They lasted a long time and felt good but weren't quite as grippy as skate shoes should be. The footbed under the insole was also made of particleboard or something, and came apart after a while. Well worth it at $19, but not ideal.
I got these at Unique on Fulton street in Brooklyn for 8 dollars. Apparently they were a horrible flop for Airwalk and Payless when they came out, but I don't understand why. They were cheap and felt the same as the original Airwalk Ones, which are classics. A few years ago you could buy all-black Ones at Payless for $20, but those were terrible. They suffered from the worst thing you can come across when looking for cheap skate shoes, felt soles. This is what keeps Converse at Target, Polo shoes and many others from being decent skate shoes. It seems that the reason cheap shoes have felt soles is so they can be categorized as slippers and save companies on import taxes. Airwalk has reissued a lot of shoes now separate from Payless and they're great. I hope that goes well for them and one day they reissue the Jason Lee's or Tony Hawk's.
Another pair of shoes not to be messed with unless you find them on sale since they retail new for about 90 dollars. I found them for 40 at Marshalls or something. They felt great and lasted long. The laces are up high and never rip, the rubber is grippy and thick, and wingtips are coincidentally perfectly suited for toe and ollie area protection. The only downside is that there is no padding at all in the collar.
I got these at the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama. It's a place where they sell everything collected from airline luggage that's never claimed. There's a lot of interesting stuff there, including the Hoggle puppet/suit from Labyrinth. Someone must have checked a bag with these shoes in it and never picked it up. They're about as durable as vulcanized shoes get. There are rubber caps all over, and anything that's not rubber is thick suede. They're heavy, but have good board feel typical of vulcanized shoes and the sole will go before anything else.
I got a lot of use out of these shoes not because they were very durable, but because they felt great. There's a slight rubber toecap that's really grippy and makes it so the toe area doesn't blow out fast. You'll probably have to superglue a patch of suede to the side because the canvas in the ollie area goes quickly. The sole went kind of quickly too comparable to Vans vulcanized shoes. The soles are also really thin, so you may need to switch out the insoles.
Despite being canvas, these shoes were really durable. The canvas was thick and multi-layered, so it took a long time to deteriorate. The sole was really thick and outlasted the upper. They also have a thing like Adidas skate shoes where the heel is thicker than the forefoot so you can have some heel padding and still feel your board. I stopped using them after the ollie area got a hole in it and the grip at the toe wore down too much, but it took a long time. One complaint is that the rubber doesn't stay very grippy for long. It may be that the rubber used in these shoes is a little harder than what is generally used in skate shoes, so it takes longer to wear down but doesn't grip as well. Also, if you don't find them on sale at 60% off like I did, they're probably not worth it because they're expensive at retail price.
On March 16 of 2009, the governments of Brunei and Malaysia exchanged letters that essentially meant Brunei had abandoned its claim to a nondescript 7,800 square kilometer patches of mud flats and mangrove swamps called Limbang, which had been claimed by both for two decades.
Over the last three months, however, the agreement appears to have blown up in Malaysia's face with accusations that two exploration blocks in the South China Sea which were ceded to Brunei in the letters may contain anywhere from 1 billion to 4 billion barrels of crude. Thus, at the current price of US$74.20 per barrel, critics argue, Malaysia may have ceded anywhere from US$74.2 billion to US$296.8 billion in revenues to the tiny sultanate – or more. Crude hit a record US$147.27 per barrel on July 11, 2008, before falling back as the world financial crisis hit.
This has set off a political squabble in Malaysia, with the 84-year-old former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad using it as a cudgel to once again beat up on Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the successor he came to revile as premiere, for signing the letters of exchange. The governments of the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, which would claim the oil, say their state assemblies were never consulted, a violation of parliamentary procedure and constitutionality.
In addition, Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim of the Pakatan Rakyat coalition and his ally Lim Kit Siang, head of the opposition Democratic Action Party, are blasting away at Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, who was deputy prime minister and essentially running the cabinet in the waning days of Badawi's reign, which ended only a month after the agreements were signed. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a rebel elder statesman inside the United Malays National Organisation, has criticized the agreement. Hassan Marican, the former chief executive officer of Petronas, called it a treasonous activity.
Limbang nearly cuts Brunei in half on Borneo's north coast but it effectively belongs to the Malaysian state of Sarawak. The signing appeared to close one of Southeast Asia's longest-running minor border disputes and was claimed as a diplomatic triumph, settling a sea boundary delineation dispute which had held up oil and gas exploration off the two countries' mutual coasts as well as enabling the two to form a united front against China's claims over the entire South China Sea. Even today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lays claims to Malaysia's Layang-Laying, an atoll roughly 300 km from the coast of Sabah and 1,800 km from Hainan, China's most southerly inhabited island.
The disposition of the two blocks is important to both countries. Malaysia is estimated to become a net oil importer by 2011 if it does not find more reserves, and Brunei's fields, which have for decades made it the richest nation on a per capita basis in Southeast Asia, are fast depleting. A 2006 study by Rabobank, the Dutch financial services provider, said Brunei's wells will run dry in 2015—just a bit over five years from now. A 2003 study by the World Markets Research Centre puts the end of the gravy train a year earlier, 2014.
The controversy surfaced when Murphy Oil, the Arkansas-based exploration company working with Petronas Carigali, Petronas's exploration and production unit, issued a press release on April 21 saying that it had been informed by Petronas that "following the execution of the Exchange of Letters between Malaysia and the Sultanate of Brunei on March 16, 2009, the offshore exploration areas designated as Block L and Block M are no longer a part of Malaysia" and that Murphy was terminating its production sharing contracts.
"We have absolutely no comment beyond what was in our news release," said Mindy West, Murphy's vice president for public relations, in an email.
The Murphy Oil announcement set off Mahathir, who charged on April 29 in his popular blog Che Det, which is read widely in Malaysia, that "Abdullah has caused Malaysia to lose at least US$100 billion dollars (about RM320 billion) of Malaysia's oil in this agreement. Can Wisma Putra please explain why it did not stop Abdullah?"
Mahathir is still smarting from a book written by former Asian Wall Street Journal editor Barry Wain, which accused the former premier of wasting as much as US$40 billion at exchange rates at the time on grandiose projects and corruption. Today, every chance he gets, he brings up the amount of money Badawi allegedly wasted or lost to corruption.
"Having given up on Block L and M so easily, especially to a small country like Brunei, we will have no chance with Indonesia, in the contest over the Ambalat Oilfields," said an aide to Anwar. Last May, warships from Indonesia and Malaysia challenged each other repeatedly in disputed oil-rich Ambalat territories of the Celebes Sea east of Borneo, with Indonesian navy officials saying they were minutes away from firing on the Malaysians, which they charged were 12 nautical miles inside Indonesian territory. Both countries have awarded oil concessions to Shell, Unocal, and ENI respectively in the disputed region.
But it appears that the storm in Kuala Lumpur is political rather than international, and probably confined to the local political arena. The government insists that under the agreement signed by Badawi a year ago, Petronas, the national oil company, will engage in joint exploration and exploitation of the two blocks with Brunei.
In fact it appears unclear if the two blocks were every Malaysia's to give away. The agreement appears to settle a deadlock over the two blocks that has existed since at least 2003, when Malaysia awarded the two blocks to Petronas Carigali and Murphy Oil in an effort to assert its claim over the area. That was immediately met with a Bruneian gunboat which drove Murphy's craft out of the area. A month later, the Malaysian Navy blocked the arrival of a ship owned by Total, one of six companies to which Brunei had awarded a competing concession. The dispute in fact kept all of the companies from drilling for anything.
The two competing oil exploration companies seem to believe cooperation will go forward. Nobody seems to have read the last sentence in the Murphy Oil statement to the New York Stock Exchange, which said that "Murphy's potential participation in replacement production sharing contracts covering these areas is under discussion."
In addition, in a statement on its own website, Total, the French oil operator in league with the Brunei government to operate in Blocks L and M, said that the company "also remains optimistic pending the result of oil sharing negotiations between Brunei and Malaysia to resolve a dispute over the ownership of two large oil exploration blocks in the deepwater exploration areas in South China Sea. This optimistic message was presented in a telephone conversation by Yves Grosjean, the newly assigned general manager for the two Total affiliates in Brunei Darussalam."
Both countries might want to make sure their respective environmental agencies are capable of monitoring the undersea drilling to make sure there isn't a blowout like the one in the Gulf of Mexico, in which a deep sea well controlled by BP is spewing thousands of barrels of oil per day into the waters in what could end up one of the biggest manmade environmental disasters of all time.
Up until the moment he died, Roger Ailes wanted to stage a grand comeback—and he wanted Steve Bannon's help in doing it.
Shortly before the disgraced and ousted Fox News founder and CEO passed away earlier this month, he had reached out to President Donald Trump's chief strategist to join him in launching what he hoped would be the next right-wing media empire, The Daily Beast can confirm.
On Wednesday morning, Axios first reported on that in “his final days, Ailes sent a message to Steve Bannon in the White House that he'd love to team up on a new conservative media powerhouse”—a news and commentary entity that would ideally outflank Fox News from the right.
Since his ouster amid sexual-harassment allegations and scandal, Ailes had felt his former network—which he masterminded and perfected as a conservative messaging operation—had drifted too far left and politically correct for his comfort.
But Bannon had “no desire to leave the White House. So Ailes' last big idea remained just that,” according to Axios' Mike Allen.
Two sources with direct knowledge of this discussion between Ailes and Bannon told The Daily Beast that Bannon was indeed interested in the ambitious project and flattered by Ailes's outreach, but elected to stay working in the West Wing for the time being.
According to one source familiar with the preliminary plans, Ailes had wished for Bannon to join him as an equal partner—or at least one of his top lieutenants—in getting the potential comeback and dream project off the ground. To an extent, Ailes wanted Bannon to also serve in some capacity as a news director of the right-wing media entity, which Ailes envisioned as a TV, radio, online, and multimedia empire shortly before his death.
Another source jokingly referred to the unrealized project as what could have been “Bannon TV.”
"It would have been wild," the source added.
“[Bannon]'s loyal to the president and is passionate about his work serving his administration,” another source said, regarding Bannon's decision to at the time stay in the Trump White House.
Over the years, Bannon—who previously led the influential right-wing, pro-Trump outlet Breitbart—maintained a close relationship with the late Fox News architect.
According to Politico, Bannon had previously worked, and directly coordinated, with Ailes and his team to try to discredit and undermine Ailes's enemies, including journalist Gabriel Sherman. Bannon, as is his professional and personal style, advised Ailes to completely “go to war.” Furthermore, Bannon had a cozy on-air relationship with Fox News, which covered and boosted his conservative documentaries.
However, Politico also reported last month that Bannon said that Breitbart's relationship with Fox began to sour after former Fox News host Megyn Kelly grilled candidate Trump during an early GOP primary debate.
“The big rift between Breitbart and Fox was all over Megyn Kelly. She was all over Trump nonstop,” Bannon recalled. “I told [Ailes] then, I said, ‘She's the devil, and she will turn on you.'”
In a way, Bannon's assessment wasn't wrong about Kelly's loyalties. Her allegations of sexual harassment significantly contributed to Ailes's downfall and has left Fox in her rearview mirror on her way to NBC stardom. Since at least July 2016, Bannon had been warning of Kelly's “insatiable ascent,” dubbing her the “‘ Eve Harrington' of Fox News ” at his flagship Breitbart.
Six minutes and one second. That was all it took for the 66 years of Khizr Khan's life to become an American moment.
It was not something that he could have anticipated. For years, he and his wife, Ghazala, had lived a rather quiet existence of common obscurity in Charlottesville, Va. He was known in circles that dealt with electronic discovery in legal proceedings. Another overlapping sphere was the rotating cast of cadets that passed through the Army R.O.T.C. program at the University of Virginia. His wife was a welcoming face to the customers of a local fabric store.
And the last dozen years for the Khans were darkened by their heartbreak over the death of a military son, Humayun, whose body lies in Arlington National Cemetery, his tombstone adorned with an Islamic crescent. Their grief brought them closer to a university and to a young woman in Germany whom their son loved. It also gave them a conviction and expanded the borders of their lives.
Some of their neighbors knew Mr. Khan liked to carry a $1 pocket Constitution around with him. In the Khan home, a stack of them always lay at the ready. Guests showed up and they were handed one, in the way other hosts might distribute a party favor. Mr. Khan wanted it to stimulate a conversation about liberty, a cherished topic of his. He liked to point out that he lives nearly in the shadow of Monticello, home of one of his heroes, Thomas Jefferson. Mrs. Khan liked to say, “We need Thomas Jefferson.”
In the past few weeks we've brought you playlists for the Supports, Warriors, and Specialists in the Nexus—all to help commemorate the arrival of the official Heroes of the Storm soundtrack. Now it's time for the big one: the Assassins.
Assassins. They're the heart of many a team that braves the Nexus—diving into battle and dancing back-and-forth with death (sometimes literally) to bring down their foes before anyone can slay their teammates. They might not take the brunt of damage like Warriors, or repair damage inflicted like their Support counterparts, but they certainly dish out the most damage. And at the end of the day, it's that barrage of damage-per-second that you always need to make it through the enemy team and destroy the core.
So what do these dealers or death put on their favorite mixtape? What does The Butcher bellow “FRESH MEAT” to the tune of when he's charging down a lane? Let's find out.
Alarak
Be Prepared by The Lion King OST
Alarak might not be quite as evil as Scar, but like the villainous lion from Disney's classic, the guy is always scheming. “For what?” you might ask. Who knows? But you better be prepared for something nefarious to go down whenever the Highlord of the Tal'darim is around.
Cassia
Wonder Woman's Wrath by Rupert Gregson-Williams
Cassia is the closest thing we have in the Nexus to Wonder Woman. It's only proper that she get a song befitting a superhero. As with Taylor Swift swooping in to save Li Li in our Support playlist, we thank the good people behind Wonder Woman for their impeccable timing in showing their support for the Javazon.
Chromie
One More Time by Daft Punk
Chromie is, by far, one of the giddiest denizens of the Nexus. She loves to celebrate. And thanks to her time travelling and reversing capabilities, she can always celebrate something again if she wants to.
Falstad
Call Me the Breeze by Lynyrd Skynyrd
In his younger days, Falstad Wildhammer journeyed throughout Azeroth in search of glory and adventure. He's flown across the Great Sea, fought at Grim Batol to free the Red Dragon Queen Alexstrasza, and now serves on the Council of Three Hammers—in between Heroes matches, that is.
Genji
I Need Healing by Fat Buddha
If there's one thing we all know about Genji, it's that he needs healing. And he always needs it, really, really badly. Even when he's at full health! He might as well just steal a boombox from Lúcio and carry it around with him, playing the chorus of this song for all his allies to hear.
Greymane
Bark at the Moon by Ozzy Osbourne
Genn Greymane—the proud and often stubborn king of Gilneas—isolated his kingdom behind a mighty wall, turning his back on the Alliance. However, after the Worgen Curse struck Gilneas, Greymane realize he couldn't save his people alone. Nowadays he unleashes his inner beast upon opponents in the Nexus, howling into battle with the Prince of Darkness.
Gul'dan
Dangerous Power by Gabriel and Dresden
Gul'dan sided with a demon, quite literally, in exchange for the dangerous power of the fel. He betrayed his own people—and screwed over everyone else in Azeroth, too—just so he could have that power. And where did his betrayal get him, at the end of it all? “I tried, and I failed to teach you,” Gabriel & Dresden sing. If only the evil warlock had listened.
Illidan
What I've Done by Linkin Park
Illidan is the essence of angst. He lives a wounded life, one of constant pain and bitter anger for all the bad things he's done, all the people he's hurt along the way—but, more importantly to Illidan, all the bad things they have done to him. He might not seek absolution like the character in Linkin Park's song, necessarily, but he does seek redemption…just by, you know, getting very violent vengeance on those he doesn't like. He's also made a killer appearance at BlizzCon.
Jaina
Cold As Ice by Foreigner
Jaina might have a pleasant, even noble demeanor. But anyone who's gotten trapped in the Archmage's Ring of Frost knows that she shows no mercy to her foes. Well, at least she sometimes gives them a snow cone before they die.
Kael'thas
Disco Inferno by Trammps
Kael'thas loves to get down to some disco almost as much as he loves to set things on fire. Do you think he's ever stopped to ask himself why everyone runs in terror once he shows up on the dance floor?
Kerrigan
Killer Queen by Queen
Kerrigan might not have gunpowder, gelatin, or dynamite with a laser beam like the eponymous deadly monarch in this Queen ballad, but she's absolutely guaranteed to blow your mind. Plus, don't you think an Ultralisk is more powerful than any of those other things anyways?
Li-Ming
Violet by Hole
The opening track from Hole's Live Through This was written by frontwoman Courtney Love as a fierce breakup song—it's a roaring, screaming expression of her rage and contempt around the loss of her agency. Violet captures Li-Ming's defiant energy and unbridled passion—not to mention her iconic purple disintegration beam. The rebellious wizard's ray of face-melting energy might last just moments, but if you can trigger the resets and “give more violet to the violents,” the enemy team will feel like the purple death beams last forever.
Engage Li-Ming head-on at your peril . . . she wants you to. “Go on, take everything,”—she dares you to!
Lunara
Poison by Bell Biv Devoe
We've all been there: you're in the middle of a team fight when suddenly your health drops precariously low. Your healer isn't there. Or maybe they're just out of mana. So you run. The bad guys keep hitting you. Your health drops even lower. With one tiny sliver of HP left, you just make it back behind your towers where they can't hit you anymore . . . and then you die to Lunara's damage-over-time effect. Sing it with me now: That girl is pooooiiisssssonnnnn!!
Malthael
Don't Fear The Reaper by Blue Öyster Cult
Malthael, the Reaper incarnate, the Aspect of Death. He must be smiling to himself behind that creepy hood while he floats around the Nexus reaping souls with his twin scythes listening to Blue Öyster Cult on his headphones (it's easy to hide them behind his hood, just like his smile). “They told them not to fear the reaper,” he says, cackling to himself. “Little did they know!”
Nova
You Dropped a Bomb on Me by The Gap Band
The Gap Band's song is about a man falling for a woman despite (or maybe because of) the fact that she keeps dropping bombs on him. Nova might not have as many suitors in the Nexus since she can't seem to stop sneaking up to kill them, but she blows enough kisses that you know she's confident that special someone will come even if (or, really, when) she drops a bomb on them.
Ragnaros
Sleep Now in the Fire by Rage Against The Machine
Ragnaros keeps getting put to sleep in the Firelands, whether he wants to take a nap or not. While he unquestionably has a temper, nothing can match the righteous fury Zach de la Rocha brings to Rage Against the Machine. Maybe one day Ragnaros will be able to match Zach's anger and emerge from his lava prison for good—never to be forced to sleep in the fire again.
Raynor
Take Your Time by Sam Hunt
Sam Hunt's mournful country tune tells a story of him being in love with a woman, but choosing not to pursue her because he knows she's got a lot of other stuff going on in her life. Kerrigan being captured by the Overmind and transformed into a Zerg queen is probably the best example there is of someone having too many complications in their personal life to worry about landing a boyfriend. But just like Sam Hunt, Raynor was willing to wait as long as she needed.
Samuro
Copy of A by Nine-Inch Nails
Samuro loves to make copies of himself whenever he's in a tight situation. No doubt these clones have saved him many times over. But Trent Reznor's song raises a troubling question: how do you think the clones feel about all of this? Do you think the weaker Samuro clone likes being a “shadow of a shadow,” always trying to catch up with himself? Samuro usually escapes after summoning up his copies; they're the ones who are left to die.
The Butcher
Eaten by Bloodbath
Eaten is a song about a man who wants to be eaten. The Butcher loves to eat people. There is no better match made in hell or heaven. The Butcher wakes up to this song every morning and blasts it while brushing his teeth with a giant meat cleaver. He plays it on his commute to . . . wherever he goes to chop things. He will play it at his wedding, right before he eats his bride (or groom!). He will ask that it be played at his funeral, if he ever can be fully laid to rest.
Thrall
Ride The Lightning by Metallica
Thrall is a big fan of heavy metal. The Warchief of the Horde loves to ride the lightning every time he casts his Q—especially since that rework gave him all these new quest benefits for doing so.
Tracer
U Can't Touch This by MC Hammer
Who hasn't tried to chase down Tracer, infuriated by her steady stream of niggling but deadly damage, only to have her Blink out of your grasp again and again and . . . again? You can practically hear her teasing you with MC Hammer's signature beat as she zips away
Tychus
Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash
As a man who spent a significant part of his life caged within his own hulking metal space marine suit, Tychus knows to appreciate prison folk. Lucky for him he still managed to snag himself a cigar, just like the rich folk in Johnny Cash's historic prison song.
Valeera
I Disappear by The Faint
Valeera is pretty much unmatched when it comes to sneak attacks in Heroes of the Storm. You're in lane, just biding your time soaking up XP while you wait for the next objective. A small blur or shimmer in the wind might catch your eye. Before you can even wonder what it was, there she is: stabbing you from every which way. And before you even have a chance to respond, she disappears, “a burst of black, a breath of smoke.” The only difference between her and The Faint is you are usually the one who loses control after she shows up—because you're dead.
Valla
By Demons Be Driven by Pantera
As a Demon Hunter in Sanctuary, Valla has seen the worst of what happens when evil takes hold: Villagers left with their bones shattered, the purity of her people withered by demonic taint. Some are driven to ill deeds by demonic influence; Valla is driven to defend against it.
Zeratul
Da Mystery Of Chessboxin' by The Wu Tang Clan
From the shadows of the Korpulu Sector to the rugged lands of Shaolin, the Dark Prelate strikes again. Zeratul is unquestionably the most Wu Tang Hero in the Nexus. He's calm, quiet, and calculating in his every move, until he bursts forth, more deadly than the stroke of an axe. Choppin' through your back!
A game of chess is a perfect metaphor for the ninja blade battles the Protoss assassin enters into—you can deal more damage than almost anyone as Zeratul, but if you want to make it back out in one piece, you must think first before you move.
Zul'jin
Zul'jin is a real sucker for pain because, just like Kelly Clarkson, he knows that it will just make him all the stronger when he comes back swinging. Who knew Clarkson was such a big fan of berserkers?
So the Songs of the Storm winds to a close. But fear not, there are always more Heroes coming into the Nexus. So let us know what you think. Do you agree with our choices, or do you insist that Zeratul actually listens to Polka? Let us know what you think of the songs so far, and what you might have in mind for any future Heroes!
GREENFIELD, IN -- Jonathan Lawler loves to work the land. For seven years, the Greenfield-area man operated Lawler Farms, a for-profit, sustainable produce farm, harvesting nearly 700,000 pounds of food annually.
Now he's on a mission to feed the hungry in Central Indiana. Lawler has revamped his 36-acre farm into a nonprofit operation called Brandywine Creek Farms. His goal for the first year is to donate 500,000 pounds of food, which he said is realistic based on the farm's capacity and the addition of an army of volunteers to help through the season.
On top of that, Lawler has joined forces with Gleaners, Midwest Food Bank, Kenneth Butler Soup Kitchen and other area food banks as distribution partners.
Lawler, who also owns a transportation consulting firm that helps pay the bills, says his 15-year-old son inspired him to start thinking differently when it came to his farm.
"He came home from school and talked about kids who take home food from the food pantry," Lawler said.
"My awareness of hunger was limited to the homeless in Downtown Indianapolis. The last place I would expect it is in a rural farming community like where I live."
As he began to look around, the 39-year-old married father of three realized that the "commodity" farms in Hancock and surrounding counties produce tons of corn, soybeans and wheat, "but nothing you can just pick up and eat," he said.
Lawler and most of his neighbors are self-sufficient. They grow what they need or have access to quality food at supermarkets. If he needs something he didn't grow himself, Lawler said, he can jump in his truck and drive 12 minutes to the nearest grocery. But for someone who doesn't have reliable transportation, that 12-minute drive could be a two-hour hike, he said.

AMY GOODMAN:
For our last segment, we look at the dramatic rise in global food prices, adding a new level of danger to the crisis of world hunger. In Africa, food riots have swept across the continent, with recent protests in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Senegal. In most of West Africa, the price of food has risen by 50 percent — in Sierra Leone, 300 percent. Last week, African finance ministers warned the rise in international food prices “poses significant threats to Africa's growth, peace and security.” Other protests have been held this past week in countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Egypt. In Haiti, at least five people have died in riots over 50 percent price hikes for rice, beans and fruit since last year. The demonstrations continued Monday outside the national palace in Port-au-Prince.
HAITIAN DEMONSTRATOR: We are protesting voluntarily. It is not for money. The parliament is responsible for all of this. All we ask for is for the government to cut down on prices of food.
AMY GOODMAN:
Last month, the World Food Program issued a rare appeal for an additional $500 million in funding. For its part, the Bush administration has reduced emergency food aid. Last month, the US Agency for International Development said that a 41 percent surge in prices for wheat, corn, rice and other cereals over the past six months has generated a $120 million budget shortfall that will force the agency to reduce emergency operations.
What's causing this food price hike? What can be done to reverse it? Raj Patel explores this question in his new book Stuffed and Starved: the Hidden Battle for the World Food System. He's a writer, activist, former policy analyst with Food First, formerly worked for the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, and has also protested them on four continents. He joins us from San Francisco.
Welcome, Raj Patel.
RAJ PATEL:
Hi, Amy. How are you?
AMY GOODMAN:
Very good to have you with us. What's causing this surge in food prices around the world?
RAJ PATEL:
Well, it's a number of factors. For a start, there were just bad harvests last year. Some people say that this is a sign that climate change is biting in agricultural economies. And it's certainly the case that there was some very bad weather, particularly in Australia, last year. So there's a low level of crops available.
But on top of that, there are a few other factors. One of them, one of the issues, is that governments, particularly the US government, is very keen on biofuels. Biofuels are fuels that are derived from corn, from sugar cane, and they're being presented as a way of achieving energy independence. The trouble is, of course, that the biofuels drive up the price of these commodities, which means that poor people can't afford them anymore.
On top of that, you've got an increasing demand for meat in developing countries. And as people get richer in those countries and they shift to something that looks more like an American diet, you have a situation where the grains are being diverted away from poor people and into livestock. So, again, that's driving up the price of grains.
And finally, I think one of the major issues is, of course, the price of oil. I mean, one of the problems with the way our food reaches us today is that it is industrial, it is very fossil fuel-intensive, not just to the distance the food travels, but also in the fertilizer. You know, fossil fuel is required to produce fertilizer, pesticide, these sorts of things. And so, when the price of oil is over $100 a barrel, that combines with all the other factors to make a perfect storm where food prices are absolutely beyond the means of the poorest people.
AMY GOODMAN:
Ethanol has been posed as an alternative to oil. What is your response to that?
RAJ PATEL:
It's an alternative to oil if you're in the grain business. It's an alternative to oil if you are one of the large industrial grain processors who are looking and lobbying very hard to make money out of the transformation of grain into ethanol.
But it's an absurd idea. I mean, in terms of just the carbon, the level of carbon that's in — the level of CO2 that it takes to produce ethanol is much higher than the actual — you know, the saving that you get from burning ethanol. So, in terms of a climate change strategy, ethanol is madness. And sadly, all the major presidential candidates at the moment seem to have been drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. And it seems to be something that doesn't enter popular discourse as one of the grave dangers in modern American agricultural policy.
AMY GOODMAN:
Raj Patel, you write in the beginning of your book, “Our Big Fat Contradiction,” that “the hunger of 800 million happens at the same time as another historical fact: that they are outnumbered by the one billion people on this planet who are overweight.” Talk about that contradiction.
RAJ PATEL:
Yeah — well, I mean, it's a contradiction actually that you see everywhere. I mean, you see it in the States. I mean, the US is the most obese country on the planet. There are only three in ten Americans are now at a normal body weight. And at the same time last year, about thirty-five million Americans went hungry at some point last year. So this contradiction between hunger and obesity is worldwide.
And in the past, we had a situation where the rich were fat and the poor were thin. Today, because our food comes from the sort of industrial market of highly processed food that extracts value from poor farmers and gives us processed, highly fatty food, a sort of fast food, as convenience food for people living in cities. Well, the upshot of that is that you've got both poor people who are going hungry and poor people who are predominantly overweight. I mean, it's a sad contradiction that today in the United States the lower your income, the more overweight you're likely to be.
AMY GOODMAN:
Raj Patel, we've had this controversy in the presidential race, the stepping down of the head of Burson-Marsteller from the campaign, Mark Penn, from the campaign of Hillary Clinton, because he met with the Colombian ambassador. They have retained his lobbying company to lobby on behalf of a so-called free trade agreement between Colombia and the United States. Bush is giving that agreement to Congress to pass on. What about the so-called free trade and how it affects food prices around the world?
RAJ PATEL:
Well, I mean, one of the reasons that you're seeing food price riots right now is because all the countries that you listed, from Haiti to Senegal to Burkina Faso to India, they are largely hitched to an international economy where they have to import grain in order to be able to consume it. And this is a consequence of the US pushing a so-called free trade agenda, where countries are being forced to lower their tariff barriers, to stop protecting farmers. And as a result, what you're seeing is that the countries that are worst affected by this are the ones that have most enthusiastically been forced to embrace free trade.
The countries that are doing — that are not suffering quite as badly are countries that have a lot of support for agriculture. I mean, the support is distorted, particularly in the US and the European Union, but even in China or Japan or South Korea. Rice, for example, in South Korea and Japan, is treated as a cultural good. The Japanese and South Korean governments fought very hard to exempt food from the strictures of free trade.
So, absolutely, free trade has a great deal of responsibility to bear here, because countries have been forced into using free trade. And, of course, when the price of food goes up globally, countries have no reserves, they have no policies, they have no recourse, if they're being forced to be part of the free trade system. So, yes, I think it has a great deal of responsibility.
AMY GOODMAN:
Farmer suicides, what have you found?
RAJ PATEL:
Across the world, but particularly in India, you see a situation where farmers on — I mean, farmers, like everyone else, want to improve their lot, and so they borrow money to be able to invest in their land. And increasingly, those investments don't pan out, whether it's climate change or whether it's a medical expense that they have to pay. And all of a sudden, farmers find themselves on the brink of foreclosure or bankruptcy, and they become the first people in generations in their family to lose their land. And rather than suffer that indignity, farmers in India, for example, have been poisoning themselves with pesticides. That was one of the hardest parts of researching this book, is talking to families where farmers did kill themselves.
And, of course, it's an epidemic that started in the States, in the Midwest in the 1980s, when there was a flourishing of farmer suicides. That's perhaps not the right word, but there was certainly an epidemic of them. And those suicides follow the rise of debt for farmers. They particularly affect small farmers, farmers who have been — family farmers who have been on their land for generations. And in the new modern agricultural economy, those farmers are the most vulnerable, whether they're in India or the States or in Britain.
AMY GOODMAN:
Raj Patel, in the last thirty seconds — and then we will bring our listeners and viewers part two of this conversation — but in our last thirty seconds, how devastating are the hike in food prices for those living on the edge?
RAJ PATEL:
I mean, they're absolutely devastating. It's important to remember, of course, that living on the edge is also devastating, but what we have now is a situation where the food prices are really just toppling people into straightforward hunger and famine. I mean, in Haiti, people are eating mud cakes in order to keep hunger pangs at bay. Things are pretty dire.
AMY GOODMAN:
I want to thank you for being with us. We'll bring part two of this conversation to our listeners and viewers within the next few days. Raj Patel is our guest. His new book is Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.
Abstract
Aims Many websites provide a means for individuals to share their experiences and knowledge about different drugs. Such User-Generated Content (UGC) can be a rich data source to study emerging drug use practices and trends. This study examined UGC on extra-medical use of loperamide among illicit opioid users.
Methods A website that allows for the free discussion of illicit drugs and is accessible for public viewing was selected for analysis. Web-forum posts were retrieved using web crawlers and retained in a local text database. The database was queried to extract posts with a mention of loperamide and relevant brand/slang terms. Over 1290 posts were identified. A random sample of 258 posts was coded using NVivo to identify intent, dosage, and side-effects of loperamide use.
Results There has been an increase in discussions related to loperamide's use by non-medical opioid users, especially in 2010–2011 Loperamide was primarily discussed as a remedy to alleviate a broad range of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and was sometimes referred to as “poor man's” methadone. Typical doses ranged 70–100 mg per day, much higher than an indicated daily dose of 16 mg.
The American Middle Class Is Losing Ground
5. Wealth gap between middle-income and upper-income families reaches record high
The gaps in the wealth (assets minus debts) of lower-, middle- and upper-income families are much wider than the gaps in income. There is one other stark difference: only upper-income families realized notable gains in wealth from 1983 to 2013, the period for which data on wealth are available, while gains in income over that period were felt across all income groups, albeit at different rates. The wealth holdings of lower-income and middle-income families are virtually unchanged, and these families fell further behind upper-income families in the past three decades.
The widening gaps in wealth, measured as the ratios of median wealth, across income tiers are the consequence of the crash in the housing market and the Great Recession of 2007-09. These two closely intertwined events wiped out all of the gains in wealth experienced by lower- and middle-income families from 1983 to 2007.
Wealth and income together provide a more complete financial portrait of U.S. adults. The former is a stock of financial resources accumulated over time, while the latter is an annual inflow of financial means. Some adults, such as retirees, may have low income but high levels of wealth. Meanwhile, younger workers may have a high inflow of income but low levels of wealth.
Unlike income, wealth data are not adjusted for family size because it is difficult to associate a current family size with a stock of wealth. In part, that is because wealth is accumulated and potentially spent over an extended period of time during which family structure may change significantly. It is also typical for at least part of a family's wealth to be passed on to future generations.
Changes in wealth are measured from 1983 to 2013 using the Survey of Consumer Finances. Because of the way the data are collected and reported, the unit of analysis for wealth is the family, not the household. Families in the Survey of Consumer Finances are divided into three income tiers based on their income level after it has been adjusted for differences in family size.
Because the Survey of Consumer Finances is conducted triennially, the estimates presented in this section are for different time periods than in the analysis of income. The years 1983, 1992, 2001 and 2010 immediately follow recessions or represent the tail ends of recessions. The year 2007 was a business cycle peak, prior to the onset of the Great Recession. Changes in wealth since 2007 reveal the impact of this downturn.
The fortunes of U.S. families overall swung like a yo-yo from 1983 to 2013. The ride up lasted through 2007 as median wealth overall increased to $137,955 from $77,890 in 1983, a gain of 77%. Most of these gains were registered during the record-long economic expansions in the 1990s and the housing market boom that followed.
The wealth of U.S. families plunged as home prices began a rapid descent in 2006. By 2013, overall median wealth had decreased to $82,756, a loss of 40% in the space of just six years. Almost all of this erasure took place from 2007 to 2010, but there was no sign of a recovery from 2010 to 2013. Over the entire span from 1983 to 2013, the median wealth of U.S. families was up only 6%.
Not surprisingly, the wealth of a family is related to its income. In 1983, the median wealth of middle-income families was $95,879. This was much higher than the $11,544 wealth of lower-income families, but it was far less than the $323,402 wealth of upper-income families. Thus, in 1983, upper-income families had nearly 30 times as much wealth as lower-income families and about three times as much wealth as middle-income families.
The wealth gaps across families in the three income tiers widened greatly from 1983 to 2013. The wealth of lower-income families in 2013 was $9,465 – 18% less than they had in 1983. The wealth of middle-income families was essentially unchanged, rising only 2% to $98,057. However, the wealth of upper-income families doubled to $650,074 in 2013. Thus, in 2013, upper-income families had almost 70 times as much wealth as lower-income families and nearly seven times as much as middle-income families.
The increase in wealth gaps across income tiers occurred after an initial period of gains for lower-income families. From 1983 to 1992, the wealth of lower-income families increased from $11,544 to $14,024, or 21%. The median wealth of middle-income families was unchanged at around $96,000 in this period. Moreover, the gain for upper-income families was modest as their wealth increased 6%, to $344,162 in 1992.
A period of prosperity ruled from 1992 to 2001 as the wealth of all families rose sharply. For middle-income families, median wealth increased by 43%, from $95,657 to $136,445. Lower-income families experienced similar gains as their median wealth increased from $14,024 to $19,397, a boost of 38%. But gains for upper-income families were much sharper as their wealth almost doubled, from $344,162 in 1992 to $600,089 in 2001.
Lower- and middle-income families have continued to fall behind upper-income families in the 21st century. Heading into the Great Recession, lower-income families lost 6% of their wealth, edging down from $19,397 in 2001 to $18,264 in 2007. Middle-income families strengthened their position, raising their wealth by 18%, to $161,050 in 2007. Upper-income families fared the best, as their median wealth increased by 22%, to $729,980 in 2007.
The Great Recession had a negative impact on all families, with the greatest damage inflicted upon lower- and middle-income families. From 2007 to 2010, median wealth fell to $10,688 for lower-income families, to $98,084 for middle-income families, and to $605,228 for upper-income families. In percentage terms, these represented losses of 41%, 39% and 17%, respectively. Once again, upper-income families stretched their advantage, this time by losing proportionately less than other families.
The harmful effects of the Great Recession are showing signs of dissipating, but the clock is far from being rewound completely. Lower-income families continued to experience losses from 2010 to 2013 as their median wealth slipped an additional 11%. The wealth of middle-income families held steady, at about $98,000. Meanwhile, upper-income families stitched together gains in this period as their wealth rose to $650,074 in 2013, an increase of 7%.
Assets owned by lower-, middle- and upper-income families
Differences in the types of assets owned by families in the three income tiers likely contributed to the differences in the recent ups and downs of their respective portfolios. An owned home is a sizable asset for most American families. But while a home is the single most important asset of lower- and middle-income families, upper-income families have a wider variety of assets. For upper-income families, stocks and bonds and business assets are equally important.
In 2007 and 2013, the equity held in an owned home accounted for about 45% to 50% of the total mean value of assets owned by lower- and middle-income families. Stocks and bonds account for about 20% of the total assets of middle-income families but for less than 10% of the assets of lower-income families. Equity in an owned business is more important to lower-income families than to middle-income families, by a factor of about 2-to-1. For both income tiers, transaction accounts and other assets, such as vehicles and other personal property, account for about 30% of assets.
For upper-income families, an owned home represents only about 20% of the total value of assets. Stocks and bonds and business assets each account for 20% to 25% of total assets for these families, and other assets, including transaction accounts, make up an additional 30% or so. It is likely that the greater diversity of assets owned by these families is in itself a result of the greater financial means at their disposal.
The distribution of assets held by American families did not change much from 1983 to 2013. Stocks and bonds gained more importance in the portfolios of lower- and middle-income families from 1983 to 2001 as defined contribution pension plans, such as 401(k) plans, became more prevalent.
The greater reliance on home equity as a source of wealth proved to be detrimental to the financial health of lower- and middle-income families in the 21st century. The most significant economic events in this century have been the crash in the housing market in 2006, a meltdown in the financial markets in 2007-08, and the Great Recession of 2007-09.
From December 2007 to December 2010, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14%, and the Case-Shiller national home price index declined by 19%. Thus, as noted, families in all income tiers experienced significant losses in wealth.
In the post-Great Recession period, the stock market recovered more quickly than the housing market. The S&P 500 index rose 47% from December 2010 to December 2013 compared with a rise of 13% in the Case-Shiller national home price index. Overall, these trends in asset values favored families who owned relatively more financial assets than those who owned relatively more housing. Thus, during the course of the latest economic downturn and recovery, the wealth gap between upper-income families and other families grew.
Assets and debts
A family's wealth, or net worth, is the difference between the value of its assets and the value of its liabilities. Thus, in addition to asset prices, the amount of debt taken on by a family plays a key role in determining its net worth. Although the absolute value of assets rose more than the absolute level of debt in the years leading up to the Great Recession, the rate of growth typically was faster for debt – leaving families vulnerable when the economy weakened.
From 1983 to 2001, asset values increased by more than the increase in debt levels for families in all income tiers. Among middle-income families the mean value of assets increased by $156,928, compared with an increase of $31,738 in their debt level. Thus, their mean wealth increased by $125,190 from 1983 to 2001. The pattern of asset values increasing more than debt levels also prevailed from 2001 to 2007.
But even as the mean wealth of families was climbing, lower- and middle-income families were accumulating debt at a faster rate than their asset levels were increasing. From 1983 to 2001, the mean level of debt owed by middle-income families increased by 90% and mean asset values increased by 77%. Lower-income families raised their debt level by 111% over the same period, nearly double the increase in their asset values (59%). Only upper-income families experienced a greater increase in the value of their assets (87%) than in their level of debt (54%).
The practice of accumulating debt at a faster rate than the rise in asset values continued from 2001 to 2007. Moreover, it became entrenched among upper-income families as well. Middle-income families raised their debt level by a further 61% from 2001 to 2007, compared with an increase of only 18% in the mean value of their assets. This trend likely placed families in a more vulnerable position prior to the Great Recession than they might have been if the growth in debt and asset values had been more balanced.
Families in all income tiers put the brakes on debt accumulation after the onset of the Great Recession. But these attempts were in vain from 2007 to 2010 as asset values plunged even more. Middle-income families cut their mean debt level by $11,624, or by 11%. But the value of their assets fell by $79,626 (19%). Thus, their mean wealth dropped by $68,002 with the Great Recession. Upper-income families were not immune to the downturn. They reduced their debt burden by 6%, but their asset holdings lost 17% in value.
Lower-income families, with more limited financial resources in general and greater exposure to job losses, were unable to reduce their debt burden from 2007 to 2010. Their level of debt increased 15% in this period. This increase was more modest than in previous periods, but it was damaging in light of a loss of 2% in asset values. Thus, the mean wealth of lower-income families fell by $8,214 with the recession.
Families in all income tiers succeeded in continuing to reduce debt burdens from 2010 to 2013. Middle-income families knocked off $14,675 of their debt, but even that did not keep up with a loss of an additional $34,377 in their asset holdings. Likewise, lower-income families cut their debt by $7,708, but that was insufficient in the face of a loss of $32,321 in asset values. Thus, the mean wealth of lower- and middle-income families dropped again from 2010 to 2013.
Only upper-income families experienced a gain in mean wealth from 2010 to 2013. Their debt level decreased by $21,186, and their asset values increased by $23,183 in this period. Thus, the mean wealth of upper-income families increased $44,369 from 2010 to 2013. But the mean net worth of upper-income families remains less than in 2007, and that is also the situation among middle- and lower-income families.
“A Japanese schoolgirl uniform is kind of like blackface, I am just in acceptance over it, because something is better than nothing,” Cho wrote. “I am so sick of not existing, that I would settle for following any white person around with an umbrella just so I could say I was there.” At Salon earlier that year, Mihi Ahn wrote that “[Stefani] swallowed the subversive youth culture in Japan and barfed up another image of submissive giggling Asian women.”
Even without including any actual Asian women, Perry accomplishes something similar. She and her dancers spend much of their performance time putting their palms together and bowing, scurrying across the stage trying to be light on their feet, and hiding behind umbrellas and fans. Dainty, subservient, shy—though there are no Japanese schoolgirls here, the imagery of the performance is hardly nuanced. The performers' make-up does little to combat Cho's anxieties about blackface, and while Perry's skin-exposing interpretation of the kimono could have been more sexualized, it's this kind of stereotypical visuals that plays into white fetishization of Asian women—something Perry doesn't have to deal with when she takes off her costume.
“I am in my 20s, and the shitbag boys who used to pull their eyes back and say 'ching chong' still hurt me,” the writer (and friend of mine) Crystal Leww wrote last night. “This sort of shit is not funny or artistic to me; it just reminds me that I am still not an American to a lot of people and that someone who looks like me still cannot be a Katy Perry of the world.”
There's also something peculiar about her pairing of Japanese—and Chinese— imagery with the song “Unconditionally,” which was originally inspired by a trip to Madagascar. Maybe it's just the track's pounding percussion that inspired the theme and (what looks like) taiko drumming. But considering how Prism is Perry's most spiritual album to date, the performance suggests Perry's taken up an Eat, Pray, Love style reinvention centered on Eastern spirituality—with “Eastern” construed as broadly and monolithically as possibly, encompassing the Shinto-shrine imagery of her AMA's performance, the karma shout outs on Prism's “Legendary Lover," and on.
Because it was not a celebration. The fans who defend Katy Perry like to say that she engaged in cultural appreciation, that her performance was a harmless tribute to Japan. But it's worth pointing out that few of her prominent dancers—wearing makeup to appear more Asian—are actually Asian themselves, and, as others noticed on Twitter, the awards show otherwise seemed to leave out Asians entirely. Exactly how pop stars can appreciate a culture by largely leaving its members out of that celebration—at a televised event that doesn't really acknowledge their existence, no less—is a mystery. Additionally, considering the number of myths surrounding the historical roles and significance of geishas in Japan, Perry's appearance felt like the performance equivalent of skimming a Wikipedia page, not a tribute based in any deeper understanding or desire for accuracy.
A snake nut can is a practical joke device that closely resembles a can of nuts, but contains a long wire spring covered by a cloth or vinyl sheath, printed like snake skin, which leaps out of the can and startles the unsuspecting victim.
The item was invented by Samuel Sorensen Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. circa 1915. Adams' wife Emily had been complaining about the jam jar, saying that it wasn't properly closed or that it was sticky. Adams, inspired by her nagging, then invented a spring snake - a coil of wire wrapped in a cloth skin, and compressed the two-foot snake into a little jam jar so that it would jump out when the lid was removed.[1]
The snake jam jar then evolved into a whole array of products, including the snake peanut brittle can, the snake mint can, and the best-selling snake nut can. In the 1990s Adams' grandson produced snake potato chips.

GETTY Marine Le Pen has declared the “system” is panicking because people are 'waking up'
The Front National leader launched a blistering attack on her two main French presidential opponents at a political rally on Sunday. She condemned centrist Emmanuel Macron and conservative candidate François Fillon – both of which she said belonged to the same elitist political “system”. The hardline leader's scathing comments prompted the crowd to shout: “We've had enough!”
Mrs Le Pen first attacked 39-year-old Mr Macron, a former economy minister under François Hollande, who she said was the media's “favourite” candidate and Mr Hollande's “avatar” Mrs Le Pen then hit out at Mr Fillon, saying that he was a “promise-making machine” and that he had “done nothing” for the French during his five years as Nicolas Sarkozy's prime minister.

(CBS News) WASHINGTON -- Robert Mueller, who spent the last 12 years as FBI director -- the second longest serving director after J. Edgar Hoover -- is retiring soon. He turned the agency into one of the country's main terrorist fighting organizations.

One week on the job when 9/11 happened, there were no other major attacks on the homeland during his tenure. But in his final interview as director he said the threat of another attack is still there.
Mueller warned Thursday the al Qaeda threat which closed 19 U.S. diplomatic posts earlier this month, is still active.
"We're monitoring it very carefully and want to make certain that if it were postponed because of the actions we are taking, that we're alert to the possibility that it's back on for action," he said.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has tried to hit the U.S. before with the underwear bomb and the printer bombs.
Asked if he expects the group will try to attack again, Mueller said, "I would expect that, down the road, that people would like to hit us."
Inside SIOC, the FBI's secure command center, Mueller explained terror has been his top worry since the beginning of his 12-year tenure. He was just a week into the job when 9/11 happened.

"In the wake of September 11, the one question that was always posed by the president, whether it be George Bush or President Obama, is, 'What is the FBI doing to prevent the next terrorist attack?'"
Mueller was forced to transform the FBI from a criminal investigative agency into a counterterrorism force. While there have been no major follow-up strikes, there have domestic attacks: Fort Hood in 2009 and the Boston Marathon bombings in April.
Despite criticism that the FBI missed some warning signs, Mueller said neither incident was preventable. A 2011 Russian warning about bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev turned up no terrorist connections.

"The agent who had that lead did a very thorough job in tracking down any information," Muller said. "He went to the college campus, did record checks, ultimately interviewed the parents and ultimately interviewed the individual."
Muller said he is satisfied the FBI did a thorough job.
Mueller also promised that people will be brought to justice for the attacks in Benghazi, which killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others. And Mueller expressed personal satisfaction with the conviction of Whitey Bulger, who was a mob boss in Boston back when Mueller was a prosecutor there.
Japan's whalers have won an injunction in a United States court against Sea Shepherd, restraining the anti-whaling group from attacking their ships in the Southern Ocean.
The decision by the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was described as "somewhat astonishing" by Sea Shepherd leader Paul Watson on Tuesday.
It follows an appeal to the court by Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research against the decision of a US District Court judge refusing an injunction earlier this year.
Chief Judge, Tashima Kozinski said in the decision that Sea Shepherd, Mr Watson, and anyone acting for them, were "enjoined from physically attacking any vessel engaged by Plaintiffs the Institute of Cetacean Research, Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha, Lt., Tomoyuki Ogawa or Toshiyuki Miura in the Southern Ocean."
Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha operates the whaling fleet for the ICR, While Mr Ogawa and Mr Miura are believed to be senior officers.
Share. Until April 7. Until April 7.
All PlayStation 4 owners are able to jump into the world of Eorzea and try out Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn as part of the game's open beta test.
The test, which started this morning and runs until April 7, will allow anyone who owns a PS4 to jump into the MMO without needing to register beforehand. Additionally, the test makes use of the live servers, meaning you'll be playing alongside both PS3 and PC players and, if you decide to buy the game when it releases, the character you make this weekend will be carried over for you to use.
Exit Theatre Mode
Square Enix announced last year that Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn had over 1.5 million registered accounts, which means the high-stakes relaunch of the game can definitely be considered a success. With the announcement you'll be able to upgrade from the PS3 version for free if you're keen to play on PS4, the future's looking fairly bright for the MMO.

Today, Microsoft revealed SmartGlass, a technology that can turn almost any touchscreen device into an extension of the Xbox 360. For entertainment, this means being able to start watching a television show or movie on the go and continue on your TV - and for games, it means using the second screen as a touch-based interface for creating your own plays in Madden or being given access to additional information in Halo.
It's likely the biggest thing Microsoft revealed at the show, and might be one of the more interesting revelations out of E3, but while some are pointing at it as a "Wii U" killer, it might actually be more beneficial to Nintendo than it could ever be to Microsoft.
Above: Check out Microsoft's full unveiling of SmartGlass
Besides the obvious issues with HD graphics and online gameplay, the Wii's controller was one of the roadblocks in the way of bringing third-party games to the system. Developers don't often feel like creating console-specific versions of their games, and since third-party games often sold poorly when compared to AAA Nintendo releases, many developers simply didn't bother at all. And honestly, we couldn't blame 'em.
While the Wii U will remove the graphical hindrance, the inclusion of a touchscreen on the controller has the possibility to create that hurdle all over again. Developers of AAA games would need to make use of it in some way, just to make it work on the Wii U. With Microsoft's unveiling of SmartGlass, however, that all changes.
Now, if EA were to spend millions of dollars creating an interesting user-interface for the Wii U version of Dead Space 3, that cost wouldn't be for the Nintendo release alone. A modified version of the interface could be made for SmartGlass as well, further fleshing out the Xbox 360 Dead Space 3 while creating a version that takes full advantage of the Wii U GamePad. Instead of beating Nintendo at its own game, Microsoft may have helped it out tremendously.
This works in Microsoft's favor as well, obviously, as it assures that Xbox 360 copies will continue to have the complete experience instead of lagging slightly behind the Wii U. It also helps extend the current generation's lifespan even more by allowing parity between the Wii U and the Xbox 360 - odds are we'll see the Vita being tagged to the PS3 in the same way, creating an interesting generational dynamic where all three systems have features that can optionally extend to a second screen.
We're hoping to find out more about SmartGlass, the Wii U, and the likely Vita/PS3 partnership as E3 continues.
Pittsburgh Steelers star wideout Antonio Brown is back on the gridiron following a stint on ABC Network's Dancing With The Stars. Brown and Broncos linebacker Von Miller opted for a different method to stay in shape this offseason by competing in the ballroom dancing competition show. Brown was eliminated in the semifinals.
Following his first football workout in months, Brown said he remains in great shape.
"I felt pretty good today, actually, my feet, I'm in shape, running my routes and dropping my hips," Brown told NFL Network's Aditi Kinkhabwala on Thursday. "I still have work to do on my finishes, but that will come. For the most part, I'm feeling good and can transition out of my breaks."
Though some might claim participating on the show can be a distraction, Brown told Kinkhabwala it helped improve his footwook and hip placement.
"I don't want to say it made me faster, but I feel like it has helped me a lot with my shock absorbers," he said. "I've been able to drop my hips and get on the ball of my foot."
Last year, Steelers signal-caller Ben Roethlisberger said he wanted his offense to put up 30 points per game. However, the 2016 squad is sans Martavis Bryant, who is serving a year-long suspension, but Brown and the Steelers' offense is still holding onto their goal.
"It's too early to tell right now. We're just getting started now in Phase 3 of the offseason so we definitely got a long way to go. Our goal in front of us is still to be the best offense," he said. "Thirty points is still attainable and we're looking forward to putting our word on display when we get control this season."

While Yingluck did not appear, the court issued its verdict for her former Commerce Minister Boonsong Teriyapirom who was tried over the same matter in a parallel trial. Boonsong was sentenced to 42 years in prison and ordered to compensate the state 16 billion baht. The sentence was not suspended.

11:45am
Sources close to Yingluck say she left the country Thursday for Singapore where her brother Thaksin Shinawatra was staying. No public statement has been made about her whereabouts and the claim could not be immediately verified.
11:26am
Reporters wait outside Yingluck's residence in Bangkok, unsure whether she is there.

11:20am
Immigration officials said Friday morning that there are no records of Yingluck leaving the country.
11:15am
Political activist Nutta Mahattana said this was the equivalent of a key player being removed.
“Politics may become easier if she fled into exile. We may see elections sooner,” Nutta said.
11am Redshirt Leader Voices Opinion
Redshirt leader Thida Thavornsaek said she was surprised the former prime minister did not show up to court, but said “there should be no arrest warrant.”
“What can be done to rescind the arrest warrant? Her lawyers should workout a medical certificate. If there was no arrest warrant, the situation would have calmed down but the warrant has led to a heightened political temperature. It's a difficult situation,” Thida said.
10:40 am Supporters in Denial
A woman from Aranyaprahet who refused to give her name: “It's fine that we are deceived. But I pity the reporters who were deceived. Because they were the one who told us to come, saying there would be a verdict today. It's not the PM's fault because she has to come anyway one day.”
Somchai Tratummek, 68 of Chiang Mai: “Even if she's running away, I'm cheering for her. There must be a reason why she suddenly didn't come. I don't think the verdict will end well.”
Lawyer Chamnan Chanruang doesn't think Yingluck has fled. “If she fled, she would have done it a long time ago. If she fled, she won't have anything left because of the new Anti-Corruption Act.”
10:27 am
Official Supreme Court statement just issued:
“The prosecutors stated an objection that they do not believe the defendant is indeed ill as there is no medical certificate, and the condition that she claimed is not so severe that she cannot travel to the court.”
10:25 am
Prominent artist/photographer Manit Sriwanichpoom said he was not surprised by Yingluck's no-show. He said the “strategy has been set.”
“I want to see what political benefit she will get from this though,” Manit said. “It's a shame that we don't get to see justice system work to the utmost.”
Boon Poomsida, a supported from Yasothon, believed Yingluck's health excuse was credible. “People can be sick, it's normal. I think she will definitely not flee.”
Another woman has been shouting: “She will definitely come. Don't you go back my folks. Don't believe the rumors. She will not leave her people. She will show up!”
10:18 am
Noppakow Kongsuwan, a Redshirt who showed up at the court early in morning to cheer Yingluck said he wasn't surprised by developments. “The Shinwatra clan is not a clan of revolutionaries. They are business people. I'm not disappointed however. From her perspective, she was being persecuted. Politics will heat up from now. The Shinwatra family will lose credit, however.”
10am
Thousands of supporters remain outside the Supreme Court, most unaware that Yingluck is not arriving and has been declared a fugitive for not appearing. Yingluck cited health reasons that the court rejected in staying its reading of the verdict in her 28-month malfeasance trial.
9:58am
Rachai Vannukul, 59 of Bangkok, came alone today. “It's a pity to see so much injustice. Like Thomas Jefferson said, ‘When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.' Justice must come first, despite those who think otherwise. The government is not run by soldiers, those are at the border. These are fuckers!”
9:54am
9:45am
The court has denied Yingluck's request, ordered her arrested and the seizure of her assets bail bond.
9:42am
Our reporters have confirmed that Yingluck is not coming to the court today and has formally requested that the verdict be delayed a month to Sept. 27.
9:34am
Unclear what's going on today. Yingluck has not arrived and a source high in the Redshirt umbrella group UDD has told our reporter she will not be coming today. Reporter at Yingluck's home says she has not left.
9:25am
Bangkok police commander Sanit Mahatavorn said he believes today will conclude without any violence.
“I don't expect any unrest. Up until now I think everything will be fine,” said the police general. “I've tried to create understanding with leaders on both the regional and national levels. I'm sorry that my force has to be strict today, and I welcome all suggestions.”
Although another police commander has instructed Yingluck's supporters to leave as soon as the verdict is read, Sanit said there is no limit when the gathering will have to end.
“No, we don't have any curfew to gathering here,” he said.
9:24am
Pretty heavy rain at the court now.
9:12am Verdict Postponed?
We're trying to confirm reports the reading of the verdict has been postponed until this afternoon. Yingluck has still not arrived to the court. “Please maintain order!” police are calling over a PA system.
9:10am
9:07am
Phone service is too poor for reporters to initiate live streams.
8:58am
Rotsuphon Thammasri, 50 at left, came from Yasothon. “I came here because my heart said so, without any leaders telling me to. If there were leaders telling us to come, there would be so many people that the government wouldn't be able to control us. If Yingluck gets punished too much, it means she didn't get justice. Then, the state won't be able to control a part of the population.”
Wittawut Suwantuk, 70, came to the court at 5am from Sukhothai province. “I came with my own brainpower to give Yingluck encouragement. The court process for the reds is so different from yellow, everything happens so fast. Even just farming, they can find something wrong with it. But those who try to fix farmers' problems are exemplary people. There might be some higher power, I can't say, let's compare it to angels and humans, sending orders for today's court results.'
8:47am
Yingluck has just arrived . A vehicle believed to carry Yingluck swarmed by her supporters shouting, “Yingluck, Fight! Fight!”
8:39 am
Apart from the fact that Yingluck's supporters are barred from gathering in front of the court – even though they have done so in the past – a civil rights activist said access to the courtroom for Yingluck's close circle is also restricted.
According to Human Rights Watch coordinator Sunai Phasuk, former Pheu Thai MPs had to submit their names in advance in order to enter the court compound.
“It could become a basis of political harassment,” he said. “Many [former] MPs and local leaders of the UDD [Redshirt organization] have been subjected to pressure by the military and police to pledge that they will not bring their followers to support Yingluck in Bangkok.”
Only a handful members of the press are allowed inside the courtroom today. Communication devices are not permitted inside.
8:21 am
Despite junta warnings to Yingluck supporters to stay away and the former prime minister's own appeal yesterday for them to stay at home, hundreds thousands of supporters have gathered at the Supreme Court building in north Bangkok.
Napassorn Boonree arrived since 5.30 am.
“If she is jailed, we will follow to gather in front of the prison,” she said. “They threatened us not to come today, saying there will be so many checkpoints along the road. we came we didn't see any”
This ex soldier rode a bike from Saraburi to Bangkok to show his support for Yingluck Shinawatra.
“I'm not afraid to be here and give reporters my real name.” Capt. Pisit Piputdoe said. “Whatever the result comes out, people already see what happened,”
8.15 AM
Top figures in the Shinawatra political clan also showed up in support of their former leader today, including Watana Muangsook, Chaturon Chaisang and Sudarat Keyuraphan.
8.00 AM
Supporters of ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra are gathering in large number close to the supreme court office in north Bangkok. Some have camped overnight.
The area in front of the court is sealed off by the authorities, citing a court order.

Gwent — the popular in-game card game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — is getting a standalone release, if a recent European Union trademark filing spotted by Nerd Leaks is any indication.
The European Union Intellection Property Office lists a trademark application for "GWENT THE WITCHER CARD GAME," filed in Polish on Monday of this week. The application includes a "graphic representation," the logo at the top of this article, and is classified as both video game (9), card game (28) and online gaming service (41) — in addition to more broad classifications like jewelry, stationery, leather goods, figurines and clothing.
In a PDF document hosted on the Polish developer's website in March, CD Projekt revealed it was creating "a new type of video game format previously unexplored by the studio" for a 2016 release.
There are no other details on the filing, such as which platforms this spinoff may target, though at the very least a PC release through the developer's own GoG.com service seems likely.
This strategy recalls the release of Fable II Pub Games, a standalone version of Fable 2's decidely-not-as-popular-as-Gwent pub games released for Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.
Compilers sometimes generate correct sequential code but break the concurrency memory model of the programming language: these subtle compiler bugs are observable only when the miscompiled functions interact with concurrent contexts, making them particularly hard to detect. The cmmtest tool performs differential testing to hunt concurrency compiler bugs in C and C++ compilers against the C11/C++11 memory model. The tool is still under development but it already identified several mistaken write introductions and other unexpected behaviours in the latest release of the gcc compiler.

Homeowner shoots at wouldbe robbers during attempted home invasion
COLUMBIA, Mo. - Columbia Police are investigating an attempted home invasion in the 3200 block of Mexico Gravel Road.
Officers were called to the home just before 10 p.m. Sunday.
The homeowner, Levi Strodman, said his wife heard the knock and sent him to the door. He grabbed his pistol, which he said he always carries in the home.
"It's kind of taboo but I encourage it, obviously now," he said.
When he got to the door, he saw the peephole was obstructed but he thought a neighbor was just having fun. When he cracked the door, an armed suspect tried to force his way in.
"He rushed it and I put force back on him and was able to stop him immediately," said Strodman. "He was still fighting to make his way through and was gaining ground. Then he presented a pistol."
Strodman said he lost his footing and fell down the stairs, but not before he fired twice at the intruder, who ran off.
"In this case, I was able to literally save my life and my wife from someone who wished to do us harm," he said.
Former prosecutor Bill Tackett said it's a textbook case of Missouri's castle doctrine and stand your ground in action.
Under castle doctrine, a homeowner, or someone allowed to be in the home like a babysitter, has the legal right to defend themselves using deadly force when faced with a threatening trespasser. Stand your ground says people no longer have to retreat from danger before shooting in any place where they have a legal right to be.
"This is the extreme case where someone knocks on your door and points a gun at you and you have both available to you," said Tackett. "If you want to shoot an intruder, this is your state."
Tim Oliver, director of Learn to Carry, said a holstered gun is a danger to nobody.
"If that homeowner had not had his firearm with him, it could have turned out a whole lot worse," he said.
Strodman said he only saw one person run away from the scene, while police said a witness reported seeing two people.
A K9 was brought in to try to track down the suspects.
Police said it's unclear if the suspects were hit by the gunfire. There was some damage inside the home from the shots being fired, but Strodman and his wife were not seriously hurt, according to police.
Strodman said he hopes his experience can help others get the tools and training they need to take responsibility for their immediate safety.
"I just can't recommend enough getting the tools and utilizing something that was given to us even at the foundation of our country," he said. "The state of Missouri practically encourages us to protect ourselves."
JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games) are quite possibly the most polarising, contentious genre in gaming. Love them or loathe them, the genre offers a beautifully strategic style of gameplay that tends to focus on exploration, something which is loved by millions of fans worldwide.
With characters who have personality and depth, and games that give us the ability to watch these characters grow and develop, the gamer gets a greater sense of connection to the story - and, importantly, it's often a connection that is formed from emotion. What I want to look at here is the positive side of the genre, the things that make it so great and so rewarding, and that have provided me and countless others with hundreds of hours of memorable gaming experiences.
The JRPG was fairly underground until the mid 1990s, at least here in the west. But then popular systems such as the Super Nintendo allowed some JRPGs to reach the public attention. One example was the wonderfully twisted Chrono Trigger. The game introduced a new audience to the Japanese aesthetic: it offered gorgeous visuals and a beautifully developed plot as well as a monstrous campaign that rewarded the player for devoting their time to it.
Another example, and one that has developed a rightful cult following, was the maddeningly superb Earthbound. With its glorious misplaced humour and submarine trips, the game definitely had character, and it was another SNES-based addition to the JRPG genre. Other titles for the SNES included Final Fantasy titles such as FFVI, as well as Illusion Of Gaia and Lufia 2. The SNES really had an astonishing collection in its back pocket. Looking back, it seems strange that even when household names like Mario got an RPG incarnation, the JRPG genre just didn't quite take off. But its time would come.
That time arrived when one stunningly crafted, emotionally profound, technically proficient example of the genre came along: the utterly gorgeous Final Fantasy VII. The game was a step forward of such gigantic proportions that it managed to single-handedly stirred the JRPG genre into the mainstream.
Providing an evocative plot, wondrous graphics (for the time) as well as a technically fluid battling system, the game became astronomically popular in Japan, Europe and the US. Everything the game introduced can be summed up by the backlash and ultimate response to the death of Aeris. Fans desperately sought reasons to bring her back, trying any method that seemed to offer even a glimmer of hope.
That emotional response is another reason why Final Fantasy VII became a phenomenon when it was released back in 1997. Even today, that one moment provided still provokes discussion, such was the power and intensity that Square Enix had managed to construct.
Thanks to the popularity of the Final Fantasy series, the JRPG genre itself began to explode, as games likes Xenogears, Dragon Quest, and the Phantasy Star series took off. Why it took six Final Fantasy sequels for the west to finally embrace the JRPG is a mystery, but what's undeniable is how the key characteristics of the games appealed to the masses. These games offered a multi-layered mode of escapism for the player: they were different worlds, ones that rewarded the time taken to explore them, something that was simply unheard of at the time. These games were revolutionary, and people were starting to pay attention.
Naturally, when one thing becomes popular, it starts a bandwagon, and many iterations of the same thing follow. Some will be successful, some will not, but over time there will always be a point where the market is so saturated that the audience they fought so hard to attract starts to become disillusioned.
In recent generations, attempts have been made to reinvigorate what was thought to be an aging combat system, that of the turn-based fighting structure. Personally, I'm a great fan of this “archaic” system. Most fans of JRPGs and RPGs in general that I knew grew up tactically planning their next move in Xenogears or the Final Fantasy series, praying their methods would be successful. The system allowed you to take your time to plan your moves, and arguably the tension of the battles was increased as a result. In a fierce battle where every move counts, the turn-based system provided that spilt second of doubt, when you couldn't tell whether a move had been successful or not.
Those moments of tension that have undoubtedly been lost amidst the new style of free-flowing action. While the real-time systems used in modern games are seamlessly designed, offering a new tactical edge while exploring more creative ways of battle, the faster pace can leave some of us a little overwhelmed, struggling to figure out what to do and when to execute what the game is trying to get you to do. It's a design that has permeated the last generation and you'd be hard pressed to find a JRPG on console that offers the traditional turn-based structure, which is a shame.
Of the last generation, I'm a great lover of Tales Of Vesperia and Eternal Sonata, as well as the additional Star Ocean and Final Fantasy releases. However, one game stands testament to everything I love about the traditional JRPG; one game that even in the midst of change, stuck to the origins of the turn-based system. That game was Lost Odyssey. Now, I'll be the first to admit the game isn't perfect, far from it, but I felt a great respect, a subtle connection with the game that warmed me while I deconstructed its suitably brilliant turn-based system. It reminded me of a time where JRPGs gave me the option to take my time, become patient and plan my attack.
The appeal of either system is purely subjective, and while I have a deep fondness for the traditional turn-base system, the contemporary real-time system demonstrates the ever-growing progression that all genres may adhere to, one that fuses the old with the new to create a system that will endure into the coming generation.
With the Xbox One and the PS4, a new era dawns on every genre and in particular those which are not as successful as they once were. Looking at the confirmed release list of JRPGs for the new system we have two additions: Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts 3, both established, well-loved franchises. Naturally it would be crass to suggest that only such established franchises will make it onto the new consoles, but I hope in time the JRPG is given a chance to shine once more. It would be a great shame if this generation signals the death of console JRPG gaming.
So what are the reasons why fans keep coming back for more, keep asking for the rigorous, painstaking hours that are needed to really fulfil the true potential of a JRPG? Maybe it's exactly that. In a generation where multiplayer has overshadowed single player campaigns, where time isn't spent worrying about how the gamer will play alone, the JRPG offers something very few others can: an immersive, thought-provoking experience, one that allows complex characters to create deeper relationships with the gamer. It's a slower, more introspective gaming experience that's not unlike the experience of reading a good book. The faster-paced, pick-up-and-play contemporary gaming experience isn't for everyone, and while the RPG genre can offer a similar style of gaming, the more time a person puts in, the more rewarding the experience will be.
It's a cliched to say that modern society has no attention span, but it's tricky to deconstruct the reasons why people are turning away from RPGs without tackling this issue. Final Fantasy VII was released in 1997, and 16 years down the road the game's fanbase is older, more independent and undoubtedly in the middle of time-sapping careers. If you've got a heavy workload to worry about, where's the time to play JRPGs going to come from? It makes sense, really, that people are more likely to jump into a straightforward first-person shooter than spend hours on a time-consuming RPG. Logically, then, maybe the current generation of gamers needs a Final Fantasy VII of their own, something to attract them to a genre they might not have experienced before.
The decline of JRPGs might also have something to do with the way the Japanese gaming industry is adapting to shifts in gaming perspective - or, not adapting, as it seems the industry has adopted a fairly stubborn attitude towards any kind of change. I wouldn't call that arrogance, but I'd struggle to argue against anybody who would.
No matter how you perceive the situation, the winds of change do feel near. Anyone with an interest in the genre can see the JRPG has some work to do in order to retain its appeal in an ever more frantic and claustrophobic gaming marketplace. With more and more franchises extending further, and the ability for indie developers to have their work showcased on each platform, the market share for each respective genre is likely to shrink. Add to that the endless inclination to revolutionise, improve and keep things fresh, and the pressure is on for everybody to plead for the public's attention, especially under the allure of AAA titles.
But there is hope. One type of system fights in the RPG's corner, standing firmly behind it and offering a new gaming perspective for fans: the handheld device. Recent additions like the 3DS and PS Vita, as well as older systems, give players the ability to tackle battles in shorter bursts, which might give people more reason to stick with a game. As I've mentioned previously, time has arguably been one of the reasons for disillusionment with playing JRPGs, but with these systems (and mobile devices!) the JRPGs future may well literally be in our hands.
Newer offerings such as the Pokémon series as well as the critically acclaimed Bravely Default provide the same enthralling sense of exploration, intensity and accomplishment that JRPGs in the past were so astute at providing - and they use traditional turn-based systems.
I, for one, will stick with the JRPG until the bitter end, whenever or wherever that may be. While the genre may never again reach the zeniths it once hit, JRPGs still have so much to offer the gaming community, whether you are a passionate fan or casual gamer. We're in an exciting period, a time of experimentation and venturing into the unknown. The enduring appeal of this genre has always lain in the freedom it offers, the way it encourages the player to strive for adventure, providing beautifully constructed tales wrapped around characters who are as flawed and as imperfect as we are. The future holds even greater prospects for the genre.
The JRPG is a genre that should never be ignored - it should be embraced.

What should we expect from Erin Hills at the 2017 U.S. Open? Nobody really knows the answer to that, which means nobody really knows who to predict when it comes to winning the tournament.
We thought earlier in the week that we would see an incredibly penal golf course on the edges, but the USGA remedied that by whacking down much of the knee-high fescue on Tuesday.
The only thing we're sure of before this tournament starts is that the course will be long. It will be the longest in U.S. Open history, in fact, at 7,741 yards. Other than that, nothing is certain, but here are a few observations on a big ballpark hosting the second major of the PGA Tour season
1. A low score will win: This will be one of my primary predictions come Wednesday, and Jordan Spieth confirmed it on Tuesday in his press conference. "I don't see par winning the tournament," said Spieth. "I see closer to 5- to 10-under. Someone who has very good control of the ball off the tee will have plenty of opportunities to make birdies, given the conditions that we're expecting."
There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that the course is playing at a par of 72 for the first time in 25 years. Many times U.S. Open scores are at or around par because par 5s play as par 4s and the USGA artificially enhances the final number. That won't be the case this year.
Also, the fairways are wide, the rough is (now) shorter and if the wind doesn't blow, there will be little protection for the greens and tight collection areas. Now, the wind will probably blow most of the week, but even if it dies slightly, the course seems gettable.
2. Should they or shouldn't they: Despite cutting its out-of-control rough on Tuesday, the USGA is still catching flack from some for their decision to cut it down. Ladies and gentlemen, the organization that cannot win.
USGA is out of control for having unplayable fescue a few yards off the fairway. Now it's soft for cutting it. Man, the US Open is the best. — Ryan Lavner (@RyanLavnerGC) June 13, 2017
Now, they said they whacked it because of weather, not to satiate players. But I'm of the belief that players' complaints -- such as this from Kevin Na -- had to come into play at least a little bit.
I'm of the opinion that because of the crazy wide fairways, the USGA should have left everything alone and let the course play as it stands. I understand why they cut it, but these fairways are so wide I think even Phil Mickelson could hit them (hopefully we get to find out of that's true). Let the fescue play as a water hazard and move along down the road.
3. The forever course: The longest course in U.S. Open (and major championship) history could play even longer as it has rained (and will likely continue to rain) this week. That's great news for Dustin Johnson, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy, who all hit the ball 740 yards off the tee. It's not great news for the Brandt Snedekers and Billy Horschels of the world. This could have a 2011 at Congressional to it.
Rory: "I wasn't crying when I saw that rain this morning. That's a long golf course that's only going to play longer." — Will Gray (@WillGrayGC) June 13, 2017
Is everything coming up Rory?
4. Which quadrant will it fall under? Speaking of Congressional, I'm guessing Erin Hills will fall to the east and north of it on this graph. It will be longer, and it will probably have a higher missed fairway penalty given how badly you have to hit a shot here to actually miss a fairway.
We've broken down the last 13 US Open courses to see how they compare. We'll see this week where Erin Hills fits in! #USOpen pic.twitter.com/18iwFPFvmm — 15th Club (@15thClub) June 12, 2017
5. A good short game: The eventual winner this week will be at least serviceable with his wedges. That sounds like a no-brainer, but let me explain. As Paul Azinger pointed out on Shane Bacon's podcast, the collection areas around the greens will play less like a U.S. Open and more like Augusta National. There will be some really tough spots to get up and down from, but you will be able to get up and down unlike many U.S. Opens of the past. Don't blast your drives 70 yards wide left or right and avoid bogeys when you miss greens, and you should be good to go. Sounds easy, right?
President Trump made good Monday on his promise not to accept his $400,000 presidential salary, handing over his first three months of pay to the National Park Service — but the generous gesture couldn't escape the scoffing of critics.
Mr. Trump gave the $78,333 check, the amount cut by the Treasury for the pay period that began with the Jan. 20 inauguration, to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
“We're going to dedicate it and put against the infrastructure on our nation's battlefields,” said Mr. Zinke. “We're excited about that opportunity.”
He noted that the 25 national battlefield were more than $100 million behind in maintenance.
At the daily press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised the Park Service for its 100 years of service and said Mr. Trump was “personally proud” to help its mission.
Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the paycheck was a drop in the ocean when Mr. Trump proposed slashing 12 percent of the budget for the Department of Interior.
“If Donald Trump is actually interested in helping our parks, he should stop trying to slash their budgets to historically low levels,” Mr. Brune said in a statement.
“This publicity stunt is a sad consolation prize as Trump tries to stifle America's best idea. It's a distraction that falls far short of the $12 billion needed to address the current backlog of park maintenance and does nothing to offset the almost $2 billion Trump asked Congress to cut from the Department of the Interior in his budget,” he said.
Mr. Trump also came under fire at the press briefing for the expense of frequent trips to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he has spent most weekends since taking office and where he will host Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.
The trips to the club, which Mr. Trump has dubbed the “Southern White House,” have cost taxpayers an estimated $10 million to date for security and travel aboard Air Force One.
Mr. Spicer told reporters that is been “ironic” that the expense of going to Mar-a-Lago was brought up on a day when Mr. Trump put more than $78,000 back into the government coffers.
“The president just donated a significant amount of money of his salary back to the federal government. And so, you know, respectfully, at what point does he do enough? He just gave a very sizable donation,” he said.
Mr. Spicer bristled at a reporter saying the donation was a “small amount.”
“I think to be able to say that — I mean, he isn't taking a salary. I think he's stepped down from his business. He's walked away from a lot,” said Mr. Spicer. “I think at some point, you know, he's done quite a lot, quite a bit in terms of making a donation to government.”

Preston Tucker made his mark on the 2015 Houston Astros in his rookie season. Tucker batted .243 (73x300) with 35 runs scored, 19 doubles, 13 home runs and 33 RBIs. He played a majority of his time in the field in left and right field.
A recurring question this offseason has been with Tucker's size and the logjam in the outfield the Astros, that Tucker wouldn't be better served playing first base. First base is arguably the biggest hole the Astros have at the moment with the departure of Chris Carter and stagnation of Jon Singleton.
The response each time from the Astros is Tucker is an outfielder. Houston Chronicle beat writer Evan Drellich echoed that well know fact in response to a question on Twitter today:
Tucker can play any position on the field if asked to. The Houston Astros LLC don't plan to use him beyond OF, DH https://t.co/yzMM6HKB6Q — Evan Drellich (@EvanDrellich) January 13, 2016
The beauty of Twitter is that it allows player to directly address those same questions.
Tucker linked to the 2010 SEC baseball awards. Tucker was selected as the first baseman on the all-defensive team. Tucker played four seasons (2009-2012) at Florida, batting .329 (341x1035) with 57 home runs and 258 RBIs.

Remember the last time an Astros player responded to a reporter's tweet:
Excerpted from 'The Great American Stickup'
"It Was the Economy, Stupid"
"How did this happen?" ~ President George W. Bush
"It was a humbling question for someone from the financial sector to be asked--after all, we were the ones responsible." ~ Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., former Goldman Sachs CEO
They did it.
Yes, there is a "they": the captains of finance, their lobbyists, and allies among leading politicians of both parties, who together destroyed an American regulatory system that had been functioning splendidly for most of the six decades since it was enacted in the 1930s.
The big cop-out in much of what has been written about the banking meltdown has been the argument by those most complicit that there was "enough blame to go around" and that no institution or individual should be singled out for accountability. "How could we have known?" is the refrain of those who continue to pose as all-knowing experts. "Everybody made mistakes," they say.
Nonsense. This was a giant hustle that served the richest of the rich and left the rest of us holding the bag, a life-altering game of musical chairs in which the American public was the one forced out. Worst of all, legislators from both political parties we elect and pay to protect our interests from the pirates who assaulted us instead changed our laws to enable them.
The most pathetic of excuses is the one provided by Robert Rubin, who fathered "Rubinomics," the economy policy of President Clinton's two-term administration: The economy ran into a "perfect storm," a combination of unforeseen but disastrously interrelated events. This rationalization is all too readily accepted by the mass media, which is not surprising, given that it neatly absolves the majority of business reporters and editors who had missed the story for years until it was too late.
The facts are otherwise. It is not conspiratorial but rather accurate to suggest that blame can be assigned to those who consciously developed and implemented a policy of radical financial deregulation that led to a global recession. As President Clinton's Treasury secretary, Rubin, the former cochair of Goldman Sachs, led the fight to free the financial markets from regulation and then went on to a $15-million-a-year job with Citigroup, the company that had most energetically lobbied for that deregulation. He should remember the line from the old cartoon strip Pogo: "We have met the enemy and he is us."
For it was this Wall Street and Democratic Party darling, along with his clique of economist super-friends -- Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, and a few others -- who inflated a giant real estate bubble by purposely not regulating the derivatives market, resulting in oceans of money that was poured into bad loans sold as safe investments. In the process, they not only caused an avalanche of pain and misery when the bubble inevitably burst but also shredded the good reputation of the American banking system nurtured since the Great Depression.
If we accept a broad dispersal of blame or a sense of inevitability -- or simply ignore the details, since they can be so confusing -- we lose the opportunity to rearrange our institutions to prevent such disasters from happening again.
That this is true has only been reinforced by the tentative response of the Obama administration in its first year. Even after a crash that economists agree is the biggest since the granddaddy of 1929, the president's proposed reform legislation stops far short of reintroducing the kind of regulation of the markets that prevented such disasters in the intervening eighty years. We still see a persistent fear, stoked by the same folks that led us into this abyss, that regulation and scrutiny will kill the golden goose of Wall Street profits and, by extension, U.S. prosperity.
If we as a people learn anything from this crash, however, it should be that there are no adults watching the store, only a tiny elite of self-interested multimillionaires and billionaires making decisions for the rest of us. As long as we cede that power to them, we can expect to continue getting bilked.
Three key myths consistently propagated about the financial markets proved devastating in this event. The first is that buyers and sellers are all logical and well informed about what they are doing, so the markets will always be "corrected" to provide accurate price values. The second is that whatever happens in these "free markets," the general public will not be hurt -- only irresponsible gamblers will lose their shirts. The third is that whenever the government gets involved, it will only screw things up; even if regulators only ask questions, it will poison the pond and spook the fish, to everybody's detriment.
All of these assumptions were proven false; the brave new world order of super-rational high-tech derivative marketing based on a Nobel Prize-winning mathematical model turned out to be a prescription for financial madness. A win-win system too good to be true turned out to be a cruel hoax in which most suffered terribly -- and not just that majority of the world's population that suffers from the whims of the market, but even some who designed and sold the new financial gimmicks. Left to their own devices, freed of rational regulatory restraint by an army of lobbyists and the politicians who serve them, one after another of the very top financial conglomerates imploded from the weight of their uncontrolled greed. Or would have imploded, as in the examples of Citigroup and AIG, if the government had not used taxpayer dollars to bail out those "too big to fail" conglomerates.
Unfinished FEMA Flood Maps Put Sandy Victims In Limbo

Superstorm Sandy pummeled the East Coast six months ago, and, as with other natural disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was there from day one, finding people temporary shelter and later supporting rebuilding efforts.
FEMA also has a lesser-known role. It oversees the creation of flood maps, which model the risk of flooding in different areas during storms. These maps are also used to set building codes and flood insurance rates. In New York and New Jersey, FEMA is updating those maps, and so far many homeowners don't like what they are seeing.
'Flying By The Seat Of Their Pants'
Sitting in a makeshift office in his garage, George Kasimos is "FEMA-ing." That's what he calls the research and organizing he does with a group he started called Stop FEMA Now.
"FEMA is flying by the seat of their pants," Kasimos says, "and we have to rebuild our homes with their seat-of-their-pants rules and regulations."
The first floor of his house in Toms River, N.J., flooded during the storm and he had to gut it. He says the construction could have been done in January, but he stopped work for a few months when FEMA released a new version of its flood maps, which are used to set insurance rates.
"I thought I was on that show Punk'd, to be honest. I just didn't believe it," he says.
Kasimos figured if he doesn't raise his home by 4 feet, his flood insurance would go from $1,000 per year to $15,000 per year. Because on these new maps, Kasimos is now in what's called a Velocity Zone, or V Zone. This means that in a "hundred-year storm," FEMA modeling predicts waves three feet or higher would hit his home.
Kasimos is supposed to elevate and put his house on pilings, which means lifting it off its foundation, moving it out of the way, and plunging big telephone poles into the ground for his house to sit atop. But Kasimos lives on a lagoon, not the open ocean. So he thinks he should be in an A Zone, at risk for flooding, but not wave damage. In an A Zone, he'd still elevate, but he could skip the costly pilings.
"In an A Zone, it cost about $50,000 for an average home ... for a V Zone, it's about $150,000," he says.
Kasimos took his plight to Facebook, and now has more than 3,500 likes for his group; they've started meeting near-weekly.
Literally A Work In Progress
"We do anticipate the V Zone in certain areas becoming smaller, it is an advisory product," FEMA's Bill McDonnell says.
McDonnell says he agrees the maps are a work in progress. When Sandy hit, FEMA was already two years into a project to update the flood maps, which in some areas dated back to the 1980s. It generally takes 3-5 years to finish, but FEMA decided to release an early version, like a rough draft, so that people could have the most recent data available to decide how to rebuild.
"[It was] just out there for informational purposes, and then the state of New Jersey adopted it as a land use policy," he says, "so that if people were going to rebuild, they have to rebuild to that standard."
So the "advisory" maps basically became building code for repairing properties that have substantial storm damage. The state didn't want people to rebuild based on old data and have to lift their houses higher later.
FEMA says the maps will change, but the number of people affected and the requirements for rebuilding will only decrease when the maps are finalized. That leaves Jersey Shore homeowners, like Kasimos, to decide whether to do work on their homes now that they may find out later wasn't actually needed.
Kasimos has decided to rebuild without elevating for now. He's trying to fix only what he has to in order to get back to normal. Even then, he's still doing work he'll have to tear up when he eventually elevates.
"[I'm] going to have to take apart the deck, my stairs, the siding, things like that, absolutely," he says.
FEMA says it understands the urgency and is moving as fast as it can. It expects to start releasing a new version of the maps county by county, perhaps as early as June.
The San Diego Chargers were handed their fifth consecutive loss on Monday night. The 22-19 defeat was familiar territory for the Chargers. Out of those five consecutive losses, four were due to costly fourth-quarter mistakes.
"It's pretty sickening," quarterback Philip Rivers said, per the team's official site.
"It's been a tough stretch to say the least," Rivers added. "You at least kind of wonder ... it's just crazy how they've all been similar. We had a chance in all of them. The Oakland one was a little out of hand, still, even that one we made it interesting.
"We just don't have the answers right now. It's not surrendering and saying we're not good enough. I'm not saying we're surrendering, but we are what we are, and right now, that's 2-7 on a five-game skid."
The Chargers' 16-7 lead was cut to two just minutes into the fourth quarter, mainly because of two self-inflicted penalties. The first stemmed from a flag on Stevie Johnson for delay of game after the receiver spiked the ball following a pass. D.J. Fluker drew the second penalty for being an illegal man downfield -- a play which otherwise would have been six on the board for San Diego (Rivers found Gates in the end zone).
"Obviously critical mistakes," head coach Mike McCoy said. "We can't have two penalties take points off the board. We would have gone up a score and instead we give them an opportunity to go down and go ahead. Critical mistakes."
The Bears capitalized on a gassed Chargers secondary, putting up 15 points in the fourth quarter.
"(The defense) did not make enough plays," McCoy said. "It comes down to that. That is what the game comes down to, making plays. We gave (the Bears) too many opportunities."
Aside from the penalties, Johnson believes it's the team's lack of discipline that ultimately led to the fourth-quarter meltdown.
"We just have to be better," Johnson said. "We just have to be more disciplined, I guess. And we have to be able to fight through it and overcome. We're learning. It's a learning process right now and we'll get better. It's about progressions."
Week 10 brings a much-needed bye for the banged-up Chargers roster. They'll hope to end their five-game skid against the Chiefs in Week 11.
Tammy Murray holds one of her dogs after her pets were saved in a Sacramento fire. Jan. 21, 2016
A total of 14 dogs, four cats and two parrots were rescued during and early Thursday morning Sacramento fire, leaving the homeowner with a smoky aftermath, but thankful to be reunited with her plethora of pets.
NBC affiliate KCRA reported that Sacramento Metro Fire crews were called about 3:45 a.m. to a fire at a home on I Street in North Highlands near McClellan Park. It appears as though fire started when the homeowner was making some toast and noticed the appliance smoking near the washer and dryer in the garage.
Firefighters battled the blaze that started in the garage, and were able to get the animals out to safety. The homeowner was more than grateful. She was extremely emotional afterward, circling her car, where she had placed several of her dogs for safekeeping.
“Material things?” Tammy Murray told KCRA. “You can keep it all.” Then she thanked the firefighters directly: “I owe you my life and my dogs. They all sleep with me.”
Life in space is hard on the human body. The lack of gravity's pull can quickly take its toll—bone density declines, muscles deteriorate and more. But compared to a fish, humans have it pretty easy, Michael Byrne reports for Motherboard.
Related Content What Happens to the Human Body in Space?
For several years, scientists working with the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) studied the effects of life aboard the International Space Station for a small school of medaka fish. Also known as Japanese rice fish, medaka are small, freshwater fish native to Japan. And they are invaluable for space research. Not only are they easy to breed, but they are transparent, giving researchers a clear view at their bones and guts as they adjust to life in space, Jessica Nimon writes for NASA's International Space Station Program Science Office.
It turns out that the effects of microgravity on medaka aren't much different than our own—the effects just set in much faster. For humans, it takes at least ten days for the symptoms to start showing up, but according to a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, the fish started losing bone density almost immediately upon arriving in orbit. Since humans and medaka grow their skeletons in similar ways, that gives scientists a good starting point to figure out how the process actually occurs, Byrne reports.
In order to get a closer look at how the fishes bodies reacted to life in space, the scientists genetically modified them so that two different types of cells would glow under different wavelengths of light. The first, osteoclasts, break down bone tissue as part of the process of repairing and maintaining any damage. The second, osteoblasts, create the matrices that bones form around, Byrne reports. As soon as the fish made it to the ISS, they went into a special tank designed for microgravity and were observed from a remote lab at Tsukuba Space Center using the two different fluorescent lights as their bodies adjusted to their new environment.
Because the fish reacted so quickly to their new living situation, the researchers were able to observe the effects of microgravity on their bodies almost in real time. Almost immediately, numbers of both types of cells increased noticeably when compared to an Earthbound control group, with certain genes going into action in ways not seen in normal gravity, Byrne reports.
While these findings are limited to this batch of lab-grown fish, it could eventually shed new light on the processes that govern how human bodies adapt to space as well as to typical human diseases like osteoporosis. For now, the researchers plan to continue their work with their next batch of fishy astronauts.
Almost a year after carrying out his attacks, the hacker behind the Hacking Team data breach has published a step-by-step explainer on how he breached the company's servers and stole all their data.
Known as Phineas Fisher (past moniker FinFisher), the hacker posted a PasteBin over the weekend, in which he reveals how the attack unfolded, the tools he used, and provided a tutorial for h@ckZ0r wannabees who want to enter the world of top-level hacking.
Since the whole exposé is quite a long read, we're going to provide a summary, but we recommend checking out Phineas Fisher's post for the finer tips on various hacking techniques and pen-testing tools.
Zero-day exploit in an embedded device was initial entry point
The hacker revealed that the entry point into Hacking Team's infrastructure was a zero-day root exploit in an embedded device deployed inside the company's corporate network. He declined to name the exact nature and purpose of the embedded device.
Phineas Fisher says he spent a lot of time scanning the company's network and even exposed a vulnerability in the Hacking Team's Joomla-based frontend website, discovered issues with their email server, a couple of routers, and some VPN appliances. Despite the large attack surface, he concluded that the zero-day exploit he identified was much more reliable for further attacks.
After writing and deploying a backdoored firmware to the vulnerable embedded device, he then waited, listening to internal traffic, scanning and mapping the local infrastructure.
MongoDB databases left without authentication strike again!
This is how he discovered a couple of vulnerable MongoDB databases that Hacking Team's admins failed to protect with a password. Here he found details about the company's backup system and the backups themselves.
The most precious backup was of the Exchange email server, from where he extracted the BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server ) admin account password, which was still valid.
This password allowed Phineas Fisher to escalate his access by hacking the company's Domain Admin server, from where he extracted the passwords for all the company's users.
Windows Domain users and passwords
Since there was a chance he'd get caught at any point, the first thing the hacker did was to use Windows Powershell and quickly exfiltrate the data found in the company's email server, which he regularly scraped for new emails every time he came back to their network in the following weeks.
Hacker discovers secret network where the RCS source code was hosted
After reading some of the stolen emails, Phineas Fisher understood that there was another hidden network inside the company's infrastructure, where the Hacking Team kept the source code of their RCS (Remote Control System) surveillance software.
With access to everyone's computers thanks to the Domain Admin server hack, Phineas Fisher focused on one of the company's top coders, Christian Pozzi.
Scanning Pozzi's computers and email accounts, Phineas Fisher eventually found the password to the Web interface of Hacking Team's GitLab source code management system. And that was it. System compromise achieved, new bonus level unlocked, and the rest is history.
"That's all it takes to take down a company and stop their human rights abuses. That's the beauty and asymmetry of hacking: with 100 hours of work, one person can undo years of work by a multi-million dollar company," Phineas Fisher explained. "Hacking gives the underdog a chance to fight and win."
UPDATE: The article was updated to change the hacker's nickname from FinFisher to Phineas Fisher. FinFisher is an older moniker, which he does not use anymore, and coincidentally the name of Hacking Team's main rivals.

Moses Intercedes for the People
13 But Moses said to the Lord , “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for you brought up this people in your might from among them,
14 and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O Lord , are in the midst of this people. For you, O Lord , are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
15 Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say,
16 ‘It is because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.'
17 And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promised, saying,
18 ‘The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, to the third and the fourth generation.'
Coroners and police in the Chicago area say they are alarmed about the use of synthetic forms of heroin that are sometimes taken as a heroin substitute or mixed with it to produce deadly effect.
In McHenry County, Coroner Anne Majewski said two deaths last year were related to the use of furanyl fentanyl, a type of synthetic opioid that has shown up elsewhere in the collar counties in recent months along with other dangerous forms of fentanyl. Test results are pending on another McHenry County death this year suspected to involve furanyl fentanyl, Majewski said.
It's "a very serious concern as (we're) seeing more cases of synthetics alone and heroin laced with other opioids," she said.
Meanwhile, authorities in McHenry County have continued their aggressive pursuit of criminal charges — including drug-induced homicide — for those accused of selling or providing heroin and other opioids.
Just in the past week, a Huntley man was charged with drug-induced homicide after authorities said he supplied a mix of heroin and furanyl fentanyl believed to have been ingested by a man who was found unresponsive at a Lake in the Hills home in April and later died, according to the McHenry County sheriff's office.
Terrance Kampas, 27, also was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, police said.
Two days later, in a separate case, a Wauconda man pleaded guilty to drug-induced homicide, admitting that in 2015 he sold heroin to a 28-year-old Port Barrington man who suffered a fatal overdose.
In that case, Rolando Aguilar, 28, was sentenced to eight years in prison, officials said.
Thursday, the same day that Aguilar pleaded guilty, the sheriff's department also announced the arrest of a man they said was caught selling heroin while he was out of jail on bond following a heroin-related arrest in July.
Authorities said more than 40 grams of heroin were seized from the home of Brian Freund, 30, of Wonder Lake, and he has been charged with unlawful possession and delivery of a controlled substance, according to a police news release.
Another man was sentenced this past week to three years in prison after a probation violation stemming from heroin delivery charges related to his girlfriend's fatal overdose in 2015. Cody Hillier, of Algonquin, admitted to using drugs while on probation last year.
Hillier had testified last month against James Linder, the Zion man who sold the heroin that was linked to the death of Hillier's girlfriend, Danielle Barzyk.
Linder was found guilty of drug-induced homicide in Barzyk's death and awaits sentencing.

Is it accurate when the media portrays the atheist movement as a club for old white men? It's undeniable that most of the time men outnumber women, whether you're looking at conference attendees or conference speakers, blog readers or best-selling authors. But when Monica Shores wrote that “no women are currently recognized as leaders or even mentioned as a force within the movement,” the atheist community cried out.
Why? Because it's blatantly untrue.
Women atheists not only exist–we've played pivotal roles within the secular community. The most vocal atheist activist at the beginning of the modern movement was Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who founded American Atheists in 1963 and was instrumental in the removal of compulsory prayer from public schools in the US. While her personality was off-putting to some, it is undeniable that she brought atheism into the public eye.
Since then, women continue to fill leadership positions in the movement. Lori Lipman Brown is the founding director of Secular Coalition for America, the only lobbying group for atheist, agnostic and humanist Americans. Annie Laurie Gaylor is co-founder and current co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, an organization devoted to upholding the separation of church and state. Camp Quest, a summer camp for children of parents with naturalistic worldviews, was co-founded by Helen Kagin and currently has Amanda Metskas as its executive director. Lyz Liddell is director of campus organizing for the Secular Student Alliance. Debbie Goddard is the director of African Americans for Humanism and campus outreach coordinator at the Center for Inquiry. Before someone quips that there are no atheist women in foxholes, Kathleen Johnson is the founder of the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, in addition to being vice president of American Atheists.
I could go on, but I think you get the point.
And don't assume that women are relegated to working behind the scenes, or only come in the form of the “gentle storyteller.” Dozens and dozens of women authors, journalists, bloggers, podcasters and comedians are producing amazing work, some of them gnashing their teeth even louder than Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. (Check out the list at the end of this piece).
Then why, you may ask, are so few as well known as the male firebrands? Is it because, as Shores suggests, that “there's little indication that atheists are receptive to the suggestion that they might benefit from diversifying in color or gender”?
If you'll momentarily excuse me for lapsing into religious language: Hell no.
Atheists are well aware of this gender disparity and have been actively trying to close the gap. Local organizations are creating more family friendly events to encourage mothers to participate. Popular blogs like Pharyngula (written by a man) and Friendly Atheist (written by a, gasp!, young non-white man) frequently address women's issues and ask how to make the movement more welcoming. Conference organizers have been recruiting more women as speakers and, thanks to that, women have become better represented as conference attendees. Just looking at my own schedule for the next couple months, I've been invited to speak about women and atheism by five different groups so far.
So why the gap?
People like to speculate that women are more inclined to supernatural thinking, hate to be aggressive or are more afraid of leaving community behind. These nonsensical ideas illustrate the true problem: We live in a society where everything is affected by sexism, and the atheist movement is downstream from those effects. So when atheists draw many members from academic and scientific circles, which have their own gender bias issues, we end up being a victim of statistics. What's more, people in leadership positions tend to be older because they have more experience, so there's always a bit of a time lag in diverse representation. (Given time, I think we'll see more and more atheist women in positions of greater visibility, and I'd hazard a guess that one will have the best seller soon enough). This problem is compounded when the media fails to mention deserving women atheists–even in articles in feminist publications asking where all the atheist women are. Screaming “Right here!” only does so much.
It's irritating when the media makes it seem like the atheist movement has a “woman problem.” For one thing, my experience in the movement has shown atheists to be far less sexist than the general population. It's not surprising–humanism is explicitly supportive of gender equality, while many mainstream religions are extraordinarily anti-women. There's always room to improve, mainly because we're human, too, but we're actively working towards those improvements.
But frankly, it's most irritating because it can scare away women who need some extra courage in “coming out” as nonreligious. That's what “New Atheism” is about–not just persuading people that religion is mistaken, but providing a community and refusing to sit silently.
So if you're looking for some like-minded ladies, here are some amazing atheist women to check out. Don't wait for the media to clue you in.
This is just a short list, painfully narrowed down for space; for the longer version, please check out the Large List of Awesome Female Atheists.

Ed Sheeran has said he is a fan of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, praising him as a politician who "cares about other people".
The 26-year-old singer songwriter spoke to the Sunday Times about politics and music, where he also said he avoids mixing the two in his own work because fans are not interested in what he has to say.
"I have political views but nobody buys my records going: 'I wonder what he thinks about politics?' Nobody," he said.

"People buy my records to put on while they make out. I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do."
Of Corbyn he said: "I love Corbyn. I love everything Corbyn is about. And I feel people thought that, because I didn't put myself behind him, I wasn't a Corbyn supporter," he said.
"If you knew me as a person, and listened to my music, you would be able to make a pretty educated guess that he would be the kind of person I really dig. He cares about other people. He cares about all classes, races and generations, and that's how I was brought up - we need more people that care about everyone."
Sheeran was recently revealed as the most-played artist on Spotify of 2017, with 47m monthly listeners.
There was shock among music industry figures following the 2018 Grammy nominations announcement, where the record-breaking artist was snubbed in three major categories: Best Album, Best Record, and Song of the Year.

We're making a tiny bit of progress in the battle against the welfare state. No, policy hasn't changed yet, but at least there's growing recognition that maybe, just maybe, it's not a good idea to pay people not to work. Particularly when you trap them in lives of dependency and despair and undermine progress in the fight against poverty.
This chart shows that various handouts discourage low-income people from earning more money, and a recent blockbuster study from a couple of my colleagues at the Cato Institute revealed that welfare pays more than entry-level employment in dozens of states.
And a growing number of people are now aware that there's been an explosion of food stamp dependency, so one hopes that all this knowledge eventually will translate into a new round of welfare reform.
Why am I optimistic? Well, because awareness already is leading to change in some very unexpected places. Even Scandinavian nations are realizing that there has to be a limit to incentive-killing and taxpayer-sapping redistribution.
Here are some excerpts from a remarkable Bloomberg report about developments in Denmark.
“We live in a world of global competition for jobs,” the 40-year-old minister said in an interview in Copenhagen. “For any finance minister wanting to be taken seriously, it's something to deal with. That requires a modernization of the welfare state.” The AAA rated nation, whose economy contracted 0.2 percent in the first half, needs to contain welfare spending or risk losing the respect of investors, Corydon said. Danes, who like Swedes and Norwegians, are used to generous jobless pay as well as state-financed education and health care, need to learn that those privileges come at a cost, he said. …Denmark's challenge now is to ensure its welfare habits don't leave it unable to compete with populations that work harder at a lower cost, he said.
That's a noteworthy passage, both because the Danish Finance Minister recognizes jurisdictional competition as a check on the welfare state (something confirmed by a study from German economists) and because Denmark is ruled by Social Democrats.
Yet even these leftists are grasping that it makes no sense to have a system that generates perverse incentives.
…out-of-work Danes in some cases earn even more than those in low-skilled jobs. An Aug. 27 report by the Economy Ministry showed that about 250,000 Danes have no economic incentive to give up their unemployment benefits and take a job. That compares with 2.64 million people in full- and part-time jobs, according to Statistics Danmark. …The Social Democrat-led coalition of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, in office since 2011, has pushed through cuts including limiting unemployment benefits to two years from four years.
It's hardly radical libertarianism to reduce unemployment benefits from four years to two years, but it is rather significant when even politicians realize that it's not good – as illustrated by these powerful cartoons – to lure people into the wagon when nations need more people pulling the wagon.
The article even mentions “Lazy Robert,” a famous deadbeat who became the first Danish member of the Moocher Hall of Fame last April. No wonder Danes may be saying that enough is enough.
There's even a bit of good news on the tax side of the fiscal ledger.
The government has responded to the economic slump by cutting the corporate tax rate, as well as some other taxes.
Sounds like Danish policymakers could give some lessons to their self-destructive American counterparts.
But you won't be surprised to learn that there's still plenty of bad policy in Denmark. The politicians can't resist, for instance, the siren song of Keynesian economics.
It plans to spend 44 billion kroner ($7.8 billion) next year on building railroads, highways and hospitals. …Corydon,…said he wants to keep public investments close to a 30-year high to create jobs.
By the way, it's a bit depressing that Denmark actually ranks higher than the United States in the most recent Economic Freedom of the World rankings.
Yes, their welfare state is too big, their tax system is a nightmare, and they are saddled with one of the world's most expensive bureaucracies, but Denmark has ultra-free market policies in other areas.
But even those laissez-faire policies no longer are apparently enough to compensate for bad fiscal policy.
P.S. Denmark may have Lazy Robert, but the United Kingdom has Natailija, Tracey, Anjem, and Gina and Danny, so if there were a welfare Olympics, the U.K. would have a lot more medals.
P.P.S. Speaking of poverty, you may be surprised that bureaucrats at the OECD assert that America has more poverty than some very poor nations. But that's only because the Paris-based bureaucracy is trying to advance Obama's redistribution agenda by redefining poverty to mean differences in income rather than lack of income. Sort of makes you wonder why we're subsidizing their statist agenda with our tax dollars.
World War I reparations refers to the payments and transfers of property and equipment that Germany was forced to make under the Treaty of Versailles (1919) following its defeat during World War I. Article 231 of the Treaty (the so-called 'war guilt' clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all 'loss and damage' suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for reparations.
In January 1921, the total sum due was decided by an Inter-Allied Reparations Commission and was set at 269 billion gold marks (the equivalent of around 100,000 tonnes of pure gold), about £13 billion or US$64 billion[Note 1] ($785 billion in 2011),[Note 2] a sum that many economists at the time deemed to be excessive.[1] The yearly amount paid was reduced in 1924 and in 1929 the total sum to be paid was reduced by over 50%. Payments ceased when Adolf Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party took power in 1933, with about one-eighth of the initial reparations paid.[1] The final payments were made on 4 October 2010, the twentieth anniversary of German reunification.[1]

Evolution of Reparations
There was extensive debate about the justice and likely impact of the reparations demands both before and after the publication and signing of the Treaty of Versailles and other Treaties in 1919. Most famously, the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, John Maynard Keynes, resigned from the Treasury in June 1919 in protest at the scale of the reparations demands, and subsequently protested publicly in the best-selling The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919).[2]
The 1924 Dawes Plan modified Germany's reparation payments. The Americans Owen D. Young and Seymour Parker Gilbert were appointed to implement this plan. In May 1929, the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion Gold Marks, US$26.6 billion over a period of 59 years (1988). In addition, the Young Plan divided the annual payment, set at two billion Gold Marks, US$473 million, into two components, one unconditional part equal to one third of the sum and a postponable part for the remaining two-thirds.

A months-long undercover police investigation has uncovered a women-trafficking and prostitution network in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan.
The investigation, reported Sunday by Israel Radio, was conducted under the auspices of the Tel Aviv Police and resulted in the arrest of two men suspected of running the trafficking ring.
Additional arrests are expected, the Hebrew-language Walla news site reported.

The suspected ringleader of the group, identified as Leonid Streimer, is a 35-year-old resident of the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam.
The investigation reportedly turned up a complex operation in which the network would locate young Russian and Ukrainian women, some of whom had worked as models, and convince them to come to Israel on tourist visas, promising they would find work amid the difficult economic situations in their home countries.
Once they got to Israel, the women were housed in luxury condominium towers and expensive hotels, where the ring allegedly operated brothels for businessmen and wealthy individuals.
The women would charge significant fees for their sexual services, of which the network operators would get a percentage. A police source told Walla that one woman told investigators she would earn $3,000 or more per week, most of which she would send to her family in Ukraine.
The investigation began following complaints by neighbors in the luxury buildings, who suspected that brothels were being operated near their homes.
In September 2014, police arrested two suspects for running a prostitution ring that consisted of Russian and Ukrainian women brought to Israel on medical tourism visas.
According to the Task Force on Human Trafficking, an alliance of Israeli NGOs, there are 15,000 women working in the sex trade in Israel.
US inequality is at its highest point for nearly a century. Those at the top – no matter how you slice it – are enjoying a larger share of the national pie; the number below the poverty level is growing. The gap between those with the median income and those at the top is growing, too. The US used to think of itself as a middle-class country – but this is no longer true.
Economists have justified such disparities by citing “marginal productivity theory”, which explains higher incomes through greater societal contributions. But those who have really transformed our society, by providing the knowledge that underpins the advances in technology, earn a relative pittance. Just think of the inventors of the laser, the Turing machine or the discoverers of DNA. The innovation of those on Wall Street, while well compensated, brought the global economy to the brink of ruin; and these financial entrepreneurs walked off with mega-incomes.
One might feel better about inequality if there were a grain of truth in trickle-down economics. But the median income of Americans today is lower than it was a decade and a half ago; and the median income of a full-time male worker is lower than it was more than four decades ago. Meanwhile, those at the top have never had it so good.
Some argue that increased inequality is an inevitable byproduct of the market. False: several countries are reducing inequality while maintaining economic growth.
Markets are shaped by the rules of the game. Our political system has written rules that benefit the rich at the expense of others. Financial regulations allow predatory lending and abusive credit-card practices that transfer money from the bottom to the top. So do bankruptcy laws that provide priority for derivatives. The rules of globalisation – where capital is freely mobile but workers are not – enhance an already large asymmetry of bargaining: businesses threaten to leave the country unless workers make strong concessions.
Textbooks teach us that we can have a more egalitarian society only if we give up growth or efficiency. However, closer analysis shows that we are paying a high price for inequality: it contributes to social, economic and political instability, and to lower growth. Western countries with the healthiest economies (for example those in Scandinavia) are also the countries with the highest degree of equality.
The US grew far faster in the decades after the second world war, when inequality was lower, than it did after 1980, since when the gains have gone disproportionately to the top. There is growing evidence looking across countries over time that suggests a link between equality, growth and stability.
There is good news in this: by reducing rent-seeking – finding ways of getting a larger share of the pie, rather than making the pie larger – and the distortions that give rise to so much of America's inequality we can achieve a fairer society and a better-performing economy. Laws that tax speculators at less than half the rate of those who work for a living or make the innovations that are transforming our society, say something about our values; but they also distort our economy, encouraging young people to move into gambling rather than into more productive areas. Since so much of the income at the top is derived from rent seeking, higher taxes at the top would discourage rent-seeking.
America used to be thought of as the land of opportunity. Today, a child's life chances are more dependent on the income of his or her parents than in Europe, or any other of the advanced industrial countries for which there are data. The US worked hard to create the American dream of opportunity. But today, that dream is a myth.
We can once again become a land of opportunity but it will not happen on its own, and it will not happen with a politics that focuses on cutting public education and other programmes to enhance opportunities for the bottom and middle, while cutting taxes for those at the very top. President Barack Obama's support for these investments, as well as the “Buffett rule” that asks those at the top to pay at least as much in tax as a share of their income as those who are less fortunate, are moves in the right direction. Republican candidate Mitt Romney's suggestion that we cut back on public employees is worrisome; as is his silence on whether capital gains on speculation should be taxed at a lower rate than income derived from hard work.
The country will have to make a choice: if it continues as it has in recent decades, the lack of opportunity will mean a more divided society, marked by lower growth and higher social, political and economic instability. Or it can recognise that the economy has lost its balance. The gilded age led to the progressive era, the excesses of the Roaring Twenties led to the Depression, which in turn led to the New Deal. Each time, the country saw the extremes to which it was going and pulled back. The question is, will it do so once again?

In north central Iowa, competition for workers has grown so fierce that Forest City's Winnebago Industries is offering new employees a $1,000 hiring bonus if they work a full year at the RV manufacturer.
About 20 miles away in Garner, David Zrostlik, president of Stellar Industries, says that may be an option to fill open positions at his plant, whose 400 workers make field service trucks.
"For years, I sold our products to prospective customers. Now, I spend just as much time selling our company to prospective employees," said Zrostlik, whose hiring list includes engineers, painters, welders and assemblers.
Iowa's 3.1 percent unemployment rate is the lowest the state has seen in 16 years — so low that experts worry it could hinder the state's economic growth.
The impact may already be showing up in Iowa's budget problems, with retail and use sales and personal income tax receipts falling behind projections.
Officials have cut spending and are dipping into the state's cash reserves to close an estimated $300 million budget shortfall. Iowa ended its fiscal year Friday.

Iowa's economy has rebounded since the Great Recession, but recently it's showing signs of slowing.
Iowa added 110,200 jobs since 2010, with Des Moines alone gaining 47,700 positions.
Iowa workers have seen their real weekly wages climb 8.1 percent, outpacing the nation's 5.3 percent growth.
But last year, Iowa's economy inched up less than 1 percent, much lower than the gains of 2.2 percent in 2015 and 3.1 percent in 2014, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data that was adjusted for inflation.
The same held true last year for average weekly wages, which rose a meager 0.8 percent after adjusting for inflation.
Zrostlik said difficulty finding workers has impacted growth.
"We've got a lot of orders in-house," he said. "We're getting behind on production."
Agriculture at fault?
Top political leaders have pointed the finger at Iowa's ag downturn, now in its fourth year, for a slowing economy and sandbagging the state's budget.
Iowa farmers reported $12.3 million in losses in the 2016 tax year, a massive change from 2012, when they reported $1.4 billion in earnings because of record-high corn and soybean prices the year after a drought.
Others, however, doubt that agriculture deserves all the blame for Iowa's budget woes.
"I don't think that farming can explain all of it, but it's certainly a drag" on the budget, said Amy Rehder Harris, the Iowa Department of Revenue's chief economist.
Iowa and U.S. farmers have struggled with commodity prices that have fallen as much as 55 percent. At the same time, costs for seed, fertilizers and other inputs have been slow to decline.
Experts say the lingering ag downturn is something state leaders should have baked into their budget.

David Roederer, director of the Iowa Department of Management, said the state did.
"It was down more than we had estimated," he said.
Mike Lipsman, a partner at Strategic Economics Group in West Des Moines, sees bigger policy problems with the state's budget — an ever-eroding tax base that is squeezing revenue.
The problem was highlighted in May, when a state fiscal analyst said new tax exemptions on goods that manufacturers use in production could cost close to $100 million — nearly four times more than originally estimated.
"We have factors that are causing the economy to slow down, but we've made it worse with policy changes," Lipsman said.
Tax receipts lagging
The state budget can provide some clues about the health of the economy, including what Iowans are earning and what they're buying.
Through May, the state says personal income tax receipts climbed 2.5 percent to $4.13 billion, trailing the state's 4.1 percent growth estimate.
Total state sales and use tax receipts on purchases such as clothes, TVs and trucks reached about $2.61 billion, only 0.4 percent higher than a year earlier, and behind the weak 1.5 percent projection.
The state is investigating the reasons behind its lackluster revenues, which can be complicated by growing consumer purchases online that escape taxes.
Lipsman likes to look at Iowans' spending on eating and drinking — the kind of fun expenditures consumers whack from their budgets when money gets tight.
Last year, taxable sales increased 3.3 percent to $4.3 billion, compared with a 5.6 percent spending climb in 2015.
Iowans cut $137 million in spending last year.
"That's a big drop," Lipsman said.
Wanted: More workers
There's another number that causes economists concern: Despite its low unemployment, Iowa had about 11,100 fewer workers in May than a year earlier.
"You can't grow jobs if you don't have someone" to fill them, said Ernie Goss, an economist at Creighton University in Omaha.
Amanda Formaro, a human resources director for Kemin Industries, said the Des Moines animal and human food supplement manufacturer wants to fill 29 positions ranging from accountants to scientists to tech and production workers.
The company offers its workers a $1,000 bonus for referring a new hire who stays with the company a year.
Those inside referral bonuses can climb to as much as $5,000 for good tech hires because of the "ferocious competition," said Joel Jackman, co-owner of Paragon IT, a Des Moines recruiter.
Big companies are investing in tech to push productivity — possibly reducing workforce needs. And state and local governments are encouraging tech startups.
"The demand has never been as high," particularly for college tech graduates needed to replace retiring Baby Boomers who are leaving the U.S. workforce at an estimated 10,000 a day, Jackman said.
With the tight labor market, many workers — from engineers and software developers to customer service reps — often are fielding two or three job offers, said David Leto, executive vice president at the Palmer Group, a West Des Moines recruiter.
Emilee Earlywine, a 22-year-old Iowa State University ag business graduate, was one of them. She's training now for a sales position with AgReliant Genetics, an Indiana seed company.
The company's recruiter called her the first day of her senior year.
"I had six interviews and three offers. I liked AgReliant's small-company feel," said Earlywine, who's put 3,000 miles on the company's truck learning about the company, its seeds and farming.
The wage conundrum
All that demand should mean employers are pushing up wages for workers, Goss said.
But that's not the case for many.
"That's the conundrum," he said. "Wages are getting bid up, but only for some workers."
Last year, Iowa's real weekly wages climbed less than $10 to $864. Nationally, wages were mostly flat at $1,031 in 2016.
Central Iowa workers have seen an average wage increase of about 3 percent annually in recent years, said Leto, the Palmer Group executive.
"Nobody has gone crazy and shot for the moon" on salary, said Leto, whose firm provides an annual salary guide.
He expects next year will see a larger increase.
David Swenson, an ISU economist, said workers will find their way to good jobs if the pay is right.
With its older workforce, Iowa likely will need to look to neighboring states for workers.
That means Des Moines employers will need to convince workers in Omaha, St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago and elsewhere to make the move.
Des Moines and other cities already are pulling workers from smaller Iowa cities and rural areas.
Growth from immigrant labor also could be limited, given the Trump administration's efforts to restrict travel.
"Our labor force is naturally contracting, and that's a problem," he said.
Zrostlik, president of Stellar Industries, hopes good pay, working conditions and benefits such as employee ownership bring more workers to Garner, a town of 3,000.
He's working with town leaders to increase housing options.
"It's a whole big basket of stuff we have to do as an employer and small community to attract workers," he said.

NBA back! To prepare for a new season, we're breaking down one team per day, each day, until tipoff on October 17.
Team: Toronto Raptors
Coach: Dwane Casey (seventh season)
Last Season: 51-31 (third in the Eastern Conference)
Notable Addition: C.J. Miles (sign-and-trade), OG Anunoby (draft)
Notable Subtraction: Patrick Patterson (free agency), Cory Joseph (sign-and-trade)
Vegas Over/Under: 47.5 wins
Best-Case Scenario: The Raptors reach their first NBA Finals in franchise history.
Toronto has joined the NBA's 3-point revolution, if preseason is any indication. Through Saturday morning, the Raptors have attempted 57.2 percent of their shots from 3-point range, which leads the NBA by a decimal point over the Rockets.
NBA teams this preseason are taking 35.9% of their shots from 3. Raptors & Rockets are above 57%. Last year's league rate was "only" 31.6%. — Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnorNBA) October 7, 2017
After playing prehistoric midrange ball that led to annual playoff skids for the past few seasons, the Raptors are finally playing contemporary basketball. It's nice to see. They're taking more 3s. They're not settling for midrange jumpers early in the clock. They're moving the ball, with 40 assists on 68 makes. The problem is Toronto is hitting only 27.6 percent of those 3s, compared to 42.3 percent for Houston. (Admittedly, we're working with a teeny-tiny sample size.) The Raptors hit 36.3 percent of their 3s last season, so their shooting percentage should rise over the course of the actual season. They likely won't continue jacking over half their shots from downtown, but from a process-oriented perspective, their preseason style of ball is encouraging.
Still, for the Raptors to achieve their best-case scenario, they'll need to shoot the ball better. Kyle Lowry, C.J. Miles, and Serge Ibaka are the only consistently reliable 3-point shooters in their primary rotation. Someone on the team will need to have a surprise season.
Maybe that player is Norman Powell, who just got awarded a four-year, $42 million extension. Powell has shown flashes, especially in the past two playoffs, but has never put it together over the course of an 82-game regular season. Maybe that player is DeMar DeRozan, who must become more effective from behind the arc. Thus far this preseason it remains to be seen if he will. Maybe rookie forward OG Anunoby returns as a brand-spanking-new player and establishes himself as the obvious steal of the draft. Who knows?
The bottom line is that someone needs to step up offensively. Dwane Casey's “culture reset,” if it even sustains into the season, won't be enough.
Worst-Case Scenario: Toronto becomes notorious for launching 3s at a league-high rate despite having no real 3-point shooters. It'd be comedic, like playing playground basketball with your friends who insist on shooting from deep when they have no business shooting at all. The Raptors shot 40.8 percent from deep midrange last season (2-pointers taken from 16–24 feet) per NBA.com Stats, which equates to 0.82 points per shot. They'd need to shoot only 27.2 percent from 3 to match an expected point per shot of 0.82. It'd be like an experiment, since even just 30 percent from 3 would be a statistical increase in the Raptors' scoring production.
Barring major injuries, the Raptors are going to be competitive. But if Miami or Milwaukee usurps them in the standings, taking home court advantage away from Toronto, it'd be a major disappointment, especially after they brought back the band. Under this scenario, DeRozan continues shooting a putrid rate from downtown. Powell doesn't get any better. Bruno Caboclo stays two years away from being two years away. Nobody steps up as the backup point guard, with Joseph now in Indiana. The rest of the young guys don't blossom. Lowry, now 31 years old, starts declining after signing a big-money deal this offseason. Maybe the short-term worst-case scenario results in Masai Ujiri deciding to blow it up, which could actually be the best-case scenario long-term.
TL;DR: The Raptors are launching 3s, but they'll need to start hitting them for their new style to work.
Why Earthing...
In the last hundred or so years we have lost something vital for our health and wellbeing: our electrical connection to the Earth. With the advent of rubber and plastic soled shoes, and insulating mattresses in insulating houses, we spend our days and nights disconnected from the Earth.
One only has to walk barefoot in the grass or on a beach to regain this connection and feel the nurturing effects, and yet in our modern lives it is not always practical to do so. There is a very physical and scientifically verifiable reason why we feel better when we do this:
The Earth is a massive reservoir of negatively charged free electrons. Without a connection to this reservoir, the cells in our body are unable to balance the positive charge which results from things like electron-deficient free radicals. The effect of excess positive charge in the blood can be seen very clearly by the way in which the cells are attracted to clump together (see Scientific Research).
There are various things we can do to balance this electron-deficiency, such as anti-oxidant rich foods and drinking living water. But what has been largely overlooked until recently is receiving free electrons from the Earth.
It's such a simple thing and yet the effect can be so profound. In our modern lives we can't always be outside and barefoot, and so the products offered on this website are designed to provide this electrical connection to the Earth in a convenient and practical way.
Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)
There is another effect of grounding which is particularly relevant in our modern electrical world. Our environment is full of a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from computers, mobile phones & masts, radio & TV broadcasts, WiFi, Bluetooth, power lines, domestic wiring, and other electrical appliances.
This electromagnetic radiation induces voltages in our bodies, disrupting the trillions of subtle electrical communications which are a vital part of the function of our body's systems. By being grounded to the Earth we greatly reduce the levels of these induced voltages. This video demonstrates this.
We are electrical beings, living on an electrical planet, and our connection is vital for our health and wellbeing.

Senator Ron Wyden Calls 'Baloney' On Claim That Title II Will Increase Taxes On Your Internet Bill: 'I Wrote The Law'
from the i'm-guessing-baloney-was-something-else-before-that... dept
I wrote the Internet Tax Freedom Act. So I want to set the record straight about the false claim being peddled by opponents of net neutrality. They are saying things that aren't true to try to stop the FCC from acting to protect the free and open Internet. The claim: If the FCC reclassifies broadband Internet access as a “common carrier” under Title II, consumers could be stuck with new taxes by state and local governments. In a word: Baloney. The facts: Net Neutrality is not going to invalidate the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA).
My colleagues and I knew people would try to tax the Internet if they could. So in ITFA Congress broadly defined the term “Internet access.” It is illegal to tax the internet. Under Title II or otherwise. The FCC could define the Internet as a series of tubes and ITFA would still prohibit taxes. The “grandfather clause” in ITFA will not allow cities to suddenly open the Internet up to telecom taxes. If the FCC reclassifies broadband Internet, it will not change if states taxed Internet access before 1998. The FCC has broad authority, but it cannot rewrite history. The bottom line: The Internet Tax Freedom Act will protect the Internet from taxes regardless of how the FCC defines Internet access. The opponents of the open Internet aren't quitting. But the good news: neither are we.
We recently wrote about a very questionable study that argued that if the FCC does, in fact, reclassify broadband under Title II, it would lead to "$15 billion in new taxes" on your broadband bill. That number was bullshit. It conflated a bunch of different and totally unrelated things, and pretended that they were connected to reclassifying under Title II. In fact, most of the "taxes" in the report were attributed to the expiration of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (which put a moratorium on internet access taxes at the local level) which was set to expire this month(no matter what happened with the FCC). And, as part of the Cromnibus agreement, Congress agreed to extend the moratorium on taxes until late next year (when it will almost certainly be extended again). And with that, poof, almost the entire claimed $15 billion disappeared -- having absolutely nothing to do with the Title II decision.To put an exclamation point on this, Senator Ron Wyden (also, an occasional Techdirt contributor ) released one of the best statements you'll see from a politician, literally calling "baloney" on the tax claim , and noting that he wrote the damn law, so he knows what it covers -- and pointing out that the moratorium applies whether or not broadband is classified under Title II:And yet, somehow, don't be surprised if this ridiculous tax myth lives on...

Police search for evidence at the site of the stabbing in Sapporo's Higashi Ward on Nov. 26. (Aya Amano)
SAPPORO--A 12-year-old boy who admitted to stabbing a woman in the back in a random attack here said he did so because he wanted "to hurt someone," police said.
The boy has been placed in temporary custody by child welfare authorities and cannot be named because he is a minor.
The victim, who is in her 20s, was stabbed on her way home from work around 5:55 p.m. on Nov. 25 in a residential area of the city's Higashi Ward. She suffered a deep knife wound that will take one to two months to heal, police said.
The boy said he saw the young woman walking in front of him and stabbed her with a knife he had shoplifted.
Hokkaido prefectural police referred the case to a child counseling center in the city on Nov. 26 under provisions of the Child Welfare Law on grounds the boy is clearly in need of professional care.
Police said the first-year junior high school student had admitted to attempted murder.
Police found the boy Nov. 26 at a shopping center near the site of the attack and began questioning him. At first the boy denied any involvement, but later confessed to stabbing the woman.
“The woman was walking on the street ahead of me and I stabbed her in the back" and "I was overcome with a sense of wanting to hurt someone," the boy was quoted by police as saying.
The boy also spoke about his dark fantasies of scenes of dead people or killing people.
Police said the boy carried the knife in his backpack. They found the empty package for the knife in his home, along with another one still wrapped.
The boy told police he stole the knife from a large shopping complex a month or two ago as well as the other blade that investigators found in his home.
The incident occurred in a residential area on the western side of Okadama Airport in Sapporo close to Sakaemachi Station, a subway stop on the Toho Line.
After being stabbed, the woman asked for help and a pedestrian contacted the emergency 110 number who saw her falling to the ground.
Although she wore a thick coat, the knife remained stuck in her back, police said.
The child counseling center took the boy into protective custody after being contacted by police.
Because the boy is under the age of 14, he cannot be held criminally responsible for his actions under the Juvenile Law.
In general, police refer young offenders to a child counseling center and the facility decides whether or not the case should be heard by a family court.
A revision to the Juvenile Law in 2007 allows for children aged around 12 or older to be sent to reform schools for juvenile delinquents. Previously, the ceiling was set at 14.
UFC heavyweight contender Ben Rothwell saw a four-fight winning streak come to a screeching halt with a disappointing loss to Junior Dos Santos at April's UFC Fight Night 86 event, but he's already shaken off the disappointment of the night – and for good reason.
Rothwell (36-10 MMA, 6-4 UFC) is brimming with confidence again as he prepares for a UFC 203 battle with Fabricio Werdum (20-6-1 MMA, 8-3 UFC), and “Big Ben” said he's destined for great things.
“I know that I can defeat any heavyweight on the planet,” Rothwell said. “That's it right now.”
UFC 203 takes place Sept. 10 at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. UFC heavyweight champ Stipe Miocic meets Alistair Overeem in the night's pay-per-view headliner, while Rothwell and Werdum meet in the co-feature.
Rothwell currently sits at No. 7 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA heavyweight rankings, while Werdum – who lost the heavyweight title to Miocic in May – sits at No. 2.
Despite the disappointing loss to-Dos Santos, Rothwell said he believes the fight could very well be a No. 1 contender matchup, especially if he performs the way he believes he can. Sure, Cain Velasquez is in the mix, and Andrei Arlovski and Josh Barnett also have a big fight lined up for UFC Fight Night 93 on Sept. 3, but Rothwell said he thinks he can leapfrog everyone with a memorable win.
“I think I have a great opportunity to prove (I'm the No. 1 contender),” Rothwell said. “I know that's what (Werdum) is taking the fight for, and we're the co-main event to the heavyweight title fight, and the challenger I've already knocked out, and the current champion wasn't able to fight me in October because he pulled out against me, so I feel there's already history there. There's a guy or so that's obviously in the line. I think it's about performance, and I think Sept. 10, a challenger for the title will emerge.”
Should his hunch prove correct, Rothwell would be in line for the winner of the Miocic-Overeem contest. Rothwell was supposed to meet Miocic at this past October's UFC Fight Night 76, but Miocic was forced to withdraw less than two weeks out with an injury.
With that in mind, you might think Rothwell is pulling for Miocic. But the 34-year-old slugger said he'd be just as happy to face Overeem again after “The Demolition Man” seemed to dismiss his September 2014 TKO loss to Rothwell.
“It doesn't matter because after the fight with Overeem, he still felt like this or that or he could beat me nine out of 10 times,” Rothwell said. “That just proves I didn't do my job, and I want to make sure that if I fight him (again), there won't be a third fight.
“Stipe is obviously a great challenge. He's proven it. He went in, and he had a lot of things stacked against him, taking on Werdum in Brazil, and he performed beautifully and has proved that right now, he's the man. He rightfully deserves his title, and it's up to the rest of us to prove that one of us deserve the title.”
Rothwell said all he wants is that opportunity, and he said he thinks a Sept. 10 win may very get it for him.
“This fight is that step that I needed to really take me to the place I want to be, and that's a No.1 contender and taking on for the title,” Rothwell said. “I know I can win this fight and win big.”

Last year, the US psychologists Clayton Critcher and Melissa Ferguson reported interesting research showing that fatigue from concealing sexual identity can actually hinder cognitive performance. This cost stacks upon others: complications in forming close relationships, concerns about inauthenticity, and damage to psychological and physical health in the longer term all suggest that concealment is not a great position to stay in. And yet “coming out” can also be challenging, and in some cases lead to no better or even worse life outcomes than before. Not all coming-out experiences are the same, as a new study shows.
William Ryan at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his team, recruited online 28 lesbian, 25 gay, and 55 bisexual people; overall the sample had slightly more women than men. Participants were asked to cast their mind back to up to four disclosure (coming out) experiences: to their mother, father, best friend, and the person they first disclosed to (in many cases also one of the first three).
For each disclosure partner, the participant rated how much 19 different descriptions applied to the way this person responded – some were negative (e.g. “be furious”), and others positive, (e.g. “thanked me for sharing”). Participants who experienced a higher frequency of negative reactions from a best friend or father reported significantly lower levels of present self-esteem, and negative reactions from disclosure partners of any kind were associated with current depressive symptoms.
These are associations between events often ten or more years ago and wellbeing in the present day, so you would be justified in wondering how this might be happening. Ryan's team hypothesised that each coming-out experience provides insight into whether the discloser will be able to act freely and authentically around that person, as we know such a sense of autonomy is critical for wellbeing.
To investigate this, participants were asked to evaluate the amount of autonomy in each relationship as it currently stands, via items like “When I am with my [best friend], I feel pressured to behave in certain ways.” If negative reactions produced or prophesied low autonomy, and low autonomy was the true culprit for today's low wellbeing, then the statistical relationship between past reactions and current wellbeing would be fully mediated by autonomy, and the data showed it was. But as always with cross-sectional research, it's possible to sketch other directions for causality's arrow: perhaps the negative aspects of past autobiographical events come to mind more strongly for those currently experiencing depressive symptoms.
That said, these postulated effects of past disclosure experiences on feelings of autonomy provide a plausible mechanism that provides the basis for more research (e.g. longitudinal). The results also revealed a further interesting possibility worth concluding on. Whereas the negative aspects of the disclosure were important for later wellbeing, the relative strength of any positive reactions – “See things through my eyes”; “accept my positive feelings” – didn't seem to matter. This might suggest that your most important job when reacting to a disclosure from someone close is to Do No Harm. Don't worry about a flawless response, just make it clear that your support for them isn't conditional on their sexuality.

I've been wracking my brain on how to say this. And not sound like a complete whiner. But it's not gonna happen. I'm about to whine like there hasn't been a whine before. Feel disclaimed. So here it is….parenting can be lonely. Staying home with little ones is one of the world's biggest blessings….I truly believe that….but it's also very isolating. It dare say…lonely. It's the kind of soul-baring loneliness that makes you feel insecure and unworthy and like a piece of total loser with a side of what has become of me. It's like being on a desert island full of kittens. Which is amazing for the first thirty minutes until you realize that you will become hungry at some point. This analogy is going nowhere fast so let's just move on.
(obligatory cute kid photo)
Let's just take a look at it mathematically. I like to say that everyone has a couple reservoirs of power….one is labeled “PERSONAL POWER” and that goes toward sustaining your personal self….eating, grooming, dressing, brain power, general interaction skills, memory, and anxiety maintenance. It's all the things that you need to be a functioning human in society. And the other reservoir can be labeled “OTHER”. That OTHER pool can be used toward EVERYTHING ELSE. Think of all the other things you may like to do or must do for your ideal way of life….travel, hobbies, socializing, organic grocery shopping, you name it – it comes from your OTHER power bank. Let's just say that on a good day, a kid from the age of 0-3 requires on average 60-80% of your OTHER power….it goes to monitoring safety, engaging them in activities, feeding, clothing, general cleanliness, diaper changes, and overall child rearing. Things that you liked to do before kids….well, you have about 40-20% of your power left in that OTHER battery pack to do those things. You CAN still do them…it's just not at full capacity as before….because you know…you still have a kid to take care of.
Sure…things change with time…kids require various amounts of overall time and energy…so things can vary. On a rough day, that kid can push well beyond the 80% and requires ALL of your OTHER power and then some. That power requirement needs to be supplemented. Where does the extra power come from? It comes from your Personal Power pool. It means that you may not change out of your yoga pants, or you eat canned peaches for dinner instead of your normal home cooked lasagna, or perhaps you forget to buy dog food. It's a void that needs filled. And you can do it. It just requires sacrifice.
So let's get back to the point of loneliness. With kids in the mix, it creates this weird two sided desire….this feeling of wanting to be completely alone and the wanting of being social. You spend increased amounts of time pouring into other people – specifically kids – and then not filling the need of being poured into. You feel guilty if you spend time away from the kids because 1. babysitters are danged expensive and 2. you think about the kids the entire time because you can't just flip a switch and turn off the need to be a spectacular parent and 3. you kind of forget how to be social….especially if your OTHER power bank has been depleted lately. Remember how your PERSONAL POWER picks up the slack? Well, that affects your interaction skills. So boom…you are there to be refilled and can't even sponge in all that social goodness because your body and brain has forgotten how.
Hence…being in a room full of people and feeling completely lonely.
And then there is the dilemma that I have….two kids under the age of 3. And one that is 4….which in my mind still requires about 30% of my energy. So here I am…requiring what I say is 150% of my OTHER power bank….my personal power is running at 50% and literally I have no idea what my parents phone number is, when two of the kids birthdays are, seven loads of laundry to do….and that's after washing, folding and pretreating it all weekend, I've completely forgotten my social security number, and my interactions with humans that use big words is limited to a 2 second conversation with the lady at the register. And I'm fairly certain that she asked me how I was doing and I said “yes, they are all boys.”
Then there are the friends that choose to still interact with you with the kids in tow. But three things can happen. One, someone falls asleep, behaves like a completely unrecognizable angel and you feel like that thirty-minute conversation energizes you to the point of flying to the moon. Two, the kids become the neediest needs of Needville and you can't hold any sentences together, interact at all and feel like the entire exercise of social interaction was a complete waste of energy. And Three, the friends help…which in turn makes you feel like a crappy parent and an even crappier friend. And yes, you do gamble for that chance of Mt Everest type highs….but remember…it still comes at a cost. Even the act of getting your crap together to interact with others requires power. You may do it for a full recharge…you may just be depleting an already energy deficient Personal Power bank. It's sometimes so worth it. And sometimes you just choose the loneliness because yes, washing your hair isn't in the cards this week.
Jeremy and I like to joke that once we hit four kids, it was just too much for friends. You can't go out to eat with people…it requires a booth AND a table. Food goes flying. Strangers tell your kids to be quiet which is basically the full moon to this Mama's werewolf transformation. YOU WANT TO TELL MY ONE YEAR OLD TO STOP THROWING?! HE IS ONE. ONE!!! AND IT's NOT HIS FAULT THE SERVER GAVE HIM A BOWL FULL OF COLORED SHRAPNEL! He doesn't even know what the word “crayon” means?! And then you bite someone's head off and leave them for dead. At least you do in your brain after you profusely apologize and publicly reprimand your child “No throwing baby. No throwing.” Stern look. Stink eye. Distraction.
So what happens? You stay home. You cling to the hope that one day, you will have four responsible and kind young men with strong backs and everyone will want to be your friend because you have the monopoly on yard care hands and moving help. You keep your head down and nose closed as you change the diapers, clean the blowouts, and try to get the sink at least 50% empty. You plan for the most exciting night of your week….shampoo night. And heck you might even go wild….conditioner. And you text your friends because that's what you got right now….three seconds of blissful peace, locked in the bathroom, to text Bitmojis that don't even look like you because the cartoon version of yourself looks so put together.
And you know what? It will be worth it. It will. I have told so many parents of this situation…and they, with their older children, tweens and teens and grown up kiddos….they all say the same thing. This too shall pass. You will forget this fog. You will be social. The energy…it gets depleted in other ways…but you will get your sanity back. Not your laundry room necessarily. But your time slowly creeps back in….hobbies can follow…and even shaved legs and home cooked dinners….but never your heart. Your heart you gave away to those kids and that is where it will stay. And one day, you will be lonely again….but it will be for them. For those kids that depleted you 200%. And you would do anything to have that back….greasy hair and all.
So I hope that if you are having a day….a rough, over 100% kinda day, you know that you aren't alone. Not really. There is at least one other mama out here wearing a tshirt with a mustard smear and serving a pop tart for lunch and feeling weirdly isolated even in a room full of people. We can all stick together in solidarity….knowing that we are doing the bigger thing right now….that it's sacrifice that is the greatest type of love. Much love mama. And a virtual playdate….where the kids are angels and you can climb Everest later.

In the least-surprising revelation since Brett Favre went back on his retirement promise (watch out for this year's edition soon!), the chat show host who earned the sympathy of a nation has let forth his views on his peers. And, well, it's exactly what you would expect.
Conan O'Brien told reporters that David Letterman called him over the holidays to make sure that there wasn't a rift between them due to the late-night war that erupted at NBC, even though it didn't directly involve the CBS legend. O'Brien said that he and Letterman have, “always been good. I said he didn't owe me a phone call, but I appreciated it.”
(See coverage of Conan in TIME's Person of the Year issue.)
As for the question on all our lips — how would you feel if Jay Leno extended you the same courtesy, Conan? — O'Brien confirmed that he wouldn't be so receptive to a call from the man who both preceded and replaced him as host of the famed Tonight show. “We all know the story,” he added, and indeed we do.
(See pictures of Jay Leno.)
Conan proceeded to say all the right things about his new employers, TBS (“There's nothing like walking away from the Tonight show that makes you appreciative of being on the air and having a TV show. I think that feeling is coming through”) but did confess to a lingering sadness at not being a part of NBC. He explained that the Monday after his final Tonight show, he asked his assistant to meet him and she responded, “Where?” The answer? A store that sells pies.
It's the kind of anecdote someone should do a late-night monologue about. Who could take on such a task? (via AP)
Jesus's police career has been resurrected.Jesus Martinez, whose firing last year launched a "#SaveJesus" campaign in Deep Ellum, won his final appeal on Wednesday."The city did the right thing. It just took almost a year to get there," said Richard Todd, the president of the Dallas Fraternal Order of Police.Todd said Martinez, 31, will get back pay.Chief David Brown, who fired Martinez, said in an email that he believes “in due process for officers and the right to appeal.”“We respect the decision of the civil service trial board,” the chief said.Brown had fired Martinez over a confrontation with an alleged panhandler named Joe Wesson in Deep Ellum. Martinez said the man took a swing at him after he tried to get him away from people leaving a memorial service in the Old East Dallas neighborhood.A passerby's cellphone video showed him on top of Wesson while pushing his arms backward over his head. Wesson can be heard crying out in pain.Martinez's supporters mostly acknowledged that the video wasn't pretty and didn't look great. But Martinez, whose uniform was torn, said he was blinded by pepper spray he used during the fight to subdue Wesson, who has a criminal history that includes an accusation that he punched an officer previously.Martinez was charged with official oppression, but was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by a grand jury. "He should've never been fired, and he absolutely should have never been arrested," Todd said. "Chief Brown put a hardworking officer, an innocent man, in jail."Martinez's firing sparked a show of support in Deep Ellum. Business owners and residents put up flyers bearing Martinez's image and captions such as "Jesus is my Homeboy." A cardboard cutout of a cop and a donut on Elm Street referenced him. A few City Council members, led by Adam Medrano, wore T-shirts. They held fundraisers for him around Christmastime. The Dallas Fraternal Order of Police and the Dallas Police Association, which Martinez isn't a member of, led a march of dozens of supporters to Dallas City City Hall.A few former officers had said they left the department this year in part because of Martinez's firing. Dallas Police Association President Ron Pinkston blasted the chief again Wednesday."This just highlights the abuse and mismanagement by the chief of police on the rank and file officers of the Dallas Police Department," Pinkston said. "Jesus was fired after incomplete investigation and after not interviewing all witnesses."Still, City Manager A.C. Gonzalez declined to reinstate Martinez after a May appeal hearing. A civil service review board appeal hearing, which started Tuesday, was Martinez's last shot.Todd, who blasted Gonzalez after his decision, said he breathed easier after the review board's decision Wednesday."I was really starting to think the system was broken," Todd said.But Wesson's attorney Daryl K. Washington said Wednesday that he believes the hearing wasn't impartial anyway because Wesson didn't testify. Washington said the appeal board is sending the wrong message."It's clear you have a situation where this guy was terminated for using excessive force," he said. "I can't quite see how the city can come back now and say he didn't use excessive force."But the Deep Ellum workers and residents said Wesson was unwelcome in the neighborhood. Martinez, meanwhile, was known as the protector in the area who checked in on people as he started his patrol shift and gave out his personal cellphone number if they needed anything.Todd said he hopes Martinez will be allowed to return to Deep Ellum.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is today out with a new investor note concerning the upcoming Galaxy S8 release. Kuo has made a name for himself as being one of the most reliable Apple analysts in the world, but today's report focuses entirely on Samsung and corroborates a variety of details about what we're expecting to see at the company's Galaxy S8 media event on March 29th.
Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor
Kuo, like others, predicts that there will be two size variants for the Galaxy S8, one model with a 5.8-inch display and 3000mAh battery and another with a 6.2-inch display and 3500mAh battery. Both are said to be OLED and feature WQHD+ resolutions of 2960×2400. The analyst predicts that the shipment split between the models will be 6:4.
Furthermore, Kuo says that variants sold in the U.S., Japan, and China markets will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, while models sold in Europe and the rest of Asia will sport Samsung's Exynos 8895 processor.
Moving on to RAM, Kuo says that models sold in most markets will feature 4GB of RAM, while those sold in Korea and China will sport 6GB because “users in those two markets are particularly sensitive to DRAM specs.
Kuo also offers up a handful of details regarding the design, which we've already seen numerous leaks of so far:
It's taken a month of endlessly regurgitated stories, three rejected bids, and a transfer request from the player, but Barcelona have finally accepted what Liverpool have been telling them all along: Philippe Coutinho isn't for sale. Not this summer, not at this late a stage in it, not with Liverpool unable to replace the player.
According to multiple reports out of Spain today, from Catalonia's RAC1, Sky reporter Guillem Balague, and others, with yesterday's 7PM deadline having passed, Barcelona have now moved on. For midfield, they will instead target Nice's Jean Seri, a player who has been tenuously linked with Liverpool in recent weeks.
And given how little, in real money terms, they were willing to offer for Coutinho, it's hard to understand what their intentions really were—because the reality is that Liverpool couldn't actually have accepted Barcelona's third and now, presumably, final bid even if they had been looking to sell Cotuinho this summer.
Despite the headlining figure of £114M (€125M) meant to impress fans and mislead pundits—who swiftly labelled Liverpool crazy, reckless, foolish, and any number of excitable adjectives for rejecting it—both the guaranteed money and the money that Liverpool would have received this summer was far, far less than that.
Only a little more than £80M of the bid was guaranteed, and that was set to be paid in five equal payments of around £16M. Only the first instalment would have arrived this summer. Liverpool's second Naby Keïta bid, by comparison, included a first instalment of €50M (£46M) and few significant add-ons in its €72M (£66M) total.
The add-ons that would take it from £80M to £114M then ranged from unlikely to nearly impossible to achieve. They included clauses based on Barcelona winning multiple Champions League titles, Coutinho winning the Ballon d'Or, and Coutinho winning the Ballon d'Or and Champions League in the same year.
In real money terms—taking inflation, interest, and the value of cash in hand for doing deals—there's a case to be made that Liverpool's second Keïta bid wasn't very far off Barcelona's third bid for Coutinho in real value. Given the timing, player, and that they just got €222M for Neymar, the Barcelona bid was downright insulting.
It was the kind of bid that Liverpool couldn't have accepted even if they actually had wanted to sell the player. It was an offer to start negotiations on, not to end them, and certainly there was nothing about the bid that would make Liverpool reconsider when Barcelona threatened to walk following the rejection of it.
With all that in mind, it's difficult to say what Barcelona's real purpose was. Could their board have been so misguided as to think Liverpool would or could actually accept such a derisory offer? Did they think Coutinho's agitation would be enough to force Liverpool to take such a bad deal—and this late in the window?
Or was it misdirection for their own fans, Coutinho and Liverpool used to get them to accept the purchase of a star like Seri rather than a superstar? And what now will happen to their pursuit of Ousmane Dembélé? It's certain Dortmund will not be bullied into taking a deal as bad as what Liverpool were offered, either.
For Liverpool, meanwhile, the focus now turns to trying to figure out how to reintegrate a player who embarked on a scorched earth policy in his attempts to force through a move—using his representatives to attack the manager and handing in a transfer request timed to do the most damage possible to their European hopes.
The most obvious answer to that might be found at Paris Saint-Germain, who held Marco Verrattii the same way Liverpool now appear to have held Coutinho. In his case, the player fired his agent and signed a new contract as a way to bring him back into the fold. Coutinho may now have to do the same.

In spite of Musi reservoir located in the constituency, negligence of people's representatives and officials in maintaining canals, supply channels and gates of the project has created water crisis.
Nakrekal Assembly constituency has Nakrekal, Kattangoor, Ketheypally, Ramannapeta, Narketpally and Chityala mandals. State government sanctioned Rs 3 crore and NABARD had sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the modernization of Musi canals two years back. But neither elected representatives nor the officials have shown any inclination to start the works or even call for the tenders.
Four years back, the foundation stone for Asif Nagar Canal and Darmareddy canal works at the cost of Rs 10 crore was laid, but works are yet to be to taken up. The Brahmana Vellemla project which was started in 2008 is yet to get completed. The project, once completed, will greatly help Kattangoor, Nakrekal and Ketheypally mandals in irrigation purposes.
Only a few villages of Kattangoor, Nakrekal and Narketpally mandals are receiving drinking water from Udaya Samudhram reservoir through canals. Government promised to supply drinking water to all villages in the constituency, but till date there has been no response.
Most of the villages are on the sides of National Highway 65. In many villages, service roads and foot-over bridges are needed. Though a highway is passing through the constituency, there are no industries. Unemployed youth have to go to Hyderabad to find jobs.
Groundwater table in the constituency is on the decline due to illegal sand mining in Chandhupatla, Madharam and other villages since last few years. Though complaints were lodged with officials concerned many times, no action was taken. A nexus among police, revenue officials and politicos is being blamed for lack of action against sand mafia. Experts say unchecked sand mining has to be stopped to ensure sufficient ground water resources in the region.

If You Want to Get Better, Focus on What Really Matters
Brad Stulberg Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 27, 2017
(Parts of this story are adapted from my new book, Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success. If you enjoy the post and want more, please consider reading the book.)
I've previously written that you simply cannot ‘hack' your way to long-term growth and performance. If any of the latest and greatest quick-fixes actually worked, there wouldn't be an ever-expanding market for them. No coffee bean will magically help you lose weight. No tea will improve your cognitive function. No (legal) supplement will dramatically improve your strength, power, and speed.
Put differently: Quick-fixes stop working quickly.
So, then, what does work? What are the evidence-based interventions that promote a high-performance lifestyle, reduce burnout, and support mental health?
Do Deep-Focus, Undistracted Work
Multi-tasking is an illusion. If anything, it ought to be called “half-tasking.” Research shows that when people multi-task, they are constantly switching their attention between tasks. Even though this occurs at the scale of milliseconds, it adds up. The American Psychological Association reports that when you multitask, though you think you're getting twice as much done, you're actually getting close to only half as much done!
Multi-tasking not only occurs at a conscious level (i.e., knowingly trying to do two things at once), but also at a subconscious one. Even if you aren't actively using/checking your smartphone or other digital devices, just having them in your pocket or visibly near you can sap your cognitive energy. That's because you end up exerting tons of energy resisting the urge to check them! All kinds of research have demonstrated that the mere presence of a smartphone detracts from your ability to produce high-quality work. This holds true in the office, the writer's studio, or the gym.
The main takeaways: 1) Don't multi-task — even if it feels productive, it's destructive. 2) Remove distractions. If you're unaccustomed to working in this manner, start with small chunks, even as little as 10 minutes, and gradually increase duration.
Take Breaks
Working in the above manner can be draining. For most tasks, studies show people can only sustain intense concentration and effort for 90 minutes. Much like interval training allows athletes to get the most quality work done in a given duration, so too does work in intervals allow the brain to maximize output. Science says the most productive way to work is in blocks of intense work (15–90 minutes) followed by brief breaks (5–30 minutes).
One of the best and most practical breaks is walking. For cerebral work, just a 5–15-minute walk has been shown to increase creativity. For physical work, a brief walk encourages one's heart-rate to come down while keeping blood flowing and the body limber.
Sleep
It's one of the most productive things you can do. Period. Aim for at least 7–8 hours. If you're an athlete who is training HARD, even 10 hours isn't too much. When we sleep, our bodies grow; our minds consolidate, store, and connect information; and our willpower is replenished.
I spend a lot of time discussing sleep in my book, and for good reason. Though it's one of the most important things we can do, the vast majority of people don't sleep enough. Some simply because they don't prioritize sleep and don't try (if this is you — start trying!) and others because they can't. If you fall into the second category, start with doing an inventory of your sleep hygiene and work to correct any gaps.
Spend Time in Nature
If you have access to greenspace, immerse yourself in it often. Unfortunately, most people aren't lucky enough to walk out their back door and onto forest trails. Rather, getting to the park or trailhead is a 30–45-minute drive. This can seem like a hassle, but it's so well worth it. We've never met someone who has regretted driving so that they could spend time in nature.
Nature is good for both our mental and physical health. It lowers blood pressure and the stress hormone cortisol, it can help thwart anxiety, depression, and burnout, and it increases creativity. Especially in a world where so many of us spend so much time starring into screens, nature is a restorative powerhouse. Make spending time in it a priority.
Surround Yourself Wisely
The people with whom you surround yourself have a profound influence on your life. In many ways, they shape it. Research shows that motivation is contagious. If you surround yourself with driven people who exude a positive affect, you'll performer better. What's more is that the opposite — negative affect — is especially powerful. A study we've written about before found that even amongst high-achievers, groups tend to be pulled down by the least motivated person more than they are pulled up by the most motivated person.
Live on Purpose
Having a strong and deeply-held purpose for what you do is a powerful performance enhancer. Find a meaningful “why” for your work and remind yourself of it often.
Fueled by purpose, you can push harder, better, and longer. A fascinating line of new research shows that when we focus on something beyond ourselves, we may be willing to endure more effort for a longer period of time. Additionally, the more we can minimize the importance of our ego, of our literal “self,” the less fearful we'll be. No longer in a guarded state trying to protect our literal “self” from failure, we are more likely to take constructive risks and venture beyond our perceived limits. In a paradoxical twist, thinking less about ourselves is one of the best ways to improve ourselves.
Exercise
I've covered this topic up the wazoo! So either just trust me that at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity is good for brain and body or read more here, here, and here.
Reflect on Your Mortality
Thinking (and reading) about death and dying has a profound way of increasing self-awareness and ensuring you are spending your days how you really want to be spending them. Reflecting on your own end can be quite uncomfortable, but it's influence on what you do while you're alive is too important to overlook.
If you found this valuable, please spread the message by recommending this post (the little heart) and consider reading the book, where all of these principles are explored in more detail.
To help make a new COSI Columbus exhibit as realistic as possible, Edgar Escobar recently rode an all-terrain vehicle through the mountains of West Virginia. During his ride, the Honda associate brought along six GoPro cameras. The result is a 360-degree film of his trip that plays out in front of visitors "riding" an ATV in "Meet The Innovators," an exhibit that opened last Sunday.
To help make a new COSI Columbus exhibit as realistic as possible, Edgar Escobar recently rode an all-terrain vehicle through the mountains of West Virginia.
During his ride, the Honda associate brought along six GoPro cameras.
The result is a 360-degree film of his trip that plays out in front of visitors �riding� an ATV in �Meet The Innovators,� an exhibit that opened last Sunday.
�We didn�t want it to be a computer-generated video,� said Escobar, a test engineer in the company�s powersports division. �I took it to where we do our real-world testing.�
Escobar�s escapade was typical of the effort that various Honda associates put into the exhibit, which is designed to expose young people to possible STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) careers.
Since 1982, Honda of America has been churning out automobiles and employing thousands at plants in Ohio, first in Marysville, then in East Liberty.
Last year, Frank Paluch, president of Honda Research & Development, joined the board at COSI. The idea for �Meet The Innovators� came out of conversations between Paluch and COSI president David Chesebrough.
�We�re trying to inspire the future generation of innovators,� Paluch said. �We want to show them that it�s not about just creating a product that people want to buy but about using technology to change and improve society.�
Teams of Honda associates worked on each of the five themes of the exhibit, which will be at COSI indefinitely. They are:
� Styling: By covering the process used to design vehicles, visitors can sketch their own designs.
� Power train: Cutaways of an engine and transmission help explain their function. Visitors can turn a crank on the engine and watch the pistons move.
� Aerodynamics: A miniature wind tunnel helps show how air moves over a vehicle. Fog helps visitors see that happen.
� Crash testing: A Honda Pilot is stripped of its body to show the layers of different types of steel used to ensure a rider�s safety. Adjacent to the vehicle sits a crash-test simulator that visitors can sit in and experience.
� Suspension: This is the area Escobar worked on, with the ATV and simulated ride.
�The Honda associates were so passionate about what they do, you could tell how invested they were in it (creating the exhibit),� said John Shaw, director of experience production at COSI.
The exhibit also features videos of the Honda associates discussing their careers. The idea, Paluch and Shaw both said, is to make these careers sound attractive to middle- and high-school students.
�There�s this mystery between education and what we actually do in our day-to-day experiences in our careers,� Paluch said. �With this experiential, hands-on exhibit, we should be able to bridge that gap.�

I would rip off someone's jaw to see Juan of the Dead right now. That's how cool this first trailer is for what Latino Review calls “Cuba's 1st Horror Film” is. Written and directed by Alejandro Bruges, Juan of the Dead takes place 50 years after the Cuban Revolution, where the island is overrun by zombies the government swears were sent by the United States. Social commentary aside, it's then up to one man to attempt to solve the problem. Part Shaun of the Dead (obviously) but with a grittier look more akin to something culty and cool like Six-String Samurai, you've gotta see this bad-ass trailer for Juan of the Dead.
Thanks to Latino Review for exclusively premiering this trailer. It looks insane.
And here's the poster for the film:
In the Latino Review story, Bruges describes the movie as follows:
It's a zombie film but it's about Cubans and how we react in the face of a crisis because we've had a lot of them here over the last 50 years. It is a social comedy, it has a bit of everything. It has horror, it has action and it pretty much laughs in the face of problems.
You certainly get the sense of the blend of humor, violence and social commentary in the trailer. Plus it seems like, on a relatively limited budget, Bruges was able to pull off some really impressive and innovative effects shots. I love the slingshot shot, the jaw ripping and the part where it seems like they're jumping on top of the zombie's heads. Plus, how sweet-looking is that car?
After watching that trailer, I'm dying to see this movie. Apparently, it's set to hit the festival circuit in the coming months. Fantastic Fest anyone?
Yet another passage from Sarah Palin's "Going Rogue" has been called into question. This time it's her account of the lawsuit against Exxon over the 1989 Valdez disaster. Alaskan experts who were involved in the case say that she's distorted her role.
"It took years for Alaska to achieve victory. As governor, I directed our attorney general to write an amicus brief in the case, and, thanks to Alaska's able attorneys arguing in front of the highest court in the land, in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the people," Palin wrote. "Finally, Alaskans could recover some of their losses."
In fact, as Palin herself acknowledged at the time, the decision was a disappointment.
The ruling reduced punitive damages for victims from $2.5 billion to $500 million. Environmentalists and plaintiffs' lawyers decried the ruling as a slap at the victims and Palin herself said she was "extremely disappointed."
Meanwhile, one of the lawyers involved says Palin played no part in the case.
"That is the most cockamamie bullshit," said Dave Oesting of Anchorage, the lead plaintiff attorney in the private litigants' civil case against Exxon. "She didn't have a damn thing to do with it, and she didn't know what it was about."
For more falsehoods from Palin's book, see our slideshow.
Global warming, drugs and corruption are among the oft-touted threats to society at large. But according to Thailand's Department of Mental Health, a more pressing danger is threatening the future “development of the country” — the selfie.
On Sunday, government psychiatrist Dr. Panpimol Wipulakorn warned that young Thais who post pictures of themselves on social media but don't receive enough positive feedback are encountering emotional problems, which in turn is creating a dearth of well-balanced citizens and could eventually spell trouble ahead for the Southeast Asian nation.
“If they feel they don't get enough Likes for their selfie as expected, they decide to post another, but still do not receive a good response,” she said in a statement, according to the Bangkok Post. “This could affect their thoughts. They can lose self-confidence and have a negative attitude toward themselves, such as feeling dissatisfied with themselves or their body.”
She added: “This could affect the development of the country in the future as the number of new-generation leaders will fall short. It will hinder the country's creativity and innovation.”

While you'd be hard-pressed to find a smartphone owner anywhere who hasn't indulged at some point, that Thais have a penchant for narcissistic camerawork is undeniable — even celebrated royals are selfie-obssessed, and recent antigovernment protests in Bangkok were inundated with hordes of selfie-snapping demonstrators.
“We call them Instagram protesters,” Pakkarat Phattanathanya, a producer with SpokeDark TV, tells TIME. “They turn up and take photos of themselves, but when we interview them they can't say what the protest is about.”
Pakkarat, 29, herself admits to probably posting two selfies in the past two weeks, but because she's “not a girlie girl” it's likely that many of her peers take more. “I don't think it's a problem, but some people may get depressed,” she says, adding that “obviously the more Likes, the better.”
Panpimol warns young Thais to guard against selfie addiction by placing themselves in situations where photos are socially taboo. “If you can pass that point,” she says, “next time you will be able to control your selfie-taking behavior.” And who knows? It could even save the country.

Cannon says in the letter that the pending charges will create too much of a distraction for the business of the city to go forward.
A city spokesman says Charlotte Mayor Patrick Cannon resigned effective immediately just hours after he was charged. Keith Richardson said Cannon submitted his letter Wednesday to the city manager and attorney.
He is also accused of accepting from the undercover agents over $48,000 in cash, airline tickets, a hotel room, and use of a luxury apartment between January 2013 and February 2014 in exchange for the use of his official position.
Tompkins says Cannon solicited and accepted bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as real estate developers who wanted to do business in Charlotte. According to the criminal complaint, Cannon is accused of accepting bribes from the agents on five separate occasions. On the most recent occasion, on February 21,2014, Cannon allegedly accepted $20,000 in cash in the mayor's office.
If convicted on all the charges, he faces 20 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines.
The 47-year-old Cannon, a longtime radio show host and the founder of E-Z parking, a parking management company, was elected mayor in November, replacing Anthony Foxx.
Telephone messages left for Cannon were not immediately returned.
The investigation began in August 2010, when Cannon still held an at-large seat on the Charlotte City Council. He was first elected to the council in 1993 at age 26, becoming the youngest council member in the city's history.
When he was 5, his father was found dead of a gunshot wound outside a vacant school. He was raised by his mother, Carmen, who worked on a truck assembly line. They lived in housing projects.
After graduating from South Mecklenburg High, he earned a degree in communications with a minor in marketing from historically black North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro.
"I am both saddened and angered because I have known Patrick and his family for over 30 years, but more than anything, my heart is broken for the city of Charlotte," said Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor. "This is not the city that I know, served and love. This alleged behavior is inexcusable and cannot be tolerated."
According to the complaint, Cannon was also accused of accepting $12,500 from an undercover agent to help him develop a feminine hygiene product called "Hers" to be marketed and sold in the United States. In exchange, Cannon offered to help the agent - posing as a business manager for a venture capital company - get the necessary permits to open a nightclub.
During the meeting, an undercover agent told Cannon: "You know, again whatever you can do to get our application moved up towards the top, uh, business license and things like that, that we need."
According to the complaint, Cannon responded: "Yeah, not a problem."
Cannon later had a discussion with the undercover agent, apparently attempting to clarify that the money was strictly seed money for the "Hers" product and not payment for his help in opening the nightclub.
"OK, so I mean, 'cause I'm not, I'm not one of those Chicago or Detroit type (of) folk," Cannon told the agent, apparently referring to high-profile corruption cases in those cities.
Cannon ended the conversation by saying he looked good "in an orange necktie, but not an orange suit," according to the complaint.
When the agent set up two later meetings to discuss the money and give Cannon an opportunity to return it, Cannon failed to show up, the complaint said.
During his campaign, Cannon promoted plans to create jobs in a city of 760,000 people that has become one of the nation's leading banking and energy centers.
Big banks helped drive Charlotte's explosive growth over the past two decades, but the city's financial institutions were hurt in the nation's banking meltdown. Since 2008, Charlotte has lost thousands of good-paying financial services jobs.
Two days after Cannon announced he was running for mayor in May 2013, the first undercover agent introduced him to a second undercover agent posing as a developer from Las Vegas. The second agent told Cannon he was interested in developments along a streetcar and light rail line being built in Charlotte. Cannon provided the proposed routes and stops, according to the complaint.
Cannon later agreed to fly to Las Vegas to convince a group of potential foreign investors to invest in the company purportedly owned by the second agent. Even though the two had known each other only about a month, Cannon agreed to tell the investors he had known the agent for years. The complaint said Cannon acknowledged the story he would tell investors was false, saying, "Well, if it's made up, it really doesn't matter."
Cannon and the second agent also discussed compensating Cannon for his part in the scheme, and Cannon suggested that he receive a campaign donation before he made the trip to Las Vegas.
Instead, the agent agreed to pay for Cannon's trip to Las Vegas, plus $6,000 cash for spending money for his wife. The Cannons received the first $1,000 when they arrived in Las Vegas; they received the other $5,000 after Cannon gave his presentation to the purported investors.

Wait a second. Is a National Review editor allowed to say this about Benghazi?
On the totality of the evidence we have so far, the White House took the intelligence community and diplomatic community's estimate, which was relatively uncertain, bereft of much detail, and turned out days later to be quite wrong, and played up certain parts of it to avoid questions about their counterterror strategy and the situation in Libya. That isn't being as straightforward with the American public as they could or probably should have been; it's also not a lie or a cover-up.
This is a response to Charles Krauthammer's bombastic insistence yesterday that newly released Benghazi emails had revealed “a classic cover-up of a cover-up.” But as Patrick Brennan says, they show no such thing.
You know, if conservatives had stuck to a reasonable line like this one in the first place, they could have caused President Obama a lot more damage. Did the White House “play up certain parts” of the Benghazi story in order to “avoid questions about their counterterror strategy”? I'd quibble over some of the details here, but that's fair enough. And there are certainly legitimate questions—although they cut a bipartisan swath—about how security was handled in Libya before the attacks.
Stick to that stuff and you have a story that resonates—and not in a good way for Obama. Take the Krauthammer route, and you get cheers from the Fox News faithful but not much else. That's why no one but a hard core of loons and fanatics cares about Benghazi anymore.
Good night, TechNet.
The online Technet blogs and customer support forums will live on, but Microsoft announced today in a letter to subscribers that it plans to retire its venerable TechNet subscriptions service. New subscriptions will no longer be available after August 31, 2013, and the subscription service will shut down as current subscribers' contracts end.
Microsoft has offered TechNet subscriptions for most of the modern Windows era, debuting in 1998 as a massive packet of CDs, and evolving into a download option as broadband connections became common.
The services have historically been one of the best deals around for frugal IT professionals and PC enthusiasts. For an annual subscription fee of a few hundred dollars, subscribers get the right to download virtually all of the desktop and server software Microsoft sells, with multiple product keys. The software is licensed for evaluation purposes only, but that restriction is part of the license agreement and not enforced in the software itself.
As a result, a lot of enthusiasts used TechNet as a way to get cut-rate Windows client and server upgrades and licenses. Those product keys would up activating Windows on PCs deployed for everyday use instead of hewing to the “evaluation only” restriction.
To make matters worse, that smoking deal was also a boon for software pirates, who figured out long ago that they could subscribe to TechNet and sell the keys (sometimes along with counterfeit media) via the web, at prices that were too good to be true.
Over the years, Microsoft has tried to clamp down on piracy, cutting the number of product keys available to TechNet subscribers in 2010 and again a year ago, in 2012. It also changed the terms so that usage rights expired when the subscription did (although product keys continued to work).
But as the farewell letter notes, “IT trends and business dynamics have evolved,” and TechNet has outlived its original purpose.
Given its history, today's announcement shouldn't be a surprise. Here are the details:
New subscriptions won't be accepted after August 31, 2013. Newly purchased subscriptions must be activated by September 30, 2013.
Current subscribers will still receive subscription benefits until their current contract ends. For most retail customers,subscribers are limited to a single year.
Existing subscriptions that expire on or before September 30, 2013 may be renewed for one year. Renewals may be purchased until August 31, 2013.
Subscribers with active Microsoft Certified Trainer accounts may continue to access their program benefits until March 31, 2014.
MVPs will continue to receive the option for a free Visual Studio Premium with MSDN subscription.
In practice, that means TechNet downloads will continue until sometime near the end of 2013, as those one-time renewals expire.
Microsoft has posted an FAQ here that also covers subscription benefits through Microsoft programs such as Not-For-Resale (NFR), Volume Licensing (VL), IT Academy (ITA), MAPS, Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)..
According to Microsoft, “The service is being retired so that Microsoft can focus on bettering our free experiences for IT professionals through TechNet including the TechNet Evaluation Center, Microsoft Virtual Academy and TechNet Forums.”
Those programs typically offer time-limited versions of software that function just like fully licensed versions until they hit an expiration date. For Windows 8, Microsoft offers a 90-day evaluation version of its Enterprise edition only. (Enterprise editions are available as volume licenses only, not at retail.) That's a far cry from what TechNet subscribers get today: three Windows 8 Pro product keys, each with multiple activations permitted, as well as a perpetual license for Windows 8 Enterprise.
Microsoft typically offers Windows Server for longer trial periods, such as the 180-day Windows Server 2012 Essentials trial.
Product keys downloaded as part of a TechNet subscription won't expire, although license rights for products downloaded as part of a current subscription will cease when the subscription ends.
Microsoft's developer-focused offering, MSDN Subscriptions, will continue to be offered. MSDN prices are significantly higher than those for TechNet. For IT professionals who genuinely need Windows client and server releases for long-term evaluation, the MSDN Operating Systems package is probably the best deal. It costs $699 for the first year, with renewals running $499. That's a steep jump from the $199 and $299 annual costs (renewals $149 and $249) for TechNet Standard and Professional, respectively.
The MSDN OS offering includes virtually all editions of Windows, even unsupported ones, as well as Windows Server 2012 and 2012 Essentials. Microsoft Office is included only with the two priciest levels, starting at more than $6119 for the first year and $2569 a year for renewals.
Microsoft did not announce any changes in its Action Pack program, which offers discounted software to registered partners.
Technet license changes through the years:
Once again-- as it's done every two years like clockwork since Pelosi gained control over the committee-- the DCCC has moved to protect Paul Ryan's reelection. A swingy southeast Wisconsin district that Obama won in 2008, 51-48%, WI-01 offers an obvious Democratic target-- one the DCCC habitually refuses to consider, even going so far as to sabotage local candidates and asking institutional Democratic donors to cut off their funding. WI-01 is not on the DCCC target lists this year, despite the fact that Paul Ryan is the single most disliked and mistrusted politician in America.

Currently I'm Leaning Right Into It
-by Randy Bryce
My name is Randy Bryce. I live in Caledonia, Wisconsin. (just north of city of Racine/south of Milwaukee) I'm quite sure everyone is aware of what has happened to Wisconsin the past few years. In addition to everything horrible that has been happening to us thanks to the extremists who have taken over the Republican Party on a state level, I have been doubly “blessed” to also reside within Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District-- a seat currently held by Paul Ryan.
I don't need to tell you that the man needs to go. I've been trying. I realize that throwing my “Union Thug” t-shirt over the corner of the television during the President's “state of the state” address only temporarily makes things a little better by not having to watch the definition of “smug.”
Fact is, Paul Ryan has been neglecting this district. It has been hundreds of days since he had a town hall event where “We, the People” could interact with him. Mr. Ryan has not just been bringing pain onto those of us in Wisconsin's 1st CD, but, is literally trying to bring pain and most certainly a higher mortality rate to everyone in the entire United States through his attempts at repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Thankfully, although the Republicans hold just about every majority to be held (aside from the majority of Americans having voted for Trump), their incompetence will not allow for them to cooperate.
My intent with writing this isn't to just slam Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. I want to repeal and replace him with someone who wants to be a part of Wisconsin's 1st CD.
A little bit about me:
I currently pay my bills with my day job of being a proud union ironworker. I've been a dues paying member of Iron Workers Local 8 for twenty years. I've been an elected officer of the executive board for the past eight years. I've been the only one to hold the (volunteer) position of political coordinator-- going on nine years. I've had the pleasure of literally building America. I've been under, in, and, on top of most of the infrastructure in southeastern Wisconsin. Not only do I notice daily what kind of condition our infrastructure is in, but, I know how to fix it.
In addition to being active within my local union, I was also elected for a term to sit on the Milwaukee Area Labor Council's executive board. I did not seek reelection this past term in order to concentrate my efforts more locally with the results of our 2016 general November election. I am secretary for the Racine County Labor Council. Our numbers are growing, and, we look forward to being involved with the community.
I'm a U.S. army veteran. I spent three years on active duty-- 1983-86. Most of that time was spent at Ft. Bragg, NC as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Rapid Deployment Force. I was deployed to Central America when things were “interesting” in that part of the world.
Upon being honorably discharged, I returned to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. One of my first jobs was helping homeless veterans. It's my opinion that the words “homeless” and “veteran” should never be used in the same sentence. We freed up resources that were only available to veterans so that other resources could be better allocated.
I'm currently Chair for the Veteran Caucus of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. I was also privileged to be part of another terrific group-- the Wisconsin Veterans Chamber of Commerce. I'm currently president of that organization. In our second year of operation, we have been able to put on a full time executive director. (He's the one who does all of the work.) We advocate for veteran-owned and veteran friendly businesses.
In addition to labor and veteran issues, I'm involved with local politics. I'm currently 1st vice chair for Racine County Dems. As part of the WisDems “Red to Blue”program that helps take the fight into gerrymandered districts, I was a “mentor” this past cycle. I have run previously for state assembly/senate in heavily gerrymandered areas.
Lastly, but far from the least on a personal level, I'm a dad. I have a ten year old son who lights up my world. He's been on more picket lines than 80% of my union brothers/sisters. He's a reminder of why I am involved.
I voted for Bernie in Wisconsin's primary. I had the honor of being asked to speak at his rally when he stopped in the area. For the general election I was asked to be an elector-- part of the electoral college-- to cast a vote for Hillary.
More recently I have been involved with Voces de la Frontera, an immigrants' rights group that is expanding from Milwaukee into Racine. They were able to put out over 30,000 people in Milwaukee streets for May Day.
Lately-- in a very surreal setting-- people, groups, mentors, electeds have been asking if I would think about running against Paul Ryan. A friend of mine, Rob Zerban ran against him in 2012-14. I know what will take place. Obama took the district in 2008.
My reply up until a few weeks ago had been “I'm not saying no at this point.”
Currently I'm leaning right into it.
I'm looking around at the special elections and how the rest of America got tired of being poked with a stick. We stopped licking those November election wounds, and, are on our feet. Locally, I see more grassroots groups springing up everywhere. Many are newer faces joining the rest of us that have been active since Walker's Act 10. It's great to see.
I am thankful for those who have already committed to help out. Too many of us here in Wisconsin are fully aware that Scott Walker's anti worker extreme agenda is now being taken to the national stage under Trump. In addition, now the Wisconsin GOP feel emboldened to get even more extreme with a friend in the White House. As this is written more laws are being passed whose only intent is to punish us for how we vote.
I see the upcoming election as the best chance that not only the 1st CD, but, the entire country can get rid of Paul Ryan. As an ironworker I know what hard work is. ironworkers have a saying-- “when I hear can't, it means you won't.”
I sincerely look forward to all of us getting to know each other a lot better.
UPDATE: Ryan's TrumpCare 3.0 "Healthcare" Bill
The vote is in a few hours. The Republicans claim they have the votes they need to pass it. But do they? Ryan's Chief Whip, Steve Scalise is notorious for being unable to count past 100. So they put Patrick McHenry in as a "backup." Problem with McHenry is that he's delusional and tells Scalise, McCarthy and Ryan what they want to hear. The Republicans who will decide whether or not the bill passes are the ones who have serious opponents. Republicans who the DCCC never challenge, know they have nothing to worry about in terms of accountability. The dozen key congressmen who are under pressure from their home districts and who are facing serious reelection problems are the ones who have held out and refused to say where they stand-- in the hope the whole thing will fall apart and they'll never have to take a definitive stand. The percentage next to their name represents how much of the vote Trump took in their districts.)

Waking Times
I'm talking about little defenders of consensus science, bloggers who love and adore every official pronouncement that comes down the pipeline from medical journals and illustrious doctors.
Dear Bloggers: Thousands of published studies you cite and praise are wrong, useless, irrelevant, deceptive—and the medical journals know it, and they're doing nothing useful about it.
The issue? Cell lines. These cells are crucial for lab research on the toxicity of medical drugs, and the production of proteins. Knowing exactly which cell lines are being studied is absolutely necessary.
And therein lies the gigantic problem.
has the bombshell story (July 21, 2016):
“Recent estimates suggest that between 20 percent and 36 percent of cell lines scientists use are contaminated or misidentified — passing off as human tissue cells that in fact come from pigs, rats, or mice, or in which the desired human cell is tainted with unknown others. But despite knowing about the issue for at least 35 years, the vast majority of journals have yet to put any kind of disclaimer on the thousands of studies affected.” “One cell line involved are the so-called HeLa cells. These cancerous cervical cells — named for Henrietta Lacks, from whom they were first cultured in the early 1950s — are ubiquitous in labs, proliferate wildly — and, it turns out, contaminate all manner of cells with which they come into contact. Two other lines in particular, HEp-2 and INT 407, are now known to have been contaminated with HeLa cells, meaning scientists who thought they were working on HEp-2 and INT 407 were in fact likely experimenting on HeLa cells.” “Christopher Korch, a geneticist at the University of Colorado, has studied the issue. According to Korch, nearly 5,800 articles in 1,182 journals may have confused HeLa for HEp-2; another 1,336 articles in 271 journals may have mixed up HeLa with INT 407. Together, the 7,000-plus papers have been cited roughly 214,000 times, Science reported last year.” “And that's just two cell lines. All told, more than 400 cell lines either lack evidence of origin or have become cross-contaminated with human or other animal cells at some point in their laboratory lineage. Cell lines are often chosen for their ability to reproduce and be bred for long periods of time, so they're hardy buggers that can move around a lab if they end up on a researcher's gloves, for example. ‘It's astonishingly easy for cell lines to become contaminated,' wrote Amanda Capes-Davis, chair of the International Cell Line Authentication Committee, in a guest post for Retraction Watch. ‘When cells are first placed into culture, they usually pass through a period of time when there is little or no growth, before a cell line emerges. A single cell introduced from elsewhere during that time can outgrow the original culture without anyone being aware of the change in identity'.”
Getting the picture?
HUGE numbers of published studies are based on knowing which cells are being used and tested. And much of the time, the researchers don't know. They pretend they do, but they don't.
Their work is completely unreliable.
Everyone involved (for decades) looks the other way.
It's the secret no one wants to talk about.
Thousands and thousands and thousands of medical studies are useless, and their conclusions are unfounded, and turn out to be random.
This is like saying, “Well, we built all those buildings in the city, but the concrete we used was probably cardboard. Let's not talk about it. Let's just wait and see what happens.”
Millions of patients who are taking drugs are guinea pigs. Researchers originally tested the toxicity of drugs on cells they assumed were relevant, but they were wrong. They said the drugs were safe, but they were working with cells that had no bearing on safety.
This is one reason why, on July 26, 2000, Dr. Barbara Starfield, a highly respected public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, could conclude, in the Journal of the American Association, that FDA approved medical drugs kill 106,000 Americans every year—which becomes a MILLION deaths per decade.
The original researchers on those drugs pretended they knew what they were doing.
Pretended.
Everything I'm describing and citing in this article?
The FDA knows about it.
The CDC knows about it.
The World Health Organization knows.
National health departments all over the world know.
Medical schools know.
Many doctors know.
Many, many researchers know.
Many hospital executives know.
All pharmaceutical executives know.
Many mainstream medical reporters know.
All medical journals know.
But they continue to promote life-destroying fake news.
Blog that.

For a single adult in 2009, the poverty line was $10,830 in pretax cash income; for a family of four, $22,050.
Given the depth of the recession, some economists had expected an even larger jump in the poor.
“A lot of people would have been worse off if they didn't have someone to move in with,” said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin .
Dr. Smeeding said that in a typical case, a struggling family, like a mother and children who would be in poverty on their own, stays with more prosperous parents or other relatives.
The Census study found an 11.6 percent increase in the number of such multifamily households over the last two years. Included in that number was James Davis, 22, of Chicago , who lost his job as a package handler for FedEx in February 2009. As he ran out of money, he and his 2-year-old daughter moved in with his mother about a year ago, avoiding destitution while he searched for work.
“I couldn't afford rent,” he said.
Danise Sanders, 31, and her three children have been sleeping in the living room of her mother and sister's one-bedroom apartment in San Pablo, Calif., for the last month, with no end in sight. They doubled up after the bank foreclosed on her landlord, forcing her to move.
“It's getting harder,” said Ms. Sanders, who makes a low income as a mail clerk. “We're all pitching in for rent and bills.”
There are strong signs that the high poverty numbers have continued into 2010 and are probably still rising, some experts said, as the recovery sputters and unemployment remains near 10 percent.

“Historically, it takes time for poverty to recover after unemployment starts to go down,” said LaDonna Pavetti, a welfare expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group in Washington.
Dr. Smeeding said it seemed almost certain that poverty would further rise this year. He noted that the increase in unemployment and poverty had been concentrated among young adults without college educations and their children, and that these people remained at the end of the line in their search for work.
One indirect sign of continuing hardship is the rise in food stamp recipients, who now include nearly one in seven adults and an even greater share of the nation's children. While other factors as well as declining incomes have driven the rise, by mid-2010 the number of recipients had reached 41.3 million, compared with 39 million at the beginning of the year.

Food banks , too, report swelling demand.
“We're seeing younger people coming in that not only don't have any food, but nowhere to stay,” said Marla Goodwin, director of Jeremiah's Food Pantry in East St. Louis, Ill. The pantry was open one day a month when it opened in 2008 but expanded this year to five days a month.
And Texas food banks said they distributed 14 percent more food in the second quarter of 2010 than in the same period last year.
The Census report showed increases in poverty for whites, blacks and Hispanic Americans, with historic disparities continuing. The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was 9.4 percent, for blacks 25.8 percent and for Hispanics 25.3 percent. The rate for Asians was unchanged at 12.5 percent.
The median income of all households stayed roughly the same from 2008 to 2009. It had fallen sharply the year before, as the recession gained steam and remains well below the levels of the late 1990s — a sign of the stagnating prospects for the middle class.
The decline in incomes in 2008 had been greater than expected, and when the two recession years are considered together, the decline since 2007 was 4.2 percent, said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard. Gains achieved earlier in the decade were wiped out, and median family incomes in 2009 were 5 percent lower than in 1999.
“This is the first time in memory that an entire decade has produced essentially no economic growth for the typical American household,” Mr. Katz said.

The number of United States residents without health insurance climbed to 51 million in 2009, from 46 million in 2008, the Census said. Their ranks are expected to shrink in coming years as the health care overhaul adopted by Congress in March begins to take effect.
Government benefits like food stamps and tax credits, which can provide hundreds or even thousands of dollars in extra income, are not included in calculating whether a family's income falls above or below the poverty line.
But rises in the cost of housing, medical care or energy and the large regional differences in the cost of living are not taken into account either.
If food-stamp benefits and low-income tax credits were included as income, close to 8 million of those labeled as poor in the report would instead be just above the poverty line, the Census report estimated. At the same time, a person who starts a job and receives the earned income tax credit could have new work-related expenses like transportation and child care. Unemployment benefits, which are considered cash income and included in the calculations, helped keep 3 million families above the line last year, the report said, with temporary extensions and higher payments helping all the more.
The poverty line is a flawed measure, experts agree, but it remains the best consistent long-term gauge of need available, and its ups and downs reflect genuine trends.
The federal government will issue an alternate calculation next year that will include important noncash and after-tax income and also account for regional differences in the cost of living.
Indulging a creative and, to a degree, noble and socially responsible desire to shatter the nurtured illusion of violence in the westerns as idealized, innocent cowboys-versus-Indians gunfighting, Sam Peckinpah decided to take the subject in his own hands and show the world a piece of stylistically enhanced truth about what it meant to be an outlaw in the bloodthirsty days of the old West. Peckinpah's idea of The Wild Bunch was to put the audience right in the middle of the brutality, bathe the viewers in blood and gore, terrify them and make a statement on the hunger for violence that hides somewhere deeply ingrained in human nature. Written by Walon Green and the director himself, developed from a story designed by Green and Roy N. Sickner, and starring the great William Holden, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan at their all-time best, The Wild Bunch is a groundbreaking masterpiece of revolutionary historic value. The film's inspiringly creative editing conducted by Peckinpah and talented youngster Lou Lombardo influenced the next generation of filmmakers, while the original use of cameras with different frames per second, with their footage later cut together like nothing the world had seen before, gave some crucial scenes the feeling of elasticity of time. Throughout the film Peckinpah weaves an underlying idea of the western era coming to an end, just like John Ford masterfully did in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and he does it so efficiently that you get the feeling in your gut that what you have before you is the final relevant chapter in the history of the genre, the acutely disturbing and surprisingly honest closing lines of a story that gave us so many pleasures over the years.
We wanted to show violence in real terms. Dying is not fun and games. Movies make it look so detached. With The Wild Bunch, people get involved whether they like it or not. They do not have the mild reactions to it. —Sam Peckinpah
A monumentally important screenplay. Dear every screenwriter/filmmaker, read Walon Green & Sam Peckinpah's screenplay for The Wild Bunch [PDF]. (NOTE: For educational and research purposes only). The DVD/Blu-ray of the film is available at Amazon and other online retailers. Absolutely our highest recommendation.
Stephen Prince wrote in 1999, ‘The Wild Bunch is an epic work, and it has had an epic impact on American cinema' and noted Martin Scorsese's description of the film as ‘savage poetry.' Paul Seydor has described the film as ‘one of the great masterpieces of world cinema,' and then further notes that ‘any discussion of The Wild Bunch implicitly acknowledges the editing by Lou Lombardo and Robert Wolfe, so integral is it to the style, meaning, and effect of the film. Still, one should at least observe that the art and craft of film editing know no higher peaks than The Wild Bunch, and very, very few that are anywhere near its summit.' Here's in-depth script analysis by Paul Seydor. Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (Cambridge Film Handbooks) is available from Amazon.
The making of the final shootout, an extract from The Wild Bunch: An Album In Montage, a documentary of the making of the film by Paul Seydor and Nick Redman. The occasion for the creation of this documentary was the discovery of 72 minutes of silent black-and-white 16 mm film footage of Sam Peckinpah and company on location in northern Mexico during the filming of The Wild Bunch.
Todd McCarthy described it as, ‘a unique and thoroughly unexpected document about the making of one of modern cinema's key works, this short docu will be a source of fascination to film buffs in general and Sam Peckinpah fanatics in particular.' Michael Sragow wrote that the film is ‘a wonderful introduction to Peckinpah's radically detailed historical film about American outlaws in revolutionary Mexico—a masterpiece that's part bullet-driven ballet, part requiem for Old West friendship and part existential explosion. Seydor's movie is also a poetic flight on the myriad possibilities of movie directing.'

Neon Magazine's Flashback 1969: The Wild Bunch.
“I only have questions,” Sam Peckinpah tells Barry Norman in this seldom seen interview from December 1976. “As a filmmaker I must look at both sides of the coin, and do my best as a storyteller. I have no absolutes. I have no value judgments,” Peckinpah goes on to say, before asking, “Why does violence have such a point of intoxication with people? Why do people structure their day on killing?” This is an incredibly honest and brilliant interview with Peckinpah, who doesn't flinch from any of Norman's questions—discussing his ignorance, his mistakes—explaining why he was wrong in thinking it could work as catharsis in The Wild Bunch, and why he was “a good whore.” —Paul Gallagher
A rare behind the scenes look at legendary filmmaker Sam Peckinpah on the set of The Wild Bunch, 1969. Fascinating to see Peckinpah at work making this landmark film surrounded with a crew that all seem to be following him in not only direction but also in wearing cowboy hats and sunglasses.

I've counted my plots before they hatched, I've duked it out with my brothers and sons, and I've lorded over an entire continent. Now, having lost more than I've gained and suffered more than I've succeeded, I'm finally ready to share Wot I Think about the majestic Crusader Kings II.
Did the word majestic give it away, or did my previous bursts of excitement already give you an inkling of how I feel about the strategic role-playing grandeur of Paradox' latest?
It's more than a bit good at what it does so rather than immediately talking about how much I've fallen for its brutish charms, I'm going to try and summarise exactly what that is first. What does Crusader Kings II set out to do?
The most important difference between this game and the vast majority of grand strategy titles is that it's all about characters. There are thousands of the blighters populating the world at any one time, with skills, traits, personalities, jobs and relationships. You are one of them. You're not a country or a culture, you're a bloke, or less frequently a blokess, with a family, some friends and a huge gallery of foes. When you die, you'll take control of your heir following the lines of succession in your locality.
There are big players, like kings, the Pope and his antis, and the occasional emperor, but mostly there are courtiers, waiting to be plucked from relative obscurity, landed with position and maybe even some land, and then cut back down to size when they start bulging out of their boots. There are children to marry off for political gain and there are children to quietly dispense with because do you really want your entire dynasty to be in the hands of Reginald whose jousting ineptitude has left him with a few splinters of lance in the amygdala and a severe case of being an absolute moron?
No you don't because he'd need someone else to do the job of running your disintegrating duchy for him and the brains behind his brains are likely to be your spymaster, who has been a little too chummy with that cousin you never liked who has a claim on your most fertile parts, all based on an ill-advised, lust-fuelled marriage that your grandfather made forty years ago. Best, then, to make sure Reginald dies before you do or you'll have to change the laws of succession and that's going to piss off a whole other group of people, weaken your stability and bring the walls crashing down around your ears.
Does it sound like a soap opera? A particularly violent soap opera, laced with infanticide, religious warfare and sexually transmitted unpleasantries? Maybe the religious warfare and disease weren't clear in the above example but believe me, somebody in the story has almost definitely contracted a case of genitirritation and most of them have definitely killed people for not reading the same books as them.
It sounds like a soap opera because it's a bit like one. It's also a historical epic, a bloody tale of intrigue and even a sort of sit-com. In fact, when you find yourself playing a four year old count caught up in the collapse of the Kingdom of Wales, ordered to defend your lands against the suddenly and, to your childish understanding, inexplicably pissed off Bishop of Rome, it's hard not to laugh. If you'd been an adult and a master theologian you'd understand that your king had decided to believe that the three in one is actually the one made three and therefore everybody had to kill everybody else and mutilate their corpses so badly that they wouldn't be allowed into Heaven, which runs a no trainers, all innards policy.
One of the reasons that Crusader Kings II is brilliant is because it understands that losing is fun. In fact, I don't think winning is as much fun. Better the slow and noble decline than the bloat of victory and expansion. I'm sure it's possible to learn exactly how the game works and be better than it but there's so much happening with every minute that passes (the game is real time but can be paused) that I can't be bothered to understand half of it and I certainly don't want to decipher it because I'm not viewing the world as a machine but as a collection of minds.
When gluttonous, heavingly overweight Count Peter, well into his sixties, was given the choice of turning his mind to God in his dotage, he said “sod that and pass the boar's cheeks”. A bit of piety might have been good for him and the prestige would certainly have cheered up his soon-to-inherit son, but you should have seen the size of the man. He was gargantuan, like a medieval Jabba with sixteen bastard children off fighting the battles he was too corpulent to partake in. I could have snaffled up the good stats but I'd never have forgiven myself; Peter was snaffling nothing but a county's worth of wild animals with a side of eggs.
There are times when I've been a man of influence, particularly when starting on these British isles, where I always find myself more in control. It's not because I know the lay of the land or believe that roleplaying an Englishman requires a striving for excellence, it's because it's a lot harder to be surrounded by murderous landgrabbers when you're on an island.
In fact, I'd suggest that anyone start out who is afraid of being bewildered by the amount of things happening around them gives Scotland or Ireland a shot. They're both good starting points and you can go through a couple of generations struggling over control of that little corner of Europe before you even glance across and realise that –
Oh my sweet pajamas, what in the name of God has happened to the continent? Judging by the number of Muslims in Spain whatever happened was definitely in the name of God, although it may not have been the Scotch one. And is France really supposed to be that big? And why is Italy entirely comprised of men hitting each other in the kidneys with swords?
My absolute most favourite thing about Crusader Kings II is that the world will happily continue without me. Maybe if I play my kids right I'll be the centre of attention for a couple of years over the centuries covered, but most of the time this is one of the games that suffers least from Truman Show syndrome that I've ever played. In that respect, Crusader Kings II is up there with Football Manager and Dwarf Fortress. It's a strategy game, it's an RPG but it's also a simulator. Yes, it's not a historically accurate simulator, with plenty of alterations to reality made for balance and to sustain dynastic evolution, but it is a remarkable study of alternatives, a playground of ‘might have beens'.
My most memorable game to date didn't involve forging a mighty kingdom. I was playing a count on the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary. I was, by necessity, mostly passive. That's when speeding the game up comes in useful. At its fastest rate, the years tick by fairly quickly, with automatic pauses when decisions need to be made. My king would occasionally call me into service, usually when he himself had been called into service, and my armies would dutifully chop their way through infidels or vulnerable neighbours. Other than that, I made marriages for my children, attempting to make something out of them so that when I passed on I wouldn't have a total incompetent in charge of my tiny realm.
It was sometime around 1100 that everything went wrong. The young king called up all his levies and took us off adventuring into the east. As soon as the troops had marched out of earshot, the dastardly duke of Transylvania, one of the king's vassals and possibly a vampire, began to assault all of Hungary with armies of his own. He declared independence and chipped away at the lands surrounding him, and Hungary, for the first time since 1066, was fractured.
But then, but then. An exchange of the mighty cash reserves I had built up in my passivity allowed me to hire mercenaries, raise my personal levy and march on Transylvania. I, the forgotten and the subservient, made Hungary intact once more.
I'd like to say the story ends with me being granted titles and bounty on the king's return but that's not what happened. I faded back into obscurity even as the borders of Hungary eventually expanded. There have been times when I've received thanks for noble deeds and times when I've received greater thanks for committing atrocities, but mostly Crusader Kings II doesn't pander to the player.
And that is precisely why it isn't an impenetrable mess of a game to the uninitiated. The game is not overwhelming, not in any way whatsoever, because it lets you get on with things, never forcing you to balance imponderable digits against one another. There is a great deal of information but you don't ever need it all, and it's only when at war or engaged in particularly complex plots that you'll need to repeatedly pause the game to make sure your strategy isn't failing spectacularly.
Most of the time, things will continue to happen and it's very hard to find yourself in a dead end that isn't logical and based around the readily understandable actions of people. This isn't Victoria or Europa Universalis where having a slider in the wrong position can lead to severe punishment; Crusader Kings II is about people and what makes them tick.
The interface is simple as well, even though it may look daunting. You'll only ever have to click the right button to interact with people and move armies, and the left button to bring up information, whether cycling through map overlays or selecting tabs. And there may seem to be a lot of them, but don't be daunted. Ignore what you don't understand until the need arises to understand it. Context may help when an event occurs, or you can dip into the dry but useful tutorials.
If you're not terrified of maps then you can play and enjoy Crusader Kings II. It's that simple. Do you like pondering alternate histories and creating grand narratives? That's what this game is about. Do you enjoy courtly interplay and elaborate plots of succession, marriage and murder? That's also what this game is about.
Heck, do you like A Game of Thrones? This is the best Game of Thrones game you will probably ever play, unless you really need the fantasy element and if you do, then for God's sake just pretend that pagans are riding wolves and French people have six eyes or whatever it is you need to do, but play this game. There's incest and intrigue aplenty and isn't that what GRRARGH Martin is really all about?
There have been so many strategy games in recent years that have made me wish I was playing Crusader Kings instead and when Sengoku was among them, I was worried. It seemed like a poor foundation on which to build a sequel to one of my favourite games, lacking the complexity of interaction that I craved.
I needn't have worried. Crusader Kings II is everything I wanted from a sequel and it's a sequel that I hadn't expected to ever see. The interface is improved, it's visually far more attractive and the simulation model seems to create more interesting alternate realities. It's also (for me and by most reports) almost completely stable and although I can imagine what will be added in the expected (and I've got to admit, hoped for) expansions, there are no features missing that I expected to be included. I haven't even dabbled in multiplayer yet, which is also a thing that exists.
The biggest complaint appears to be the inability to play as Pagans or Muslims. It's easily fixed with mods and I for one am glad those characters haven't been crudely forced into the hereditary models followed by the dynasties of Christendom. If they are playable in the future, I hope the experience is quite drastically different, otherwise the brilliant emphasis on culture and people that is the game's core would be compromised.
Now, what did they get wrong? Levies seem to replenish a little bit too fast.
There's so much I haven't written about but my initial draft was the typed equivalent of a man waving his arms and making incoherent sounds of delight and excitement. It's such a huge game that people will find different ways of enjoying it and, of course, some people won't find anything to love at all. Those people are dead inside. Anyone interested in emergent gameplay, dynamic narrative and the humanising of strategy would do well to spend a few days in the company of Crusader Kings II.
For me, the genius of Paradox' best grand strategy titles has always been that they don't tell you what to do or how to win. Instead, they give you the tools to find your own way through history and let you live with the consequences. When the consequences are so human they mean all the much more and this is probably the most human strategy game I've ever played. If it doesn't wind up being among my very favourite games of the year, spectacular things will occur in the next ten months.

Taipei (AFP) - Taiwan held the island's first ever commemoration in parliament Friday of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as lawmakers urged the new government to address human rights issues in its dealing with China.
It comes weeks after China-sceptic Tsai Ing-wen was sworn in as president, succeeding Ma Ying-jeou who oversaw an unprecedented eight-year rapprochement with Beijing.
Ties have rapidly cooled since Tsai won the presidency in January, with Beijing highly distrustful of her traditionally independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
In the past, Taiwan's government has repeatedly urged China to learn lessons from the Tiananmen crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, in which more than 1,000 were killed according to some estimates.
But parliamentarians have never before gathered to voice their views.
A day ahead of the June 4 anniversary, senior lawmakers from the DPP and the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) were joined by human rights activists and exiled Chinese dissident Wu'er Kaixi as they observed a minute's silence.
They also signed a motion proposed by DPP lawmaker Yu Mei-nu to demand the government "express Taiwan's serious concerns over redressing the June 4 incident at the appropriate time" in future interactions between the two sides.
"Taiwan and China have very close ties, so the suppression of human rights that happened to Chinese citizens could also threaten human rights in Taiwan," Yu said.
KMT lawmaker Chen Shei-saint broke partisan ranks to voice his support, saying democratisation in China was "the biggest assurance for Taiwan's security."
Taiwan is self-ruling after splitting with China in 1949 following a civil war, but Beijing still sees it as part of its territory to be reunified.
Since Tsai took power Beijing has been pushing her to adhere to its "one China" concept.
Taiwan was left furious after its citizens were deported from Kenya and Malaysia to the mainland as part of fraud investigations, a move seen as a pressure tactic on Tsai.
For its part, the DPP this week dropped what were criticised as "China-centric" changes to the high school curriculum that triggered major protests last year while the KMT were still in power.
The repealing of the curriculum changes was criticised by Beijing, which warned Taiwan it would "shoulder the consequences for repeating the history of provoking tension and instability".
Activists urged parliament to hold the Tiananmen commemoration every year.
"Please send a message to China's authoritarian government that... you are standing beside pro-democracy campaigners and that you are different from the Chinese government," said Wu'er, a prominent student leader in 1989 now living in exile in Taiwan.
Also speaking in parliament, Yang Sen-hong, chairman of Taiwan Association for China Human Rights, said Taiwan should "bravely tell (China) to stop the terror and end the disaster, otherwise Taiwan will suffer too".
In August, a "Key & Peele" sketch proposed why OutKast haven't made a record since 2006's Idlewild: because André 3000 is just too weird. When Pitchfork hopped on the phone with OutKast's Big Boi to discuss his Big Grams collaboration with Phantogram, we asked him if he'd seen the sketch.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," he said. "I sent it to Dre, that shit was funny as hell. It was funny as hell ‘cause it was way off, but it was funny as hell."
He continued:
If anybody's been following me on social media—if we're not doing music then people think we're not together—but we've been really hanging out with our kids this summer; we've been going paintballing, we've been going to golfing, we've been hanging out every week. We had a real good summer. It's been a real relaxing summer for the both of us but you know, we've really just been enjoying the brotherhood aside from the music. Since we've been doing that all our life, we're just getting back to the friendship, you know?

It seemed as if Espanyol had eased off in their search for new defender, but that couldn't be further from the truth.
Lluis Miguelsanz
The Barcelona-based club have made big strides this week in a move for Tottenham centre-back Federico Fazio.
Talks with the player are at an advanced stage and it seems the transfer could be completed soon, with the English club keen to move the Argentine on.
The player has given his OK to the Pericos regarding a four-year deal and they must now reach an agreement with Spurs.
Espanyol president Chen Yansheng was in London this week, accompanied by CEO Ramon Robert, to talk about the deal.
Fazio is the club's primary target in defence and the club are keen to tie the deal up as soon as possible.
Tottenham paid 10 million euros for him two summers ago, but he's failed to adapt to English football and spent last season back on loan at Sevilla.
Espanyol's second option was Diego Llorente, who was offered to them by Real Madrid, but the young defender has now moved on loan to Malaga.
Fear of rejection is a powerful motivator—or more accurately, anti-motivator. The sting of rejection is sharp (in fact, it actually causes something more like physical pain), probably because most of us consider rejection humiliating. If fear of rejection holds too powerful an influence over your choices, Rejection Therapy may be up your alley.
The free game has one rule: You must be rejected by another person at least once, every single day.

It's a simple but clever idea designed to help you build confidence and overcome your fear of rejection:
You can think of it as game, but this game involves your life and the treasures are real. The five objectives of Rejection Therapy are: 1. To be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives 2. Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence) 3. Learn from, and even enjoy rejection 4. To not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people 5. Permit yourself to fail
The game doesn't require anything to play, but if you'd prefer some help, the game's creator, Jason Comely, sells playing cards for $16 (or printable cards for $10). There's also an iPhone app and an Android app.

How To Get Elected Officials To Actually Hear Our Worries About Censorship: Speak Up!
from the speak-up dept
I already mentioned Rep. Lofgren's talk at the Section 230 Symposium from the High Tech Law Institute at the University of Santa Clara on Friday, but wanted to do a separate post on another point that Lofgren raised. EFF's Cindy Cohn asked Lofgren a simple question towards the end of Lofgren's talk, questioning what we in Silicon Valley could actually do so that folks in Washington DC actually understand these issues.Lofgren, at first, seemed unsure thatcould be done, noting that those with lots of money and hired lobbyists in DC still get heard much more than the ordinary citizen, but after talking for a bit, she did make a point clear, and it was:. She pointed out that in this day, a congressional rep hearing from 200 constituents (she suggests physical letters) is something that gets attention, and gets Representatives to pay attentionI know that many around here are cynical about the political process -- and I'd include myself in that description. We've seen way too many ridiculously bad laws passed by Congress to protect this or that special interest. Our government too often seems to take direction (if not dictation) directly from corporate interests. However, Lofgren does have a point: people really do need to speak up when they hear of serious problems such as domain seizures, copyright expansion and other problems.The domain seizures, in particular seem to have received very little attention in the press. I spoke to a reporter at the event who said that his editor just didn't think it was a topic anyone cared about. That's scary. We're talking about wholesale censorship by the US government -- almost certainly in violation of basic free speech and due process rules. And it's all being done by a group within the US government who's supposed to be "protecting our borders." It seems reasonable to question why this group is involved in straight up censorship of websites. But it's not going to happen if people don't speak up.

First there were buttons. Now there's a campaign committee.
Paperwork was filed with state elections officials Wednesday to create "GMFM — Garry McCarthy for Mayor Exploratory Committee."
The purpose of the committee? "To explore the prospect of the candidacy of Garry McCarthy for Mayor of Chicago," according to the form filed with the Illinois State Board of Elections.
The filing lists a web address of garryformayor.com, which is the same address listed on gold and green "GMFM" buttons that were circulating this summer. That website brings up a page that says the "domain name has just been registered" but no information on a possible campaign.
Attempts to reach McCarthy were unsuccessful Thursday. In July, McCarthy said he wasn't sure who was distributing the buttons. He told the Tribune a run for mayor was "probably unlikely."
"There's a group of people who are very serious about this, and they are looking at all the angles," McCarthy said. "I haven't said 'no' yet. Let's put it that way."
Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired McCarthy as the city's top cop in December 2015 amid the fallout of a judge ordering the mayor to release a video of the Laquan McDonald police shooting. Emanuel fought the video's release for more than a year in court, including during his re-election campaign.
The footage of white Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teen McDonald led to weeks of protests, accusations of a cover-up and calls for Emanuel's resignation. The mayor initially stood by McCarthy. But as the video made national news and thousands took to the streets to demonstrate, Emanuel dismissed his top cop, citing a lack of public trust in the Police Department.
Since then, McCarthy has taken up work as a security consultant while making the occasional television and radio appearance criticizing the city's leadership and the homicide rate that has soared in the last two years.
Listed as president of the campaign fund was Brian McCormack at an Edgebrook address on the Far Northwest Side. The treasurer listed was Bernadette McNally at a North Center address.
McCormack did not return calls left at his home, work and cell phones, or a message sent to his campaign email address listed on the form he filed with the Illinois State Board of Elections.
Contacted by phone Thursday, McNally said she was in the middle of a meeting and did not immediately return the call.
Such campaign committees are required to report political contributions if they top $5,000, but the amount of money listed as available was "$0."
McLaren has more than enough headaches in the technical department after the team's dire showing in the Australian Grand Prix at the weekend, the first race in the 2013 F1 world championship.
But now they've come under fire from rival team boss Christian Horner, who has suggested that it was a vital component developed and delivered by a McLaren subsidiary which directly caused Mark Webber's dreadful start in the race at Albert Park, Melbourne.
"Mark's problems were hugely frustrating because it was an ECU issue that is obviously supplied by a third party," said the Red Bull team principal. "I'll let you guess who that is!"
The ECU - the electronic control unit - is the brains of the car and handles all the telemetry systems in an F1 car. All the teams use a standardised sealed unit provided by McLaren Electronics Systems (MES), which has supplied ECUs to F1 and many other motorsports series around the world for a number of years.
The previous ECU system used in F1 had been regarded as "bulletproof" in terms of reliability. However, this season sees the introduction of a new generation of ECU components as part of a major change in technical regulations coming through for 2014, specifically relating to a new generation of energy recovery systems (ERS) and the introduction of V6 engines to the sport.
Red Bull was not at all happy when that new unit for their #2 car failed, depriving them of access to critical data immediately before the start of the race in Melbourne.
"We lost all telemetry on the formation lap, so we couldn't do the preparation you need to for the start. It totally messed it up," fumed Horner of the problems facing Webber and his car crew. "He and the engineers were completely blind."
Not only did Webber lose six spots off the grid as a result of the launch set-up issues, the Australian also went half the race without being able to use his KERS boost system - something else that came down to the issues with the McLaren ECU.
"The ECU issue also shut down KERS, so by the time we had reset the whole system, it lost Mark the start and early ground," revealed Horner. "It's something they need to get on top of because there were a lot of issues during testing," he added, giving a direct warning to McLaren that he was not happy with the situation.
Over at McLaren, the increasingly beleaguered team principal Martin Whitmarsh told Press Association Sport that he was "distressed" to hear of Horner's complaints.
"I'll be disappointed if it is our fault because in F1, NASCAR and IndyCar, we've not yet stopped a car, and we're very proud of that record," he said. "It undoubtedly caused some headaches at the beginning of testing and I hope we haven't caused anyone problems here.
"I don't want to be defensive about our electronics business because if you undertake to supply these things then you expect them to be faultless," he added. "We'll put our hands up if it's a fault that's derived from the hardware or the BIOS [but] you can also inflict ECU problems on yourself by how you set it up."
Whitmarsh promised to look into the matter and said that customers usually weren't slow to let him know if anything was amiss with McLaren's products.
"It is very complex [and] we're running a completely new system on an old established engine for one year," he pointed out. "But at least next year when we transition into the new engine, and with a lot of complexity around the ERS - which is far more complex than KERS - we've something that has the capacity to deal with it."
Subsequent reports on Monday quoted the managing director of MES Peter van Manen as saying that Webber's problem in Melbourne had been tracked down to the data systems in the Red Bull garage, rather than an issue with the ECU in the car.
Webber ended his home event in sixth place despite starting on the front row alongside teammate Sebastian Vettel. "I felt like I drove well all weekend," he said, "so it was frustrating to come away so low down in the points.
"Things went against me from the start: we had no telemetry on the grid, we had no KERS for the opening 20 laps and the car fell off the jacks at the first pitstop, costing me time," he explained. "When you find yourself in the middle of the pack and you don't have KERS, you're in a really hard place. You can't attack and it's hard to defend through the DRS zones."

We already knew that CD Projekt Red's upcoming open-world RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was going to be a massive game in terms of how long it will take you to complete it. But now the developer has shared new insight into just how large the Witcher 3 world is by releasing the first images of the game's map.
You can see the map images and hear directly from CD Projekt Red developers in GameSpot's new video feature below, which we filmed on-site at the studio's office in Poland earlier this year.
You'll notice that The Witcher 3's world isn't just one big map; it's actually broken into two maps: a smaller Prologue map and the larger Northern Realm. There is also an archipelago destination that you can visit only by boat. Traveling to this location is one of the few instances in The Witcher 3 where you'll encounter a loading screen.
CD Projekt Red also teases that what you see in the video below represents only The Witcher 3's mortal realm. The game also has regions described as fantastical and unnatural, but the developer is keeping official details under wraps for now so as not to spoil story elements.
Watch the video below to learn more about The Witcher 3's vast world. The video is the second installment in a three-part video series we're airing this week. You can watch the first episode here, while the third will debut tomorrow.
The Witcher 3's release date is May 19 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Digital copies of the game unlock that day at 1 AM UTC, which is actually in the late afternoon/early evening in the United States on May 18.

Last week saw a ruling in the case National Association of the Deaf v. Netflix, Inc., 3:11-cv-30168-MAP (D. Mass. June 19, 2012), in favor of the NAD requiring Netflix to close-caption its online video.
This is a bad ruling. Really terrible. It's the kind of results-oriented judicial activism that undermines the public's trust in the judiciary. The judge made it clear he was going to rule for the plaintiff, no matter what. But in doing so, he has potentially ripped open a huge hole in Internet law. Hey jobless recent law school grads—if this ruling sticks, there may be buckets of money to be made in ADA litigation against Internet companies.
The case involves a Cyberlaw perennial: are websites obligated to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA)? In this case, the desired accommodation is close-captioning for Netflix-streamed video. If websites must comply with the ADA, all hell will break loose. Could YouTube be obligated to close-caption videos on the site? (This case seems to leave that door open.) Could every website using Flash have to redesign their sites for browsers that read the screen? I'm not creative enough to think of all the implications, but I can assure you that ADA plaintiffs' lawyers will have a long checklist of items worth suing over. Big companies may be able to afford the compliance and litigation costs, but the entry costs for new market participants could easily reach prohibitive levels.
And then there are linkages with other civil rights statutes, such as Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (an anti-discrimination law) and state laws, that use similar language as the language interpreted in this ruling. If all of those statutes are back in play too, the range of obligations imposed on websites—and the opportunities for aggressive plaintiffs' lawyers—expand exponentially. Expect lots of consumer claims that a website discriminated against them based on an impermissible criterion. It's safe to say that the legal rules at issue in this case could have billions of dollars of impact between the web coding obligations and the potential litigation frenzies.
The most crucial ruling is where the court says that a website qualifies as a "place of public accommodation." The court deviated from—and, incredibly, didn't cite—a nearly unbroken line of precedent rejecting that conclusion. I don't have a complete roster of cases in this area, but cases that came to mind include Noah v. AOL (a Title II case), Access Now v. Southwest Airlines (an 11th Circuit case), Stern v. Sony, Young v. Facebook, and Ouellette v. Viacom. The only plaintiff win in this area is the offbeat National Federation of the Blind v. Target case (which this court did cite), where the court held that Target's obligations to comply with the ADA in its offline retail stores extended to its website. Because of its fact-specific nature, the Target ruling really hasn't had much of an impact on Internet litigation over the past 6 years.
Bypassing all of this precedent, the judge instead relies almost exclusively on the heavily criticized First Circuit Carparts decision from 1994. The NAD made a crafty venue move suing in a court bound by Carparts. Even so, I wonder how this ruling would fare on appeal to the First Circuit (if Netflix goes that route), and I wonder if judges in other circuits will be persuaded by this judge's ruling.
Netflix also argued that it lacked the copyright permissions to close-caption the copyrighted works of others. This is no joke; recall, for example, the howls over Amazon's text-to-speech feature in the Kindle. The court says it wants discovery on that issue.
Finally, Netflix argued that the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 ("CVAA") and associated FCC regulations preempted the ADA's application to Netflix's service. I don't know anything about the CVAA, but it's clearly topical to the issue of close-captioning online video. The court says that Netflix (and presumably other sites covered by the CVAA) gets the pleasure of complying with both the ADA and the CVAA. Yay for duplicative and overlapping regulations!
It's possible that Netflix will win this case in the end (probably not in front of this judge). Until it does, however, we have a clean (if erroneous) ruling that websites are places of public accommodation that are subject to the ADA. I have to imagine plaintiffs will find that pretty exciting.
More from Overlawyered and Wendy Davis.
Update: Although I believe the statute and case law make it clear that ADA does not apply to websites, I also believe that responsible websites should voluntarily undertake extra efforts to accommodate users with disabilities. In many cases, doing so will actually increase profits by expanding the userbase; and even where it isn't, it's a good business decision both as a matter of corporate ethics and for providing extra utility to all users.

[Author's note: In a recent panel discussion, Democracy Collaborative co-founder Gar Alperovitz called for dialogue and debate regarding the pros and cons of the Evergreen model. It's my hope that this blog series will catalyze just such a discussion. As most all the coverage of Evergreen so far has focused on the model's benefits, I focus here exclusively on what I see as a major drawback. If something I have to say strikes you as offensive or wrong-headed, please respond in the comments.]
I want to continue the discussion of the Evergreen Cooperatives that I started (or at least tried to start) with my last blog, What's Up With Evergreen?, but in order to do so I feel that I first need to lay a little philosophical groundwork, so bear with me.
As an entry-point into our discussion, consider the term “white savior complex,” coined to describe a prevalent attitude and narrative around Western aid to African countries. The myth of the white savior holds that members of an oppressed group need a white person to save them and show them how to succeed. Thus, the oppressed are told they must turn to the very group that oppressed them in the first place for their salvation. This is a common trope in Hollywood movies as well as in international development. Dangerous Minds and Avatar are two text-book examples. If you think about it for a minute, I'm sure you can probably come up with a dozen more examples of your own.
The white savior mentality is damaging on a number of fronts. For one, it denies the competence and agency of the people who are supposedly being helped – which is to say it is a patronizing attitude masquerading as compassion. This is simply adding insult to injury (albeit, with the best of intentions). White saviors fail to recognize that the plight of those whom they are trying to help is caused by the same discriminatory system that has placed them in an advantaged position to begin with. The problem is thus framed solely as a lack on the part of the oppressed, rather than as the natural outcome of an unjust system.
The white savior complex is ubiquitous in our society, as it offers a salve for white guilt while stroking the white ego by placing privileged people in the role of selfless hero. The abundance of white saviors in our society has, however, failed to result in much salvation for anyone but the white saviors themselves (and I freely cop to having been one myself). Ironically, projects to help poor people often turn out to be more lucrative for the people providing the help than for the people receiving it (see Non-Profit Industrial Complex).
The provocative – and probably unpopular – contention that I am going to make here is that Evergreen bears many hallmarks of the white savior complex. It is a project conceived by people who enjoy societal privilege in order to help an oppressed group. However well intentioned, it reinforces the idea that oppressed people need (mainly) white professionals to save them. While I assume the project planners had the best of intentions, it nonetheless seems undeniable that the Evergreen model has reproduced, at least in part, the dysfunctional dynamics of privilege that afflict our society.
Consider these statements from the recent report on Evergreen released by REDF:
Evergreen Cooperatives was established in 2009 as an incubator for worker-owned cooperatives in Cleveland, Ohio with support from the Cleveland Foundation, the City of Cleveland, and a group of local anchor institutions including the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, and Case Western Reserve University. Additional assistance in designing the Evergreen model came from the Democracy Collaborative and the Ohio Employee Ownership Center. (pg. 2)
[...]
The businesses were chosen based on opportunities, the needs of the Anchor institutions, and the interests of funders, but without the industry expertise necessary to operate efficiently. (pg. 7) [emphasis added]
What is notably lacking here is any mention of the people the project is meant to benefit as having any agency at all. The project's designers are all relatively privileged members of society, occupying posts in government, in large institutions and in foundations. The people who are meant to benefit from the project are not similarly privileged. In fact, the report refers to potential worker-owners as the “target population," which is not a term that implies agency. So we have a situation where the privileged are coming to the rescue of the underprivileged – pretty much the definition of white savior complex.
And how bizarre is it that worker cooperatives were designed based on the needs and interests of institutions and funders, and not on the needs, interests, skills and abilities of the worker-owners? The report even sees fit to mention Evergreen's lack of industry expertise, but fails to mention the lack of worker input into (not to mention control over) the decisions of what and for whom to produce. Those have to be the two most important decisions a worker cooperative has to make, and yet by all accounts those decisions were made before the inclusion of worker-owners*.
Anyone who has followed the Evergreen story is aware that it's been a rather rocky road for the three cooperatives thus far (these two articles provide some in-depth background, for those who need to catch up). All of the businesses floundered for the first few years, and none of them is yet financially self-sustaining. Most of the problems that the businesses have faced were the result of poor planning by the organizers (i.e. the white saviors). Besides the lack of industry-expertise, mentioned above, the report highlights other failings by the organizers:
In hindsight, Evergreen executives acknowledge that the businesses should have had contract agreements in hand before starting the businesses, and that the product and service needs of the Anchor institutions needed to be better understood. (pg. 6)
An added problem for E2S is that, unlike in a union shop where workers come up through the trades, its workers mostly lacked construction expertise, and a lot of on-the-job training was required to get them up to speed. (pg 7)
Failing to provide accurate market projections and failing to understand the existing skills of workers...and these are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to rookie mistakes by the professionals. In fact, from everything I've read about Evergreen, despite the rosy spin most of it has had, I am unable to escape the conclusion that Evergreen's organizers essentially convinced a bunch of poor people to take part in a poorly thought-out experiment that very nearly crashed and burned. And when that happened, who stepped in to save the day? Was it the workers, having some hard conversations and deciding on a course of action? No. It was Evergreen executives bringing in new management to fire workers and cut wages from, in some cases, $20 per hour to $9**.
The Evergreen executives failed to properly plan the businesses, over-hyped the possibilities and underplayed the risks to workers, and then when things went south, told the workers they were going to have to sacrifice to salvage the experiment that the professionals had initiated.
Evergreen Cooperative Laundry faced the steepest learning curve since it was the first business venture. At first, the workers were involved in all aspects of decision-making, which was difficult since most of them did not have experience in the laundry business and lacked some basic skills of financial management, including reading a profit and loss statement. When the new manager stepped in to streamline operations from the top down, the dramatic culture shift made it difficult to win the support and trust of all workers. However, as Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative said, “If you don't make a profit, the experiment goes away.” Ultimately, the workers were persuaded that making the business profitable was in their interest as owners. (pg. 7-8)
Here we see the white savior complex in action. Blame for the project's difficulties is laid at the feet of the workers, despite the admitted failings of the executives, and the solution presented is for workers to just go along with what the people who know better (i.e. their white saviors) are telling them to do (even though it was those same people who led them astray to begin with). The thinly veiled insinuation here is that the worker-owners wouldn't even understand basic things – like the need for a business to make a profit – unless they had someone to explain it to them.
Maybe it was not the need to become profitable that was such a hard sell to the workers, but rather the ways being proposed to them to make that happen. Maybe the lack of trust was a result of being told they were owners and then having management decisions made without their input. Maybe they were suspicious of the people who had told them what a great idea all this was and how successfull they would be four years ago, and who were now telling them that they needed to take a 50%+ paycut or face unemployment. Maybe...
I've heard through the co-op grapevine that more than one of Evergreen's original worker-owners has left with a bad taste in their mouth. Some, I'm told, were downright traumatized by their experiences. My guess would be that the white savior complex has something to do with that. I think it's high time we talk about it openly.
*Another decision that appears to have been made without the input of worker-owners is the use of debt financing. From the report:
In a normal cooperative, worker-owners generally bring some capital to the table. However, given the target population and the process by which workers come to Evergreen, raising that kind of capital was not possible. Instead, all three businesses were entirely debt financed...While the debt funding allowed workers to own their full share of the businesses, it also created a significant debt burden that made it very difficult for these businesses to be profitable. Recently, some of the debt for E2S and ECL was converted to equity, and ECDF now owns Class B shares in these businesses.
Compare this with the Working World's model of non-extractive finance.
** While it's been reported that workers took massive pay reductions to save the businesses, it's never been mentioned whether or not any of the executives were asked to make similar financial sacrifices. I, for one, would like to know.
PA chief Mahmoud Abbas said that the "fate" of Arab refugees must be resolved if a peace treaty is to be achieved with Israel.
At a joint press conference Monday with French President Francois Hollande, Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas said that the fate of what he said were 5 million Arab refugees must be resolved if a peace treaty is to be achieved with Israel. That must come in addition to the establishment of a PA state in all of Judea, Samaria, and Jerusalem.
The official policy of the Palestinian Authority is to demand repatriation for the descendants of Arabs who fled Israel in 1948 to their original homes in Israel, thus flooding the Jewish state with Arab refugees and effectively erasing Israel from the map, replacing it with a “secular, democratic Palestine.”
In a law approved by the PA parliament in 2008, and signed into law by Abbas, the “right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and property, along with compensation for their suffering, is a holy cornerstone of their rights that cannot be negotiated away. There will be no consideration of negotiation on this issue, nor will there be a referendum on it,” the law says.
A separate PA law states that “it is forbidden for Palestinian refugees to leave their current domicile as a solution for the 'right of return.' Anyone who acts against this law will be seen as a traitor, and will be subject to the penalties that this crime entails.” The law of the language is similar to that of the law against selling land to Jews. PA Arabs who do so are considered “traitors,” and their penalty is death.
Abbas' calls come as the Israeli Knesset established an official body to advocate for the rights of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, who were ethnically-cleansed during the 20th century.
The surge in refugees seeking asylum in Canada by way of the United States has hit southern Ontario border crossings, according to the latest figures from border officials.
Starting in November, just as U.S. President Donald Trump stunned the world with his election win, more than 400 refugees a month started showing up at the five border crossings looking to get into Canada permanently.
In January alone, 433 refugees showed up at Ontario border crossings, compared to 175 refugees in the same month in 2015. That figure is a 147 per cent increase.
There's no question for Windsor, Ont. lawyer Eddie Kadri, the spike is directly related to Trump's immigration policies.
​"You're seeing a direct correlation between the rise in refugee claims and the new administration's policies," Kadri told CBC News. "Absolutely, there's no doubt."

There were 422 refugees seeking asylum in southern Ontario in November 2016, up from the 231 during the same month in 2015. December had similar results with 447 in 2016, compared to 297 the year before.
While Canada Border Services Agency would not give specific figures for each point of entry, numbers released to CBC News come collectively from the region's largest crossings:
Ambassador Bridge (Windsor)
Windsor-Detroit Tunnel
Blue Water Bridge (Sarnia)
Peace Bridge (Buffalo)
Queenston Bridge
Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)
Toronto a popular destination
Toronto has been a popular destination for many refugees entering Canada. Health-care workers in that city and the mayor have called for more assistance, as homeless shelters there have dealt with increasing numbers of newcomers.
In January, some 810 people seeking refugee status, including men, women and children, used a city shelter, according to statistics from Toronto's Shelter Support and Housing Administration. That's an 80 per cent increase from January 2016.
Most people seeking refugee status through the official border crossings likely understand their limitations under the U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, according to Kadri.
Given that agreement between the two countries, anyone coming through a border crossing would be denied entry into Canada unless they fit into one of the exceptions.
"People in this situation would likely be well counseled and would know ahead of time, whether they can show up at a border," he said. "That's why you see a lot of people trying to cross land borders, where there's just land, there's no actual port of entry."
I've made quite a few varieties of raw or no-bake energy balls in my day. They've been a major pantry staple in my house since I realized how easy they are to make! Today I'm so excited to share a version that is hands down, the most delicious version I've ever tried.
There are endless ways you can combine nuts, dates, seeds, dried fruit, oats, etc. in a blender and roll out a super easy, tasty batch of energy balls (if you don't know what I'm taking about click here). The version that I'm sharing with you today is extra special because they don't taste like your typical energy balls, in fact, they're so rich, creamy and chocolatey that I think they taste like brownie batter!
Made with only the most wholesome ingredients (no sugar or flour!), I guarantee that today's Vegan & Gluten-Free No-Bake Brownie Bite Energy Balls will knock your socks off and satisfy your sweet tooth.
They might not be much to look at, but these balls are just so darn good. I've been snacking on a couple around 3pm when my energy starts to wain, and I start daydreaming about chocolate chip cookies. They hit the sweet spot, and are filled with fiber, protein and (good) fat to help you power through the rest of the day (sans sugar coma!).
No-Bake Brownie Bite Energy Balls, Vegan & Gluten-Free Print Prep time 20 mins Total time 20 mins Author: Ilene Godofsky Moreno Recipe type: snack Cuisine: vegan, gluten-free Serves: 12 Ingredients balls 1 cup pitted dates (soaked in warm water for 30 minutes to soften)
¼ cup tahini
¼ cup oat flour
3 tablespoons cacao powder
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
⅛ teaspoon salt toppings 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons cacao nibs chocolate drizzle 1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon cacao powder Instructions Drain the dates and place them in the blender or food processor. Add the rest of the ball ingredients and blend until smooth (you may need to scrape the sides down a few times). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Prepare the toppings by placing the sesame seed and cacao nibs each on their own place. Wet your hands, scoop a heaping tablespoon of the batter, and roll it into a ball. Roll the ball around on either the sesame seed or cacao plate to coat it, then place it on the baking sheet. Repeat until all the batter is used. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator so that balls can firm up. In the meantime, prepare the chocolate drizzle by stirring all the ingredients together. Remove the baking sheet from the fridge. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the balls and sprinkle a little extra salt on top. Return the baking sheet to the fridge so the chocolate can hard (10 minutes). Transfer the balls to an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to enjoy them. 3.5.3208

Feel the pulse of Pinoy readers. The results of the 2012 NBDB Readership Survey is out.
Published 10:52 AM, October 31, 2012
MANILA, Philippines - I am a slow reader.
I savor the words, let phrases linger longer in the mouth.
But I read several books at a time.
Sometimes, 5 or 6. Sometimes, more.
I cannot read before going to bed because it makes me sleepy, even if the book's a thriller.
The best reading time for me would be in the early morning, during waiting time or while on travel.
These are some of my reading habits and behavior. And if you're a smart book writer or publisher, you will find a way to get your hands on facts that pertain to your market's reading attitudes and practices.
If publishers and writers knew, for instance, that there is more demand for books written in local dialects, then they can (and they should) produce more books that will cater to this need.
This is the aim of the National Book Development Board (NBDB) Readership Survey of 2012. In partnership with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHIL) and Vibal Foundation, NBDB commissioned the Social Weather Stations (SWS) to conduct a survey among Filipino readers to determine reading behavior and habits.
The results were presented to an audience composed mainly of book publishers in August in Pasig.
Why the book writers were not there is a whole story on its own, worthy of a separate write-up.
Since March 2003, NBDB has been conducting what NBDB chair Flor Marie Sta. Romana-Cruz described as the “most comprehensive survey on book readership in the country.” The second survey was undertaken in 2007. This year's survey is the 3rd one.
Sta. Romana-Cruz believed that the results of the readership survey are useful for publishers, the Department of Education, mass media and the general public.
Bible still at number 1
Linda Luz B. Guerrero, vice president and chief operating officer of Social Weather Stations (SWS) presented the results of the survey in 258 slides.
While some of the data didn't quite reach me and I got lost in a haze of statistical jargon and technical obscuration, I believe I still managed to get the most important facts.
Here is a summary of the results of the 2012 NBDB Readership Survey:
The average number of non-school books read by the respondents in the past 12 months is 6. The respondents read for information and knowledge. But based on this year's survey results, more people are reading books for enjoyment. The top 3 on the list of “best-sellers” are: the bible, romance novels and cookbooks. At the very bottom are these categories: music, poetry, psychology and erotica. More respondents are reading books in Tagalog, next in English, and then Filipino. (Notice the distinction between Tagalog and Filipino.) 45% of respondents read Filipino authors only. 43% read foreign and Pinoy authors. When choosing books, the respondents are influenced by the blurb (44%), word of mouth (40%) and television (16%). The respondents get their non-school books by borrowing from others (47%), receiving them as gifts (44%), borrowing from the library (25%), renting (20%) or buying (16%). 16% of the respondents bought a non-school book in the last year. In 2007, the figure was 19%. In 2003, it was 22%. The number of non-school books purchased for personal reading in the last 12 months (mean) is 4.8. More people are now buying non-school books that are on sale, or at a discount. Of those who read non-school books, only 6% read e-books. Of those who read e-books, 34% started reading books in this format in 2011. 90% of respondents still prefer books that are printed and with the original cover 90%. The second preferred format is photocopied books, and the least preferred is digital or e-books. 86% say that books are not only good for school but also for daily activities. More respondents also consider books as good gifts. Respondents who watch TV, read newspapers, listen to the radio, watch DVD also read non-school books. All of the internet users surveyed read non-school books. Respondents who read non-school books declined in Visayas and Mindanao. Highest percentage of those who read non-school books are people who are single, college graduates and those with more income. Readers are getting younger. More readers are starting at 13 years old. (mean) Fact: Most people have time to read if they will choose to do so. Fact: Respondents believe that local books are written well. Fact: Books that look good (cover design, layout, etc.) are generally preferred.
What are we to do with these facts?
Sta. Romana-Cruz asked the heavy questions: What have we done, really, to promote reading and to package it as a worthwhile activity? How can we do a better job and move forward? How do we make reading more palatable?
(My question: Why should we? Reading is its own reward; it's not something to be endured.)
With the kind of books we are producing (look around you and take a long look at bestsellers towers and displays in bookstores), what kind of readers are we creating?
I was chatting on Facebook yesterday with a writer friend who told me that he didn't want to jump into the bandwagon. (He is a published, multi-awarded writer.)
I told him: At least more people are reading books, isn't that a good thing?
What do you think? Let us know by posting your comments below. - Rappler.com
Right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos has spoken out in defence of the 'deliberately provocative' university fund he has launched exclusively for white men.
The Breitbart journalist and, lately, founder of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, said his decision to set up a fund that would 'allow white men to pursue post-secondary education on an equal footing with their female, queer and ethnic minority' was deliberately divisive to provoke discussion on a topic that was roundly ignored.
Speaking to IBTimes, Yiannopoulos said: "It's very telling when you see people who think of themselves as being the most enlightened people, and they see a group suffering – and poor white males are in trouble – and they see someone who is prepared to stand up and do something about it, and they s**t all over it. It is very telling.
"I intended the fund to be divisive because I wanted to draw attention to the fact that the world doesn't look the way those people think it does. It started as a bit of a joke really, something provocative, but then when I looked at the data it made sense."
Initially available to students in the US alone "because I am very US-centric now", there is a possibility that the fund will be rolled out to students in other countries as the grant becomes better established.
The fund will start 'modestly' with $125,000 a year (£87,000) to give out to an as-yet undecided number of applicants as "for a poor person, the difference between going to college and not can be a few thousand dollars".
"It will be means and ability-tested," Yiannopoulos said. "When tuition fees came in in the UK, it proved that people aren't dissuaded from going to university by fees, provided they don't have to pay them upfront. What people do find harder is the initial cost of moving and buying books – particularly in the US, so this is a small contribution towards that."
On why the fund is set up to help only white student when US government figures show those students with the lowest attendance at university are of American Indian origin, Yiannopoulos stated: "There are literally thousands of funds set up to help women, but there are about 40 set up for men. UCAS says poor white boys are the most under-represented group in the UK, and it is the same in the US."
The most recent data released by the US Department of Education in January 2016, shows 43.5% of first time post-secondary students enrolled in a four-year institution from 2011/12 were white, while 30.2% were black and just 23.2% American Indian. But Yiannopoulos said: "A lot of these studies don't take into account numbers, they say black people get X percent of Y, but there may be a lower percentage of black people.
"I have identified a group of underprivileged people in need of help – and they are definitely in need of help in the UK as well. I have a lot of very rich friends, and a lot of famous friends – on the quiet because no one can be publicly associated with me because I am a bit of a naughty hell-raiser – and they wanted to help me do something like this. There are enough grants out there for women and minorities."
So Jon Stewart had his rally yesterday. From what I can tell, it was a great promotional event for his TV show and a great party for a lot of college-educated people. Don't get me wrong; I love Jon Stewart, love the Daily Show, and I love the fact that people who are not bat-shit crazy were willing to turn out for a quasi-political event (even if ironically). I don't have any problem with a comedy show holding a rally, no problem with lampooning the 9/12ers, and no problem with centrist liberals holding field day on the D.C. mall.
But something about it irks me. Perhaps it's the inauthenticity of Stewart pretending he's just a really topical comedian while hawking a crypto-politics somewhere between a librarian's shushing and a classic elitist "let the serious people talk now" attitude. Yes, we've all seen him rip Tucker Carlson a new one by pointing out that he's just a comedian and you can't pin him down on political opinions because, after all, you're just going nuts over a joke you don't get while shirking responsibility for your role in the political discourse that's destroying this country . And of course it's absurd that people prefer getting their daily news from a thirty minute sketch show rather than from a show run by credentialed journalists. And of course that should be embarrassing to credentialed journalists everywhere.
But I'll tell you what's really absurd and embarrassing: critiquing our political culture because, in the midst of all the death, destruction, and suffering it's causing around the world and at home, the big problem is that the rhetoric is too uncouth. The rhetoric! My poor, virgin ears! As if that's the major problem with politics right now. Not innocent men, women, and children dying every day because of drone attacks by this supposedly calm and concerned President. Not peaceful people being jailed everyday for political crimes connected to what they choose to do with their body. Not the economic crimes committed by the corporate-government cabal destroying any wealth and future security. No, it's the tone of national discourse we should really be concerned about.
Here's the thing, though: the only people who care about this stage show called the "national discourse" are the elites in media and politics who actually get to manufacture participate in it. It's natural for Stewart to linger on that topic as somebody who has a job in the media, but I can't see why the rest of us should care too terribly much. Not that he's necessarily wrong - sure, I'd like to see more thoughtful reporting and commentary on TV - but he exemplifies the same superficial, fashion cum politics that pisses off dumb ass right wingers about "Hollywood". Neither the image of politics on TV nor the scripts read by those on it are the most important things. The televised stunts of a comedian, or even the broadcasted bloviating of a talking head stroking his own ego, is not the most important thing. What matters are the lives of people being affected by these government and corporate policies. But of course, these are the policies on which people inside and outside the beltway - in spite of how it appears to Stewart - "work together to get things done every single day." I suppose only a loudmouth boor would point out that these policies kill, maim, imprison, plunder, and deceive people everyday - but really, we should keep our voices down! For the country!
I hate to say it, but Stewart appears so disconnected from the genuine tragedies affecting (God help me) regular people in the real world that he thinks the superficial, artificial, abstract idea of a "national discourse" is worth holding a rally about. It's a figment of our collective imagination with no material reality, which is why it's so risk-free to write jokes about. Yes, redneck conservatives pretend they participate in this manufactured discourse by watching news programming straight out of Idiocracy. But hipster liberals pretend they participate in it, too, by watching ten minutes of commercials and twenty minutes of skits four times a week. Aren't both scenarios sad? Is either really helping? And hey, if you point out any flaws in this punditry-on-the-sly, then why so serious, man?
For example, take the tepid, meek interview Stewart gave Obama. Did he call Obama out on the shallowness of the hope and change rhetoric a year and a half into the term? A little bit, sure. But reasonable, sane journalism - or cutting edge comedy, take your pick, I suppose - means letting the President get away with not answering questions or addressing the concerns you claim to be raising, so long as he does it in an articulate and calm manner that gives you time to set up a joke. See, what matters is the tone, and hey, look at all these young people interested in the news! It's as if the only problem with politics is that it's not entertaining enough. But have you seen FOX and Friends? There's entertainment besides comedy.
Look, Jon Stewart would be the first to tell you he's not the answer to these deeply rooted problems in our national politics. And I commend him for that. But at the same time isn't he kind of exploiting the fact that we don't have a viable answer, using this gap in credible political leadership to market his brand of "What ever are we going to do?" comedy programming? It just further proves the point that what we need is not a courtly return to respectful national conversation around the banner of the D.C. status quo but radical leadership that motivates people to face our problems head-on.
But Jon is just a comedian; he's made it clear we can't expect that from him. And, after all, his ability to serve as an outlet for popular frustration with the media he lampoons actually works pretty well for him. Reveling in his status as court jester who can point out the emperor's nakedness, Stewart is content to land on the volume of conversation in the court as some sort of pressing concern. But I've probably taken him too seriously, now; I guess the joke's on me. Wish I was one of the cool people who could crack wise while the country goes down the toilet.
Music industry representatives in France have gathered at the offices of the country's broadcast watchdog the CSA to air concerns over difficult-to-fill quotas on French-language titles.
French radio stations are struggling to fulfil a quota that demands 40% of songs played be French-language titles, half of which are required to come from new artists, with the number of French pop songs being produced dwindling.
The law was introduced in 1994 in an attempt to stem an invasion of English-language songs.
Increasingly French singers have switched to singing in English in recent years due to ease of export and the languages perceived better-suitability for pop music – between 2003 and now the number of French-language album releases dropped from 718 to 158.
Head of Fun and RTL2 radio stations Jérôme Fouqueray, who is leading the call for system change, said “one cannot continue to ignore the new scene which is not French-speaking”.
Fouqueray pointed to the success English-speaking French singers are having abroad while remaining relatively unknown at home, telling Le Parisien newspaper “the setup must evolve”.
NRJ radio group's Maryam Salehi asked: “How can you ask radio broadcasters to respect quotas if producers dry up the source?”
SNEP, the body set up to protect the interests of the French record industry, dismissed such claims however, with general manager David El Sayegh saying: “Granted, there are fewer French productions than ten years ago due to the record crisis. But last year we proposed 720 French-speaking titles to the radio, that's a 28 per cent rise on 2009.”
“However, music FM stations only use 15 singles to meet 90 per cent of their quota. They're terrified of new material.”

German: Biography of a Language. By Ruth H. Sanders. Oxford University Press; 248 pages; $29.95 and £17.99. Buy from Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk
MOST people regard grammar books and dictionaries as a codified set of rules prescribing dos and don'ts. For professional scholars of language, though, they are more like history books. Languages are constantly in flux, but it takes a rather long view to show just what a contingent and transitory thing a language can be at any point in time. Ruth Sanders, a professor of German Studies at Miami University in Ohio, takes just such a view in her new book, telling the millennia-long story of German and how it got that way.
Ms Sanders neatens the history by choosing six turning points to trace the development of German or, more accurately, the Germanic languages. During the third millennium BC, speakers of Proto-Indo-European reached most of Europe. Ms Sanders's biography ranges widely over not just linguistics, but also over archaeology and genetic history to tell the story of these prolific Indo-Europeans and their languages; an eighth of this slim book has passed before the reader first encounters the first Germanic-speakers (on the coasts of Denmark). No one knows what made the Germanic language branch off from the Indo-European family. Whether the pre-existing population in Scandinavia influenced it, or if it had already branched off when it arrived, is hard to say for certain at this distance. But Ms Sanders does usefully correct a common misconception. Languages do not usually spread because newcomers replace indigenous peoples. Rather, those already there often take up the new settlers' tongue.
The next turning point was courtesy of Arminius, also known as “Hermann the German”, a Roman-trained soldier; in 9AD he stopped a Roman advance eastward across the Rhine. At the battle of Teutoburg forest, the troublesome locals ambushed three Roman legions. As a result, the Roman borders, known as “limes” (from which comes the word “limits”) stopped at the Rhine. Whereas the Germanics took up as many Roman ways of life as they could afford, they never took up their language as the conquered—primarily Celtic—people of France and Spain had. Germanic marauders would later devastate the empire itself, but in another twist, those who settled in Italy, Gaul and Spain did in fact begin speaking Late Latin. Arminius had saved a bit of the map for German.
At another of Ms Sanders's turning points, the Germanic dialects had split into High (mountainous, southern) and Low (northern, flatland) varieties, giving modern (High) German ich, for example, while old Anglo-Saxon had ic and Dutch, ik. Perhaps the most celebrated turning point in the history of the German language is the work of another rebel against Rome, Martin Luther. His belief in salvation through personal faith alone, not the intermediation of the Church, led him to violate a longstanding prohibition on translating the Bible into vernacular languages. Luther had to compromise between the many different “Germans” that filled the German lands in those days, hundreds of years before there was a single German state (the creation of which is Ms Sanders's fifth turning point). Luther borrowed an emerging standard used by the Holy Roman Empire, “chancellery German”, as a base with some currency in different regions.
Luther's genius was to infuse his translation with the words he heard on the street in his bit of Saxony, in east-central Germany. He obsessively asked friends and fellow scholars which dialectal words would be most widely understood. The common touch was so successful that a Catholic opponent complained that “even tailors and shoemakers…read it with great eagerness.” It was the bestseller of the century and remains the most popular German translation. Rarely has a single man had such a mark on a language. The German of Luther's Bible was nobody's native language in his day. Today it is so universal that it threatens Germany's once-vibrant dialects with death by standardisation.
Ms Sanders's work contains some disappointments. Occasionally she reintroduces the same fact as if it were new. And with under 250 pages to tell her tale, there is little room to spare. There are no examples of the earthy Saxonisms that Luther made into today's standard German. Ms Sanders reports that the Latin theodiscus is the first mention of German's name for itself (Deutsch), but not where theodiscus comes from. (The answer is that theud was a Germanic root meaning “people”, so that Deutsch meant “Peoplish” to its speakers.) The chronological tables contain more errors than they should. The last turning point, German's cultural revival after two crushing world wars, feels too brief.
Ms Sanders's book is a biography, not of the modern German language proper, but of the Germanic languages and the people who speak them. She takes in the development of Yiddish, Dutch, Icelandic and of course English, as well as others. As such it is an ingenious telling of just how German emerged from the primordial Germanic soup, and how many other ways it could have been if, say, Luther had been born 100 miles farther north. For all its flaws, this is an enjoyable yet still-scholarly read for the historian, linguist and Germanophile alike. It would be a fine thing to have more such brief histories, made easily readable to the non-specialist, of the major world languages.
2015 is already a landmark year in two-time Grammy winners They Might Be Giants‘ illustrious career. With the return of their Dial-A-Song service, the band have been posting a new track and accompanying music video every week to unanimous exclamations of joy from fans old and new.
Every Tuesday throughout the year a new song is posted via www.dialasong.com, TMBG's “Particlemen” YouTube channel and on their free smartphone apps.
In celebration, the band is releasing GLEAN on 20th April via Lojinx in Europe and on 21st April in the US on their own Idlewild imprint. It includes 16 songs direct from these first weeks of their Dial-A-Song service. The range of these recordings is truly staggering. From the manic violin-driven ‘Music Jail, Pt. 1 & 2‘ to the bluesy grinding of ‘Underwater Woman,' Glean comprises some of They Might Be Giants' most vital work of their 30+ year career. With the album, TMBG's sound is in equal turns as rocking, surprising, effervescent, and truly original as they have ever been. The highly anticipated album is produced with long-time collaborator Pat Dillett (St. Vincent, Mary J. Blige, David Byrne, Donald Fagen, etc), and comes hot on the heels of 2013's fan-favourite Nanobots.
From the world's first downloadable album to audio and video podcasts to smart phone apps, They Might Be Giants' career has always been one of unlikely innovation. And now their most notorious innovation, Dial-A-Song, has been revitalised for 2015. Originally launched in 1983 from John Flansburgh's Brooklyn kitchen via a consumer answering machine, Dial-A-Song let listeners in on the latest and greatest from the band years before their career took off on a international level.
I have just read the most heartbreaking description of the death of Lady Katherine Grey. She was the sister of Lady Jane Grey, the “Nine Days Queen” and a descendant of Mary Tudor, sister of King Henry VIII. Katherine's death at the age of twenty-seven was most unfortunate.
What makes her story so sad? In many ways, her life mirrors that of her cousin Arbella Stuart who was born six years after Katherine's death. Arbella was a descendant of Margaret Tudor, the eldest sister of King Henry VIII. Both women were potential heirs to Queen Elizabeth I. Both women married Seymour men without the permission of the Queen. Both women were imprisoned for their foolish behavior and both died probably of starvation in captivity. The only difference was Katherine had two children while Arbella had none.
In Tudor times, being a potential successor to the monarch was hazardous to one's health. Many heirs suffered imprisonment or beheading. These poor women had the audacity to fall in love with men and marry. While I admire Queen Elizabeth I very much, she was particularly hard on these women in not allowing them to follow their hearts. I don't think it would have mattered who the men were.
Katherine Grey never sought permission to marry, probably with good reason. The wedding ceremony was performed essentially in secret. The only witnesses were her husband's sister and a mysterious priest who performed the rite. The marriage was soon exposed and the Queen was furious. In the meantime the sister had died and the priest had disappeared. The validity of the marriage could only be substantiated on the testimony of the bride and groom. Elizabeth set up a commission to investigate the details with the express hope the marriage would be declared invalid. But the commission could find no reason to contradict the word of the bride and groom. In the eyes of the law, if the bride and groom declared they were married, that was enough.
Katherine and her husband were separated along with their two sons and held in captivity. She slowly descended into a deep depression and didn't eat enough to keep herself alive. Her keeper despaired of her health and called for a doctor. But she had no will to live separated from her husband and her eldest son. She called her keeper to her deathbed and professed her undying love for her husband. She gave him three rings to pass on to her beloved after her death. Her betrothal ring, her wedding ring and a momento mori ring all attested to her great love of her husband and to the fact that she was indeed married.
I am sympathetic and understand Elizabeth's political reasons. Elizabeth wanted to have as few potential heirs alive around her as possible. As a prospective heir herself, she had suffered great fear and humiliation during the reigns of her brother Edward and sister Mary. And you get the feeling there may have been a wee bit of jealousy on Elizabeth's part too. But I think it boiled down to Elizabeth's insecurity. She had been declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament after the downfall of her mother Anne Boleyn. When she ascended to the throne, she never had the act overturned and so remained a bastard in the eyes of the law. And she was a female monarch. At the time, this was viewed as an aberration in the Christian hierarchy. Poor Katherine Grey was unlucky enough to be caught up in the quagmire of Tudor politics and its consequences.

Recently, Georgia state Senator Barry Loudermilk appeared on TBN's “Praise the Lord” where he made the rather familiar argument that the Founding Fathers took the concepts of the separation of powers and the three branches of government directly out of the Bible.
Claiming that John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington all directly cited the Bible as justification for these concepts, Loudermilk asserted that Jeremiah 17:9's claim that “the heart is devious above all else” made the Founder realize the need to divide power among various branches of government, which they took directly from Isaiah 33:22's declaration that “the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our ruler, the Lord is our king”:
If that argument seems familiar, it is because it came directly from David Barton, who has made the baseless assertion time and time and time again:
It is untrue every time Barton says it and is equally untrue when Loudermilk mindlessly repeats it.

Although Bible prophecy can be difficult to interpret, some predictions seem clear – for example, the return of Israel to their own land (fulfilled in 1948). The Brexit vote on Thursday, where Britain decided to leave the EU following a referendum, is consistent with prophecies traditionally interpreted to mean that Britain will collaborate with nations other than the EU at the time of Jesus' return. However, there are other plausible interpretations of these prophecies. So, whist I think it's good to get excited when world events seem to fulfill Bible prophecies, it is probably better to reflect on the fact that God is in control of world events, Jesus will return at some point, and we should be ever-ready for this!
The Bible predicts an invasion of Israel around the time of Jesus' return led by a ‘Northern' confederacy of nations (see Daniel 11, Ezekiel 38 & 39, Zechariah 14). Whilst it isn't easy to ascribe specific modern nations to the ancient nations listed in these prophecies, it seems that the Northern confederacy will include Russia and countries from continental Europe. The Bible also speaks of a resistance to this invasion, which includes ‘Tarshish with its young lions' (Eze38:13). Tarshish and her young lions are traditionally identified as Britain and the nations that have arisen from the British Empire (including the USA). If 'Tarshish and the young lions' refers to Britain and the nations that have arisen from the British Empire, it would seem odd for Britain to be part of the EU at the time that this prophecy is fulfilled if the countries in continental Europe are part of the Northern confederacy that invades Israel. This prompted many to predict – correctly as it turns out – that Britain would leave the EU.
However, I think it would be a mistake to say categorically that the Bible predicted the result of the referendum last Thursday. Tarshish could relate to other nations (e.g. Spain). Also, even if Tarshish does refer to Britain, there are other scenarios that would still be consistent with Bible prophecy with Britain remaining (or perhaps even returning) to the EU (for example, Britain in the EU but making different military alliances around the time of Jesus' return).
So, whilst it's good to be excited when world events seem to fulfill Bible prophecy, it's healthy to remain open-minded to other possible interpretations. It's also important to recognise that Brexit will result in upheaval and painful changes for many. However Brexit relates to Bible prophecy, God is firmly in control of world events (Daniel 2:21-22), and Jesus will return. We are told to look out for signs that this return may be soon, and to be ready (Mark 13:35-36)!

Those are just some cases making up the recent explosion of lawsuits filed by workers against their employers.
"Workers are becoming more aware of their rights," said Lou Pechman, an employment lawyer at Berke-Weiss & Pechman who has handled many of these cases for employees. "There have been some big judgments for workers, and it's natural for them to fight for themselves."

"I saw very few wage issue lawsuits for the first 11 years of my practice," said Carolyn Richmond, a lawyer since 1994 and who works at Fox Rothchild,
"Usually it was worker discrimination cases, but the number of cases on wages has increased a lot over the past few years," said Richmond, who is counsel to the restaurant industry.
While the actual number of cases might seem low—some 7,764 over time lawsuits filed in the U.S so far this year, according to the Federal Judicial Center—the percentage has shot up dramatically.
Collective lawsuits in federal court alleging wage and hour violations increased some 400 percent from 2000 to 2011. The increase so far this year is 10 percent higher than last year, when 7,064 cases were filed.
Redd Foxx, TV's 'Sanford,' Dies of Heart Attack at 68 : Entertainment: Comedian is stricken while rehearsing new show, 'The Royal Family.'
"They were rehearsing on the set and clowning around, and Redd was sort of breaking people up when he collapsed," said McCallister. "They all thought he was joking around at first, and then they called the paramedics."
Foxx was stricken at 4:10 p.m. while rehearsing a scene for the series on a studio sound stage, said Rachel McCallister, a spokeswoman for the program. The rehearsal was halted after the actor collapsed. There was no audience present.
Foxx died at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center nearly four hours after he collapsed at Paramount Studios while rehearsing the latest episode of his television series.
Comedian Redd Foxx, who became a television star playing an irascible, bawdy junkman in "Sanford and Son" and returned nearly two decades later in the current CBS series "The Royal Family," died Friday of a heart attack. He was 68.
McCallister said virtually the entire cast and crew went to the hospital, and Foxx's wife, Ka Ha Cho, whom he married in July, was at his side when he died. McCallister said that Foxx's body will be flown to Las Vegas for burial. Funeral plans are pending.
It was uncertain how Foxx's death would affect the series, which is scheduled to resume taping Tuesday.
Foxx, whose entertainment career spanned more than five decades, was known for his portrayal of cantankerous but endearing television characters and for performing off-color routines in nightclubs.
Until the television debut of "Sanford and Son" in 1972, Foxx was known more by the occupants of smoke-filled nightclubs and purchasers of his several randy recordings than by the American public at large.
Afterward, his life became a roller-coaster saga--soaring from rags to riches, sliding back into bankruptcy and troubles with the Internal Revenue Service before Foxx made a comeback this fall as a prime-time star.
In his new television series, Foxx played Al Royal, a retired Atlanta mail carrier whose life is disrupted when his grown daughter moves back home with her three children. But to some, his character was merely a reincarnation of the role he popularized in 1972 as the crabby Fred G. Sanford--a name that he chose as a tribute to his brother who had died five years earlier.
"Sanford and Son" was set in Watts and avoided the mainstream of black stereotypes on television. Of the show that entertained television viewers for five years on NBC, Foxx said in a 1973 interview: "I'm convinced that 'Sanford and Son' shows middle-class America a lot of what they need to know. . . . The show is lighthearted, doesn't drive home a lesson, but it can open up peoples' minds enough for them to see how stupid every kind of prejudice can be."
Foxx, never one to keep his opinions to himself, said in the same interview: "I want no black takeover. . . . Black power and white power are meaningless, I want green (money) power."
But the comedian and actor, whose distinctive voice drew descriptions of coarse sandpaper to the low-throated growl of a blues singer, was credited with influencing a generation of black comics who followed him.
Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of Paramount Pictures, which co-produced the show, said in a statement: "Redd Foxx was blessed with the ability to make people laugh and audiences everywhere loved him for it. Within a short period of time, Redd and his Royal Family had won their way into millions of homes and hearts. All of us at Paramount are sad to lose such a friend and a one-of-a-kind talent."
The scraggly-faced entertainer was born John Elroy Sanford in St. Louis, Mo. When he was 4, his father deserted the family, leaving the boy, his older brother, Fred Jr., and his mother penniless.
JOHANNESBURG: When Zimbabwean game farmer Tendai Musasa speaks about his president, Robert Mugabe, his voice softens with joyful pride.
At a giant party in Victoria Falls on Saturday to celebrate Mugabe's 91st birthday, the 20,000 guests feasted on elephant meat donated by Musasa, who pledged to slaughter two of the beasts.
Mugabe celebrated his 91st birthday with a lavish bash attended by thousands of ruling party faithful. Crowds of supporters clad in ZANU-PF party regalia emblazoned with the president's image sang and danced as he arrived for the party being held at a luxury hotel in the famed Victoria Falls resort.
Assisted by his wife Grace the frail Zimbabwean leader, who was surrounded by family members, threw 91 balloons into the air.
Elephants were slaughtered for the feast, which was held on the hotel's golf course, with white marquees erected to accommodate the guests.
Seven huge cakes were on display in one of the tents. One giant 91kg creation depicted the Victoria Falls.
Musasa, whose lifelong dream is to meet Mugabe, said his main motive for donating the elephants, as well as a lion trophy, a crocodile trophy and a small herd of live impala, was gratitude. He's a beneficiary of Mugabe's land reform policy, a program that saw white farmers ousted from their holdings without compensation after 2000.
“We regard him as our father,” he said of the world's oldest leader, who has been in power for 35 years. “Our provider, our hero. We regard him as a very courageous man.”
Musasa originally planned to donate a wild buffalo or two, to be slaughtered for the feast. However, recent rains made it difficult to find any, so he donated five live impala to breed in the president's game reserve. The lion, which he recently hand-picked, and a crocodile are to be stuffed as trophies, not eaten.
He said there was a strong cultural obligation for Victoria Falls to show hospitality and thank Mugabe for celebrating his birthday in the town.
Others who have donated items include government heavyweights Jonathan Moyo and Obert Mpofu, who each offered 20 cows for slaughter. Mpofu also donated $40,000 (Dh146,920) toward the event, according to local media.
The extravagance of the birthday celebrations has attracted criticism because of the stark contrast with Zimbabwe's high unemployment and failing businesses. The country's struggling public enterprises, including electricity and transport providers, are expected to contribute to the event and a teaching union official, Raymond Majongwe, told local media the nation's threadbare schoolteachers had been forced to donate from $1 to $10 each.
Mugabe's increasing frailty has ignited a succession war in the ruling ZANU-PF party, with Joice Mujuru ousted as the nation's vice president last year among accusations of plotting to kill Mugabe. Scores of her allies, including senior party officials and 15 ministers and deputy ministers, were purged in December.
Musasa, director of the 31,000 acres Woodlands Conservancy near Victoria Falls, said it attracts big game trophy hunters from all over the world, including the United States.
He said it was better to kill one elephant for the Mugabe feast than 20 cows. “It's one life versus 20,” he said.
Musasa, sensitive to criticism from conservationists _ though he doesn't always agree with them _ added that the elephants would have been shot anyway because they were nuisance animals that were threatening local farmers. He said Zimbabwe was severely overpopulated with elephants.
The elephant shot for the feast Thursday was a young bull.
“It had grown up (with) a tendency of charging and hostility to farmers,” he said. “They're going to the ripe corn. They become aggressive, stubborn and unflinching in their attacks.
“Elephants have got characters, like human beings. There are the rogue ones who become accustomed to being thieves. They attack people guarding the fields.”
He said the conservancy usually shot about two elephants a year as part of its “problem animal control.”
“We send a message to the rest of them not to be rogue animals. We put down the most formidable charger or aggressor to say to the rest, ‘Don't do this thing.'”
The lion to be given the president as a trophy would be shot later this year by an international game hunter who would pay a trophy price, he said.
“I personally identified an old lion, a huge one,” he said. “If you have studied the dynamics of the lion kingdom, these lions are soon ousted by the pride. They start to pray on farmers' livestock. They start to be a danger to human lives.”
Musasa was 4 when Zimbabwe won independence in 1980. At university, studying engineering, he led a students' movement in favour of land redistribution from white farmers to blacks.
Mugabe's land seizures were violent and controversial: The program led to a significant decline in agricultural production and undermined related industries, as new black farmers struggled to run their holdings without infrastructure, resources, knowledge, farming experience or access to bank finance.
Last week, a husband was reported to have surprised his wife and her lover inside a motel. The first thing that entered my mind is not about infidelity, but death. Killing someone in flagrante delicto (caught in the act), or death inflicted under exceptional circumstances, does not carry any imprisonment.
The act of killing another person is a criminal offense. It's the rule. It's not uncommon, however, for rules to have exceptions. For instance, there is no criminal offense when killing is done in self defense or under exceptional circumstances.
Death under exception circumstances covers both death and physical injuries, when a married person – either the husband or the wife – surprises the other spouse in flagrante delicto in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person. Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code reads:
ART. 247. Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances. – Any legally married person who, having surprised his spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person, shall kill any of them or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter, or shall inflict upon them any serious physical injury, shall suffer the penalty of destierro. If he shall inflict upon them physical injuries of any other kind, he shall be exempt from punishment. These rules shall be applicable, under the same circumstances, to parents with respect to their daughters under eighteen years of age, and their seducers, while the daughters are living with their parents. Any person who shall promote or facilitate prostitution of his wife or daughter, or shall otherwise have consented to the infidelity of the other spouse shall not be entitled to the benefits of this article.
As stated in a case, Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code does not define and provide for a specific crime, but grants a privilege or benefit to the accused for the killing of another or the infliction of serious physical injuries under the circumstances therein mentioned. Far from defining a felony, this provision merely provides or grants a privilege or benefit — amounting practically to an exemption from an adequate punishment — to a legally married person or parent who shall surprise his spouse or daughter in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another, and shall kill any or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter, or shall inflict upon them any serious physical injury. It is, in effect, an exempting circumstance.
The penalty of infidelity is death. The requirements before exemption is granted:
1. A legally married person (or a parent) surprises his spouse (or his daughter, under 18 years of age and living with him), in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person.
2. He/she kills any or both of them or inflicts upon any or both of them any serious physical injury in the act or immediately thereafter.
3. That he has not promoted or facilitated the prostitution of his wife (or daughter) or that he or she has not consented to the infidelity of the other spouse.
There's an interesting aspect of the penalty when a spouse kills his/her spouse under exceptional circumstances. The penalty is destierro, which we commonly know as banishment. This is not a penalty but a measure of protection for the accused (the spouse who killed the other spouse) — to prevent a situation when relatives or friends of the dead spouse/lover might exact revenge.

Zavodovski Island, Southern Ocean
Chosen by Elizabeth White, producer, Islands
I can vividly remember the knot in my stomach as we approached the steaming, malevolent-looking crater of Zavodovski Island, 1,300 miles east of the Falklands in the Southern Ocean. The trip had taken more than a year of planning and caused many sleepless nights (even before the seven-day rough sea crossing), and my first impression was, “Gosh, I hope this is worth it!” But sometimes the things that push you out of your comfort zone become the most poignant.
As we boarded the inflatable and took our first steps on the island, I knew I was going to fall in love with the place. Zavodovski Island is home to the largest penguin colony in the world; it's a wave-battered volcano covered in penguins. To many people, the rawness of this land of mud, smoke and penguin carcasses would be anything but beautiful (and yes, the place does stink) but there is something exciting about being in a place where so few humans have set foot. Places that are truly wild and untouched are very hard to find.
Watching the penguins going about their daily lives in this rugged and brutal landscape was a humbling experience. It's a strange vision of paradise, but to me – and to the 1.5 million penguins that nest there – there's nowhere like it on Earth.

The Gokyo Valley is beautiful. It has sweeping glaciers and Cho Oyu – the sixth-highest mountain in the world – at its end. It's home to the sherpa people, some of the warmest and most hospitable you will meet, anywhere. It took six days to trek there, carrying all our kit, so to arrive was an incredible feeling. We saw lots of wildlife, from Himalayan tahr to the exquisite monal pheasant, Nepal's national bird – and one of the most colourful you can find.
The area is not famous for its snow leopards but in the last 10 years there is evidence that their numbers here may be growing. We filmed jumping spiders there: the world's smallest but highest-living animal mountaineer. The valley has some famous viewpoints: Gokyo Ri at 5,360m is the highest point any of the Planet Earth crew reached in filming mountains. It's a peak that towers over the Ngozumba glacier. You have to start the climb early in order to see the sunrise over Everest and, depending on your fitness, it can take several hours.
We had a wonderful time with our sherpa crew. On our last night they invited us to a cultural exchange. We listened to our head guide Nima sing and dance a traditional sherpa story about a spider. After the applause died down it was our turn but we got embarrassed and passed on the opportunity. After several more attempts to get us to perform (and a fair amount of home brewed “chang”) our cameraman Jonathan Jones burst into a rendition of You've lost that lovin' feeling, and the rest of us had little choice but to join in. The sherpas seemed pleased with our efforts and soon were demanding we teach them a “traditional dance” of our own. So, we ended up with the whole room doing the hokey cokey. I like to think we did something to spread British culture to the remote Himalaya.
Other encounters weren't so pleasant. We were camping and without fail every night a large yak would try and come into my tent. The first night was like a scene from a horror film with me screaming as I had no idea what this heavy breathing, snorting, hairy visitor was. I sat bolt upright and for a second thought it might even have been a yeti. I have no idea why the animal was so attracted to my tent.

Working in Madagascar was a real highlight for me. We went to film indri, the biggest and the most-engaging of the lemur family. Each day we trekked through hilly jungle before dawn to find the indri, accompanied by our expert Malagasy guide. Indri are not too hard to find because, as the sun rises, they sing, to tell rival indri families that this is their patch of forest. It's a beautiful and plaintive sound and incredibly loud.
However the jungle is dense and the trees tall, and while indri can dance effortlessly through the trees, we can't. So we had to wait patiently for the family to come to areas where we could film. Luckily, waiting in the forest in Madagascar is a treat. The jungle is full of strange insects, reptiles and birds; they are hard to spot at first, but having the friendly, knowledgeable guides meant we could find and film some unexpected jungle gems.
There is a satanic leaf gecko that lives there. It is disguised as dead leaves with a face like Dragon from the movie Shrek. There's another leaf-tailed gecko that is so beautifully disguised – to look like the green and gold of tree bark – that you can be standing 10cm away from it and still not be able to see it. Eventually, it will lift a leg or blink and then you start to see it! The guides love showing this to tourists and seeing how long it will take them to spot. We also filmed a stick insect that looked like a green twig but revealed bright red patterned wings when it walked, presumable to scare away predators. None of the guides had seen that before.

Chosen by Ed Charles, producer, Deserts
This has to be one of the wildest and most undisturbed places I have ever been: you could drive for days and not see another human being. The vastness of the landscape and its stark beauty were breathtaking, and although it was largely empty, there were pockets of life, usually around dry riverbeds, where there was just enough water beneath the ground to support life.
Here you'd see elephants, oryx and lions right in the heart of the desert, but our best moment was when we saw a cheetah. Cheetahs in the heart of the desert are incredibly rare, but one day we rounded a corner and came face to face with a beautiful female in mid-hunt. I'm not sure who was more astonished, us or the cheetah, but there followed an incredible moment where neither party dared move. It probably only lasted a few seconds but it seems to stretch on for minutes. Unfortunately, the spell broke when we went to get our camera: the movement caused her to run off into the desert. We never saw her again, but knowing she was out there was an incredible privilege.

Walking beneath the towering elephant grass of Kaziranga national park, it's hard not to feel as small as an insect. The grass, the tallest in the world, is more than three times the height of a human. The dense green blades arch high over the path, creating a tunnel kept open by animals that also dwarf us – generations of elephants and buffalo. Their secretive labyrinth is shared by more than 2,000 rhinoceros, more than all other Asian rhino put together. If you include the swamp deer, wild boar, hornbills, gibbons and sloth bears, you can see why they call it the Serengeti of Asia. Looking from one watchtower with my binoculars I counted 25 rhinos – there's nowhere in Africa you can do that.
Most magical are the Kaziranga dawn safaris, taken sitting with a blanket over your lap in the back of an open-top jeep, a crimson disc sitting low in the sky as you sip sweet local Assam tea. The prize for most visitors is spotting a Bengal tiger, found here in higher densities than in any other protected site in the world. Their stripes evolved to camouflage them brilliantly in the tall grass, and as they slink off into the labyrinth, it's nice to be reminded, in age of ever-more-intimate wildlife filming, there are magical places where creatures keep their secrets.

Travelling to Harar was like travelling back in time. It's a beautiful city, and the warren of cobbled streets are so narrow that cars can't go down them, so food is brought in on donkeys. It's considered Islam's fourth holy city, and the old town has 99 mosques. It's a place where you feel history exuding from the walls.
I had heard about spotted hyenas roaming the streets at night but it was not until a group of eight of them brushed passed my leg on a narrow cobbled street at 1am, that I realised exactly how true this was. Spotted hyenas are the second largest land predator in Africa: they've been known to kill people. It was at first frightening to be encountering them on small dark streets in the middle of the night, but after seeing how comfortable the locals are with their company, I soon became accustomed.
A few nights later, I was surrounded by more than 100 fighting hyenas as two clans battled for access to the city. My lack of fear in this scenario is testament to the extraordinary peaceful pact that exists between man and beast in this city. The locals welcome them into their city, and have done for centuries. It's an astonishing coexistence between people and perhaps the most vilified animal in our planet … and it shows us just how possible it is for us to share our streets with wild animals.

How the bugs in our gut and elsewhere on our body affect our overall health still remains largely a mystery. But IBM is hoping to shed some light on the human microbiome and its role in autoimmune diseases using crowdsourced supercomputers through its World Community Grid.
IBM has partnered up with the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Diego, and the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute for the study, which aims to map three million bacterial genes found in human guts.
The hope is this research will help scientists better understand how these bacteria contribute to diseases like Type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.
IBM isn't the only one looking at our gut health, though. In fact, it seems to be en vogue for tech companies. In April, Alphabet's life sciences arm Verily launched a project to glean information on the microbiome through the gut and DNA samples of 10,000 participants. Tech billionaire Naveen Jain began his own exploration of the subject with the creation of Viome in 2016 and there have been several startups gobbling up VC dollars to study the subject in the past couple of years.
IBM's study will use the scientists from the aforementioned universities as well as harness the mass computing power from volunteers around the world to crunch the data. It will then analyze findings and make them publicly available.
I went into television in 1979, when I was 25 years old. The weather was cold, very cold. The winters of the 1960s and 1970s were some of the most brutal of the last century. And stubbornly, the cold would not release it's bone-numbing grip.
Magazines sported stories of a coming Ice Age. The winter of 1976-77 was so cold that the state of Ohio virtually closed for the month of January. A great blizzard in January 1978 brought hurricane force winds and record snowfall to the Midwest. Just a few weeks later, another massive blizzard of historic proportions closed Boston and Providence for a week. Snow fell in Miami on January 19, 1977.
Energy conservation was all the rage. People were buying solar panels to put on their houses to heat hot water. Tiny little Japanese cars were selling faster than Japan could make them -- not only for the fuel efficiency, but because they were all front-wheel drive, better for handling in the never-ending snowstorms.
The situation was alarming to some people. A select committee of climate experts came together in January 1978. They declared that there was no end in sight to the 30-year cooling trend.
The stage was set for news media to capitalize on these captivating weather stories -- but it never happened to the degree it has today. Not even close.
There were several factors at work regarding why. First, there were only three channels on television. They were very competitive with each other, but they were all essentially printing money. NBC, ABC, and CBS controlled what the public saw and heard, along with the newspapers -- which were thriving. The major media outlets were king.
Second, there was no internet. You got your news from the small group of information outlets, and that was it. It's hard to imagine a world without blogs and websites freely writing and editorializing about the stories of the day, but this simply did not exist.
And third, there were no rapidly evolving technologies forcing change. Television, radio, and print were healthy and profitable. The marketplace was in their control, and life was good.
As the 1980s dawned, market conditions began to change. It started with CNN, ESPN, HBO, and The Weather Channel, among others.
The planting of cable TV across the nation was a double-edged sword for the traditional television networks. It gave them a much better and more consistent signal, but it also put a hole in their revenue stream. Total audience for the big three television networks peaked in the early to mid-1980s and has been falling ever since. Combine that with the internet, satellite TV, and expanded radio offerings, along with a myriad of other technological innovations, and today you have a much more complex and competitive marketplace.
How does this figure in with global warming? It all started in 1988, when Dr. James Hansen of NASA testified before Congress on a very hot summer day. He said global warming is real, is caused by human burning of fossil fuels, and is a danger to the future of the planet.
Overnight, everything changed.
Dubai: Pakistan's former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf says he considered the use of nuclear weapons against India amid tensions following the 2001 terror attack on the Indian Parliament, but decided against doing so out of fear of retaliation, according to a media report.
Musharraf, 73, also recalled that he had many sleepless nights, asking himself whether he would or could deploy nuclear weapons, the Japanese daily 'Mainichi Shimbun' said.
The former president disclosed that amid tensions between India and Pakistan following the 2001 terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament, he contemplated the use of nuclear weapons, but decided against doing so out of fear of retaliation.
When tensions were high in 2002, there was a "danger when (the) nuclear threshold could have been crossed," the paper quoted Musharraf as saying.
At the time, Musharraf had publicly said that he would not rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons.
Musharraf also said, however, that at the time, neither India nor Pakistan had nuclear warheads on their missiles, so it would have taken one to two days to make them launch-ready.
Asked whether he had ordered that missiles be equipped with nuclear warheads and put into firing position, he said, "We didn't do that and we don't think India also did that, thank God" -- pointing, perhaps, to a fear of retaliation, the paper reported.
The two countries subsequently avoided an all-out clash and tensions subsided.
The then army chief Musharraf ousted the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a coup in October 1999. The army general served as president from 2001 to 2008.
Musharraf has been living in Dubai since last year when he was allowed to leave Pakistan on pretext of medical treatment. He has been charged with involvement in the murder of the former two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.

The Houston Rockets finally shuffled their way out of the postseason Wednesday night.
The team's Game 5 loss to the Golden State Warriors was expected if not inevitable, and a long-building frustration seemed to be seeping out of the Rockets as their streaky run in the 2015 NBA playoffs came to a clunking, turnover-ridden finish.
Houston's angst manifested itself in a number of ways, the most interesting being Dwight Howard's comments to the assembled media at the postgame presser.
As CBS Sports' James Herbert (h/t Sporting News' Jordan Heck) reports, a sullen Howard told the media he will not let the loss bring him down, because he is a champion.
"It's tough, but I won't stop fighting," Howard said. "I'm going to continue to push myself to the limit and remember that, no matter how the season ends, I'm still a champion. And I won't let anyone tell me anything different."
Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
Technically, this is true.
Howard is a champion—a dunk contest champion. Which is cool, or was cool, back when the world was pure and entertainment was feeding a blob that lived on your keychain.
Of course, Howard is not an NBA-title-that-means-something champion. He did get to an NBA Finals with the Orlando Magic in 2009, which counts for something, just not a ring or other trinket you can use as a prop in a guerrilla marketing stunt.
So yes, Howard will get raked over the coals for his phrasing, but the underlying sentiment remains admirable: He views himself as a champion and wants to hold himself to a champion's standards. These are good things.
On the flip side, calling yourself a champion aloud before earning a title is a great way to catch all the misery. Just saying.

Editor's Note: This story was originally published in February 2017, after Amanda Diesen and Todd Kreig created a funny pregnancy announcement explaining that, although Kreig was paraplegic, they were expecting their first child together.
On August 5, 2017 — six months after their announcement, declaring "it still works" went viral — the couple welcomed Everett Jason Kreig, nicknamed Rhett, into the world.

Diesen told TODAY Parents that although sleepless nights with a 5-month-old are exhausting, parenting has been a rewarding experience for her and her fiancé.
"The tough part for Todd is that he can't help out as much as he'd like to," said Diesen. "If Rhett gets fussy he likes to be walked and bounced and rocked, but Todd is unable to do that."
"We're thankful, though, to have learned early on Todd can do a lot more than we originally thought," Diesen continued. "He had been told by someone else in his situation that he wouldn't even be able to hold his son, but Todd holds Rhett every day. Todd will occasionally feed Rhett, and I even made him change a dirty diaper the other day."

In February 2017, the Ohio couple made the internet smile with their creative announcement of their most recent challenge — their journey into parenthood.
Krieg, a former dirt bike racer, became paralyzed after a biking accident in 2014. After traveling to California for a rehabilitation program, Krieg met Diesen, who worked as a recovery specialist with patients at the facility. The pair fell in love, and after Krieg returned to Ohio in 2016, Diesen followed.

Shortly after, the couple learned that Diesen was pregnant with their first child — an unexpected event given Krieg's paralysis.
"We definitely weren't trying to have a baby — we wanted to get engaged, get married, and then start trying in a few years," Diesen told TODAY Parents. "We found out at the beginning of December and were extremely shocked and overwhelmed. We took a test together and just about freaked out."

"It was au natural, no IVF," Diesen explained. "Doctors had said it was possible, but the chances were very slim — that it probably wouldn't happen without help like IVF or other devices."

To announce their unexpected pregnancy to their friends and family, the couple planned a photo shoot, where they decided to have a bit of fun. Diesen says she found pregnancy announcements on Pinterest in which the dad was holding a sign that said, "I did that," and had the idea to include the phrase, "It still works" in their own photo.
During the funny photo shoot, things turned serious when Krieg proposed. Diesen said "yes," and later posted their story on a bridal website, in hopes of winning a contest for a free wedding. This week, a friend shared their story and their pregnancy announcement on Reddit, where millions of people have viewed the image, which shows Krieg sticking out his tongue and giving the camera a thumbs up while Diesen pretends to be embarrassed.

"We are two of the goofiest people together," said Diesen. "(The announcement) is slightly immature and inappropriate, but everyone secretly loves that stuff. I feel our story is very unique and inspiring, and my hope is that it brings hope to anyone else looking for love — that it literally can happen in the most unexpected place with the most unexpected person — so be open to change."
Diesen says humor has been a key part of their ability to cope with the more difficult parts of Krieg's condition.

"Of course there are moments of sadness and we can't joke about it all the time — he truly is in pain constantly — but I'm thankful to do life together and to be able to bring him up," said Diesen. "Todd brings so much joy to my life and everyone around us, and I can't wait to watch him be an amazing father to our son."
A second strand of opposition comes from what I think of as the Bah Humbug caucus: fiscal scolds who routinely issue sententious warnings about rising debt. By rights, this caucus should find much to like in the Senate health bill, which the Congressional Budget Office says would reduce the deficit, and which — in the judgment of leading health economists — does far more to control costs than anyone has attempted in the past.

But, with few exceptions, the fiscal scolds have had nothing good to say about the bill. And in the process they have revealed that their alleged concern about deficits is, well, humbug. As Slate's Daniel Gross says, what really motivates them is “the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, is receiving social insurance.”
Finally, there has been opposition from some progressives who are unhappy with the bill's limitations. Some would settle for nothing less than a full, Medicare -type, single-payer system. Others had their hearts set on the creation of a public option to compete with private insurers. And there are complaints that the subsidies are inadequate, that many families will still have trouble paying for medical care.
Unlike the tea partiers and the humbuggers, disappointed progressives have valid complaints. But those complaints don't add up to a reason to reject the bill. Yes, it's a hackneyed phrase, but politics is the art of the possible.

The truth is that there isn't a Congressional majority in favor of anything like single-payer. There is a narrow majority in favor of a plan with a moderately strong public option. The House has passed such a plan. But given the way the Senate rules work, it takes 60 votes to do almost anything. And that fact, combined with total Republican opposition, has placed sharp limits on what can be enacted.
If progressives want more, they'll have to make changing those Senate rules a priority. They'll also have to work long term on electing a more progressive Congress. But, meanwhile, the bill the Senate has just passed, with a few tweaks — I'd especially like to move the start date up from 2014, if that's at all possible — is more or less what the Democratic leadership can get.
And for all its flaws and limitations, it's a great achievement. It will provide real, concrete help to tens of millions of Americans and greater security to everyone. And it establishes the principle — even if it falls somewhat short in practice — that all Americans are entitled to essential health care.
Many people deserve credit for this moment. What really made it possible was the remarkable emergence of universal health care as a core principle during the Democratic primaries of 2007-2008 — an emergence that, in turn, owed a lot to progressive activism. (For what it's worth, the reform that's being passed is closer to Hillary Clinton 's plan than to President Obama 's). This made health reform a must-win for the next president. And it's actually happening.
So progressives shouldn't stop complaining, but they should congratulate themselves on what is, in the end, a big win for them — and for America.
Tyson Griffin is ready to officially make the move to featherweight. Welcoming him to new the new weight class is fellow former lightweight turn featherweight, Manny Gamburyan. The two are expected to clash at UFC on Versus 4.
UFC officials made the announcement on Tuesday afternoon.
After being considered a top contender at lightweight for most of his UFC career, Griffin has fallen on hard times recently, losing three fights in a row including the first KO loss of his career courtesy of Takanori Gomi at UFC on Versus 2. Griffin's most recent loss came by way of controversial split decision at the hands of Nik Lentz this past November. Despite it being his third straight defeat, Dana White did not agree with the decision and decided not to release Griffin from the organization. Griffin now looks to find success at featherweight, starting with Gamburyan.
Gamburyan will try to bounce back from a TKO loss to current UFC Featherweight Champion Jose Aldo, his first loss at featherweight. Much like Griffin, Gamburyan moved from lightweight to featherweight after dropping two straight fights at 155. Gamburyan was on a three fight wins streak at featherweight, including a KO victory over former 145 champion Mike Brown, before failing to capture the title in his last bout against Aldo.
UFC on Versus 4 is scheduled for June 26, 2011. While no official venue has been announced, the event is rumored to be taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The first double gameweek of the season is upon us, with Manchester City and Stoke both playing twice.
The Citizens travel to Sunderland, whilst the Potters host Middlesbrough, before the pair meet at The Etihad on Wednesday. Anytime goalscorer and clean sheet odds are not currently available for the second match, so our analysis below only takes account of the weekend matches, but we elevate City and Stoke players when it comes to squad selection on the basis that they play twice in this round of fixtures.
Defensive odds
Team Best clean sheet odds Implied chance of a clean sheet Man Utd 1.8 56% Man City 2.12 47% Stoke 2.25 44% Chelsea 2.26 44% West Brom 2.4 42% Tottenham 2.45 41% Leicester 2.45 41% Swansea 2.55 39% Southampton 2.6 38% Liverpool 3.3 30% Crystal Palace 3.4 29% Watford 3.65 27% Middlesbrough 3.85 26% Burnley 4.1 24% Hull 4.65 22% Arsenal 5 20% Everton 6.1 16% West Ham 6.2 16% Bournemouth 11 9% Sunderland 13 8%
Both Manchester clubs are prominent in our thinking for Gameweek 27, with United topping the (single) gameweek rankings. They have a 56% chance of keeping Bournemouth at bay in Saturday's early kick off, whilst cross-town rivals City have a 47% chance of registering a clean sheet away to Sunderland, and then host Stoke. Antonio Valencia and John Stones are our chosen routes into each defence, providing attacking and bonus point potential respectively.
Stoke and Chelsea (both 44% – albeit the Potters then have a second game) complete the top 4 for Gameweek 27. A home game against Middlesbrough bodes well for Mark Hughes' men, given the attacking profligacy of their opponents, whilst Chelsea travel to West Ham on Monday evening, looking to get back to their defensive best. Lee Grant provides excellent value between the sticks, whilst Marcos Alonso, as always, offers a potent attacking threat.
To fill the remainder of our defensive slots, we opt for Hull's budget shot stopper Eldin Jakupovic (£4.0m – 22%) as our backup keeper, with goal machine Gareth McAuley (£4.5m – 42%) and Southampton's Jack Stephens (£4.0m – 38%) taking the second and third spots on our bench respectively.
Before moving onto our analysis of the bookmakers attacking odds, a quick look at the bottom rungs of the clean sheet ladder tells us that defensive assets from West Ham (16% – home to Chelsea), Bournemouth (9% – away to Man United) and Sunderland (8% – home to Man City) should be avoided this weekend.
Attacking odds
Player Best anytime goalscorer odds Implied chance of scoring Zlatan Ibrahimovic 1.62 62% Sergio Aguero 1.67 60% Harry Kane 1.9 53% Diego Costa 2 50% Henrikh Mkhitaryan 2.6 38% Dele Alli 2.7 37% Fernando Llorente 2.7 37% Eden Hazard 2.75 36% Son Heung-Min 2.8 36% Raheem Sterling 2.85 35% Jamie Vardy 2.9 34% Daniel Sturridge 3 33% Salomon Rondon 3 33% Gylfi Sigurdsson 3 33% Kevin de Bruyne 3 33% Yaya Toure 3 33% Paul Pogba 3 33% Leroy Sané 3 33% Romelu Lukaku 3.05 33% Sadio Mane 3.1 32% Alexis Sanchez 3.2 31% Roberto Firmino 3.25 31% Shinji Okazaki 3.25 31% Manolo Gabbiadini 3.25 31% Pedro 3.3 30% Christian Benteke 3.4 29% Riyad Mahrez 3.5 29% Marko Arnautovic 3.5 29% Peter Crouch 3.6 28% Philippe Coutinho 3.75 27% Troy Deeney 3.75 27% Nacer Chadli 3.75 27% Willian 3.85 26% Christian Eriksen 3.85 26% Jermain Defoe 4 25% Alvaro Negredo 4 25% Nathan Redmond 4 25% Andy Carroll 4.33 23% Sam Vokes 4.33 23% Adam Lallana 4.5 22% Theo Walcott 4.5 22% Dusan Tadic 4.55 22% Cesc Fabregas 5 20% Kevin Mirallas 5.5 18% Adama Diomande 5.5 18% Robert Snodgrass 5.5 18% Matt Phillips 5.5 18% Cristhian Stuani 5.5 18% Alex Iwobi 5.5 18% Benik Afobe 6 17% James Milner 6 17% Wilfried Zaha 6 17% Mesut Ozil 6.3 16% Ross Barkley 6.5 15% Manuel Lanzini 6.5 15% Yohan Cabaye 6.5 15% Andros Townsend 6.5 15% Fabio Borini 7 14% Scott Arfield 7.5 13% Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7.5 13% Etienne Capoue 8 13% Adama Traore 8 13% Junior Stanislas 8.5 12% Tom Carroll 14 7% Tom Davies 15 7%
Sergio Aguero (60% chance of scoring against Sunderland followed by an extra game at home to Stoke) provides top billing for Gameweek 27 and takes our captain's armband. He is joined up front by cup final hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic (62%) and Fernando Llorente (37%) ahead of home games against Bournemouth and Burnley respectively.
The bookies also fancy the chances of Golden Boot joint leader Harry Kane and Chelsea's Diego Costa, but the duo unfortunately prove too expensive for our squad this gameweek.
In midfield, the double gameweek again promotes a City asset to the top of the class, with Raheem Sterling (35% and a second fixture) our first pick. Dele Alli (37%) now has 12 league goals for the season and joins Sterling in our midfield ahead of his home game against Everton on Sunday.
Gylfi Sigurdsson (33%) and Pedro (30%) have both been in good form of late and complete our starting XI. Swansea's Icelandic talisman has the potential to enjoy his home game against Burnley, whilst Pedro continues to offer great value as a Chelsea midfield pick and travels to West Ham for a London derby on Monday evening. Etienne Capoue (13%) once again completes our squad with his £4.5m valuation vital for our budget.
The bookies also rate a host of midfield options in Gameweek 27; Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Eden Hazard, Heung-Min Son, Kevin de Bruyne, Yaya Toure, Paul Pogba, Leroy Sané, Sadio Mane, Alexis Sanchez and Roberto Firmino, but we have to forgo all of the aforementioned midfielders for reasons such as starting security, injury doubt, budget, or the fact that we already have 3 players from a certain club.

— Scientists are reporting unprecedented success with a new type of cancer treatment. It uses the patient's own immune system to fight the disease.
As CBS2's Dr. Max Gomez reported, the revolutionary treatment is destroying cancer.
Emma Collins looks like a typical 16-year-old girl now, but less than three years ago she was dying of cancer.
Kashaun Lawhown, 7, was facing the same fate.
Both of them were battling leukemia, and traditional treatments -chemotherapy and radiation — weren't working.
A game changing experimental cancer treatment that utilizes the body's own immune system gave them a second chance.
“The immune system has developed over may, many, many, you know, over millions and billions of years to actually get rid of things that don't belong in the body. Cancer doesn't belong there,” Dr. Stephan Grupp explained.
Dr. Grupp is the Director of Immunotherapy at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where Kashaun and Emma took part in a clinical trial for this revolutionary treatment.
“We collect white blood cells from the patient — those include T-cells. Those T-cells then go to a specific place where they are manufactured; reprogrammed to actually be able to attack cancer cells,” Dr. Grupp said.
These souped-up cells, now called CAR-T cells are then put back in the body where they multiply and get to work, explained Dr. Shannon Maude.
“When they find something that they recognize, like the B-cell leukemia, they kill that off,” Dr. Maude said.
“If you had told me five years ago, how effective they would be, I wouldn't have believed you,” Dr. Stephen Hunger said.
Better yet, some of the CAR T-Cells may actually stick around to fight a recurrence, Dr. Hunger explained.
“A one-time treatment can certainly lead to at least five years of survival, and we hope can lead to cures,” Dr. Hunger said.
After battling leukemia for five years, it took just one T-cell treatment to finally put Kashaun's cancer into remission.
“Everything worked out good and I'm healthy,” Emma added.
Just four days after her treatment there was no sign of her cancer. What's more amazing, she's been in remission now for 18 months.
“Out of many, many years, or many, many people doing a lot of work to come to this point, it's really exciting,” Dr. Maude said.
The CAR-T therapy is effective mainly against leukemia and lymphoma but researchers are working to also use it against so-called solid tumors like breast, colon, and lung.
Not all patients have their cancer destroyed, the trials have been positive enough that the FDA is expected to approve the therapy this year.
Citizens' Assembly votes 87% in favour of advising government to change eighth amendment on right to life
A committee set up to deliberate on Ireland's strict abortion regime has voted for the constitutional rules to be changed.
The Citizens' Assembly, a randomly selected group of 99 members of the public chaired by the supreme court judge Mary Laffoy, met on Saturday to discuss the contentious issue for the final time.
At the heart of the assembly's work is examining the eighth amendment to the republic's constitution, which gives equal right to life to the mother and the foetus. In the first of a series of votes by members on whether to advise constitutional reform, the assembly voted 87% in favour of change.
A series of other votes are being held over the weekend to determine the specific changes the assembly will recommend.
Since 2014 in Ireland, a pregnancy can be terminated under the Protection Of Life During Pregnancy Act if there is a risk to the woman's life, including from suicide. The procedure can involve a medical or surgical termination, or an early delivery by induction or caesarean section.
Irish people have dared to speak on abortion. Our government must listen | Grainne Maguire Read more
There has been a strong campaign for women to be allowed to have an abortion in cases of rape and incest, or if there has been a fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis.
Figures from the Health Service Executive showed 26 terminations were carried out under the legislation in 2014 and again in 2015. In both years, 14 were because of a risk to the life of the mother from physical illness, three in relation to suicide and nine following emergencies arising from physical illness.
In 2013, Amanda Mellet became the first of three Irish women to formally ask the UN to denounce the prohibition on abortions in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities as “cruel and inhumane”.
Mellet and her husband took their case to the UN's human rights committee after they were forced to go to England to terminate the pregnancy.
Last year the UNHRC ruled that by forcing Mellet to leave Ireland to have an abortion, the state had inflicted trauma and distress on her.
For the first time in its history, Ireland compensated Mellet as a result of the ruling. Under the country's laws, if Mellet and the other two women had remained in the republic they would have been forced to give birth to stillborn babies.
On Saturday, Judge Laffoy said the result of the vote provided a mandate for changing the status quo and, if implemented by the government, it would require a constitutional referendum, the Irish Times reported.
Opening the session, she praised the commitment of the assembly members.
“This exercise in deliberative democracy allowed us to withdraw from the polarising perspectives and begin first and foremost with the facts.”

You have to respect minor league baseball teams. Just when you think all of the glorious ball park foodporn monstrosities have already been invented they continue to push the boundaries of innovation and your arteries.
The Wilmington BlueRocks, a Kansas City Royals affiliate in Wilmington, DE has stepped up to the plate and created this mouthwatering creation. The minor league team partnered with Krispy Kreme to make the first ever hot dog donut bun. The bun is slathered in raspberry jelly which lubes up the buns for the steamy hot dog to be inserted. This tantalizing wonder is then topped with crispy, salty bacon.
That blend of sweet, savory and hint of tang from the raspberries is giving me a tongue boner right now.
They call it “The Krispy Kreme Donut Dog,” which is probably a better name than “Kremey Weenie.”

Donald Trump's victories in seven states on Super Tuesday left many Americans ready to hightail it to the Great White North.
The phrase “how to move to Canada” began trending on Google as results poured in from across the nation. According to Google data editor Simon Rogers, searches for the phrase spiked 350 percent between 8 p.m. and midnight Eastern time.
By midnight, that number jumped to 1,500 percent, according to Google Trends.

The controversial candidate won seven states in the Tuesday primaries, namely Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Virginia, Arkansas and Vermont.
Trump's victories came despite the fact that he initially refused to speak against the recent statement of support he received from former KKK leader David Duke.
Speaking to supporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump congratulated Ted Cruz for the senator's win in Texas before taking a swipe at Hillary Clinton's record, saying she has been in politics a long time and “isn't going to straighten it out” if elected president. Trump also took aim at GOP rival Marco Rubio, saying the “little senator” had a “tough night.”
Clinton, meanwhile, took the delegate-rich states of Massachusetts, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia and Tennessee in the Democratic primaries.

She told supporters in Florida that “this country belongs to all of us, not just those at the top, not just to people who look one way, worship one way or even think one way,” while opponent Bernie Sanders promised his supporters he would take the fight to the 35 states that remain in contention.
The association representing more than 800 midwives in Ontario says there is a "burgeoning interest" in allowing them to offer abortion services.
The idea was floated in recent months during discussions with the Ministry of the Attorney General and Health Ministry officials while the Association of Ontario Midwives was offering advice on the recently passed Safe Access to Abortion Services Act, which prohibits protests within 50 metres of abortion clinics.
Now the idea is "on their radar," Elizabeth Brandeis, president of the association, said in an interview.
"The Association of Ontario Midwives has a pro-choice position," said Brandeis. "We believe very strongly that reproductive rights, including a spectrum of choices around birthing, also encompass safe access to abortion care."
Midwives do not currently provide abortions anywhere in Canada. In other parts of the world, they play a role, including in France, where they are allowed to prescribe and perform medical abortions. In Sweden, midwives can administer abortion medications, and they counsel women through the process. They can also prescribe contraception.
In Canada, midwives are limited to providing care to women during pregnancy, labour and birth, as well as post-natal care for up to six weeks. There are more than 1,500 midwives working across the country. They go to school for four years to earn a degree in midwifery from one of seven schools offering it and then must meet the standards set by the college of midwives in their province or territory.
Brandeis said the continuity of care and a client-centred approach midwives already provide could easily translate into a model for the provision of abortions.
Abortion system 'fragile'
Midwives could support women as they are making a decision about pregnancy termination or if they have suffered a miscarriage and, as a result, need an abortion, she said. They could also support them through the procedure and provide post-abortion care.
Right now, the system of abortion providers operates in silos, said Brandeis, and that's not helpful for women.
The other main benefit to midwives providing abortions would be increased access to it, especially in rural and remote areas, she said.
"We know that the abortion system is fragile," she said. "There are decreasing numbers of providers offering abortion, and so midwives being able to fill gaps within the health care system is something we are very interested in looking at, not just in abortion provision but in many aspects of reproductive care."
Abortion clinics exist mostly in urban centres, and women outside those areas largely rely on hospitals for the procedure. Fewer than one in five hospitals in Canada provide abortion, according to the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, and they can have long waiting lists or other restrictions, such as requiring a doctor's referral.
The coalition says there is a shortage of doctors able and willing to provide abortion.

Katrina Kilroy, a midwife in Toronto who heads the Canadian Association of Midwives, said there is interest among midwives across the country in providing abortion. "This is not a contentious issue in the midwifery community," she said.
Kilroy said it's well within a midwife's knowledge base to provide medical abortions by prescribing a medication that terminates pregnancy, and they could be trained to do manual vacuum aspirations, a type of surgical abortion.
It would be a "shame" if governments didn't take the opportunity to allow midwives to provide abortion given the interest and the gaps in the system that need to be filled, she said.
"If there is an entire class of caregivers who could be offering that service, and they're not able to offer that service, that's a question for policymakers," said Kilroy.
Health minister rejects idea
Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins, who was a physician before he was a politician, told CBC that the government has already been working with the midwives association to expand their scope of practice, which is set out in the Midwifery Act and is regulated by the College of Midwives of Ontario. The expansion includes ordering laboratory tests and prescribing more drugs that fall under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

"We are not currently considering expanding the scope to include abortion services," said Hoskins.
"This would require a significant amount of work, and although we are open to all discussions, it's not currently an activity that the ministry is undertaking."
The health minister said he's not ruling it out, but right now, it's not a priority.
Updating the Midwifery Act and creating any necessary training would be a "big undertaking" said Hoskins.
The NDP's health critic, France Gélinas, said removing barriers to abortion access would help women in rural and remote areas like her northern Ontario riding, Nickel Belt, and the government should take the midwives up on their offer to provide the service.
"It's a huge opportunity lost, and the big losers in this are women in northern and rural Ontario," she said.
"Why not pursue it? It's a good fit. It makes sense."
If the government did follow through on the idea, there would no doubt be some opposition, the Ontario midwives association said.
"There are people opposed to abortion in general, so having another provider enter that space, we expect that there would be reaction and backlash from anti-choice advocates," said Brandeis.
Minister should 'entertain' idea
The idea is getting traction, however, with doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood Toronto.
"Adding midwives to the roster of people providing abortion care is a smart way to go," said Sarah Hobbs Blyth, executive director of the clinic. "I think the minister should entertain it."
If the Health Ministry is already expanding the drugs that midwives can prescribe, it should consider allowing them to prescribe Mifegymiso for medical abortions, said Hobbs Blyth.

"The timing seems fortuitous," she said.
Doctors at the Planned Parenthood Toronto clinic will soon have Mifesymiso at their disposal.
Mifegymiso is a prescription drug used to terminate early pregnancies that was made available in Canada in January after a lengthy Health Canada approval process.
Ontario began covering the cost of it in August. The government said that would help increase access to abortion and provide a more affordable option for women.
Health Canada told CBC the decision whether or not to allow midwives to prescribe and administer Mifegymiso is up to the provinces.
Manavi Handa, an assistant professor at Ryerson University in its midwifery program who has been a midwife for 17 years, said it would be a personal decision for midwives to offer abortion services, but they should have the option.
Some countries have "physician-only" laws that prohibit anyone other than doctors from providing abortions, but Canada isn't one of them, said Handa, and that would make it easier for the provinces to proceed with incorporating abortions into midwives' scope of care.
In many other countries, midwives are thought of as specialists in reproductive health and not only providers of care during and after pregnancy, she said. She said she'd like to see that spectrum of knowledge more recognized in Canada, especially as access to abortion "continues to be an issue" in some parts of the country.
If you like politics as blood sport, this is great stuff. On the other hand, if you worry about people, their lives, their health, how their money is spent and how their government protects their lives, their health and how their money is spent, well, then, this sucks.
If you had been waiting for the three-month follow-up to the Senate Environment and Public Works committee hearing on the Fukushima Near-Term Task Force recommendations–the one Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) promised in August at the last hearing on this issue of vital importance to US nuclear safety–well, that hearing was yesterday, Thursday, December 15. . . and whether you watched them or not, you are still waiting.
Though this hearing was, indeed, scheduled months ago, and was introduced Thursday by Boxer with the insistence that the committee should focus on the progress of post-Fukushima lessons learned, the Senators instead behaved much like some of their House brethren had the day before, spending over two-and-a-half hours debating whether Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman Gregory Jaczko was either a bad chairman. . . or the worst chairman ever.
As has been detailed so many places, the four other NRC commissioners sent a super-complainy letter to the White House essentially accusing Jaczko of making decisions they disagreed with. . . oh, and yelling, banging his gavel, and causing three unnamed female NRC employees to cry. Not to belittle any real problems with real bullying, harassing, martinet bosses, but given the context–seeing this letter “leaked” by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) just before the scheduled release of a report (PDF) from Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) accusing members of the NRC (most notably industry loyalist and Obama appointee Bill Magwood) of conspiring to slow-walk and/or submarine safety upgrades that Jaczko wanted to see adopted after the Fukushima disaster–it is hard to see this dustup as anything but a distraction and a witch hunt.
And it is hard to see the Representatives and Senators (all of them Republican) who spent the last two days berating Jaczko as anything but clumsy puppets of a nuclear industry hell-bent on seeing that nothing more is required them, memorable nuclear nightmare or no.
Look no further than Rep. Issa's introductory statement at his Wednesday hearing, in which he so badly butchered the names of four of the five NRC commissioners seated in front of him. Issa did OK with “Magwood,” but the verbal Play-Doh that he substituted for “Jaczko,” “Svinicki,” “Apostolakis” and “Ostendorff” demonstrated either a purposeful slight of those “fereign” soundin' names, or a complete and total ignorance of the matter at hand.
Now, I will cop to having botched the pronunciation of Chairman Jaczko's name (I now have it on good authority that it is pronounced YAHTZ-ko), but in my defense, I was just going by what I heard on radio and television. Issa, on the other hand, should, in his role as a House member tasked with oversight of the NRC, and as a man who has pushed this apparent scandal as the single most important thing confronting nuclear regulation right now, have a familiarity if not a close working relationship with these people. His demonstration that he did not seem to say that rather than have any deep knowledge of the matter at hand, Issa was likely just reading what had been placed in front of him by folks who had paid for the right to put words in the mouth of a US Congressman.
Now, as has been mentioned before, it is hard to find the energy to go to the mat for Chairman Jaczko, who may be the most liberal commissioner at the NRC, but is still not seizing this Fukushima moment and truly rethinking US nuclear policy. Perhaps Kevin Kamps of Beyond Nuclear put it best: “He's not ‘our guy' by any means, he has voted to re-license plants that should probably be shut down. But he does care about safety, in ways that the others do not.” It is hard not to wish that Jaczko were the worst commissioner at the NRC instead of the best. But it is easy to be outraged by what has happened to Jaczko, and more importantly, what has happened to the fight to improve the safety of America's nuclear facilities.
And it was hard, while watching the House and Senate hearings within the boundaries of a TV screen, not to think you were seeing some colorized clip from the McCarthy era. The innuendo, character assassination and countless hours of self-righteous grandstanding from Republicans that all-of-the-sudden were oh-so-concerned about supportive work environments and reactor safety went beyond politics-as-usual–it was business as usual, and politics as business. A naked power play by an entrenched, privileged, presumptuous and protected industry.
But now what? This round goes to the nuclear industry–hats off–they made a week that should have been about following up on Fukushima taskforce recommendations, and made it instead about the regulator that dared to regulate. Big nuclear put reformers on their heels at a time when the literal and political fallout from Fukushima should have nuclear apologists running for the hills.
But this is far from over. Darrell Issa, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), commissioners Magwood, Svinicki, Ostendorff and Apostolakis, and the nuclear lobby that buttresses all of them will not stop here. The two days of hearings may have ended with a plea for a bunch of smart and dedicated public servants to “work it out,” but watching the events of the last week (and reading the emails included in Markey's report) make it clear this is not just a war on Jaczko, this is a war on regulation. It may look on the surface like so much bread and circuses, but big nuclear's henchmen are prepared to feed Christians to the lions all day long. Pro-nuclear forces will accept nothing short of an unobstructed path to privatized profits with socialized risks.
So, the ball's in your court, Chairman Jaczko. Will you try to give the industry some of what it wants–go ahead with approval of the new AP1000 reactors, the restart of derelict facilities like Davis-Besse and Crystal River, and the relicensing of aged, Fukushima-class plants–in the hopes that somehow this will make the masters of the nuclear universe like you more? Or will you stand fast, indeed, stand faster–pause the relicensing, stop new construction, accelerate post-Fukushima safety upgrades–and stare down the lobbyists and wholly owned elected officials?
If they want to pose as Joe McCarthy, then you, Chairman Jaczko, channel your inner Joseph Welch: “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?”
Thanks to a rare alignment of personal interests and election-year politics, it appears the White House has the NRC chairman's back (at least for now)–Jaczko should use the opportunity to look forward.

Reports have surfaced before on why it's so difficult for the human brain to get the human body to adjust its behavior for the betterment of the planet. But maybe none as pointed as the latest: the American Psychological Association has just completed a study on why people are so slow to action when it comes to combating climate change. Their conclusion? Simple. It's psychological.The report finds that there are a number of mental barriers that prevent people from acting, even if they believe wholeheartedly that climate change is a major threat. Topping the list is the fact that most often, climate change isn't considered an immediate danger, and thus, less urgent to act upon.
So this is where the APA decided to dig in--they analyzed the root of the inaction: (from the APA)
Scientific evidence shows the main influences of climate change are behavioral — population growth and energy consumption. "What is unique about current global climate change is the role of human behavior," said task force chair Janet Swim, PhD, of Pennsylvania State University. "We must look at the reasons people are not acting in order to understand how to get people to act."
Uncertainty — Research has shown that uncertainty over climate change reduces the frequency of "green" behavior.

Mistrust — Evidence shows that most people don't believe the risk messages of scientists or government officials.

Denial — A substantial minority of people believe climate change is not occurring or that human activity has little or nothing to do with it, according to various polls.

Undervaluing Risks — A study of more than 3,000 people in 18 countries showed that many people believe environmental conditions will worsen in 25 years. While this may be true, this thinking could lead people to believe that changes can be made later.

Lack of Control — People believe their actions would be too small to make a difference and choose to do nothing.
— People believe their actions would be too small to make a difference and choose to do nothing.
Habit — Ingrained behaviors are extremely resistant to permanent change while others change slowly. Habit is the most important obstacle to pro-environment behavior, according to the report.
"Many of the shortcomings of policies based on only a single intervention type, such as technology, economic incentives or regulation, may be overcome if policy implementers make better use of psychological knowledge," the task force wrote in the report. The task force identified other areas where psychology can help limit the effects of climate change, such as developing environmental regulations, economic incentives, better energy-efficient technology and communication methods.
The last Pew Research poll found that some 80% of people believed that climate change was a serious issue--but it consistently came in dead last when ranked against other issues like terrorism, the economy, even the ambiguously worded "decline of family values." So, to better understand why people feel no pressure on the issue, even though scientists continually warn that in order to avoid catastrophe action must be taken now, the APA compiled a list of the psychological barriers responsible for the disconnect. Here's a sampling:While it's interesting to see it spelled out and backed up by research, none of this is particularly revelatory stuff. And the solutions it expounds are good ones--like employing clear, immediate financial incentives to get people to cut back on energy consumption--but not necessarily new ones. Nonetheless, this is a worthy, under-examined avenue--and one that could have huge benefits in motivating more people to act. As the APA says,It would indeed be useful to have a wider body of study done on the subject--if more specific ways to appeal to the human brain to inspire action on an intangible threat, perhaps they can effectively be applied to policy.

Story highlights Family holds private funeral Saturday for Army Sgt. La David Johnson Cooper
President Donald Trump's response to Johnson's death has sparked controversy
Cooper City, Florida (CNN) Loved ones bid their farewells Saturday at a private funeral for Army Sgt. La David Johnson, one of four US soldiers killed in Niger, whose death has been at the center of a public dispute this week between President Donald Trump and a congresswoman.
Flags flew at half-staff across Florida as Johnson's remains were transported early Saturday afternoon for burial following the closed-door service at Christ the Rock Community Church in Cooper City.
"Reality just hit me, and it was like, he's really gone, and I'm not going to ever have my brother anymore," Johnson's sister, Terkiya McGriff, told CNN affiliate WSVN on Friday night.
An estimated 1,000 people attended the service, according to Cooper City spokeswoman Michelle Alvarez, with "a few hundred" having to stand.
Local residents waved flags and watched from the roadside as the processional accompanied Johnson's remains from the church to Hollywood Memorial Gardens for burial.
Aydan Özoğuz ( (help·info) , born 31 May 1967) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). She has been a member of the Bundestag since 2009 and served as deputy chairperson of the party from 2011 until 2017. She also served as Commissioner for Immigration, Refugees and Integration at the rank of Minister of State in the third government of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2013 until 2018.
Early years [ edit ]
Özoğuz was born on 31 May 1967 in Finkenau, Hamburg to Turkish parents, who came to Germany in 1958. She grew up in Hamburg-Lokstedt. Her parents later went into their own food business. Özoğuz acquired German citizenship in 1989. She has two brothers, Yavuz and Gürhan.[1]
She finished her high school education at Corvey-Gymnasium in 1986 with Abitur. Following her studies in English Major and Spanish and Human Resources Management in minor, she completed a master's degree at the University of Hamburg in 1994. During her university years, she was member of the Turkish Student Society in Hamburg, and served as its chairperson for two years.[1][2]
Career [ edit ]
Since 1994, Özoğuz was research fellow in the Körber Foundation as project manager of "Coordination of New Projects" with focus on German-Turkish projects. From 1996 on, Özoğuz conducted projects in the field of Youth and Science Exchange as well as academic conferences on issues of international relations. With her election into Bundestag, she was exempted from her post at the Körber Foundation.
Between 2001 and 2008, Özoğuz was member of the Hamburg Parliament. She was appointed speaker of the parliamentary group of SPD for migration policies and member of the committees of interior affairs, petitions and family.[1]
In 2004, Özoğuz joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She is the first ever Turkish descent woman in the SPD leadership as deputy chairperson.[1]
Member of the Bundestag, 2009–present [ edit ]
Özoğuz first entered the Bundestag at the 2009 German federal election. She became a member of the Committee on Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. She served also in the Committee of Inquiry for internet and the digital society. On 2 March 2010, the SPD parliamentary group appointed her commissioner of the group for integration.[1]
Özoğuz was re-elected in the 2013 election, gaining the constituency of Hamburg Wandsbek. She is one of the eleven politicians of Turkish descent who won a seat in the Bundestag, including seven women.[3]
Since 2018, Özoğuz has been a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and on the Committee on Human Rights and Humantarian Aid.
Federal Commissioner for Immigration, Refugees and Integration, 2013–2018 [ edit ]
On 16 December 2013, Özoğuz was appointed Commissioner for Immigration, Refugees and Integration (German: Beauftragter der Bundesregierung für Migration, Flüchtlinge und Integration) in the third Merkel cabinet, succeeding Maria Böhmer (CDU). She was the first ever woman with Turkish roots and Muslim member of the German Federal Government as Minister of State.[4][5][6]
In April 2015, Özoğuz accompanied German President Joachim Gauck on a state visit to Turkey. In September 2015, amid the European migrant crisis, she joined Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel on a trip to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing from Syrian civil war which erupted in 2011.[7]
In May 2017, Özoğuz wrote a guest commentary in the newspaper Tagesspiegel in which she stated that a specific German culture "aside from the language is simply not identifiable", as "already historically, rather regional cultures, immigration and diversity have shaped our history". She added that "Globalisation and pluralisation of lifeworlds leads to a further diversification of diversity."[8]

In August 2012, Özoğuz was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy Riot. “Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are draconian and disproportionate,” the lawmakers said in the letter. “In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts – even if they can be seen as provocative – must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.”[9][10]

Anyone who has spent time in the tropics knows that the diversity of species found there is astounding and the abundance and diversity of ants, in particular, is unparalleled. Scientists have grappled for centuries to understand why the tropics are home to more species of all kinds than the cooler temperate latitudes on both sides of the equator. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the higher species numbers in the tropics, but these hypotheses have never been tested for the ants, which are one of the most ecologically and numerically dominant groups of animals on the planet.
New research by evolutionary biologists Dr. Corrie Moreau of Chicago's Field Museum and Dr. Charles Bell of the University of New Orleans is helping answer these questions. Their findings are presented this week in the journal Evolution.
The scientists used DNA sequence data to build the largest ant tree-of-life to date. This tree-of-life, or family tree of ants, not only allowed them to better understand which ant species are related, but also made it possible to infer the age for modern ants because information from the fossil record in the form of geologic time was included in the research.
This ant tree-of-life confirmed an earlier surprising finding that two groups of pale, eyeless, subterranean ants, which are unlike most typical ants, are the earliest living ancestors of the modern ants. The time calibrated ant tree-of-life showed that the ants found on the planet today can trace their evolutionary origins back to between 139 and158 million years ago -- during the time the dinosaurs walked the Earth (a finding in line with previous studies).
But why are there more species of ants in the tropics? To explain this pattern of higher species diversity for many tropical organisms, biologists have used the analogies of the tropics acting as a "museum" or "cradle" for speciation. In the case of the museum analogy, the tropical climates have more species because this is where the oldest groups persist throughout evolutionary time. The converse of this explanation is that the tropics are a cradle where new species are more likely to be generated.
To better understand where on the planet the ants arose and if any single geographic area was more important for their evolutionary origins, Moreau and Bell reconstructed the biogeographic history of the ants. These analyses found that the Neotropics of South America were vital to the deep and continued evolutionary origin of the ants. This finding suggests that for the ants the rainforests of the Neotropics are both a museum, protecting many of the oldest ant groups, and also a cradle that continues to generate new species.
As ants are one of the most ecologically important groups of terrestrial organisms, these findings suggest that protecting the rainforests of the Neotropics are vital to the health and success of both the ants that live in them and all the other animals, plants, fungi, and microbes worldwide that rely on ants to survive.
When Deyquawn Cooper wasn't coaching track at Carver Vocational Technical High School or pedaling around the city as a bike messenger, he was usually with his two cousins, Shaquilla Boykins and Saiquan White.
Cooper, 21, fell right between the other two in age — Boykins is 25, White 18. They lived across the street from one another on a West Baltimore block where several other members of their family also live, and were extremely close, said Luther Jones, 63, who is Boykins' and White's grandfather and Cooper's great-uncle.
"They were like brothers and sister, that's how close they were," Jones said. "That's how tight of a family we are."
Now, however, the family is struggling to cope with a new reality, one they say was the result of a terrible accident. Last week, Cooper was fatally shot, and Boykins and White, who are siblings, were charged Thursday in his killing — Boykins with second-degree murder and felony use of a handgun, and White with possessing a gun and accessory after the fact in Cooper's death.
"Both situations are tough," William Cooper, Deyquawn's father, said of his son's death and Boykins' and White's arrests. "The whole thing could have been prevented."
Deyquawn had a good head on his shoulders, working four jobs and always helping others with whatever they needed, his father said.

He said he never thought his son would end up on Baltimore's rapidly growing list of homicide victims. Neither did others who knew him.
"He's just one of those good kids: hard-working, never in trouble, positive role model," Carver Principal Shionta Somerville said.
Somerville recruited Cooper to be the girls track coach late last year after he stopped in to visit his father, a culinary arts teacher at the school. She recognized the young man from her days as an assistant principal at Edmondson-Westside High School, from which Cooper graduated.
"You probably don't get much better than him," she said.
The family lived in proximity to one another in the 1800 block of Penrose Ave., in the city's Franklin Square neighborhood.
According to charging documents, police responded to Boykins and White's home about 9:52 p.m. last Wednesday for a report of a shooting. They found Cooper inside with a gunshot wound. He was taken to the Maryland Shock Trauma Center, where he was pronounced dead about 2:30 a.m. He was the city's 250th homicide victim this year.
Detectives took Boykins and White to the homicide unit for questioning, where they waived their rights to remain silent and agreed to discuss what happened. But their accounts changed over the course of the interview, the documents say. And neither would say what happened to the gun.
According to charging documents, the three were hanging out together and drinking alcohol when Boykins went upstairs to the bathroom. When she came downstairs, she "recognized that there was a handgun seated on the dining room table" of the home.
"Ms. Boykins picked up the handgun and proceeded to walk into the kitchen where Mr. White and Cooper were; with the handgun in her hand," the documents read. "Ms. Boykins advised she was going to inquire into why the gun was on the dining room table or in the house at all when the handgun discharged while it was still in her hand."
According to the documents, Boykins immediately dropped the gun to the floor. White tried to lift Cooper to put him in a vehicle and take him to the hospital, but he was too heavy.
White, the documents say, eventually admitted the gun was his, but initially provided "numerous inaccurate accounts," including that an unknown person had kicked in the back door of the home and shot Cooper — which police described as "an effort to mislead the investigation away from his sister" and himself.
Boykins and White "admitted to being the only people in the house" besides Cooper at the time of the shooting, the documents say, but both denied "knowing where the unidentified handgun was moved after the shooting." Police said those statements "suggest that both Mr. White and Ms. Boykins were working together to withhold or hide material evidence."
The medical examiner determined Cooper's death was a homicide, and Boykins and White were arrested. Police and prosecutors said the charges were based on the evidence of the case. They would not say whether the charges would have been different if Boykins and White had cooperated fully.
"As in all cases, prosecutors rely on the facts presented to them to determine the charges," Rochelle Ritchie, a spokeswoman for Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby, said in a statement. "If the pending investigation reveals additional information, it is always considered in what charges we proceed upon."
Neither Boykins nor White had an attorney listed in online court records, and neither has an adult criminal history in Maryland, according to online records. A preliminary court hearing for both is scheduled on Oct. 28.
Jones, who has lived on Penrose Avenue all his life, said he wishes police and prosecutors would view the incident as an accident for the family to sort out.
"When it happened, everyone was distraught as to how it happened and why it happened," he said. "Everybody feels as though it was an accident. They just want someone to tell the truth."
Cooper's father said he just wants police and prosecutors to "follow the proper protocol."
Somerville said that when she first heard that Cooper had died, she thought it had to be the result of an illness. "I know that sounds silly, but for a kid like that, you just don't connect it to any type of violence," she said.
When she recruited Cooper to coach the school's track team late last year, he was only 20, meaning he couldn't be a paid staff member. Still, he volunteered until his 21st birthday in February, even coming in on his off days to check on the squad, she said.
"When the girls were frustrating him, he would come to me and say, 'Ms. Somerville, these girls just don't want to work today,'" Somerville said, laughing at the memory of his commitment. "He was really patient with them."
The girls loved him in return, Somerville said, and took the news of his death "really hard," requiring her to call in a crisis team to help them deal with their emotions.
Since his death, there has been an outpouring of support for him on social media and at Carver, his father said. There was also a vigil in his memory on Tuesday night.
"He touched a lot of people," he said, "and he was only here for such a small time."

Maybe you're delivering a presentation to a huge audience. Maybe you're taking an online test. Maybe you just need to get some work done on a tight deadline.
Windows doesn't care.
Windows will take control of your computer, force-feed it updates and flip the reset switch automatically -- and there's not a damn thing you can do about it, once it gets started.
If you haven't saved your work, it's gone. Your browser tabs are toast. And don't expect to use your computer again soon; depending on the speed of your drive and the size of the update, it could be anywhere from 10 minutes to well over an hour before your PC is ready for work.
As far as I'm concerned, it's the single worst thing about Windows. It's only gotten worse in Windows 10. And when I poked around Microsoft, the overarching message I received was that Microsoft has no interest in fixing it.
Editors' note, March 3, 2017: Microsoft heard us, loud and clear. The company's completely changing this behavior in the Windows 10 Creators Update, coming this spring, so that you can "snooze" a restart indefinitely.
How Windows Update sabotaged me at work -- more than once
It felt like karma.
On September 1, 2010, I sat within speaking distance of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, ready to help live-blog his every word. But my Windows laptop -- a Windows laptop in a sea of MacBooks! -- wasn't quite working properly. I figured it just needed a quick reboot, so that's what I did.
But because Windows had recently downloaded some updates, my computer decided it would be a good time to install all of them. So I spent the next 15 to 20 minutes internally screaming at my PC while Steve Jobs presented the new iPod Touch.
(Yes, it would have been slightly funnier if Jobs had announced new MacBooks.)
It was the first of three occasions that a forced Windows update would totally destroy my workflow at a critical moment -- once crippling my computer when I had a hot scoop to share with the world.
Then, Windows 10 came along to add insult to injury.
Imagine this: With no warning, a prompt pops up on your screen telling you that your Windows 10 laptop is about to restart. Even though you know you're about to lose access to your computer, there's not a damn thing you can do about it -- the buttons are all grayed out. If you're really unlucky and Windows is installing a major update, the progress meter may be a tease: Once it reaches 100 percent, your computer might reboot a second or third time before you finally get control again.
I've personally seen this -- or something similar --happen five times over the past year.
And it turns out lots of people have stories just like mine.
Worldwide Windows tales of woe
There's software developer Dylan Beattie, whose laptop decided to shut down while he was giving a talk in front of 200-odd developers in Malmo, Sweden, and found he had to wing the rest of the presentation without his slides. "I wasn't terribly happy," recalls Beattie, adding that he now has a habit of explicitly running Windows Update a few hours before his presentations "just to make sure it's not going to spring any surprises."
Alex Gibson, a 3D printing consultant, says he no longer trusts Windows to manage his 3D printer after his computer forced a restart near the end of a 6-hour-long print job for a customer in November. He tells me he's switching to a Raspberry Pi.
Lydricsama, a digital artist from Finland, says she lost hours of work on a commissioned piece she was working on late into the night, leaving her with a bare sketch (instead of a mostly lined and colored illustration) after her machine forced an update back in October. She tells me that while it was her fault for not saving the document more often, Windows also didn't help: "I had no prior warning before it restarted itself." Luckily, her client didn't mind the delay.
Mark Switzer, who goes by the handle Preheat when he plays World of Warcraft, also had his machine restart at a particularly inconvenient time last month. He was in the middle of beating the game's final boss in front of a live Twitch audience. He says he lost most of his viewers that day, a little bit of money (he's an official Twitch partner), and his in-game reward for beating the boss. "Overall it wasn't a huge deal, just very frustrating to have your computer decide these things on its own," he tells me.
Alexsander Stukov, an software engineer who spends days running stress tests and cloning virtual machines, says he's lost hours of work to forced Windows Updates on five separate occasions now. "Windows Update is a terrible piece of software," he tells me, but says he has no other choice: "Our customers use it, and we have to test our software on the same environment."
Then there's Alexandria Seabrook, who says she couldn't complete the online test for a college course this October because of Windows 10 updates -- and whose professor wasn't quite as forgiving as Gibson's and Lyricsama's customers. Busy with midterms, she waited until nearly the last minute before flipping open her Windows 10 computer -- only to watch Windows Update take control of her machine until well after the deadline had passed.
"It was only 20 questions. I could have finished the test on time if it wasn't for the Windows Update," she tells me. She got a 58 on the midterm, and was barely able to bring it up to a C by the end of the semester. "I don't like [Windows], but I'm a college student," she says. "I'm stuck with this laptop literally until it breaks down because I have no money."
When I ask my fellow CNET staffers, many of them chime in with stories, too: how Windows decided to reboot in the middle of a liveblog, or an expense report, or while taking notes in the middle of an interview -- or in the airport, right before boarding a plane, without enough power left to actually finish the installation. Once, Windows 8 even force-updated CNET editor Stephen Shankland's machine when he was in the middle of a Skype interview with NPR.
Microsoft's response
I know what you're thinking: "How many times do you have to get burned before you get a Mac?" Or maybe a Chromebook. Or even an iPad with a keyboard cover -- anything but a Windows machine that can just spontaneously restart while you're in the middle of mission-critical work.
That's pretty much the direction I've been leaning in recent months. And after hinting there might be a MacBook purchase in my immediate future, I asked a Microsoft spokesperson if the company was doing anything about forced updates.
Here's the statement I got:
Once a machine is upgraded to Windows 10, it will remain current through Windows Update for the supported lifetime of the device, with safety and security, productivity, and entertainment value over time. This is what we mean when we talk about delivering Windows as a service, and it is one of our core inspirations for Windows 10. We'll keep listening to our customers, improving the experience month after month. Windows 10 is an operating system that will run on a range of devices -- from Xbox to PCs, phones to tablets and tiny gadgets -- all of which are connected and kept up-to-date by Windows Update. Both enterprises and consumers benefit. The optimum way to ensure our customers are running the best Windows is to get them the latest updates for Windows 10. Delivering Windows 10 as a service means we can offer ongoing security updates, new features and capabilities - we'd like to make sure people can get access to the latest Windows 10 updates as soon as they are available.
In other words, Microsoft thinks it's super important that you get the updates. "Auto-restarts" are a feature, not a bug.
In fact, Microsoft has been actively getting rid of ways to keep users from disabling automatic updates: in Windows 10 Pro and above, you used to be able to do that from the Group Policy tool. As of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, though, that option is gone. (You can still schedule a restart, but it involves doing a lot of work to change the annoying "ready or not, here it comes" default.)
And while the next version of Windows will let you stave off updates for a 35-day period (if you paid extra for a Pro, Enterprise or Education-grade copy of Windows, which sounds like a moderate form of blackmail), my understanding is that even those versions won't let you cancel an update that's already been delayed and is now about to occur.
In other words: you'll be helplessly watching your computer turn itself off, just the same as usual.
Spontaneous Windows Updates are basically free ads for Apple
Don't get me wrong: I appreciate that these updates can help keep my PC secure. It's a heck of a lot better to have Microsoft patching holes in my computer's software instead of having to deal with damage after the fact with third-party antivirus software. (Particularly because the likes of Symantec and McAfee tend to bog down computers.)
And I'm not an anti-vaxxer: I understand that by patching my PC, I'm helping to keep it from spreading malware to other computers, too.
But I think the company has overcorrected with these forced updates. We should be able to decide when to get our vaccines -- not have the doctor walk into our house, grab us by the hair and shove the medicine down our throats.
I think it's time we send Microsoft a message that this isn't okay -- that the computers we bought and paid for with our hard-earned dollars are ours to use whenever we want, not just when Microsoft says so. I need a reliable PC, a computer that's ready for action whenever I need to report on a story, jot down notes from an interview, or liveblog a keynote. Share this story if you feel the same.
There's got to be a better way of handling these updates. Perhaps by automatically installing them when a PC and its owner are both asleep? That's what college freshman Alexandria Seabrook suggested, right after she told me how furious she was with her Windows machine. Or maybe Microsoft could take a page out of the Apple and Android playbooks and let users decide when to update.
I generally like Windows. But if I can't find a Windows PC that's always ready for work, my next computer will be a Mac.
(If you've been victim of a particularly nasty Windows Update, write to me at sean.hollister@cbsinteractive.com. I'll be compiling the best stories for a future article.)
Editor's note: This is a guest post from Ty Karnitz.
Gentleman readers, this is a call to action. Throughout history, men have used sports to test themselves against one another, and it is time we revive a noble sport which builds courage, willpower, and mental fortitude. It is time for ferret-legging's renaissance.
What is ferret-legging?
What is ferret-legging you ask? A sad question — it proves just how forgotten this sport has become. The game is simple and eloquent. Contestants take live ferrets and shove them down their pants. The winner is whoever can stand the ferrets' teeth and claws the longest.
There are, of course, a few additional rules to make the contest fair. The pants must be tied at the ankle so the ferret cannot escape and the pants must be roomy enough for the ferret to move from ankle to ankle freely. The ferret must have all 34 teeth and all their claws. Neither the ferret nor the contestant can be drugged in any way. Save the drinking for afterward, gentlemen. Finally, it should go without saying that no underwear is allowed.
Once the ferret is inside and the pants belted tight, the game begins. The current record for ferret-legging, or “put 'em down” as the pros call it, stands at about 5 hours and 30 minutes. A daunting time at first glance, but don't despair. With practice and patience you too could be a king of the ferret-legging world.
Okay, where did this come from?
Ferret-legging has a rich history. While primarily pets today, ferrets have been domesticated for at least 2,500 years and were once used as hunting animals. Hunters would send muzzled ferrets into the burrows of rabbits and moles to scare them out. During the Middle Ages, ferreting became illegal unless you were very wealthy, and that is how the sport was born.
Poor hunters and poachers were forced to smuggle their ferrets past game wardens. They did this by putting them down their pants. It's unclear when shoving ferrets down your trousers became a sport instead of a necessity, and we don't know the exact location it became a contest, either. Some claim Scotland, others England. We do know it began in the United Kingdom and became very popular among Yorkshire miners in the 1970s. It's there that ferret-legging hall-of-famer Reg Mellor took up the sport. When Mellor began, the record for ferret legging was a measly 60 seconds. Mr. Mellor was able to reach 5 hours and 26 minutes. And while his record has since been broken, ferret-legging aficionados know the sport wouldn't be the same without his contributions.
Sadly, since the 1970s ferret-legging has died off. But it is not dead yet. In Richmond, Virginia a national ferret-legging event was held from 2003-2009. Occasionally the sport can still be seen as a stunt at charity events to raise funds, and rarer still some Highland games hold competitions.
To help this sport reclaim its former prominence, you can contact your local Highland games society and request they include ferret-legging as part of their festivities.
Why should I ferret leg?
Ferret-legging has many benefits for the modern man. Competition between men raises testosterone, and we all know of the many benefits of this manliest hormone. Ferret-legging also helps a man develop his ability to thrive in high pressure situations and harness his willpower. Because when that ferret first gets its teeth into you, you're going to want to quit. With every second you fight the pain, your willpower increases.
Ferret-legging is truly two manly hobbies in one. Because once you're done ferret-legging, you can train your ferret to actually ferret and go hunt rabbits. While it may not be as prestigious to hunt rabbits with ferrets instead of falcons, the licensing for owning and keeping birds of prey in the United States can make this unpractical for the average man. Ferrets, on the other hand, are readily available in pet stores. Please remember purchasing a ferret is a big commitment and you should do your research. It's never okay to purchase an animal without accepting complete responsibility for its well-being. This doesn't just include ferret-proofing your home but making sure you have all the necessary supplies to keep your little weasel healthy.
Finally, ferret-legging is also a good conversation starter. When women hear you're into ferret-legging, they're naturally going to want to learn more about a man who would do such a thing. So the sport can help you stop hanging out with women and start dating them.
You may be asking, “What if I've spoken with my wife/girlfriend and she's not keen on me taking up my new hobby?”
Gentlemen, we must remember that sometimes we cannot live for the approval of women. Sometimes we must step out on our own and lead our own fulfilling lives. Explain to her that “hobbies can bring you joy, increase your eye for detail, keep your mind sharp, expand your creativity, and help you meet friends and learn valuable skills. They add interest to your life and help you become a more well-rounded man.”
If you find your woman is still doubtful about your new hobby, consider inviting her along. While ferret-legging is traditionally a male-only sport, there is a female version. Ferret-busting — in which ladies drop ferrets into their blouses — is a perfect way to get your girl involved. A perfect date night for the both of you, and the ferrets.
This month, astronomers have been observing a large asteroid approaching the Earth-moon system. Near-Earth asteroid 163899 – also known as 2003 SD220 – will come closest to Earth on Christmas Eve (December 24, 2015). At that time, it'll be about 28 times the distance to Earth's moon; in other words, it's not coming particularly close. Don't believe any media suggesting that this space rock may cause earthquakes. Those assertions are misleading and incorrect. Even if 2003 SD220 were passing closer, it's doubtful earthquakes would result. There's no scientific evidence that an asteroid's flyby can cause seismic activity, unless the asteroid collides with Earth. In this case, that clearly will not happen.
Asteroid 2003 SD220 the closest pass on December 24 will occur at around 8:08 am ET (13:08 UTC). Translate to your time zone here.
This asteroid isn't a newly discovered object. Its name – 2003 SD220 – indicates its discovery year. The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search (LONEOS) program in Flagstaff, Arizona discovered the asteroid on September 29, 2003.
Scientists have been watching this asteroid this month because they knew about its Christmas Eve closest approach well in advance. Thus the asteroid was included in observing schedules for various observatories. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Goldstone Solar System Radar and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Green Bank Telescope and Very Long Baseline Array conducted observations of 2003 SD220, as did the NASA-funded planetary radar system at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
A notable feature of this asteroid is its elongated shape and large size. Astronomer Edgar Rivera-Valentin from Arecibo Observatory – the largest and most sensitive single dish radio telescope in the world – told EarthSky:
We were able to observe this asteroid (with radar) for more days from Arecibo and we still estimate SD220 is about 1.25 miles (2 km) long.
Radar images obtained from Arecibo show some details including small craters on the irregularly shaped space rock.
The asteroid is now also known to rotate very slowly, taking more than 11 days to complete one full rotation.
Patrick Taylor, Group Lead for USRA for Planetary Radar at Arecibo Observatory, said:
Because it comes close to Earth, it is of interest to NASA as a possible future robotic or human mission target.
Data from all of the various observations are used to determine the asteroid's shape, rotation, and surface properties as well as allow for refinement of the asteroid's orbit, which can be used to better assess its future impact hazard. A December 23 statement from Arecibo pointed out:
This year's close approach is the first of five predicted encounters between Earth and 2003 SD220 in the next 12 years. High-precision measurements now will help better prepare for future passes.
At the 2015 pass – at its closest – asteroid 2003 SD220 will be some 6,787,600 miles (11 million km) from our planet's surface. That's more than 28 times the Earth-moon distance. It's so far away that only professional and advanced amateur astronomers are likely to capture optical images of this space rock.
That is unlike some other asteroids such as 2015 TB145 (the Halloween asteroid) and 2004 BL86 (January, 2015). Those asteroids were visible using 8″ telescopes.
The Christmas Eve asteroid will be much more difficult to see because of its distance.
This space rock – whose shape can be compared to a chicken tender – will make its approach to Earth on December 24, 2015 but will return again next in 2018.
NASA has verified that the space rock will not pass at any dangerous distance during the next two centuries.
By the way, asteroid 2003 SD220 is not the only big asteroid passing by Earth on this month. Asteroid 2008 CM, a space rock with a diameter of 1.5 km, will safely pass our planet on December 29 at more than 22 times the Earth-moon distance.
Bottom line: Asteroid 163899 – aka 2003 SD220 – will pass safely, at more than 28 times the Earth-moon distance, on December 24, 2015. This Christmas Eve asteroid will pass too far away to be visible in small amateur telescopes. Media reports suggesting that this space rock may cause earthquakes are misleading and incorrect.
Labour's candidate for the Oldham West and Royton by-election will be selected next Thursday, November 5th. LabourList understands that the by-election will be held on Thursday, December 3rd.
Applications to be the candidate need to be in by noon tomorrow (Friday, October 30th), and the NEC will draw up the longlist by the end of the day.
On Monday (November 2nd) an NEC three-person panel, consisting of Ellie Reeves, Jennie Formby and Keith Vaz, will interview the longlist and draw up a shortlist. Oldham West and Royton Constituency Labour Party (CLP) will then hold a selection meeting three days later, on November 5th.
Labour also plan to move the by-election writ on Monday, after consultation with the family of the recently deceased Michael Meacher, and the by-election will be held on December 3rd.
BRUSSELS — The European Union's agriculture commissioner said Wednesday that he planned to double the amount of money available for promoting the sale of farm goods, in an effort to counteract the effects of a boycott by Russia, an important export market for European producers.
Dacian Ciolos, the European commissioner for agriculture and rural development, said the plan could make a total of 120 million euros, or roughly $157 million, in public funds available for marketing — €60 million from Brussels, up from €30 million, and another €60 million from national farming organizations that are obliged to match European funding for such promotion.
“I strongly encourage agricultural organizations to make the most of this opportunity and to present ambitious promotion schemes in the coming weeks,” Mr. Ciolos said, adding that the goal was to “facilitate trying to find new destinations, new outlets, new markets for our products.”
The Russian government announced its boycott in August after Europe imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. The Russian action was aimed at broad swathes of the European dairy, meat, fruit and vegetable sectors.
As I learned in detail at the recent Keele conference, Antony Lempert of the Secular Medical Forum (SMF) has been instrumental in some exciting developments that have taken place over the past year or so involving intactivism, human rights, and the United Nations. Antony kindly provided ARC with a brief report on these activities, which I adapted for this message. Antony has also graciously agreed to expand in detail on this heartening news in the next issue of the ARC Newsletter.
To provide some historical perspective, in August 2001, working under the much appreciated auspices of the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC), ARC organized a team that travelled to Geneva and for the first time, placed male circumcision in official UN records as a central human rights concern (http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=7400, first link).
Last year, the SMF and cooperating organizations picked up the baton. On September 17, 2012, during the 21st session of the UN Human Rights Council, a statement about the harms of ritual circumcision was read out in the chamber by a representative of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU). The IHEU statement relied heavily on information from the SMF and the UK National Secular Society (NSS). On October 4, 2012, Antony, Keith Porteous-Wood of the UK-based National Secular Society (www.secularism.org.uk) and Roy Brown of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (www.iheu.org) accepted an invitation to meet for an hour in Geneva with the chair and vice-chair of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) to discuss ritual male circumcision. In a later informal meeting, they met with the Norwegian representative of the UNCRC, Ms Kirsten Sandberg, who has since assumed the chair of the committee.
During each of three annual sessions, the UNCRC examines the compliance of 4-5 signatory nations to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRoC). Accordingly, each UNCRoC signatory nation is scrutinized for UNCRoC compliance on a rolling five year program. The UNCRC welcomes relevant, short submissions from all sources to inform their deliberations. Israel was reviewed by the UNCRC in May/June 2013. Reports had been submitted by the SMF, and by the Israeli organisation Ben Shalem. The UNCRC report on Israel, published July 4, 2013 (http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-ISR-CO-2-4.pdf, paragraphs 41 and 42), included non-therapeutic circumcision under the heading "harmful practices'"and recommended that Israel monitor the short and long-term complications of the procedure.
Another sign I was pleased to observe of the increasing openness of human rights organizations to intactivist views is the discussion of male circumcision in the 2012 report from the International NGO Council on Violence Against Children titled, “Violating Children's Rights: Harmful practices based on tradition, culture, religion, or superstition.” (https://www.crin.org/docs/InCo_Report_15Oct.pdf) . Here are some extracts from page 22 of the report (citations omitted):
Until recently, male circumcision has generally been challenged only when carried out by non-medical personal [sic] in unhygienic settings without pain relief. But a children's rights analysis suggests that non-consensual, non-therapeutic circumcision of boys, whatever the circumstances, constitutes a gross violation of their rights, including the right to physical integrity, to freedom of thought and religion and to protection from physical and mental violence. When extreme complications arise, it may violate the right to life. It is reported that male circumcision can result in numerous physical, psychological, and sexual health problems during the surgery, afterwards, and throughout adulthood, including haemorrhage, panic attacks, erectile dysfunction, infection (in severe forms leading to partial or complete loss of the penis), urinary infections, necrosis, permanent injury or loss of the glans, excessive penile skin loss, external deformity, and in some cases even death. The WHO review quoted three randomized controlled trials suggesting that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection in males. But this potential health benefit does not over-ride a child's right to give informed consent to the practice. The decision to undertake circumcision for these reasons can be deferred to a time where the risk is relevant and the child is old enough to choose and consent for himself.
These are heady times. A thank you from the bottom of my heart to the countless people, known and unknown, who have worked so hard to help bring into reality these recent events.

Attorneys for the Rights of the Child
When I was 7 years old, I had stereotypes about Africa. They were primarily based on two things: the poor, starving children on TV and my colouring books with pictures of safari animals. As a result, in my little world Africa was hungry and dangerous. One day my parents announced that we were moving to Ethiopia. They assured me that we were going to be fine and see lots of exciting things, but I remained skeptical.
We landed in Addis Ababa at night, and were driven to the house we would stay in while we looked for our own. We passed a fruit stand that was closing for the day, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I didn't like fruit, but at least I could find my way back to this spot if something happened to my parents and I was left without food. I memorized the route as a precaution. “Good thing I'm on top of this” I thought with a renewed determination to survive.
Turns out Ethiopia was not what my childlike stereotypes had predicted. Yes, there was poverty. Plenty of it. But there was also much life. It was full of bright colours and delicious food and cool people and interesting animals and adventure. All seen through the eyes of a child.
At the end of grade 6, our family left Ethiopia and got settled in Canada. Oddly enough, during my junior high and high school years I developed a new set of stereotypes for Africa. I romanticized it. People around me who had gone on short term trips claimed that Africans were not like North Americans. They were generous and forgiving and selfless and hospitable and kind. They were content with little. I fondly remembered many people I had met in Ethiopia and agreed. I couldn't wait to return.
And once again my stereotypes were challenged. In high school and university I returned to the great continent, to volunteer in South Africa and Namibia. I had my clothes stolen from my backyard, I learned about the Rwandan genocide, I had the outside walls of my house plastered with pages of porn in the middle of the night, I was gawked at and disrespected by men, and my housemate was threatened with a gun. And I noticed something else; something that made me more uncomfortable than anything else:
Many Africans, just the rest of us, were not content with making a living, they wanted to make a killing.
Individuals, companies, and even some churches wanted to learn about get-rich-quick schemes. For the first time I saw Africa and the world through the eyes on an adult. It made me sad to realize that my romantic view was just as inaccurate as my childhood stereotypes had been.
In my travels around the world since then, I have realized that there is a common language of greed that is spoken with fluency by our families, communities, institutions, governments, and businesses. It cunningly masquerades under nomers like “The American Dream” and we market it, sell it, celebrate it, worship it, honour it, export it, and pledge allegiance to it. Success is measured by climbing the ladder, making good money, and being comfortable. Greed, in effect, has become an idol.
Recently at church, my pastor Jeff Strong shared a powerful truth he had come across while watching a presentation by author Andy Crouch. He explained that at the beginning, idols promise everything and demand nothing in return. For example, money initially delivers fun and adventure and comfort and security and happiness, but soon the pursuit of money demands more and more, while offering less and less. Eventually we reach a point in which we are giving everything to its pursuit and receiving nothing in return. We have money in the bank and a hot car in the driveway, but it has come at a high cost. We are stressed and discontent, and often it is our families and relationships that are ultimately sacrificed.
A friend recently sent me this clip, which has gone viral in recent weeks:

This is where greed leads us, as a society. The spin-off effect is that people at the bottom are put in desperate circumstances. Many of us secretly don't want the system to change, just in case we are the ones who end up at the top some day. But a system that thrives on such extreme inequality is what creates a perfect storm for all kinds of social issues like increased gang violence, teen pregnancies, prostitution, and homelessness.
Before you write this off as a rant against corporate greed, I would encourage you to look at your own life. As Andy Stanley once said, “direction, not intention, determines our destination.” Your intent to empower others means nothing if you don't have a direction or a plan to reach your destination. So here are some ideas that my husband and I have been mulling over in order to fight against the idol of greed:
1. Set an income ceiling for yourself. Our lifestyle always inflates when our income increases. Determine the amount you need, and whatever you make above and beyond that, give away. This could even make a pay raise more exciting because it creates a bigger giving slush fund!
2. Inch up your giving by percentage points. Start giving, and increase the percentage each year.
3. Support local businesses. Multinational corporations siphon money out of local communities, leaving less opportunities for people to start their own businesses or have meaningful employment. The lack of corporate accountability and regulation leads to the inequality we see in this video. If you support local entrepreneurs, you are offering someone a chance to make a living doing something they are passionate about while keeping the money in your community.
4. Pay your workers a living wage and source your products ethically. This will require research and sacrifice on the part of the employer, and make sure to visit the factories where your products are made and listen to the stories of those making them.
5. Get to know people who are on the margins. The homeless. The prostituted. The poor. The vulnerable. Personal relationships can motivate unlike anything else.
We should all learn to promote equality. After all, what does it mean to us to actually love our neighbour as ourselves?
This will take some sacrifice, some discomfort, some risk, but I believe that the process will build our faith and change the world. So, let's stop exporting and celebrating an American Dream that is built on the backs of the poor, and cast off the idol of greed that entangles us.

This is Not the Greatest Quarterback in the World. This is Just a Tribute.
I've got a confession to make: I'm a Taylor Martinez fan. I celebrate the guy's entire catalog. And because Friday is his Senior Day, I thought it fitting to send him off the right way. And after that, I have some thoughts on our mercurial field general. But first, a tribute to the crazy diamond:
Taylor Martinez: Legend from Tunnel Walk of Shame on Vimeo.
Taylor Martinez is a Certified Ridiculous Human Being. Just think about this. Remember the 2010 season opener, and the salacious rumor that Bo Pelini might start an unheralded freshman burner at quarterback? It turned out to be true, and all Martinez did was gash defenses left and right and left again - including Kansas State, whose fans used their “power towels” to wipe away their salty tears. Anyone who makes Kansas State sad is a friend of mine. I liked Taylor from the start. We all did, if you remember. We dreamt of Heismans, conference titles, maybe even a national run. Finally, we had the right set of wheels. We had a chance. In 6 weeks we went from not knowing who Taylor was to putting the weight of 1995 on him.
Like so many things in the Bo Pelini era, nothing really went as planned. Ankle injuries, throwing motions, turnovers, “turf toe.” Breathtaking highs, baffling lows and ridiculous interviews. But Pelini-era disappointments usually carry a silver lining, and this is no exception.
Four years ago, a California kid that nobody wanted as their quarterback came to play football in the middle of nowhere. He arrived at the end of 10 years of dormancy. And no, he didn't lead us to the promised land. But he showed us what it looked like. He won games, broke records, made us bite our nails and brought us to our feet. He made us wonder how high we could go. Every year, the BCS seemed like a possibility. And for a fan base so disillusioned by a decade of mediocrity, that's worth something.
We watched him bounce right up from 99% of the bone-crushing hits laid on him. We also watched him bounce back from all the negativity, the heckling, the questions and the scrutiny. And then, to top it off, he called his little brother and said, “You're gonna love this place.” And also, probably, “Yes, they have a laser tag arena and I got you a season pass."
Getting up after getting hit makes you a football player. What Taylor did makes you a Husker.
Look, I'm not here to make some grand philosophical statement about what Taylor embodies in all of us, or what he symbolizes to the program. That's silly. I just love football. And the Huskers are my favorite team. And you know what I learned about Taylor Martinez in four years? He loves football, too. And this is his favorite team. And he had every reason to abandon both of those things, and didn't. Maybe that is something to learn from. Something to remember next time the sky appears to be falling.
If nothing else, it's a good reason to cheer like hell on Friday when they call his name. I know I will. He's earned it.
Thanks for four great years, fuckwad. Good luck out there.
Although long recognized in the Soviet Union and later Russia as a great poet continuing in the tradition of Osip Mandelstam, Arseny Tarkovsky — father to renowned film director Andrei — has been little known to Western readers, and almost entirely unknown in English. The close friend to early 20th century Soviet greats such as Marina Tsvetaeva (who sought out a romantic relationship with Tarkovsky before committing suicide), Anna Akhmatova, and numerous others, few Americans might have imagined that Tarkovsky, as Akhmatova described him, was perceived by many as the one “real poet” in the Soviet Union:
[…]of all contemporary poets Tarkovsky alone is completely
his own self, completely independent. He possesses the most
important feature of a poet, which I'd call the birthright.
There are numerous reasons for the oversight. Although recognized as a war hero for his actions in World War II as a correspondent for the Soviet Army publication Battle Alarm, during which time he was seriously wounded, his leg eventually sacrificed to gangrene, Tarkovsky came of age after Central Committee secretary Andrei Zhdanov's ideological attack on the works of Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko, and, accordingly, Tarkovsky's own 1946 book, although accepted for publication, was withdrawn. It was not until 1962 that the poet was able to publish his first volume, Before the Snow, when he was 55 years of age. Although his work did gain some fame in the West through his son's films Mirror (1974) and Stalker (1979), which included quotations from a few of his poems, his writing is nearly impossible to convey into English, based as it is on the long Russian traditions of end rhyme and meter. Tarkovsky died in 1989, just prior to the fall of the Soviet Union.
Finally, in Philip Metres and Dimitri Psurtsev's I Burned at the Feast: Selected Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky we get a fair idea of what Tarkovsky's work might sound like in Russian. If the poetry that results sometimes seems to lack the excitement of other major Russian poets of the day, the translators are certainly to be commended for their brave attempts to render a completely “other” poetic tradition into a language that makes sense to the American ear.
Indeed, one of the most important aspects of this book is just how much it reveals the difficulties any translator faces. The afterword by Philip Metres, presented as 25 Propositions about the process of translating, is worth the price of the book.
Rather than presenting these concerns as an academic exercise, Metres, often with humor and always with intelligence, outlines some of the basic impossibilities of translating an “authentic” poetry. The fact that Tarkovsky was a noted translator of numerous languages into Russian who well knew of the translator's difficulties may have provided Metres and Psurtsev a tacit feeling of support. Metre quotes from Tarkovsky's poem “Translator”
For what did I spend
My best years on foreign words?
O, Eastern translations,
How you hurt my head.
“Of course,” notes Metres, Tarknovsky “wrote nothing of the kind. He wrote…”—a passage in Cyrillic follows. “Or,” continues the translator, “as an email once encoded it”:
?????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????
Besides the poet's deep reliance on Russian root words and other tropes from Romance languages dating back to Pushkin, Metres notes just a few of what he describes as “Russian poetry's acute and irreducible particularities, the most acute and irreducible its relationship to meter”:
The regularity of Russian conjugations and declensions, the
flexibility of word order in sentence meaning, and the multi-
syllabic nature of Russian words all combine to create a Seed-
ingly endless wellspring of rhymes and metrical possibilities.
In contrast to the poetries of the West, which inhaled modernism's
breath of free verse and only rarely return to the formal rooms of
strict meters, Russian poetry has, until only very recently, been
almost entirely faithful to its high organized and lush meters. In
Tarkovsky's poetry alone, one can find poems not only in iambic,
but also in trochaic, dactylic, anapestic, amphibrachic, not to
mention folksong prosodic patterns, unrhymed metrical poems, and,
yes, even free verse. It's as if, in the United States, our poetry,
metrically speaking, plays its tune within the limits of the pop form,
while in Russian, whole symphonies continue to be produced.
To recognize these and the many other impediments to an easy assimilation of Tarkovsky's work in English, is not to suggest that the translators do not, time and again, find a way to convey the grandeur and beauty of this Russian poet. Many of these poems begin within the confines of a simple metaphor that quickly spirals out into another time and world. The image of a “table set for six,” for example, in the wartime poem beginning with that image, soon moves into a somewhat frightful nostalgic scene:
Like twelve years ago, her hand,
still cold to the touch.
Her silks, blue and old-fashioned,
Still rustle and swish.
By the next stanza the poet takes the simple dinner-time activities of “wine singing” and “crystal ringing” into a dark, haunted song of the past:
How much we loved you, How many winters ago.
Ending the poem in what might at first seem like a snapshot memory of prior events, it is transformed through the presence of a vague female voice (whom, we discover in the footnotes is the now-deceased poet Marina Tsvetaeva) speaking out from the dead:
My father would smile at me,
my brother, pour some wine,
Her ringless hand in mine,
the woman would say: My heels are caked with dirt,
my plaited hair's gone clear,
and our voices now call out
from under the earth.
Indeed, given the fact that Tarkovsky wrote many of these poems during War II, death haunts a number of his earliest works. The inevitability of death is most evident in a poem like “[A German machinegunner will shoot me in the road, or]”:
A German machinegunner will shoot me in the road, or
a detonation bomb will break my legs, or an SS-boy will slam a bullet in my gut—
in any case, on this front, they've got me covered. Without my name, or glory, or even boots—
with frozen eyes, I'll gaze at the snow, blood-colored.
The poem is made even more sardonic by the translator's explanation that during the early days of World War II, when Russian “valenki” boots were in short supply, dead soldiers were often stripped of their footwear, one story telling of hundreds of frozen legs that were sawed off by Russian troops so that they might remove the boots which had frozen to the dead men's feet.
And even in such later poems as the multi-part elegy to Anna Akhmatova, from 1967, Tarkovsky writes about death in a manner that expresses deep grief while yet accepting its inevitability. That poem ends in painful tolling out of the words “all night,” reiterating the endlessness of death when faced by the living:
All night we promised
you immortality, all night
we longed for you
to take us from the house of grief—
all night, all night, all night,
as it was in the beginning.
Given the suffering Tarkovsky endured during his lifetime, it is rather amazing that, despite these dark expressions of grief, so many of his poems look to nature for regeneration and new possibility. Sometimes that rebirth, as in section IV of his poem “After the War,” represents the violence between the forces of life and death the poet has personally experienced:
Like a tree splashing the earth
above itself, having collapsed from a steep
undermined by water, roots in the air,
the rapids plucking its branches—
so my double on the other rapids
travels from future to past.
From another height, I trail myself
with my eyes, clutch my chest. Who gave me
trembling branches, a sturdy trunk
yet weak, helpless roots?
Death is vile, but life is worse,
and there's no binding its tyranny.
Are you leaving, Lazarus? Well, go away!
Nothing holds us together. Sleep,
Vivacious one, fold your hands
on your chest and sleep.
But, more often, the horrors of his life are transformed into scenes of renewal and beauty through the natural world. One need only read his remarkable “Field Hospital,” which recounts Tarkovsky's leg injury of 1944. About to have his leg amputated, the poet begins the poem with an out-of-body vision of himself, one might say “etherized upon a table”:
The table was turned to light. I lay
my head down like meat on a scale,
my soul throbbing on a thread.
I could see myself from above:
I would have been balanced
by a stout market weight.
Soon after, as his leg is cut away, time seems to stop: On that day,
the clock stopped, souls of trains
no longer flew along lampless levies,
upon the gray fins of stream;
neither crow weddings nor snowstorms
nor thaws penetrated this limbo
where I lay in disgrace, naked,
in my own blood, outside the future's
magnetic pull.
Yet the poem continues with an almost miraculous “coming-to” (predicted in the repetition of “and also”) as the poet calls from his inner self the language of an almost biblical past, bringing him back to life and to a vision, once again, of the beauty of the natural world:
My lips were covered with sores, and also
I was fed by a spoon, and also
I could not remember my name,
but the language of King David came
alive on my tongue.
And then
even the snow disappeared,
and early spring, rising on tiptoes,
draped her green scarf over the trees.
Even at the front in 1942, Tarkovsky, through the glory of nature and his memory of the past, was able in the unforgettable poem “Beautiful Day” (which in Russian means “White Day”) to recover an almost radiant joy. The poem is among those quoted in Andrei Tarkovsky's Mirror:
Beneath the jasmine a stone
marks a buried treasure.
On the path, my father stands.
A beautiful, beautiful day. The gray poplar blooms,
centifola blooms,
and milky grass,
and behind it, roses climb. I have never been
more happy than then.
I have never been more
happy than then. To return is impossible
and to talk about it, forbidden—
how it was filled with bliss,
that heavenly garden.
I don't know how that poem works in Russian, but in English the third stanza, with its simple statements of joy, each altered with their enjambments and attenuations, express some feelings about the world which remain unspoken if read merely as one long sentence. The narrator begins with an incomplete phrase that suggests a sense of his non-existence (“I have never been”) before continuing on in the second line with his expression of joy. The third line extends that feeling, “I have never been more,” suggesting that happiness is just a portion of the fullness of his feeling, before the stanza continues with the (now limited) happiness that closes stanza.
Accordingly, even in expressing his great joy, he seems already aware, as it puts it in the last stanza, that such joy is somehow beyond himself, is something to which he can never return. The happiness comes from somewhere outside of his being, and, once experienced, beyond even his memory of it. It is, in fact, a “white” world, a void that is at once pure and cleansing, yet nonetheless a forbidden territory to the surviving adult.
Tarkovsky's world, we quickly realize, is not simply fragile, but lost, a postlapsarian universe, a place perhaps haunted by an Edenic past, yet permeated with the smell of death, the burning of flesh. As he puts it in “My sight, which was my power, now blurs”:
I am a candle. I burned at the feast.
Gather my wax when morning arrives
so that this page will remind you
how to be proud and how to weep,
how to give away the last third
of happiness, and how to die with ease—
and beneath a temporary roof
to burn posthumously, like a word.

The Mayor of Pleasant Hill was at the statehouse Monday arguing against a wide-ranging gun rights bill backed by the National Rifle Association and making its way through the Iowa House.
After an outcry from the public, the bill's sponsor has removed some controversial provisions, but there's still plenty in the legislation to concern gun safety advocates.
Pleasant Hill Mayor Sara Kurovski is a registered Republican who holds a permit to carry a weapon.
She recalls a shooting incident on a snowy Monday morning two years ago.
“An individual we now know was under the influence of drugs began driving through the city of Pleasant Hill and was shooting at individuals as they were removing snow from their cars because it had snowed the night before,” Kurovski said at a statehouse news conference.
No one was killed in that shooting spree, but Kurovski says it was her first experience with a crisis situation.
“It changed people's lives,” she said.
Now she's against the gun rights bill.
Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert appeared alongside the mayor, also opposing the bill.
The two object to the legislation even though the Iowa League of Cities and various police groups have not taken a position on the bill.
Among other things, the bill eliminates required permits to openly carry guns.
Kurovski says that threatens public safety.
Open carry creates a more intimidating environment -Pleasant Hill Mayor Sara Kurovski
“Open carry creates a more intimidating environment and it makes it harder for law enforcement to investigate a scene,” Kurovski said.
Kurovski says if there are a number of people openly carrying weapons at a crime scene, law officers may not be able to tell who the shooter is.
Critics of the bill say getting rid of gun permits creates other problems as well.
Under the bill, all gun permits would no longer be required.
That includes permits to carry weapons, either concealed or openly, as well as permits to acquire weapons.
Without permits, officials with the Iowa Department of Public Safety say background checks will no longer be required for private gun purchases.
“Anything that has to do with background checks and anything that has to do with the permitting process, those are the things we're focusing on right now,” said Amber Gustafson of Ankeny with Iowa Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.
The bill also enacts so-called "stand your ground" language, reduces penalties for carrying a gun while drunk, and classifies fewer guns as assault weapons.
The bill's sponsor Rep. Matt Windschitl (R-Missouri Valley) would not say what's most important in the bill.
“If you had to pick one or the other I probably couldn't do it because these are all near and dear to my heart,” Windschitl said on Iowa Public Radio's River to River program.
Iowans are responsible people -Rep. Matt Windschitl
Windschitl says he is not concerned about the background checks. He says it will still be illegal to sell another person a weapon if the seller knew or should have known the person wasn't qualified to buy one. Windschitl doubts that eliminating required permits will lead to more Iowans openly carrying guns.
Rep. Mary Wolfe (D-Clinton), a defense attorney in her life outside the legislature, is especially concerned about what's known as "stand your ground".
Under the bill, no one has a duty to retreat if a person's life or safety is threatened, and a person may be wrong in their estimation of the danger or the force necessary to repel the danger.
Wolfe says the current self-defense law isn't perfect.
“It needs some updates but something like this that is so broad and makes so many policy changes isn't good law,” Wolfe said.
Windschitl and Wolfe disagree on how easily a gun owner might get away with shooting someone who's committing a crime.
Wolfe says homicide rates have gone up in states with "stand your ground".
Windschitl says he can't explain the homicide rates elsewhere, but he says it will be different here because the law would require a gunowner to shoot responsibly.
“Iowans are responsible people,” Windschitl said.
After complaints from the public, Windschitl has scaled the bill back so it no longer will prevent colleges and universities from banning weapons on campus.
“I wouldn't say it changed my mind,” Windschitl said. “I still believe adults who attend our colleges and universities have a right to carry firearms.”
However, there appears to be continued angst among the general public about the bill.
“There's a lot here that concerns me,” said Mary Ann Today of Ames, who called in to the show. “It creates anxiety whenever I think about it.”
Democrats say the bill is being pushed through without enough input from them.
The legislation will likely make this week's deadline for committee approval to stay alive for the session.

Country:
Wrapper origin:
Wrapper type: Ecuadorian Habano
Filler: Nicaraguan
Length: 5.75
Ring: 56
Cost: $8.00
Appearance (0-20): I tend to smoke darker and fuller cigars, but this was suggested to me by a friend at Cigars International . Out of the 4 “Surrogates,” he said that I would enjoy this one the best. Inspecting the stick, it had a light brown habano wrapper. There are some small veins on the wrapper, but nothing that is worrisome. The wrapper was fairly simple, only using simple text and one yellow “crystal ball.” While nothing really jumped out to me, nothing caused me any concern either.
Score: 17
Construction (0-20): The cap didn't seem to be fully wrapped on, but it clipped off easily without any issues. The cigar light up very easily, while giving way to a nice smooth draw. The burn line was even right down to the nub, and the ash held on extremely well. The ash was a light gray color, and tapped off easily at close to 2 inches.
Score: 18
Strength (0-20): This one sits smack dab in the middle of medium, and it just works! Any more strength wouldn't give the flavors full development, and any less would make it bland. Spot on.
Score: 18
Flavor (0-20): Right from the initial light, I got some great creamy flavors. There was no harsh start to the cigar, just some very subtle bits of spice. The smooth creamy definitely will stay with you the full length of the cigar, but you'll encounter some other notes that really give a nice balance. The second third of the cigar gave off some sweet wood and vanilla flavors. The notes were somewhat hard to pinpoint, but they complemented each other extremely well. I enjoyed the blend so much, that I burned it right down to my fingertips.
Score: 19
Value (0-20): At $8.00 , I think this competes well with anything else on the market. The smooth flavors were robust, and lasted from beginning to end. Well done!
Score: 18
Additional Notes: Smoked at Cigars International, paired with Southern Tier Pale Wheat Ale
Overall (0-100): As mentioned before, I most likely wouldn't have ever picked this stick up unless recommended. Luckily I did, because this cigar was fantastic. With little to no expectations, this Surrogate was quite memorable and will be a repeat purchase. The flavors blended well, the burn was great, and the price was right. I'll probably delve into the rest of the Surrogates lineup.

The Galaxy A8 is heading our way. We've heart it loud and clear and its really getting to a point where the amount of rumors for the upcoming handset is getting ridiculous. The phablet has appeared in live images, as well as the certification authorities - TENAA and FCC.
And if that wasn't enough to clear the smoke on the A8, today we get to see a lengthy hands-on video with a specs rundown and even a UI and camera demo. Oddly enough, the clip comes courtesy of TENAA. We have little doubt that the certification authority has early access to devices, as it is necessary for it to do its job. Consequently, the issued certificates are often the first trustworthy source for specifications and crude photos of upcoming devices. Yet, actually showing an unannounced phone on video seems a bit too much.
The clip itself, although quite blurry and out of focus for large intervals, leaves little to the imagination. We get a clear view of the Galaxy A8's metal design, which we have come to expect from an A-series device. We also get a good look at the gorgeous 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display and also a sneak peek at the UI and camera.
Better yet, the phones specs are also shown in the clip, which adds yet another level of certainty to what we already knew. The Galaxy A8 measures 157.7mm x 76.7mm x 5.9mm, which makes it the thinnest Samsung smartphone to date. The display seems to be identical to the one in the Galaxy Note 3 - sporting FullHD resolution and 386ppi density. Powering the device is Qualcomm's popular mid-range chip - the Snapdragon 615. It is by no means beastly, but is perfectly capable with four Cortex A53 cores, clocked at 1.7 GHz and another four at 1.0 GHz. The chipset comes equipped with an Adreno 405 GPU and CAT4 LTE connectivity.
Memory is set at 2GB and 16GB for onboard storage. Thankfully, there is also a microSD card slot for adding extra space. The camera setup is comprised of a 16MP main shooter and a 5MP selfie one. The physical home button is also equipped a fingerprint sensor, as was previously rumored, although here it is referred to as a "biometric authentication system". The whole thing is powered by a 3050 mAh battery and boots Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Samsung's own TouchWiz on top.
The only thing really missing in the Galaxy A8 picture is a release date and a price tag. But, judging by the elevated interest in the phablet, both should come along shortly.

Message: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/t24v
— Police said Friday that human remains found Tuesday off railroad tracks south of downtown Fayetteville are those of a Fayetteville woman who has been missing for two months.
Marcella Anne Thompson, 39, was last seen leaving her home on Sept. 23 to run errands. Her car was found on Oct. 1 when a man crashed it while fleeing police.
A man walking along a rail line that parallels Winslow Street spotted the remains Tuesday afternoon about 5 feet off the tracks near the Southern Avenue intersection, police said. He reported the find to employees in a nearby Aberdeen & Rockfish Railroad office, and they called police.
Terrin Thompson, Marcella's husband of 12 years, said Friday he does not know how he will go on without her.
Thompson said he met his wife around Valentine's day back in 1998. They were married three years later and now have a 2-year-old daughter, Ally.
"We had a whole plan, our whole life laid out. It's all gone now," he said.
Terrin Thompson said he will make sure little Ally will always be able to picture her mother.
"She was one of the most caring and loving people I've ever met," he said. "She loved her daughter and couldn't get enough time with her."
The man accused of driving Marcella Thompson's car, Pierre Rouchant Lowe, 38, crashed it and ran from the scene, according to authorities. He was charged with hit-and-run, flee and elude arrest with a motor vehicle, resisting and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Lowe not been named a suspect in Thompson's death. He was in the Cumberland County jail Saturday under an $8,000 bond.
Thompson's remains were sent to a medical examiner for an autopsy, and police haven't released a cause of death.
Thompson was one of seven active missing persons cases that the Fayetteville police have opened since January 2010.
Writing Simple Unix Scripts Phil Jeffrey, Mar 2007, v0.1
Preamble
C Shells and Bourne Again Shells
Which shell one should use is more a matter of dogma than anything else. Csh and tcsh are probably the more common ones in crystallography because of the enhancements in tcsh were available more widely than bash at some time in the past when we were all still working on SGIs (one of the machines that led the shift away from VAX/VMS as the usual operating system for crystallography). Program suites often come with two different startup or configuration files compatible with the different (sh, csh) shell syntaxes, however when there is only one config file version it is more likely to be written in C shell than in Bourne shell. There's a difference between using shells for command line execution and using them to write elaborate scripts. Perl and Tcl (and perhaps even Python) are better suited to such scripts. Sh/Bash zealots like to point out C shell limitations in the widely disseminated page C shell programming considered harmful but frankly there are better scripting languages to do most of the more advanced system administration functions in Unix.
Consequently, learn Perl or Tcl (or even C) if you want to do cute things with scripts, and Keep It Simple in tcsh or bash.
You can also RTFM tcsh. There are any number of shell guides and introductions if you just Google for them.
Hash Pling Slash (#!/)
#!/bin/csh -f
execute the script as input to the program listed after the #! characters
A very simple script would look like:
#!/bin/csh -f # # this is a comment # echo "hello world"
Simple Csh Syntax
# signifies a comment
the first word on the line is assumed to be an executible program or script or equivalent built-in command - the program can have its path explicitly specified (/bin/ls or ./hackit), or implicitly specified (ls). In the latter case the shell consults the path variable to find the first match to the program "ls". This is less secure so it is better to specify the path explicitly.
or script or equivalent built-in command - the program can have its path explicitly specified (/bin/ls or ./hackit), or implicitly specified (ls). In the latter case the shell consults the variable to find the first match to the program "ls". This is less secure so it is better to specify the path explicitly. "string" or 'string' designates a character string - in the double-quote case "$test" is converted to the value of the variable "test" if it exists or if it does not the shell will throws an error. The value of '$test' is in fact just $test - it does not do variable substitution inside single quote marks.
C shell variables can be set by the syntax "set name = value" and referenced by $name.
Simple constructions similar to the C programming language like: if (test) then ... endif and while (test) then ... end also work.
If you're writing shell scripts I assume you already know about redirection, but to reiterate:
> filename - redirects standard output to the filename - it will overwrite existing files, not append.
- redirects standard output to the filename - it will overwrite existing files, not append. >& filename - redirects standard output and standard error to the filename
- redirects standard output to the filename >> filename and >>& filename appends to, rather than overwrites, the file.
and >>& appends to, rather than overwrites, the file. < filename - redirects standard input from the file to the program
- redirects standard input from the file to the program << word - see below
- see below | - connect the standard output of the prior command/program to the standard input of the subsequent command/program (i.e. a pipe).
|& - same thing as | but also connects standard error to standard input
The csh/tcsh feature that we are most concerned with is how to get my data into my program. Specifically you want to get the shell to shove a series of lines into the program being executed rather than interpret them in shell syntax. One very tedious way to achieve this is to do:
echo "first line of program input" > instructions.dat echo "second line of program input" >> instructions.dat echo "third line of program input" >> instructions.dat program_name < instructions.dat
program_name << EOF-prog first line of program input second line of program input third line of program input EOF-prog
Reads the C Shell input up to a line that is identical to word. word is not subjected to variable, file name or command substitution, and each input line is compared to word before any substitutions are done on the input line. Unless a quoting \, ", ', or ` appears in word, variable and command substitution is performed on the intervening lines, allowing \ to quote $, \ and `. Commands that are substituted have all blanks, tabs, and newlines preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped. The resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary file that is given to the command as its standard input.
I use this construction all the time in CCP4 scripts:
#!/bin/csh -f # # run SHELXC # /usr/local/shelx/macosx/shelxc se1 << EOF HREM se1rm.sca PEAK se1pk.sca INFL se1in.sca LREM se1lo.sca CELL 35.104 63.496 76.458 90. 90. 90. SPAG P212121 FIND 8 NTRY 50 EOF #
Running the Script
chmod +x my_script.csh
chmod a+x my_script.csh
If you just type "my_script.csh" the shell may or may not find the script. This is because any command that you type in the shell that isn't an absolute or relative path (e.g. /bin/ls, ./myprog, ../myotherprog) is first looked for as a shell built-in (echo is one such command) then the path variable is searched from left to right for a location containing the command "my_script.csh". Do an "echo $path" to see the contents of your path - it's a list of directories in which one is supposed to search for programs. If your path does not contain "." then it will not find such a command in the current directory, and it may find a completely different file called my_script.csh and execute that !!. So while typing "ls" is likely to execute the program /bin/ls it is not guaranteed to do so. For reasons of security and sanity it is best to use the absolute path either as
/Users/phil/Structures/examples/my_script.csh
./my_script.csh
set path = ($path .)
Getting Into Trouble With More Advanced Shell Syntax
You could create a simple disk space monitoring script:
#!/bin/csh -f # # while (1) sleep 60 df -kl end
You can simplify laborious tasks for doing things like calculating the Mean Fractional Isomorphous Difference (MFID) between all possible pairs of MTZ (.mtz) files containing single datasets:
#!/bin/csh -f # echo "" > mfid.log for file1 (*.mtz) for file2 (*.mtz) echo "Using $file1 and $file2" >> mfid.log ./mfid.csh $file1 $file2 >> mfid.log end end
Now, how do you get mfid.csh to accept the filenames as arguments ? Well the shell allows this via special variables $0, $1, $2 etc:
#!/bin/csh -f # \rm mfid_merged.mtz # cad HKLIN1 $1 HKLIN2 $2 HKLOUT mfid_merged.mtz << eof-cad RESOLUTION OVERALL 50.0 6. SYMMETRY P6122 TITLE merge two data files together LABIN FILE 1 E1=F E2=SIGF CTYPE FILE 1 E1=F E2=Q LABOUT FILE 1 E1=FN1 E2=SIGFN1 LABIN FILE 2 E1=F E2=SIGF CTYPE FILE 2 E1=F E2=Q LABOUT FILE 2 E1=FN2 E2=SIGFN2 END eof-cad
More examples could go here if I felt that they would do more good than harm.
Tests for file name existence:
if (-e $1) echo "File $1 exists" if (! -e $1) echo "File $1 does not exist"
Tests for numeric values:
if ($a > $b) echo "A ($a) is more than B ($b)" if ($a == 9) echo "A is equal to 9" if ($a <= 9) echo "A is less than or equal to 9"
String comparions:
if ("$q" == "yes") echo "Answer is yes"
If you get to here you are way beyond the point where you should have read the C Shell Field Guide.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - You may have noticed construction crews working at the old AMF Parkway Lanes bowling alley site on South Memorial Parkway.
We have learned the spot will eventually be home to a new Baumhower's restaurant.
It's been nearly 2 and a half years since the bowling alley burned down. Now, construction crews are doing prep work needed to begin construction.
The sports-themed chain, well-known for its chicken wings, is owned by former Miami Dolphins and University of Alabama football player Bob Baumhower.
An opening date for the eatery has not been announced yet.
There is also another Baumhower's location not far from the property, on Balmoral Drive. It's unclear at this time if Baumhower's will be moving from that spot or if they are expanding.
We have reached out to Baumhower's corporate office for more information.
Press Release:
(Athens, GA) – Terrapin Beer Co. has partnered with Skybound Entertainment, the company founded by The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman, to create the official beer of the undead. Whether you're animated or reanimated, The Walking Dead Blood Orange IPA will put a shuffle in your step.
The Walking Dead comic book series, which was created by Robert Kirkman, debuted in 2003 and is the inspiration behind the wildly-popular TV series of the same name that premiered in 2010.
The partnership with Terrapin came naturally, as both the comic and the TV show have strong ties to Georgia. Much of the comic book is based in the state and the TV show is filmed in Senoia, a small town just outside of Atlanta. Further strengthening the local bond between the Walking Dead story and Terrapin is that the brewery's beers have been featured in multiple episodes of the TV show since Season 2. Like many folks out there, Terrapin is a big fan of The Walking Dead and is excited to be part of this collaborative project.
From the label:
Terrapin Beer Company and The Walking Dead have teamed up to brew the official beer of the undead. Made with blood orange peel, and a horrific amount of hops, this bloodthirsty Red IPA will have you prepared for the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse.
The Walking Dead Blood Orange IPA will be available in 22 oz. bottles throughout Terrapin's full distribution footprint. Look for these bombers to drop on October 5!

Upcoming Event: Documentary film screening and panel on Black in blue
Wednesday, January 23 at 7:30 pm
Georgia Tech's Global Learning Center, Room 236
Fifty years ago, every athlete in every sport at every school in the Southeastern Conference was white. That changed when then Assistant Kentucky Coach Homer Rice recruited Greg Page, who became the first African American ever signed to play football in the SEC. While Page died tragically in a football-related accident in the fall of 1967, Nate Northington trotted onto the field as a University of Kentucky varsity football player against Ole Miss. Since that time, tens of thousands of African Americans have followed Greg, Nate, and teammates Houston Hogg, and Wilbur Hackett, dramatically improving athletic competition....and life in the American South. This is the story told in a new film directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Paul Wagner and produced by former Kentucky quarterback Paul Karem. Follow this link to watch the Black in blue trailer.
A panel will follow the screening and will feature:
Paul Wagner, the filmmaker
Paul Karem, former University of Kentucky quarterback
Mel Page, brother of Greg Page, the first African-American signed to play football at Kentucky and in the SEC
Homer C. Rice, former Georgia Tech Athletic Director and form Kentucky Assistant Football Coach
Please join us! This screening of Black in blue and post film panel is free and open to the public, however seating is limited. Parking is available in the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference center garage, which is adjacent to the Global Learning Center.
Mary G. McDonald Receives Service Award from North American Society for the Sociology of Sport
This past November, Mary G. McDonald (Homer Rice Chair and Director of the Sport, Society, and Technology program), was awarded the Service Excellence Award from the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport (NASSS). As the 2018 recipient, McDonald was invited to deliver the Alan Ingham Memorial Lecture, a prestigious keynote at the annual meeting. McDonald used this opportunity to explore a variety of issues related to sport and current social struggles for equality and justice. In “Once more, with feeling: Sport, national anthems, and the collective power of affect,” McDonald traced the history of national anthems at sporting events and theorized two poignant examples: a multi-lingual version of the Canadian national anthem performed close to the conclusion of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Colin Kapernick's decision to kneel during the U.S. national anthem in protest of police brutality.

Summertime in pretty much any city is a different experience than any other season, but summer in New York is another world. Many of the people who can afford to escape from Gotham in July and August usually do so, and even if their numbers are relatively small among the city's eight million souls, the extra elbow room that their absence provides the rest of us on the streets, at the museums and in the parks, bars and restaurants lends the metropolis a far less frenetic vibe.
It's not that the city's unique energy vanishes; instead, it's directed toward the pursuit of leisure — street fairs, picnics and plays in the parks, free concerts, people-watching — rather than New Yorkers' customary quests for money, power, fame, an apartment with two bathrooms. . . .
In the summer, despite baking in the sweltering heat, encountering undefinable and often jarring aromas around every street corner and dealing with the constant prospect of citywide blackouts, New Yorkers give themselves license to slow down . To cease striving. To breathe.
[See the gallery, "Jewel of Manhattan: LIFE in Central Park, Summer 1961."]
In August 1969, meanwhile, LIFE magazine was busy celebrating not the season itself, but the eye-popping fashions that the "young people" — which, judging by these pictures, meant anyone under the age of 40 — were sporting during the summer months. In a cover story shot by photographer Vernon Merritt III, LIFE lauded "That New York Look" with an almost poetic zeal:
New York City is a costume party for the young this summer, a party taking place outdoors, on the streets and in the parks. Long hair, long legs. The party is not always elegant, but it is completely alive.
It isn't really hard to tell the boys from the girls, even when they are both in bell-bottoms, and of course most boys don't put shoe polish on their eyes. All are wearing what they want to to wear, from the shortest skirts to the longest skins.
How they look depends partly on where they go. The ferry is different from a Seventh Avenue lunch stand — and very different from Central Park.
The look is not what New York calls sophisticated, but even so, it catches the eye. Many of the girls seem to get their kicks with makeup. They wear it anywhere — absolutely anywhere.
The important thing is to express yourself. Depending on your talents you can do it with a 25-key soprano Melodica or a long, cool stare. You choose. The New York look is a celebration of the self.
Here, in recognition of the singular look and feel of that long-ago New York summer, LIFE.com presents a number of the photographs that ran in the "New York Look" article, as well as some other, atmospheric shots that did not run in LIFE. Take a look — and then go ahead. Get outside. Take a stroll. Flirt. It's summer, after all.
In Senegal's capital, Dakar, there is a heady mix of tension and anticipation.
Two months of unprecedented political drama in this historically stable West African democracy came to a head on Sunday with a presidential election. There are more than a dozen candidates on the ballot, including the 85-year-old incumbent, Abdoulaye Wade.
Some say if the 85-year-old incumbent Abdoulaye Wade is re-elected, there could be unprecedented violence there. Early results, according to the BBC, indicate a tight race between incumbent Abdoulaye Wade and former Prime Minister Macky Sall.
Wade is running for a third term. The constitution doesn't allow it, but he successfully petitioned Senegal's constitutional court to let him run again.
Since that decision was announced less than a month ago, there have been almost daily protests in the center of Dakar.
The politically engaged community of rap musicians in Dakar wants Wade out. On Tuesday, they gathered with other opponents near Independence Square to voice their anger at the president; that protest ended in tear gas and panic.
The mantra-like chant of the rappers, and the name of their group, “Y'en a marre” – or, we're fed up – says it all. As they see it, there are constant blackouts, a high cost of living, and no jobs — all the while a small group of elites grows wealthy.
“We have the power to elect whoever we want, and we have the power to take you off,” said Xuman, a Senegalese rapper, who is one of the leaders of Y'en a marre. “This is a message for the next president. Even if you are elected now, make sure that tomorrow if you're not doing things the right way, we can we have the power to like change you out of the country.”
The chants from the rappers who oppose Wade are loud and angry. But if you just go by decibels, the cheering in a dusty suburb when the 85-year-old Wade shows up to campaign indicates strong support for the incumbent.
On Wednesday, in the vast neighborhood of Pikine, a soccer stadium was packed with enthralled Wade supporters who treated the octogenarian president like a rock star.
Most at the campaign rally were under the age of 30.
The Wade camp actually appreciates the rappers, according to Wade's official spokesman, Serigne Mbacke Ndiaye — they're non-violent, he said, and they clean up after their protests.
But Ndiaye told me on Thursday that the Y'en a marre people forget what Wade has done for the country since he first took office in 2000. Wade created a new, affordable, community for people washed out in the floods of 2009, he said.
“Look at the roads Wade has built, the hospital, the new schools, two renovated stadiums, and so on,” Ndiaye said.
The rappers can say they've been let down by Wade, Ndiaye continued, but the majority of Senegalese – the youth –do not.
But this isn't just about Wade versus some angry young musicians.
There's also the umbrella opposition group M23, named for the 23rd of June last year when Wade tried to push through two amendments to the constitution: one, permitting a victory in a first round with just 25 percent of the vote, the other, allowing for a vice-president.
Those changes didn't happen. But it put many in Senegal on alert that Wade had plans to hand off power to his son Karim, who's held several ministerial posts, and is estimated to control 40 percent of the national budget.
One of the coordinators of M23, Alioune Tine, was detained and questioned for several days in January around his role in organizing anti-Wade protests. Meeting in a secret location, where he was hiding for his safety, he said members of Wade's own party have told him privately why the 85 year-old is running again.
“They said if he is doing so, it is for his son,” Tine said.
Then there is the Youssou N'dour factor.
The superstar musician threw his hat in the ring for the presidency late last year. But then, in January, Senegal's electoral commission told him that his candidacy petition didn't have enough signatures.
N'dour cut back all his musical activities and has become an opposition activist, appearing regularly at rallies. In fact, he was at the rally on Tuesday that ended in a fog of tear gas. One of the canisters struck him in the foot, and he's been limping all week. But Thursday, at a small press conference, he shrugged it off.
N'dour had met with former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo, who is trying to bring some senior statesman calm to Senegal in the run up to Sunday's vote.
It was the government of Obasanjo in 1979 that prevented radical Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti from running for president of Nigeria.
“I respect Fela a lot, he remains a great reference for me,” N'Dour said. “But I believe that all heads of state who won't allow their own countrymen to run for office, beware of them.”
Many here believe Abdoulaye Wade will win, and that is expected to lead to widespread anger and possible violence.
Presidential spokesman Ndiaye said the army, police and gendarmerie will be out in force, and that Senegal will not be torn apart.
If an African version of the Arab spring takes root in Senegal, would that be the fault of the opposition or President Wade?
Ndiaye said first that he doesn't believe there will be an African Spring, but if there is, it can't be the fault of Abdoulaye Wade because he respects the established order in Senegal.
He added that they believe whatever crisis this vote might bring, they'll be able to handle it.
Never before has a feature phone dominated the world's most important mobile event – then again, this isn't just any other phone. Seventeen years after its debut, the iconic Nokia 3310 has been recreated for a modern audience.
This was an important move by the brand owners of the Nokia phone brand, HMD Global. As a young startup, the company needed something to really capture a tough mobile audience – how about recreating a legend?
The new 3310 retains some of its predecessor's iconic looks – the contrast colours around the display, the pebblestone-shaped buttons – but the new design adds some modern flair. The 3310 is curvier in every axis, and there's a splash of colour on top of the classic matte ones: the new Nokia 3310 is available in matte midnight blue and light grey, as well as glossy yellow and an interesting red-orange hue.
Because of the rounded shape, the new 3310 feels slightly different from the OG 3310. And, probably because I've been so used to using a smartphone, the 79g weight almost makes the 3310 feel like a dummy set. It is for that reason, too, that it loses some of the “tank” feel of the original 3310.
That said, there are lots of important additions, like a 2.4-inch colour display and a 1,200mAh battery that increases battery life by ten times from the 2000 model (not exactly difficult, but you know). Round the back there's also a 2MP camera for “basic” needs. It also charges via micro USB, thankfully.
However, this is still a feature phone. Talk time may be rated for 22 hours, but Internet connectivity is limited to 2.5G. The phone also has Opera Mini pre-installed, should the need ever arise. There is a brand-new Snake game, though gaming on a 2.4-inch display may not be necessarily be the best experience. It may be better to just play the one integrated into Facebook Messenger instead.
The OS is called Series 30+, which was developed by Microsoft back when the company still cared about phones. It has a Symbian-like UI, and navigation is still via the square D-pad below the screen. If you've used a Nokia feature phone before, the experience will be like a duck taking to water – one does not simply forget how to use a feature phone.
And, as mentioned in our earlier post, I am not yet convinced about the build quality of the new 3310. The glued-on Nokia logo peeling off isn't a sign that the 3310 has inferior durability, but that on top of things like non-aligned back covers on some units I saw suggest that the Nokia 3310 feels cheaper than its already low 49 Euro price tag.
The matte models alleviate some of the concerns because they attract fewer fingerprints (and the safe colours look more classy), but of course, it is a matter of personal choice. A colleague literally screamed when he saw the 3310 in his favourite colour (yellow), while another much preferred the matte midnight blue model as it is the same colourway as her old 3310.
Regardless, the Nokia 3310 isn't exactly targeted for urban consumers. It may have been a strong nostalgic play to hype up the brand, but this device is still very much targeted to emerging markets, where the phone is heading to first when it becomes available. Malaysia is likely to be in this list, which we have previously reported.

SAN JOSE, Calif.—Almost imperceptibly the semiconductor industry made a big turn on the road to chip stacks. The 3-D IC marrying memory and logic using through-silicon vias (TSVs) went from being the hot destination to something in the rear view mirror.
The smartphone application processor was supposed to be the vehicle for TSVs, and Qualcomm was going to be one of its drivers. Now Apple is out front with speculation its next A-series SoC will use TSMC's wafer-level fan-out process in a 10nm chip in the works for the iPhone 7.
Whether the Apple rumor is true or not, Qualcomm confirmed it is no longer interested in 3D chip stacks with TSVs. The approach cost too much and takes too long to manufacture, said Michael Campbell, a vice president of engineering at Qualcomm in a talk at the Industry Strategy Symposium hosted by the SEMI trade group.
Instead, Campbell pointed to an emerging class of system-in-package technologies such as the device in the Apple Watch that merge multiple die and passive components. “It's a question of cost and time-to-market…TSVs require a two-year-plus design cycle while these micro packages take 6-12 weeks,” he said.
Heat is a chief problem for TSVs, said Babak Sabi, director of assembly and test development technology at Intel in an ISS talk. “No one has true stacking of memory on logic and unless someone comes up with a thermal solution for the logic die I don't think anyone's going to use it,” he said.

E. Jan Vardaman, president of TechSearch International, a veteran analyst of chip packaging technology, agreed.
“Years ago Qualcomm and Samsung did a lot of work on TSVs and had demos, but the problem was you can't get rid of the heat…hot spots on the logic die would heat memory die past their rated temperature specs…and there's no air flow or room for cooling systems [in the tiny chip stacks]—that was the first technical showstopper,” said Vardaman.
The good news is the industry is awash in alternative ways to package chips including stacks of memory chips using TSVs. “I think the idea of TSVs in logic is waning, but not TSVs in memory,” said Ron Huemoeller, corporate vice president for R&D at Amkor Technology which has a variety of options including its own versions of fan-out packages like those of TSMC.
The new packaging options are among the best hopes for driving gains in chip performance, size and cost at a time when Moore's Law is slowing down.
“The semiconductor curve isn't quite cutting it anymore, its good but it isn't what it used to be…but with the miniaturization of packages we can get back to the curve,” said Campbell. “We've always been about the semiconductor fab and the extreme value it provides, now we have to bring in other partners, the assembly and board makers,” he said.

Adam Taylor Young reports a group of BPD motorcycle cops busted into his Wadsworth Street apartment around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday:
My roommates, were quietly conversing on the front porch of our residence. I was inside, noted their arrival and closed my door. One officer who refused to identify himself, assaulted one of my roommates who was outside with a baton, and attempted to open the door. I was on the other side, pushing it closed. When he ordered me to let him in, I requested a reason for him to enter my home, and he refused to answer me. With the help of 1 or 2 other officers, he pushed the door open, entered my home, and assaulted one of my roommates who was not involved or aware of what was happening with his baton, before pushing me against the wall and asking me questions. I refused to answer until they gave me a reason for entering my home. They did not comply, so I did not comply. They asked for my identification, and knowing my rights, I informed them that I was not legally obligated to show them my identification within the commonwealth of Massachusetts, unless I was lawfully detained. I was then assaulted with a baton, and pushed to the ground. The officers put their knees on my elbow and threatened to “break my fucking arm” if I tried to move.
Somebody else who says he was there, however, says that while the cops may have gone too far:
There were 10 or 11 of us and we'd been pretty loud a few minutes before they showed up. About 4 people singing loudly off key for several minutes. A noise complaint isn't out of the realm of possibility though it is just as likely that the cops were cruising by and decided to bust up the "party". I don't recall them ever citing a noise complaint or giving any reasons beyond "Because I fucking said so. Do you want to get arrested?"

How powerful are business interests in lobbying for changes to EU legislative proposals? Andreas Dür, Patrick Bernhagen and David Marshall present findings from an analysis of 70 legislative proposals introduced by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. They note that contrary to popular opinion, business actors proved far less successful than citizen groups at achieving their desired outcomes in EU legislative decisions. They reason that this may be because with the single market completed in most areas, the contemporary European legislative agenda tends to be dominated by proposals aimed at protecting consumers or the environment.
From legislation governing the safety of chemicals (REACH) to the EU's current data protection regulation, critics of business lobbying warn that corporate interests are highly influential in EU legislative politics. But do business interests really pull the strings in Brussels? In the framework of INTEREURO, a collaborative international study of lobbying in the EU, we took up the question of business power in EU legislative politics. Our findings have just been published in a recent article in Comparative Political Studies – also available as an ungated working paper.
Our result, at first, seems surprising: Business interests are less successful, on average, in achieving favourable policy outcomes in the EU than citizen groups that advocate issues such as environmental protection or human rights. This result rests on highly labour-intensive empirical research. We interviewed officials in the European Commission about a sample of 70 legislative proposals introduced by that institution between 2008 and 2010. These interviews provided us with data about the conflictive issues within the proposals and the positions of interest groups that lobbied on these issues. We also recorded the positions of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, as well as the locations of the status quo and the outcome of the decision-making process. In total, we found 112 conflictive issues and 1,043 non-state advocates lobbying on these issues.
We used these data to calculate a measure of lobbying success, built on the idea that lobbyists are more successful the more they manage to pull the outcome closer to their ideal points, relative to the status quo. The larger the distance to the status quo, and the smaller the distance to the outcome, the more successful an actor should be considered (and vice versa).
We then analysed variation across actors with respect to this success score. Controlling for a variety of factors such as media attention, the actors' endowment with relevant information, the distance between the actors' ideal positions and the European Commission's position (and in some variations also distance to the Council majority and distance to the majority in the European Parliament), and the number of actors pulling in the same direction, we found that business actors are, on average, less successful than citizen groups. An illustration of our results is shown in the chart below.
Chart: Average lobbying ‘success' for citizen groups and business actors in the EU's legislative process
Note: The chart is based on subtracting the percentage of citizen groups/business actors that ‘lost' in their attempts to influence a given legislative proposal from the percentage of groups that ‘won' (based on the authors' ordinal success ‘score'). In this case, 65% of citizen groups ‘won' and 12% ‘lost', while only 39% of business actors ‘won' whereas 44% ‘lost'. For full calculations see the authors' longer paper.
While at first sight this finding may be surprising, the fact that business influence on EU legislation is limited actually makes sense. Contrary to citizen groups, business interests often lack a “natural ally” in contemporary EU legislative decision-making. With the single market largely completed, much of the EU's contemporary legislative activity is about regulating the European market. In the mature European polity, proposals aiming to protect consumers or the environment tend to dominate the legislative agenda.
On these proposals, business actors – often unanimously – defend the low regulation status quo. By contrast, citizen groups, the European Commission and the European Parliament all tend to support these proposals. Beyond substantive grounds, the European Commission has an incentive to advance these proposals as doing so gives it the opportunity to strengthen or at least preserve its position vis-à-vis the other EU institutions.
With business actors thus confronting coalitions of citizen groups, the European Commission and the European Parliament, it is not surprising that they often tend to lose. In fact, what we see is that nearly all of the proposals on the EU's legislative agenda get approved eventually. On most of these, we see a shift away from a low-regulation status quo favoured by business interests towards a high-regulation state favoured by citizen groups.
This is exactly what we are witnessing in the case of the EU's aforementioned data protection regulation. Although not yet finally approved, it seems likely that the regulation will go through in 2015 despite strong business opposition from large companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The result, while probably less far-reaching than the original Commission proposal, is unlikely to be a success for business. Business lobbying in the EU in this and many other cases is of a defensive nature; we see so much of it because business actors face a loss that they try to minimise.
What conclusion can we take away from this research? Overall, the project of European integration has been a major success for European business. Business actors on average benefitted from the liberalisation of intra-European trade. In the current phase of European integration, however, the popular perception of powerful business lobby groups likely overestimates the actual level of influence business exerts on EU legislation. On the whole, business actors now appear to be less successful than citizen groups in achieving their desired policy outcomes.

Tramlines is a true example of great summer sounds within the cityscape. Sheffield's favourite music weekend returns this weekend, check out our picks for the inner city festival:
The Libertines
The Libertines are a must on any festival goers line up, their chaotic infusion of punk rock, indie anthems make their live set something like no other. Having reformed once more in 2014 in front of 65,000 fans at London's Hyde Park, their Tramlines outing is relatively intimate though entirely fun and relevant.
Expect classics such as “Don't Look Back Into The Sun” and “Can't Stand Me Now” to get an outing alongside mass singalong such as “Time For Heroes” and “Music When The Lights Go Out.” Also expect modern classics such as “Gunga Din” and “Barbarians” taken from 2015 return album Anthems For Doomed Youth.
Cabbage
Described at Glastonbury as THE best punk band to come out of the Manchester region, Cabbage have a sound, political agenda and skill for relevant lyricism like no other. Their recent EP compilation release Young Dumb And Full of… is the perfect starting point for the new listener.
“Uber Capitalist Death Trade” and “Terrorist Synthesizer” are much loved within their ever growing fan base, though their rawest, most raucous sounds come in the form of early releases such as “Indispensable Pencil” and “Kevin.”
Goat Girl
Goat Girl's live set and recent releases prove that they are going from strength to strength. Unlike many a modern band they sound both different and intriguing. The South East London band sound like a refined but chaotic group, and that is EXACTLY what the world needs right now!
The female band, recently signed to Rough Trade, have a ferocious sound. Debut single release “Country Sleaze” intermingles heavy bass lines and echoey guitar chords. Unique voice is all the more overstated in follow-up release “Scum.” Their Sheffield return is set to be something quite spectacular.
Loyle Carner
A spoonerism of his surname, Loyle Carner truly is one of the true great talents within the UK's upcoming hip hop scene. Soulful, talented and intriguing, his sound is both relevant and relaxing. The Lambeth born artist is onto something special.
Watch out for tunes such as “Damselfly” and “Ain't Nothing Changed.”
The Big Moon
Formed in 2014, the London four pieces have gone from strength to strength recently, their debut album Love In The 4th Dimension was released just last month. They now embark on a summer festival tour in the form of their lives, having already impressed at Glastonbury, Dot to Dot and Radio 1's Big Weekend earlier in the year.
Stand out tracks include “Cupid” and “Formidable,” both signs of their melodic, interesting musical abilities. With unique lyrics and voice, mixed with guitar and effects alike, it is clear that they will be a stand out highlight of this year's festival.

PAKISTAN'S prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has long been caught between hawks demanding a decisive military confrontation with the Pakistani Taliban and doves adamant the militants can be talked into abandoning their bloody campaign against the government. Four weeks after Mr Sharif announced that he wanted to give peace talks another chance, he appears to have settled for a little of each.
The country's army, and many civilian critics, say that, with almost 500 people killed since September, Pakistan's domestic terrorism is out of hand, and that he must take a hard line. The prime minister's hopes of reviving the economy with the help of foreign investment will also be jeopardised by continued violence, they warn. And yet Mr Sharif and many members of his party fear confrontation will trigger horrific retaliation in their political heartland of Punjab, the rich, populous province so far relatively unscathed by militant attacks. They may be right.

Since February 20th the Pakistani Army has been bombing from the air what it claims are militant “hideouts” in the tribal areas of the country's restive north-west. On February 25th alone they claimed to have killed 30 terrorists in North and South Waziristan. At the same time the government clings to the forlorn hope that stalled negotiations with Taliban intermediaries could yet spark into life. On Monday the interior minister even suggested the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as the country's largest terrorist group calls itself, might like to participate in a cricket match to foster peace. (A TTP spokesman demurred, saying they did not approve of the game.)
Making matters trickier, Mr Sharif's main political threat in Punjab, Imran Khan, a popular former cricketer, is an unbending opponent of military action, claiming peace can be found simply by Pakistan distancing itself from the “US war” in the region.
Last month Mr Sharif appointed four go-betweens to act as negotiators with three extremist clerics invited to represent the TTP. The two sides held some meetings but stumbled, as critics had predicted, from the very beginning. The TTP, a movement committed to turning Pakistan into a strict Islamic state, balked at government demands that they negotiate within the framework of a constitution they regard as insufficiently divine. And on February 17th a faction of the TTP announced in a grisly video that it had executed 23 kidnapped Frontier Corps soldiers. Mr Sharif was unable to restrain the military in the face of such savagery (and the killing soon after of a senior officer in Peshawar), giving the generals permission to unleash air strikes. He may be tempted to continue indefinitely with the compromise, while shying away from the ground operation that would be required to obliterate the TTP's safe havens. But the mood is shifting.
Hasan Askari Rizvi, an analyst, expects a full ground invasion of North Waziristan by April. He says Pakistani military leaders fear the TTP will be greatly strengthened in the wake of the NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they predict will give the group's Afghan Taliban allies greater control of the east of the country. It is a prophecy even more likely to be realised if there were a complete American withdrawal this year. On February 25th Barack Obama warned his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai, that is exactly what could happen if Mr Karzai still refuses to sign a long-term security agreement. Mr Rizvi says that Pakistan's civilian government will not be able to stand in the way of an army determined to seize back North Waziristan. “They know better than to be on the wrong side of the army,” he says.
EXODUS 10:1-20
« Exodus 9 | Exodus 10 | Exodus 11 »
The Eighth Plague: Locusts
10:1 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them,
2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them, that you may know that I am the Lord .”
3 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the Lord , the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
4 For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,
5 and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field,
6 and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
7 Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?”
8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, “Go, serve the Lord your God. But which ones are to go?”
9 Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the Lord .”
10 But he said to them, “The Lord be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.
11 No! Go, the men among you, and serve the Lord , for that is what you are asking.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
12 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left.”
13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
14 The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.
15 They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
16 Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.
17 Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the Lord your God only to remove this death from me.”
18 So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the Lord .
19 And the Lord turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
20 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.

Inquiring minds are reading about student riots at the University of California.
Students at the University of California's flagship Berkeley campus took to the streets on Friday night, vandalizing university buildings, burning trash cans and clashing with police in the latest expression of frustration over cuts to the educational budget in California.
In November, the University of California Board of Regents voted to raise tuition by 32 percent. At the same time, professors were asked to take pay cuts or be furloughed, classes were eliminated and class size increased. Protests erupted across the University of California system, particularly at UC Davis and UCLA.
Student Loan Defaults Soar
Every year, tens of thousands of college students and graduates stop making payments on their student loans.
For more than a decade, that loan-default rate was in decline because the federal government toughened penalties for schools with high shares of defaults. Now, the rate is increasing again and not just because of the economy.
The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, which has the nation's highest overall default rate on federal student loans: 9.8 percent in fiscal year 2007, the latest figures available.
But more than default rates, it is the high levels of debt that are provoking alarm among consumer advocates. That has heightened scrutiny of for-profit schools.
Tuition at for-profit schools can easily top $10,000 a year. The average loans for a student who earned a bachelor's degree totaled $32,650 in the 2007-08 school year, compared with $17,700 at public universities. At community colleges, the average for two-year degrees was $7,125.
In Arizona, for-profit schools are booming. They have more than doubled the number of students they serve in the past five years, and more students are at for-profit schools than all three of the state's public universities combined.
Last school year, for-profit schools enrolled nearly 468,000 students, according to the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, a state agency that licenses and regulates most for-profit schools. About 55 percent were from Arizona, and the rest lived elsewhere and attended school online.
In December, the University of Phoenix settled a whistleblower lawsuit in federal court for $78.5 million over recruiter-pay practices. Two former enrollment counselors sued in 2004, alleging the school defrauded the government of billions of dollars in financial aid and violated federal law by paying recruiters based on enrollment. The company said the pay practices were legal because enrollment was not the sole determinant. The university did not admit any wrongdoing.
Nationally, for-profit schools had the highest share of defaults in the United States in 2007: 11 percent. Community colleges had a nearly 10 percent rate, and private, non-profit universities had the lowest rates, at 3.7 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Student Loan Scam
Millennials had better learn quickly that they face coming of age through middle age and end of life in a world in which they will be forced to consume one-third to half as much in per capita energy terms and associated material production and consumption.
Thus, they should be rioting to cut taxes and to cut government including cutting funding for places like "Berzerkley" and the many worthless programs and costly administrative and pension payouts.
What "Berzerkley" or a state or private university confers on the vast majority of students is a "credential" and "legitimacy" within the existing division of labor and state tax farm. Their "education" is mostly in terms of being conditioned to conform to the costly state superstructure, including submitting to tax, wage, and debt servitude for life.
What they will "learn" in terms of actual occupational skills, self-reliance, and productive wealth creation they could learn at a much lower cost (and higher return to them) than 4+ years of university "education" by actually doing something productive, paid or not, as a youth.
Rioting for more government largess extracted eventually from their meager paychecks in the future is suicide and merely sustains for a while longer the system they perceive themselves to be opposing or attempting to reform.
They are wasting their valuable time and youthful vitality rioting against the intractable state when they could be using their time and efforts to form productive private associations in parallel or outside the existing division of labor and social and political superstructure.
Expect More Riots
There will be more riots, and over more issues. Students are traditionally always the first to riot, since most of them are young and rebellious, and therefore it's easier to get them to engage in street protest and vent their anger.
The only groups that may even be more riot prone are French farmers and Greek public workers.
How Good Is That Education?

Turkish police have fired water cannon and rubber pellets to disperse a crowd gathered in central Istanbul for the city's annual gay pride parade.
The police appeared intent on stopping the crowd gathering near Taksim Square on Sunday, a cameraman for the Reuters news agency reported.
Al Jazeera's Serpil Karacan, reporting from Istanbul, said opposition members of parliament formed a human chain to block the riot police.
Images and videos posted on social media showed several people carrying gay pride flags running away while being fired upon by a water cannon mounted on an armoured police vehicle.
As of 1400 GMT, the protesters have left Taksim Square and the nearby Istikal Street, and the city is "back to normal" according to our correspondent.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, photojournalist Bradley Secker, who is at the scene in Taksim, said the gay pride marchers were "puzzled" by the police action, given that a similar parade on June 21 went on in Istanbul without any incident.
According to the AFP news agency, police took action against the crowd when demonstrators began shouting slogans accusing President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of "fascism".
No official comment has so far been issued by the government, but there were reports that the parade was stopped as it was Ramadan.
However, Karajan said the parade, which has been held over the past 13 years without police intervention, occured peacefully during Ramadan last year.
Taksim is a traditional rallying ground for demonstrators and saw weeks of unrest in 2013.

Donald Trump's election risks upsetting EU ties with the US "fundamentally and structurally", EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned.
"We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works," Mr Juncker told students in Luxembourg.
The Commission chief predicted that two years would be wasted while Mr Trump "tours a world he doesn't know".
His remarks contrasted with other EU leaders' more muted reaction to the Tuesday's shock election result.
American cities have seen angry protests since Mr Trump's election victory over the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
In New York, Mr Trump set about forming the team that will see him through to his inauguration on 20 January, when he replaces Barack Obama in the White House.
EU unease
Mr Juncker had offered his formal congratulations to Mr Trump on Wednesday in a joint statement with Donald Tusk, head of the European Council.
Speaking on Friday, he said: "In general the Americans take no interest in Europe...
"During the campaign, Mr Trump said Belgium was a village somewhere on our continent...
"He raises questions which could have harmful consequences because he calls into question the trans-Atlantic alliance, and thus the model on which Europe's defence rests.
"He takes a view of refugees and non-white Americans which does not reflect European convictions and feelings."

During the election campaign, Mr Trump caused alarm in EU circles with his sharp criticism of Nato, the cornerstone of Western Europe's defence structure, and calls for better relations with Russia.

His promise to "cancel" the Paris Climate Agreement within 100 days of taking office and protectionist stance on trade have also caused concern, as have his controversial comments about ethnic and religious minorities.
While EU leaders congratulated the Republican on his shock victory over Hillary Clinton, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed in her message to him that the US and Germany shared "the values of democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity, regardless of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political belief".
Germany, France and the Netherlands all face elections in the new year, with populist and far-right parties poised to capitalise on discontent with the EU's continuing migrant problem and its slow recovery from the eurozone debt crisis.
Before Mr Trump's victory, the EU had already been rocked by the UK's vote to leave the body at a referendum in June.
However, on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged his EU colleagues to take a more positive attitude.
"I would respectfully say to my beloved European friends and colleagues that it's time that we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election," he said on a visit to Serbia.
Meanwhile, in New York, outgoing UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was confident Mr Trump would not rip up the Paris agreement on climate change, despite his campaign pledge.
"He has made a lot of worrying statements but I am sure that he will understand the whole importance and seriousness and urgency," he told AFP news agency.

The reported plan to suspend part of U.S. military aid to Egypt reflects exactly what President Barack Obama announced in his speech at the UN General Assembly two weeks ago—continued aid to support counterterrorism and border security efforts, but withholding “prestige” items, like tanks and F-16s. The president also mentioned resumption of economic aid to support education, but we have seen no further news on that front as yet.
The Egyptian military is unlikely to overreact to this move—the Egyptian state paper has been spinning the president's words as representing U.S. acquiescence in Egypt's political trajectory and a resumption of aid—which is not inaccurate. So the announcement, when it finally comes, will present a half measure that will gain the U.S. little except closure on an awkward, months-long saga over Egypt aid—but given how telegraphed this move has been, I don't expect it will have much negative impact in Egypt either.
Having failed to suspend aid right after the coup, despite threatening to do exactly that, the administration was left with little choice but to define its least worst option. With this partial suspension, it hopes to make clear that there is some price (largely symbolic and perhaps temporary) for ignoring U.S. preferences. The administration hopes to show it they won't be overly influenced on Egypt policy by Gulf and Israeli lobbying for total aid resumption. And it hopes to sustain a working relationship with the people who are running Egypt—an objective which has been perhaps the only consistent component of the U.S. approach toward Egypt since the 2011 revolution.
None of this, of course, adds up to a policy that will achieve America's stated strategic objectives of stability, much less democracy—this is yet another short-term, interim measure designed to preserve narrow U.S. interests rather than advance broad ones. Given that instability—and violence—in Egypt are likely to increase in the coming months without some political accommodation with Islamists and restraints on the security forces, this is no solution. But unlike other short-term responses by the administration to developments in Egypt, like its overinvestment in President Mohamed Morsi during 2012-2013, this move does not foreclose larger policy shifts down the road. Egypt looks set to continue on the path to a managed electoral system with severe constraints on rights, accompanied by ongoing repression and continued violence against the state by Islamist extremists. In this case, a U.S. approach that keeps channels open but puts down some markers about the limits of U.S. acquiescence could be a decent start to a long-term effort at nudging the political system toward greater openness and refusing to buy into a wholesale Egyptian “war on terror,” while protecting near-term U.S. security interests. But such a long-term effort would have to have other components as well, including a resumption of engagement and support for Egypt's beleaguered human rights groups and clear communication with the Egyptian government and its allies about what terrorist threats the U.S. sees as priorities for mutual endeavor, and what threats are problems more of Egypt's own making, that the U.S. will not treat as equivalent priorities for its own efforts and support.
The question is whether the administration has developed any long-term approach along these lines. I have my doubts. If we see a resumption of most or all assistance after Egypt holds elections next year, that will signal that, despite President Obama's rhetoric, the administration is indeed returning to business as usual with Egypt.
The European Commission has informed pharmaceutical company Teva of its preliminary view that an agreement concluded with Cephalon was in breach of EU antitrust rules. Under the agreement, Teva committed not to market a cheaper generic version of Cephalon's drug for sleep disorders, modafinil.
Margrethe Vestager, Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said: "Market entry and competition by generic drugs is an essential element to improve the affordability of healthcare. In this case, our preliminary finding is that Teva and Cephalon broke EU antitrust rules by agreeing on Cephalon paying Teva to keep its cheaper generic version of Cephalon's sleep disorder drug modafinil out of the market. It's now up to the companies to respond to our concerns."
Modafinil was a blockbuster drug used to treat sleep disorders. Cephalon owned the patents for the drug and its manufacture. After certain Cephalon patents on the modafinil compound expired in the European Economic Area (EEA), Teva entered the UK market for a short period of time with a cheaper generic product.
Following a lawsuit concerning an alleged infringement of Cephalon's processing patents on modafinil, the companies settled their litigation in the UK and the US with a world-wide agreement. As part of this agreement Teva undertook not to sell its generic modafinil products in the EEA until October 2012. In exchange, Teva received a substantial transfer of value from Cephalon through a series of cash payments and various other agreements.
The Commission's preliminary view is that the transferred value served as a significant pay-for-delay inducement for Teva not to compete with Cephalon's modafinil worldwide, including in the European Economic Area. The Statement of Objections alleges that the patent settlement agreement between Cephalon and Teva may have caused substantial harm to EU patients and health service budgets. This is because they may have delayed the entry of a cheaper generic medicine, leading to higher prices for modafinil.
This behaviour, if confirmed, would infringe Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) that prohibits restrictive business practices.
In October 2011, Cephalon became a subsidiary of Teva. The Statement of Objections issued today is addressed to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and its subsidiary Cephalon Inc. The sending of a Statement of Objections does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.
Background
The Commission opened formal antitrust proceedings in April 2011.
The 2005 agreement between Teva and Cephalon was also subject to antitrust proceedings in the US (where the majority of modafinil sales were recorded over the same period). In particular, the Federal Trade Commission(FTC) filed an antitrust action against Cephalon in 2008. In May 2015, the FTC and Teva (parent company of Cephalon) reached a settlement ending the antitrust litigation.
A Statement of Objections is a formal step in Commission investigations into suspected violations of EU antitrust rules. The Commission informs the parties concerned in writing of the objections raised against them. The companies can then examine the documents on the Commission's investigation file, reply in writing and request an oral hearing to present their comments on the case before representatives of the Commission and national competition authorities.
There is no legal deadline for the Commission to complete antitrust inquiries into anticompetitive conduct. The duration of an antitrust investigation depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the extent to which the undertaking concerned cooperates with the Commission and the exercise of the rights of defence.
The Statement of Objections follows the Commission decisions concerning the "pay-for-delay" agreements addressed to Lundbeck (2013), Johnson & Johnson (2013), Servier (2014) and a number of generic companies. On 8 September 2016, the General Court upheld the Commission decision appealed by Lundbeck and others (see MEMO/16/2994). The proceedings concerning the decision appealed by Servier and others are still pending.
The Commission's competition inquiry of 2009 into the pharmaceutical sector indicated a number of structural issues and problems in companies' practices that potentially lead to distortions of competition and delays to entry of new, innovative and cheaper generic medicines into the EU market (see IP/09/1098 and MEMO/09/321). In the final report, the Commission made a number of recommendations to address these problems, and emphasised stronger competition law enforcement with regard to patent settlements. Since the inquiry, the Commission has monitored patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical sector on an annual basis.
More information on this investigation is available on the Commission's competitionwebsite, in the public case register under the reference 39686.
Acko is an under-the-radar startup that wants to disrupt India's insurance industry through a digital-only model. This week it stuck its head above the parapet and announced that it has raised $30 million to get started on its bold plan.
Founded by Varun Dua, the man behind insurance comparison site Coverfox, Acko is designed as a wholly digital take on insurance in India. The company is an independent general insurance provider that is wholly digital. Beyond operating online and without the expense of a brick and mortar footprint, Acko is aiming to unbundle insurance in India to make it both more affordable and relevant to consumers.
“India is a fairly nascent insurance market [with the same] traditional carriers that we've seen for decades,” CEO Dua told TechCrunch in an interview. “Acko will be the first internet-only carrier.”
Taking insurance in India online
Inspired by models such as Lemonade and Oscar Health in the U.S. and Direct Line in the UK, Dua sees a huge opportunity to tap into digital to take a shot at the current market — which is estimated to be worth over $10 billion annually — and reach a new segment of consumers who have been left out to date.
“The system of distribution in India does not provide information on the user at all. There's not enough data to underwrite accurately on a real-time basis,” Dua said. “Sales are mostly offline and flat pricing, usually [insurance firms] don't know much about a customer before underwriting him.
The Acko CEO believes his firm can offer a 30-40 percent discount on incumbents by pricing its policies more accurately by gathering information and data online. That's in addition to cost savings by operating without a physical presence.
“We will probably start off taking away existing [insurance rivals'] customers,” he added. “It's a relatively easier market because people are moving online year on year. That gives us the early pickings, [but we] will probably be launching smaller and unique products that don't exist today later.”
In particular, he foresees opportunity around segment-specific insurance policies that can be sold online. That could include, for example, pregnancy insurance, or policies for ride-sharing companies. Beyond selling on the Acko website, the plan is to link arms with partners who already have relationships with consumers — for example an e-commerce store selling baby items, or the ride-sharing firm itself.
In a recent report, EY forecast that India's insurance market is “poised for a strong growth” despite concerns around reaching new customers:
Despite strong improvement in penetration and density in the last 10 years, India largely remains an under-penetrated market. The market today is primarily dependent on push, tax incentives and mandatory buying for sales. There is very little customer pull, which will come from growing financial awareness and increasing savings and disposable income.
That's a major focus for Acko.
“We want to make insurance so straightforward that consumers don't need to talk to multiple people to get advice or fill up forms. Consumers should be able to access low prices in one click based on their risk profile, and be confident that at a press of a button — their claim will get paid in the fastest possible time,” Dua added in a statement.
Big name backers and big plans
To get started, Acko has raised $30 million from a range of top names that include VC firms Accel, SAIF Partners and Catamaran Ventures. Its angel investors include Venk Krishnan and Subba Rao of NuVentures, Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, Hemendra Kothari of DSP Blackrock, founder and chairman of Hexaware Atul Nishar, and ex-investment baker and Arpwood Capital founder Rajeev Gupta.
Beyond that, Dua teased that there are undisclosed “global insurance groups” that own a stake of the business. Their names won't be revealed for another month or so, but their presence has helped give the startup credibility in an industry that values corporate institutions.
Acko has received an R1 license and is currently awaiting its R2 license which has been applied for with India's insurance authority. Dua anticipates that the final nod should come within three months, leaving the company ready to open its doors and launch products for consumers before the end of September this year.
The initial plan is to be active in three or four cities until Acko has shown that “the claims pieces is something we are able to control and optimize,” according to Dua.
The team, which is currently around 20 people, is likely to grow to 45-50 by the year end, to help Dua hit his ambitious targets.
“We believe we should do close to $40 million in premiums over first year,” Dua said. “On a five-year perspective, we would love to reach anything from $500 million in premiums.”
The Agony of Feeling Indecisive
Indecisive. The inability – or the temporary paralysis – to decide when presented with more than one choice.
Have you ever felt indecisive?
It Is Agonizing!
It is like an itch that you cannot scratch, one that keeps you from doing anything else until you make your decision and move on.
You may need to decide which major to pick for your university, whether to stay in your job or quit to build your business, and if it's a good idea to marry your boyfriend or wait longer to get to know him. And a billion other decisions that on the surface seem easy enough but for an indecisive mind, they are pure agony.
And it's not like you haven't done your due diliegence.
You have done all the hard work and research to arrive at a smart, informed, educated decision. You have weighed your options, done the pros and cons exercise, and even tackled the “worst case scenarios”.
So then you sit down for the umpteenth time to finally decide.You talk to yourself rationally about your ‘best option' and how it makes the ‘most sense', and you tell yourself that it is definitely, without a doubt, absolutely and positively your ‘final decision'. Period.
Except you pause again. You second guess one thing and the next and the whole thing falls apart again. You lose all faith in making the “right” decision for yourself.
The indecisive feeling returns and it has brought along a new friend, depression. Not only are you back to square one, you are also feeling depressed that you have wasted all that time without making any progress.
Fear of Deciding “Wrong” Is A Myth
Why is it that sometimes you just can't make decisions?
One reason is that making a decision feels so final, so permanent and so irreversible that you keep dragging your feet.
Your greatest worry is this: What if you decide wrong?
What if you choose the wrong path, pick the wrong partner, or choose the wrong job? If every decision dictates the subsequent events that follow in life, would you not then be “ruining” the chances of success and happiness by choosing wrong?
Such is the insanity of the human mind. In fact, this worry is so enormous that you never even consider the remote possibility of deciding incredibly right!
Or yet another remote possibility that there may not even be a right or wrong to choose from, only an experience to live through.
Your mind tells you to fear the wrong outcome and so you absolve yourself of the responsibility of making a decision, because, you explain to yourself logically, if you don't decide, how can you decide wrong?
Well, it turns out that you can decide wrong because indecision is still a decision and it's the worst decision. The worst outcome of all is not deciding “wrong”. It is not deciding at all. With indecision, you give up the power to decide and you essentially hand that power to others to decide for YOU.
There are no wrong decisions if you make the best decision at the time with all the resources and information at your disposal. If you choose to await further instructions, that's fine but decide when the time feels right without worry or procrastination.
There are no mistakes. If you choose the “wrong” major, you learn from it. If you pick the “wrong” partner, you also learn from it. And if you even choose the “wrong” job or career, God knows you will so learn from that too.
Deciding wrong, making mistakes and failing at your relationships or your career can be the best thing that happened to you. But not deciding at all, not living with intention, not charting your own course with your own values and desires, or staying locked up in a careful state of doing very little so as to be safe, those are the recipes for regret and depression.
I only see TWO outcomes here with only ONE truth:
The TWO Outcomes: Either (1) you make the decision or (2) someone else makes the decision on your behalf.
The ONE truth: Only you know what's best for you. Anyone else that decides for you is only making a wild uneducated guess on your behalf.
One Question to Ask Yourself When Feeling Indecisive
I know how it feels to be indecisive, and how to wish that someone would make that decision for you so you don't have to do it. I know because whenever that happened to me, I would go ahead and let others decide for me. I let the opinion of friends impact my decisions and my path, and sometimes, I just sat there not deciding until the windows of opportunity closed shut and the choices vanished before I acted on them.
And that is how I know that deciding is far better than not deciding at all.
There is a simple singular question to ask yourself when you feel indecisive:
What's better: a life of mistakes or a life of procrastination?
Think long and hard about this one. Think about what it means to decide and move on with your own story or to sit there, biding your time, dragging your feet only to wake up to closed doors and lost chances.
And know this, you cannot blame anyone else for your indecision. It is in your own powers to change that now.
When I help my clients make difficult decisions in their careers and lives, I am careful never to tell them what to do, even if they wish I did but instead to give them the tools and systems and help they need to make the best decision on their own. That's true empowerment.
And that's what I want to give you now: empowerment. You are in charge of your own life. The reason you are afraid of making a decision rarely has to do with the decision itself, so look deeper. Maybe you are just waiting for approval on your decision? Maybe you need validation? Maybe a part of you needs a guarantee that it will all work out?
Well, stop waiting for those things, sweet heart!. Life does not come with guarantees, validation is the last thing that can help you and seeking the approval of others will lead you to disappointment.
Mistakes Or Procrastination? Take Your Pick!
With mistakes, you learn, you grow, you adapt, you toughen up, you gain experience and wisdom, you mature and you become a better person.
And this is only if you make the wrong decision, which is all relative.
In the grand scheme of life, making your own decisions is exercising one of your greatest human rights. Why would you ever give it up so that others make decisions for you?
With procrastination, you lose opportunity, you miss out on life, you regret, you worry, you second-guess, you depend on others, you give up your powers and become a lesser version of yourself.
Choose mistakes over procrastination. Every Single Time.
Arriving at Decisions
Do your homework, your research, and your due diligence. Seek the expert opinion of everyone you respect. But in the end, make your decision on your own, with an open heart and a brave heart and trust yourself to do it right. Let it go and stop obsessing over it after it's done!
Trust yourself that whatever reality presents beyond your decision is going to be the best thing that happens. And you have the power to change course again if need be, but the course you have now chosen is the perfect choice with the information and conditions present to you.
Google Home might not be the most popular voice assistant to offer convenient information in exchange for reams of personal data, but it appears to be the first to serve ads directly into users' living rooms.

Bryson Meunier, a Chicago-based SEO marketing professional, filmed a bizarre interaction with one the search giant's friendly robot obelisks earlier today. After Meunier asked what his day “was like,” Google's knowledge cylinder responded with the current time, local weather, and information about his commute—before launching into a 15-second ad for Beauty and the Beast complete with musical accompaniment and sound effects.
When asked for comment, Google gave the following statement to The Verge and Search Engine Land: “This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” We haven't heard back from Google yet, but they'll likely send the same thing, so let's dissect.
To be clear, this is absolutely an ad. It encourages people to exchange money for a product, is wedged in the middle of unrelated material, and uses a different soundtrack to call attention to the fact that it's not related to the main message, a technique used by many podcasts. And no matter how much ass-covering the word “partners” is supposed to be doing here, Disney is not listed as a partner company on Google's own website.

Delving past the obvious obfuscation, even the statement reads just like ad copy. Beauty? Be our guest? Google must be trolling. To which I say both “hah” and “fuck off.”
Meunier's experience isn't an isolated incident, as it was easily replicated by Marketingland's Danny Sullivan. If this heralds the dawn of an ad-supported future for digital assistants, I guess the only surprise is that we didn't see it coming sooner.
Update 3/16/17 6:13 EDT: Business Insider writer Steve Kovach obtained a statement from a Google spokesperson who claims the 15-second audio clip encouraging Home users to see Beauty and the Beast “wasn't intended to be an ad.” Huh. The spokesperson went on to say the following [emphasis ours]:
What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.

I, for one, can't wait to have Google surface “timely content” for other things I can pay money for.

A Moment Before Dying
There is a moment, immediately before life becomes no longer worth living, when the world appears to slow down and all its myriad details suddenly become brightly, achingly apparent.
For Alex, that moment came after exactly one week of pain, seven days of searing, tormenting agony that poured forth from his belly. Alex never liked his belly. Growing up he was always fat, surrounded by a family of bellowing, rotund Americans, who had a room in their house with wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling cabinets, all entirely filled with bags and boxes of various pre-processed semi-organic assemblages, which they used to stuff their faces at all hours of the day.
Alex had body image issues. He'd avoid mirrors because he couldn't bear to look at himself, his large bulbous cheeks obscuring his fine features. He avoided photos, covering his face or ducking out of the way when the click of the camera came, for the same reason: he didn't want to be confronted with the physical evidence of his disgusting nature, thought he could not go on living if he had to face the truth.
It wasn't until he got away from his family that he discovered his weight was not an immutable characteristic, like the fingerprints he often mused about burning off, like the dental records which had caused him so much adolescent anguish, like the DNA he'd heard so much about in school. He would take off his shirt and stare at his stomach in the full-length mirror. It was there, of course, hideous as ever, but also appreciably smaller. Its size, he realized, could change.
So Alex starved himself. Cut down from three meals a day to simply two and then to only one. And even that became superfluous most days. Alex simply wasn't hungry.
He watched his stomach dwindle, monitored his progress on the electronic readout of his at-home scale, charted the numbers on his computer, admired the plunging trendlines.
He was doing so well. He told all his friends. The secret to losing weight, he would explain, is simply not eating. You just get used to it after a while. He looked at the beggars outside his window and refrained from giving them change so that they too could experience this miracle. He changed the channel when the radio began speaking about starvation in Africa. “Starvation isn't so bad,” he scoffed. “You get used to it after a while.” He wondered whether the USDA thrifty food budget could be further reduced.
He stopped going out. His friends always wanted to meet him for meals, or for drinks, events in which Alex simply wasn't interested anymore. Before long, Alex's friends were no longer interested in him.
Alex started eating in cafés, ordering a small pastry, sitting in a comfortable chair, listening to the music play over the loudspeakers. Soon he stopped doing even that.
Alex read on the Internet about death. There was a theory, increasingly well supported, that eating is what killed you. They found that rats on extremely restricted diets, rats who ate very few calories, lived impressively long. They saw the same results with other animals, up to and including chimpanzees. They suspected, but could not prove, the same was true of humans. Every little bite of food was another step towards death.
Alex started eating again. His appetite grew as slowly as it had declined but within months he was back to eating three meals a day. Food suddenly gave him pleasure again. He savored the tastes on his tongue.
One night he and his friends decided to try a new restaurant. But when the food came, Alex couldn't eat it. He thought it smelled funny. He let it sit there, his plate lying on the table, his food seething, untouched.
The next night Alex couldn't sleep. He'd wake up, feeling searing pains in his stomach, as if the food winding its way through his gut had spikes and was tearing apart the walls of his intestine.
He suffered like this for days, rolling on the floor in agony, unable to resist eating but every bite he ate causing him unimaginable pain. And still, he could not stop.
Five days in, it seemed like the worst had passed. The pains came less frequently, the pains were less intense. He actually slept that night.
The day Alex killed himself, he was awoken by pains, worse than ever. He rolled back-and-forth in bed as the sun came up, the light streaming through the windows eliminating the chance for any further sleep. At 9, he was startled by a phone call. The pains subsided, as if quieting down to better hear what the phone might say.
It was his boss. He had not been to work all week. He had been fired. Alex tried to explain himself, but couldn't find the words. He hung up the phone instead.
The day Alex killed himself, he wandered his apartment in a daze. The light streaming through the windows gave everything a golden glow, which had the odd effect of making the filth he'd become surrounded with seem cinematic.
Alex wanted to go outside for one last meal, but he had trouble making the appropriate connections. Jacket, shoes, pants, wallet. Each lay in a different spot upon the floor. Alex knew they went together, he drew lines connecting them in his mind's eye, but it didn't see to fix anything, his eyes just kept bouncing from one item to another.
Finally, he summoned the intelligence to put them on. The world seemed funny afterwards. He noticed the way the key turned in the lock, like a hand rotating in front of his face, an interplay of light and shadow, objects in space. He noticed the packages sitting at his doorstep, begging him to open them, but their labels insisting that they were addressed to someone else. He noticed the frail old ladies who refused to obey the walk—don't walk signs and instead walked slowly, backs hunched, across a major intersection.
He went to a new café across the street, the one place he hadn't been to yet. Light streamed in through the huge picture windows, making the whole place seem bright and airy. So much light, in fact, that the outside seemed a glow, as if the café was suspended in the middle of a powerful white light. People held lowered, indistinct conversations. People on his left, people on his right, people behind him. But one conversation seemed to be coming from the ceiling. It might have been a trick of the acoustics. He looked up and saw two speakers staring back at him and listened closely.
The café was not playing music. It was playing a recording of two people's lowered, indistinct conversation.
The day Alex killed himself, he had a sudden, powerful craving for a Key Lime Sugar Cookie. It was odd the power the Key Lime Sugar Cookie had over him. Alex did not particularly like limes of any sort. In fact, the idea of an actual actual, as with all fruits, thoroughly disgusted him. He hated how when he ordered sparkling water at fancy restaurants they would place a lime wedge on the top of his glass, how he had to confront the disgusting object every time he tried to take a sip, how touching the lime, even to remove it, was so digusting as to be simply out of the question.
And yet, here it was, this cookie, with the lime flavor baked into the center and large transparent grains of sugar embedded in the top, begging for him, begging for one last taste. The cookie was sold exclusively by a publicly-traded chain of cafés that tried hard to seem international, giving itself a foreign-sounding title and printing the names of major world cities on every door, even though it had not expanded much beyond the eastern half of the United States. Alex purchased the cookie.
He noticed the way he couldn't quite form the words to request it, simply presented the cookie in front of the cashier and twitched his head, assuming (correctly) that in context the request would be understood. He noticed the way his hands moved haphazardly to remove the appropriate amount of money from his wallet. He noticed the way his change spilled out onto the counter as he tried to find the quarter with which to complete the transaction. He noticed the way he wobbled as he walked as he took the now-purchased cookie outside.
The day Alex killed himself, he savored his one remaining cookie, the sweetness of the embedded sugar grains, the bizarre flavor of what must have been lime. He used his tongue to wipe the remaining crumbs from his teeth, tossed the now-empty bag it had come in into the trash, and stepped out into the middle of the street.

Public-school teachers are suing the city to keep control of their lesson plans away from supervisors — a move that scored an “F” from reformers.
The United Federation of Teachers filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court Thursday asking a judge to confirm a little-noticed May arbitrator's decision declaring that teachers — not principals — are in charge of deciding what goes into lesson plans.
But reformers fear that if the union wins the suit, it could have a devastating effect on students.
“It's outrageous that teachers believe they don't need to share their lesson plans with the principal beforehand,” said Mona Davids, president of the New York City Parents Union, who plans to oppose the suit. “How is a principal supposed to ensure students are receiving a high-quality education?”
The union is taking the extra legal step to strengthen its hand on the issue. Even if teachers have control now, a judge's decision would be stronger than an arbitrator's under a challenge.
“This lawsuit is union boss Mike Mulgrew's latest attempt to gum up the works at the expense of our kids,” thundered Jenny Selis, head of reform-minded nonprofit StudentsFirstNY. “The only reason for this frivolous ­legal action is to protect the poorly performing teachers who don't properly plan and aren't serving our kids well.”
The UFT didn't even want principals to be able to collect lesson plans, but arbitrator Deborah Gaines, in a May 16 ruling, denied the union's request.
During the arbitration hearing, a Department of Education representative noted that the union defended a teacher who “merely strung together a list of song titles” and called that a lesson plan.
Total lack of oversight “would, in fact, diminish the professionalism of teachers,” the DOE argued.
A spokeswoman for the principals union said the organization isn't planning to challenge the move, since principals can still see the plans and make suggestions.
Mulgrew defended the union's case to The Post. He said in a statement that teacher control over lesson plans “helps to reduce the amount of paperwork ­required of teachers.”
He added that teachers themselves should be empowered to decide what happens in the classroom.
A spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said, “We will review the petition upon receipt.”
SOPA and PIPA are knocked-out. ACTA is on the ropes… time to relax? Not yet, meet the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the new front in the War on Piracy™. While there is already a trade agreement under this name, the TPP has been enhanced and in November last year the leaders of Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States announced a new proposed agreement. Much like ACTA, the TPP will operate as a multilateral trade agreement between the United States and selected trading partners. As such, it contains several provisions on aspects related to international trade, including its own chapter on IP rights.
There is much to talk about this chapter, it contains everything that seems to frustrate the US Trade Representative (USTR) at this time. It creates a broadcasting right, it erodes the first-sale doctrine, it enhances anti-circumvention of technological protection measures, and it improves criminal liability for infringement, amongst other things. However, the section that intrigued me the most is Art 13.3 (b), which to my mind seems to completely change the regime for limitation of intermediary liability that exists in large number of legislations. Allow me to elaborate.
Intermediaries, such as ISPs, search engines, e-commerce vendors, social networks, content aggregators, and similar online services, have limited liability for the content posted by their customers if they have take-down procedures in place, such as the DMCA's process. This limitation allows online businesses to operate without fear of constant interruption and/or crippling lawsuits that would not allow them to function properly. While the current system of take-down notices is problematic (see Chilling Effects), it still is better than the alternative.
Why this attack on intermediaries? It seems like the new enemy of content is Google with its search engines linking to infringing materials and user-generated content. As three-strikes models seem to have failed, suing customers has been a PR disaster, and even arresting and suing providers of torrent tracker sites and digital lockers has not dented piracy, the copyright industries have decided to go against the intermediaries that allow some of this content to get to you, namely, Google. However, those intermediaries are protected by the law at present, specifically laws that create safe harbors against indiscriminate liability. What to do? Well, change the law of course! Enter TPP.
TPP comes with a large number of caveats that cripple intermediary immunity. From the start it makes it clear that it is attempting to erode existing practices when it narrows down the definition of the types of services that are exempt from liability for infringement. These are:
“(A) transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof;
(B) caching carried out through an automatic process;
(C) storage, at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider;
and
(D) referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.”
This seems reasonable, but for two things. Firstly, it is evidently an exhaustive list, so it must be assumed that any function that is not mentioned will be liable. Secondly, the article further specifies that even if the above services are not to be considered liable, to achieve this status the intermediaries must comply with several conditions. In other words, it imposes a specific type of behaviour from providers, and if they do not follow such guidelines, then they can be sued for secondary infringement.
What are these conditions? For caching services, the access can only be limited to approved users, refreshing of information must comply with “industry standards”, it cannot interfere with technical standards (it cannot circumvent any TPMs), and access to the cache must be removed upon notice of the owner. In other words, we will have a take-down system for cached information. This may seem arcane, but lots of sites now use cache services (including this blog), so we would be affected. But where the attack on intermediaries really comes in force is with regards to storage services (e.g. cloud and digital lockers), and linking and/or referring services (search engines, and in theory, any site with a link to infringing material, namely, torrent sites like TPB). These services will have to comply with the following list of conditions:
The service provider must not receive “a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity”. In other words, Megaupload.
The provider must expeditiously remove content upon receipt of notification. So, remove first, ask questions later.
The site must have a representative to receive such notifications. This really bothers me, all providers, no matter how big or small, must have a removal officer or a similar employee. This will really affect SMEs!
The service provider must have “a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers”. So TPP contains a three-strikes provision after all, but it is a very sneaky manner to carry out three-strikes. It creates an obligation on intermediaries to adopt disconnection regimes, or else.
Even worse, the TPP will still allow a court to order the disconnection and/or termination for any operator of the above services. Similarly, a court has the power to order specific content to be removed from any service, even if the provider fulfills all of the conditions specified above. This truly would mean an end to limitation of liability for all practical purposes. I cannot begin to say how damaging this would be for the Internet in the countries that would adopt TPP. SOPA did not have anything as toxic as this.
I realised recently that the traditional copyright industries are out to get intermediaries when I read this year's Special 301 submission by the International Intellectual Property's Alliance (IIPA) to the USTR. They are recommending to name Costa Rica as one of the top IP offending countries. What sin have we committed? Back in December, the government passed a decree that enacts a system of limitation of liability for intermediaries. Good stuff actually. However, apparently we left too many openings for those leeches:
“Nevertheless, the decree sets forth overly long time periods by which ISPs are to forward notifications sent by right holders, and in practical terms creates a serious obstacle for the enforcement of rights in the digital environment. As a matter of example, the decree allows an ISP up to 45 days just to forward a single notification to its subscriber. In the modern market for copyrighted works, the critical time for rights holders to recoup their considerable investment can be a matter of weeks before consumer interest begins to wane. If copyright owners must compete with free unauthorized copies that can remain online for over a month, that opportunity is lost.”
So, heaven forbid that an intermediary service provider will be given time to ascertain if the claim is valid. Allegedly infringing content must be removed ASAP.
So it is time to prepare strong opposition to the TPP, even in countries that are not directly affected. If we know anything about IP maximalism, is that it propagates. Once these provisions have been adopted somewhere, there will be pressure to have them implemented everywhere.
Sound the alarm, this one really is important.
The patient is expected to arrive ‘within the next several days', the university said in a statement
Emory University Hospital in Atlanta is set to receive a patient infected with the deadly Ebola disease currently sweeping through swaths of west Africa.
The patient is expected to arrive “within the next several days”, the university said in a statement. The exact date of arrival is not yet known. The university did not give the patient's name.
“Emory University Hospital has a specially built isolation unit set up in collaboration with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to treat patients who are exposed to certain serious infectious diseases. It is physically separate from other patient areas and has unique equipment and infrastructure that provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation,” the university said.
Reuters is reporting that the patient is one of the two American humanitarian aid workers infected with Ebola while responding to the outbreak in Liberia. Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, have both showed signs of improvement, but remain in serious condition.
The disease, which has no known cure, has reportedly killed at least 700 people during the current outbreak, in which there have been more than 1,000 confirmed, probable or suspected infections.
A few days ago, several Facebook groups for Romanian atheists and agnostics, including two that were parody pages about God and Jesus Christ, were shut down without warning to any of their administrators. Some of them are simply inaccessible to Romanians while available in other countries — it's unclear whether that's Facebook's doing or that of Romanian Internet service providers. Combined, these pages had upwards of 100,000 Likes/followers.
There's reason to believe the censorship stems from Patriarch Daniel, the leader of the Romanian Orthodox Church, who may have been upset about this image posted to the “God” parody page (***Update*** 1/29/14: I'm told that this is likely not the reason for the censorship):
That roughly translates to: Want to be protected from Satan? Then pay up.
In addition to trying to plead their case to Facebook — good luck with that — some Romanian atheists have written the following open letter to the company, hoping that it might get more eyeballs. I'm honored to publish that letter here (emphases mine):
An open letter to Facebook: We, the undersigned, are writing to express our dismay and to request explanations for the recent wave of attacks against Romanian atheist Facebook pages and groups. In the last few days, two of the main pages administered by the Romanian atheist community have been closed for allegedly posting content not complying to the Facebook guidelines and for “harassment”. The main Facebook group used by the Romanian atheist community has also been shut down, as well as some personal accounts of people involved in the community. While we understand that community guidelines are important on a communication platform such as Facebook, we fail to see how these latest decisions follow regular procedures as they all seem to be part of the same purposeful campaign to silence the atheist voice in the Romanian online media. We should also point out that several similar pages and groups exist and that on many occasions the content provided on the Romanian pages has been inspired, translated or adapted from those pages that still seem to be doing well. The atheist community has never posted racist materials, has never sent spam, has never promoted any kind of hate speech against any religious people and has always attempted to only ridicule ideas and not attack the people that were promoting those ideas. It is clear that some religious groups might not want their propaganda to be criticized in any way. We have even seen communications in religious groups that referred to a concerted action of reports against atheist pages and groups and plans to widen the reports to other pages that disagree with their beliefs. This is not the outcome of just a number of individuals feeling they are “harassed” or “discriminated” against, but the intentional and organized action of a group that feels they can and should dictate what the public discourse should be like. We also understand that their numbers might be vastly larger than ours. But this should not be a factor in any decision to shut down pages or groups, as minorities of any kind also have a right to express themselves and not be silenced by the majority. All things considered, we feel Facebook was wrong on allowing this to happen without giving detailed explanations or any specific instructions on how we could remedy the situation. We are saddened by this turn of events and hope the international community will take a stand with us for our right to express ourselves which should indeed include the right to poke fun at any ideas, including religious beliefs.

Wealth of China's richest lawmakers rises by a third
BEIJING: The richest members of China´s parliament and its advisory body have grown even richer, a body that tracks wealth in China said on Friday.
Led by National People´s Congress (NPC) delegate Ma Huateng, the chairman of tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, with a net worth of 295 billion yuan ($46 billion), the top 100 representatives had a total net worth of 3.91 trillion yuan, the Shanghai-based Hurun Report said.
Their total wealth rose by one-third over the 12 months to Jan. 31, according to Reuters´ calculations based on Hurun´s data. While Chinese President Xi Jinping has led a crackdown on corruption and made the fight against poverty a priority, representatives of the NPC and the Chinese People´s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body to the government, include some of the communist-ruled country´s wealthiest businessmen.
The NPC could not be reached for comment about its ultra-wealthy delegates, and a CPPCC press representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hurun identified 153 delegates as each being worth 2 billion yuan or more, the lowest number in five years. But although the total numbers of the super-rich in the two government bodies was down, their combined wealth, at 4.12 trillion yuan, was nearly 18 percent higher than the total wealth of rich lawmakers last year.
It's not fair that Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III were compared during the draft process, are compared now, and will be compared throughout their NFL careers.
But let's compare them anyway.
I watch every rookie quarterback snap for ATL's weekly review. I made the case that RG3 deserves the slight nod thus far in the race for Offensive Rookie of the Year, but noted how conventional stats don't show how well Luck has been playing. There isn't some gap between the players so far; both players have been sensational in very different circumstances.
The reaction from the aggrieved RG3 Nation was intense. They believed it was ridiculous to say the two quarterbacks have performed at a close level, and that I was stretching it to look at the advanced statistics. But those statistics help tell the story that shows up on tape every week.
Luck badly trails Griffin in conventional stats such as completion percentage, yards-per-attempt, and quarterback rating. On the other hand, Chase Stuart of NYTimes.com notes that Luck's average pass attempt travels 10.2 yards, the top mark in the NFL. The average distance Luck's passes travel on completions is 8.6 yards, also tops in the league. RG3 runs a much more controlled offense and his numbers in these categories are below the league average. In some ways, the Redskins' use of Griffin is traditional and conservative. (Note: This is good coaching, not a criticism.)
Luck is helped less than any quarterback by yards after the catch. He has the highest percentage of passes of any quarterback to wide receivers; he's not checking the ball down. ESPN also ranks Luck as the most valuable running quarterback in the NFL. No quarterback has rushed for more first downs on scrambles. No quarterback has converted more third downs on scrambles.
Both rookie quarterbacks have been sensational in accomplishing what their coaches ask of them this year. The Colts ask Luck to throw downfield to a very suspect receiver group outside of Reggie Wayne. They threw him into the deep end of the pool right away.
"If you go back and look at my history, I throw it deep more than anybody in the league," Colts offensive coordinator/interim head coach Bruce Arians told Bob Kravitz of the Indianapolis Star. "We do spread people out and throw it quickly; we think we have everything, but we also use our tight ends and backs to help the offensive line. We want to throw it to the guys who are paid to catch it, and hand it off to the guys who are paid to run it. We're not a West Coast offense by any means."
Luck's protection also has been suspect. He shows an incredible ability to avoid the pass rush and still make plays in the pocket. Griffin similarly is calm under pressure, and he's been even more consistently accurate than Luck.
I would give Griffin the slight edge this year for consistency. But Luck is so much better than the conventional stats indicate. ESPN's Total QBR ranks Luck sixth, ahead of Griffin in eighth place. We can argue over numbers all day, but it's incredible there's a strong case to be made both rookies are already top-10 quarterbacks.
It's not fair to compare these guys after only half a season. It's almost impossible to pick one over the other. But it is fun to try.
Kravitz says he would still take Luck over Griffin long-term. As sensational as Griffin has been thus far, I'm inclined to agree.

Foreign couples will be asked if they are living together before getting married as part of an immigration clampdown.

Foreign couples will be quizzed on relationship to identify sham marriages
Marriage registrars are to be handed wide-ranging powers to crack down on widespread abuses by non-EU nationals to secure immigration status.
The Government is increasingly worried at the growth in the number of sham marriages involving asylum seekers and European citizens.
Now fresh legislation will allow the registrars to gauge whether a proposed marriage is a sham and alert the immigration authorities.
Registrars will be able to:
Investigate if those involved in a proposed marriage speak a common language.
Inquire into the number of meetings the couple have had.
Ask about whether they have lived together in the past or if they currently live together.
Determine how familiar each person is with the personal details of the other party and examine if there are immigration-related motives for the marriage.
Immigration officials said the legislation would be a key measure in targeting abuses of EU free movement rights. They have identified what they believe to be unusual surges of movement within the common travel area and say a pattern has emerged where single, male Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals, who have previously been living in the UK, have arrived in Ireland to claim asylum. The authorities fear that many of them are using their time here, while their asylum claim is being processed, to find a European citizen to marry.
The total number of asylum applications so far this year has exceeded 1,700 - more than double the number for the corresponding period last year.
The increase is particularly stark in the numbers from Pakistan and Bangladesh, with more than 800 applications received from Pakistani nationals, compared with just 91 for the first seven months of 2014. A similar pattern has emerged for Bangladesh, with more than 150 applications received.
Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald and Tánaiste and Social Protection Minister Joan Burton are working closely with the Registrar General Kevin Feely on the implementation of the new legislation.
Ms Burton told the Irish Independent last night that the new rules would hamper attempts to broker so-called sham marriages in the State.

It seems the two most common times to stop BJJ are at white belt and at blue belt. White belt makes a lot of sense. You get a lot of people who want to try it out, realize it's weird to be in such close contact with a stranger, or see that BJJ is much harder than Jacare makes it look, or find out it's just not their thing. In some ways, it's like everything else. Get in, try it out, see if it's for you.
The second belt that people often quit at is blue. This one is a bit harder to understand. For most people, by the time they get to blue they've put in a couple years (I had around 500 hours on the mat by the time I got my blue. So it wasn't a small investment.) But at the same time, in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty early on.
I got my blue a little over 6 months ago. A day I will remember for quite some time. It was after a lot of hard work, and literal blood, sweat and tears (and I'm not even talking about the test.) I was pumped. I had been able to accomplish something. I was moving up.
However, over the past couple months, I've started to see a bit more about why some people stop at blue. Now, as I'm typing this, I have no plans of quitting, so it's nothing like that, but I can begin to see why some people would. But over the last 2 to 2.5 months I've been out of the gym twice for 2+ weeks. The first time I had ringworm on my arm, the second time we were moving. In addition to those extended absences, I also missed days here and there as we had to go look at houses on a gym night, or I had to skip a lunch time class because a client came in to our office. During those times, I reflected and took a cue from OJ and thought “I'm not going to quit, but if I was, here's why…”
Progression
The first reason I could see for stopping at blue is progression. When I walked on to the mat the first time, I didn't know anything. I left at the end of that class feeling exhausted, but also excited because I had learned the steps to my first arm bar. The next two years had lulls where I didn't leave class feeling that way, but those days were often met with the reminder that I was getting close to my blue belt. However, at blue belt, the wave of euphoria over learning a new skill is often gone. I still pick up things all the time, but they're little now. I catch myself watching the technique thinking “Does the hand placement matter there? How important are those grips?” And so I try to notice those details, but overall the knowledge isn't coming in huge leaps and bounds like it was at white.
Finding Where You Rank
The next reason I see people leaving at blue belt is realizing where you're really at. It's amazing. You just got your blue. All the 3 and 4 stripe white belts look up to you, thinking “Is it almost my time? I can't wait.” The 4 stripe blues and above reminisce about when they got their blue. It's a real feel-good time period. That lasts about a week. Then you find yourself back in sparring and you realize quickly your blue belt didn't give you any extra powers. The same stupid mistakes you made last week in sparring, you're making this week. That 2 or 3 stripe blue who mopped the floor with you last week? He's mopping the floor with you this week.
In fact, in some cases, those higher belts are kicking your butt even harder than they were before. You see, when you were a white, they didn't have to work as hard. They didn't have to be as crafty. Now though, you're getting better, and so they work harder which means they enjoy beating you that much more.
Time to Purple
Not only do you realize where you fit in the food chain, but you have another realization as well. Purple is soooooo far away. In fact, right after you get your blue, purple might as well be black. You have to actually be good to get your purple, whereas you might just have to be ok to get a blue. So while you're getting your butt kicked by the same guys, you don't even have the luxury of looking forward to getting your purple, because it's going to be quite a while.
Time Involved
Finally, one thing being out of the gym showed me is how much time I spend at the gym. I got home and it was still light outside. I was able to eat supper before 8:30 or 9pm. I could sit down, relax and take a few breaths, and it wasn't already bed time. I missed the gym during that time, but I'm not going to lie, it was nice having some nights off. As you near blue belt, it seems to consume you more, you spend more time at the gym. So when you have a night off, it's even more of a break than a normal night off. That can be seductive to some people.
Like I said, none of these are reasons for me to quit, but I do understand how any one of them, or a combination of them, could see someone stop at blue belt.
GETTING robbed is bad enough at any point, but Shi Dongpeng was unluckier than most.
The Chinese hurdler is in Rio for the upcoming Olympics, and shortly after arriving in Brazil last week with a cameraman, he was allegedly accosted in the most disgusting way imaginable.
Per AIPS reports, a man rushed towards the pair and — seemingly intoxicated — vomited on both men before fleeing.
The athlete then went to a bathroom to clean himself up while the cameraman tried to chase after the perpetrator. However, when they both returned, all of the cameraman's gear had disappeared.
Surveillance footage taken by cameras in the hotel confirmed that was no coincidence. It turned out it was all a clever ruse as footage showed the “drunk's” accomplice taking advantage of the Chinese men's absence to steal the unattended equipment.
Dongpeng reported the crime to police.
Rio's high crime rate is one of the many issues the city and visiting athletes at this year's Games face.
Last week New Zealand jiu-jitsu exponent Jason Lee said he was forced to take out a large sum of money from two ATMs at gunpoint in the Olympic host city after being kidnapped.
What did you guys get up to yesterday?
I got kidnapped. Go Olympics!#Rio2016 — Jason Lee (@jasonleejitsu) July 24, 2016
In a more detailed post on his Facebook page, Lee claims the men threatened to apprehend him if he did not meet his demands for “a large sum of money”.
“I'm not sure what's more depressing, the fact this stuff is happening to foreigners so close to the Olympic Games or the fact that Brazilians have to live in a society that enables this absolute bullshit on a daily basis,” he wrote.
“I was threatened with arrest if I did not get in their private car and accompany them to two ATMs to withdraw a large sum of money for a bribe.
“This place is well and truly f***ked in every sense of the word imaginable.”
He describes the kidnappers as not “random people with guns, but rather official police officers on duty in full uniform”.
Last year it was reported extra security forces — more than double what was used in London in 2012 — would flood the city in an effort to combat the significant crime level.
Aussie Paralympian Liesl Tesch experienced Rio's dangerous underbelly first hand in June when her and her physio were robbed by two men, one of whom was armed with a gun.
“It was absolutely horrific,” Tesch said afterwards. “I can see it clear as day in my own head ... it was a pistol.”
“When it actually happens to you, it actually reinforces how dangerous this city is and how lucky we are to live in Australia.”
In 2015 British sailors Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark were robbed by two men with knives at Guanabara Bay — the venue for Olympic sailing events that has also been dogged by pollution problems.

Quakes re-sign midfielder Anibal Godoy
The San Jose Earthquakes announced today that the club has signed midfielder Anibal Godoy to a new multi-year contract.
“Anibal has been a leader for our club on and off the field,” said Earthquakes general manager Jesse Fioranelli. “He has a strong influence on every match he plays in and we made it a priority to sign him to a multi-year contract this offseason. We are happy he will be wearing a Quakes kit for years to come.”
Godoy, 27, originally joined the Earthquakes on Aug. 6, 2015. His arrival immediately sparked a four-game win streak that saw the Quakes outscore their opponents 9-0. In his 10 starts that season, the Quakes went 6-1-3, allowed six total goals, and remained alive for playoff contention until the final day of the regular season.
Godoy is coming off a 2017 season in which he set MLS career-highs in appearances (26), starts (24) and minutes played (2,134), while scoring two goals, both game-winners, and adding an assist. He played a key role in the center of the team's midfield, helping San Jose reach the postseason for the first time since 2012.
Over his two-and-a-half seasons in San Jose, he has tallied five goals and three assists in 4,969 minutes, leading the Quakes to a 22-18-19 record in his 59 appearances.
Internationally, Godoy has earned 85 caps for the Panama National Team and helped them reach the semifinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2011, 2013 and 2015. Earlier this year, Panama qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, marking the nation's first-ever appearance in the competition.

Republican Ed Gillespie on Friday conceded the Virginia Senate race to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner, concluding one of the closest election battles of the midterms.
The former Republican Party chairman did far better on Tuesday than most polls -- which showed him trailing Warner badly -- projected. But while state law technically entitled him to a recount in the close race, he said Friday he would not seek one.
"The votes just aren't there," Gillespie told his supporters, adding that he called Warner earlier in the day to congratulate him.
Gillespie's concession did not change the balance of the Senate. Tuesday's elections put Republicans in control with at least 52 of 100 seats in the chamber.
The Alaska race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan remains uncalled, and in Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Bill Cassidy are competing in a Dec. 6 runoff.
The latest Virginia numbers from the State Board of Elections show Warner leading by more than 16,000 votes, or nearly a percentage point, out of more than 2 million ballots cast.
Warner has 49 percent of the vote, Gillespie has 48 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 2 percent.
Warner, a former governor who is one of Virginia's most popular politicians, had been expected to handily win a second term. But Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, rode a wave of support for GOP candidates nationwide, and almost knocked Warner out of the Senate despite being outspent heavily.
On Thursday, Warner told reporters he was confident that his lead would hold up. He said it would be unprecedented in Virginia for such a lead to evaporate in either the canvass, as the formal counting process is called, or a recount.
Warner said he was focusing now on his next term, which would begin in January, and planned to promote a centrist agenda that could attract bipartisan support.
He said he wants "to show that we can get the Senate to actually work."
