Since Afreeca Freecs' top laner Jang "MaRin" Gyeong-hwan pulled out the splitpushing AD Kennen during the very early stages of Season 7, Kennen has been all the rage internationally as a viable splitpusher and aggressive presence in the top lane that had difficulty dying to tanks. This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.
With the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting their splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.
Runes
1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed Quintessences
This rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen's W passive, he's more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases their sustain through Doran's Blade as well as their initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making their dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.
Masteries
Eighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to their W passive, which will give them greater burst damage as they build up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for their Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite their tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.
Twelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows them to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through their E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize their early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.
Skill Order
First six levels: QEWWWR
Getting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen's primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.
After that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.
Build Order
Though Doran's Shield got a huge buff, it's still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death's Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen's dueling substantially, and contributes to their W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.

Playstyle
Early game, Kennen's ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because they can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with their good base damage on abilities allows them to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you're not pushing in. If you are, your ultimate is a good get out of jail free card as it will stun pursuers as you scurry away. Early game is not when the splitpushing starts, after all.
Mid game sees Kennen starting to assert themselves in 1v1s through their Blade of the Ruined King and Frozen Mallet power spike, meaning that they can chase down tanks, outdamage them and outsustain them in any prolonged fight. This makes it impossible for them to lane against him, yielding two scenarios: either a collapse onto you, or a teamfight away from you. With Kennen's main goal being splitpushing, it's imperative that you don't join fights immediately and try to signal to your team that it's worth backing off if the teamfight situation is likely. Avoiding any collapse is key to splitpushing, and therefore investing in Control Wards and using your trinket constantly will help you determine when it is safe to push your advantage. Once more, there are plenty of ways to disengage, amplified by the Frozen Mallet passive and Blade of the Ruined King active.
The late game is when Kennen's splitpush truly comes online. With the damage reduction from Phantom Dancer and the new Death's Dance, coupled with the attack speed and W passive available to Kennen, they should be able to 1v1 most any other champion, especially the enemy top laner who they are likely to be ahead of because of their smoother power curve and easier laning phase. In teamfights, should Kennen join them, they function as a second AD carry with the ability to peel for themselves and their team in unique ways, being a part of the backline and having an ultimate with great zone control for your entire backline. Using that optimally will be key to getting that last bit of necessary damage out there to win the fight. Kennen does not go in with this build, they are meant to be a peeling presence and AD carry, unlike their “go button” AP style which relies on Zhonya's and their ultimate to completely dismantle enemy teams.

Thought Catalog has some funny little quirks, and articles about eating pussy keep coming up as “related” on my posts. Maybe because I'm such a cunt? At any rate, I spent some time reading them, and they were rather interesting. Commenters had a rage fest when the “feminist” man said they refused to eat pussy because it's gross. Commenters were unhappy with a woman's instructions, because they simply aren't universal. Every woman is different.
This is a little out of my oeuvre, but I thought I would try my hand explaining to women how to teach a man what you like while respecting them as a person and not being a huge bitch about it. The barky “do this, do that” drill sergeant approach seems designed to keep you forever single. The key words you need to keep in mind are “respect” and “mutual.”
1. Remove your pubic hair
Just do it. Preferably with wax. If you're going to shave, make sure you are freshly shaved. Having your face scraped to shreds by prickly stubble is not fun for anyone, man or woman. Removing your pubic hair demonstrates respect in a number of ways. First of all, no one likes hair in their food, period. Second, your man will have a better view of what he's doing. Third, presenting soft, smooth skin is testimony to the fact you want them to experience pleasure while giving pleasure., and you are willing to make a personal sacrifice to ensure that happens. And don't even give me that “pedophilia” crap. Why do you think men shave their faces? Does preferring a man with a smooth jaw means you secretly lust after 11 year old boys? Of course not.
Grooming. Yes, it's mandatory, at least for the first time. And by first time, I mean the first time a man is going down on you. Every woman likes different things, and you are responsible for communicating what you like. It's not their job to figure that out on their own. Your body, your choice, your responsibility.
2. Show, don't tell
Words like “firm”, “fast”, “hard” and “slow” are too open to interpretation to be particularly useful when it comes to such delicate work. It's much better to show them what you like, with the added bonus of never sounding like a demanding harpy. Luckily, a man's body comes equipped with a feature that can be used to demonstrate the pressure, speed and intensity you personally like.
Their nipple.
“This is what I like,” said in a whisper followed by your preferences spelled out with your own tongue across their body is an excellent way to teach the idiosyncrasies of your own body. And it will feel good for them too. No need to rush it. Take your time. Linger.
Just as you expect them to.
3. Take care of distractions
Your demonstration will not doubt result in a raging boner for your man, and thoughtful women take care of distractions, first. Again, make their pleasure a key part of your pleasure, and expect to be pleasured many times. They will be able to concentrate on the task at hand if you relieve them of the distraction standing at stiff attention between their legs.
Blow them first.
Yes, they get a blowjob. Oral sex for oral sex. Of course, if they prefer a different activity, then you indulge them fully. This is about their pleasure, too, although in my experience, if a man turns down a blowjob, you may want to get some frank feedback on your technique.
4. Keep your hands on their body
Unless he's tied you to the bedframe (at your request, of course) you should keep your hands on their body. Their shoulders, neck and head. That way you can gently guide the action, although he's probably going to be hitting the sweet spots right away, if your demonstration was good. If it's not good, then it's you who failed. Bring them up and try your demonstration again. Always assume that you are a bad teacher, not that they are a bad student. Never, ever be petulant, condescending or contemptuous.
That's kind of a life rule that applies to more than just oral sex.
5. Say thank you
It doesn't have to be the words “thank you”, although there's nothing wrong with that. There are many ways to show gratitude. You can make noises that aren't words but let them know just how great they are. A long, sticky, sweaty hug. Let them go when he's had enough. Be enthusiastically grateful each and every time. Never take oral sex for granted. Never take them for granted. And invest in some vibrators so they can take a break from oral when he's just not into it. He'll know how to use them, because they already know what you like.
There. Take responsibility for your own pleasure. Respect your man. Make sure the pleasure is mutual. Show gratitude. Believe me, he'll thank you for it.

Western pressure on Iran over its nuclear program continued Thursday, as the European Union moved to tighten some sanctions against the country, and laid the groundwork for a possible EU oil embargo.
The EU added 143 Iranian entities and 37 individuals to the list of those who assets would be frozen and who are banned from entering the 27-nation bloc. A decision on whether or not to ban oil imports from the country is expected before the end of January. In 2010, Iranian crude accounted for 5.28 percent of oil imports to the EU.
European Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger told Reuters that an EU embargo on Iranian oil would require the support of all 27 EU states. The measure has been backed by France and Britain, but faces resistance from Greece. "Greece has put forward a number of reservations," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told the Associated Press. "We have to take that into account. We have to see with our partners that the cuts can be compensated by the increase of production in other countries. It is very possible."
The tightened sanctions come in the wake of the storming of the British Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 29, in which protesters tore down the British flag, set fire to a car and caused what some eyewitnesses say is considerable damage to the compound. In response, the British government withdrew its diplomats from the country and expelled Iranian diplomats from London. Several other European countries moved to withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran as a result of the storming, which many believe had the backing the Iranian government, angry over further sanctions against the country following a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its nuclear program last month.
A Joint Signal
In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle met with the Iranian ambassador Wednesday, and said they were looking for a full explanation from the Iranian government on the incident. "We in Europe want to send a joint signal of our solidarity with our British partners," they said.
The EU sanctions were welcomed in Washington on Thursday by President Barack Obama's administration. "Today's actions underscore how the United States and our European allies are committed to working together on these shared challenges," the White House said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the US Senate voted unanimously Thursday in favor of a measure that would penalize foreign financial institutions doing business with Iran's Central Bank. The move came despite concerns from Obama's administration that it could alienate much-needed allies in their policy toward Iran. During a visit to Turkey this week, US Vice President Joseph Biden also called on that country to impose stricter sanctions on Iran.
German commentators Friday considers the options available against Iran, especially an EU oil embargo. One thing crucial to any success, they say, is more support from China.
The center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:
"Iran's power in the region is eroding. The USA may have removed Iran's biggest enemy, Saddam Hussein, from power and is leaving Iraq, and soon will be leaving Afghanistan.... But the Arab Spring revolutionaries, cheered on as they were by Tehran, want nothing to do with a theocracy on the Khomeini model."
"Hopes for a comprehensive reconciliation of interests, a grand bargain between Iran and the West, have evaporated for the time being. Given the approaching US elections in 2012, Obama has little leeway. And Iran's government is paralyzed because of an inner power struggle, coming to a head in the parliamentary elections in March 2012 and the presidential elections the following year."
"Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the issue is not reduced to a choice between the Iranian Bomb and bombing Iran. Decisive sanctions from the entire EU are one of the few messages that Iran will still understand. In addition, Germany should wield its influence in Moscow and Beijing. This strategy, though, doesn't promise great success. But of all the bad options, it is the best."
The left-leaning Die Tageszeitung writes:
"With its new sanctions decisions, the EU is nudging closer to the end of the cul-de-sac that it entered in 2005. At that time, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, together with France and Great Britain, pushed through the ultimate demand on Tehran for a full suspension of uranium enrichment. That was the only way, Fischer argued, that the West could reliably signal to the Israeli government that it was taking Israeli fear of Iranian nuclear bombs seriously, and could therefore hold Israel off from taking unilateral military action against Iran."
"Iran specialists pointed out at the time that no government in Tehran, even a democratically-elected one, would be ready to fulfill these demands. What should be feared most, they said, would be the strengthening of the hardliners and those advocating for nuclear weapons. Fischer brushed off these concerns as being 'naïve' and promised, 'by the summer of 2005 a comprehensive agreement between the EU and Iran, in which they could demonstrate to the US how one successfully carries out diplomacy in the Middle East.' The rest is history."
The Financial Times Deutschland writes:
"An oil embargo will worsen the social and economic situation in Iran. The revenues from the country's chief export don't flow just to the nuclear program. They also finance the salaries of teachers, doctors, and garbage collectors. The sanctions will affect everyone, the Iranian people and the government."
"But an oil embargo could also hurt the West, even if Europe gets less than 5 percent of its oil from Iran and Germany gets less than 1 percent. Such embargos also often have a psychological effect. Higher oil prices would be poisonous for the European economy that is already likely standing on the edge of a recession."
"There are limited political options, so these sanctions are justified. At the same time, there are doubts as to whether or not they will bring about the desired result, to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power in the next one or two years. Sanctions didn't bring down Saddam Hussein in Iraq or Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, or Syria's President Bashar al-Assad."
"In order to get the Iranian regime to give in, support from Russia and especially China is needed. The Chinese have built up their economic ties to Iran and are the protective power, whose word carries weight."
The left-leaning Berliner Zeitung writes:
"The Israelis know that attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities would, at best, slow down the Iranian government's development of a nuclear bomb, and not halt it. The Americans can still hope that the Israelis will hold back. Now there is the chance that the Europeans will agree on stronger sanctions against Iran, effectively leading to a stop in Iranian oil imports to Europe. That would hit the fifth largest oil exporter hard, though it could make gasoline more expensive. But if countries like China or India don't take part, then Iran could survive a European oil embargo."
"There is still no threat of a war with Iran, though the world has never before been so close to one. Negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program are now likely over. Until now, it has been enough to apply pressure on Iran. Now, more efforts have to be taken to keep Israel from firing the first shot."
ThinkProgress recently published a post that begins with a provocative quote from Edward Abbey, “Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.” The post argues that some economic growth is acceptable while other economic growth is bad and does not explain the distinction. The obvious problem is that economic growth and the attendant growth in natural gas, oil, and coal use have led to dramatic improvements in human welfare around the world over the last few decades.
According to data from the World Bank, in countries around the world, consuming more energy and generating more electricity have been correlated with living longer, reducing child mortality, improving sanitation facilities, increasing levels of economic growth, and decreasing air pollution. Furthermore, it is hard to argue there is much “growth for growth's sake” occurring when 1.3 billion people still do not have access to electricity and 2.6 billion people are without clean cooking facilities.
Economic Development is Vital for Human Development
Economic development is a critical component of improving human well-being, and energy use is indispensable. The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook, explains:
“Energy alone is not sufficient for creating the conditions for economic growth, but it is certainly necessary. It is impossible to operate a factory, run a shop, grow crops or deliver goods to consumers without using some form of energy. Access to electricity is particularly crucial to human development as electricity is, in practice, indispensable for certain basic activities, such as lighting, refrigeration and the running of household appliances, and cannot easily be replaced by other forms of energy.”
This means that improving economic and human development almost certainly entails increasing the use of energy around the world. ThinkProgress, on the other hand, argues that we have not seen meaningful growth in recent years:
“We have not been growing in any meaningful sense of the word for a while now — certainly not the kind of growth that matters to our children and grandchildren and countless future generations encompassing billions and billions of people.”
Tell that to China and India's residents, who have experienced higher standards of living and greater prosperity over the last three decades or so. Today, hundreds of millions of people in those countries are no longer desperately poor because of economic growth and the growth in the use of energy. Both countries have seen higher life expectancies at birth, more widespread access to improved sanitation facilities, and a lower child mortality rate. Energy growth has fueled these improvements.
It is not just China and India, though—a similar story is true in both Brazil and the U.S. The following chart, using data from the World Bank and BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2014, illustrates the relationship between higher energy use and greater standards of life (including declining PM10 air pollution):
In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency also illustrates the relationship between higher energy use and prosperity. The following chart reveals that, as energy consumption and vehicle miles traveled have increased, so has economic growth, while air pollution has dropped off over time:
The use of energy is ultimately vital to living standards, and it is not simply “for the sake of growth.” India, China, Brazil, and the United States have seen not only dramatic increases in energy growth, but also improvements in human welfare. This energy growth surely does not seem like “growth for growth sake.”
Basic activities such as refrigerating food and medicines as well as air-conditioning schools and hospitals are impossible without affordable, reliable energy. Life-saving technologies, too, such as incubators for children born prematurely, also cannot exist without reliable electricity. Because more than 1 billion people do not have access to electricity, the world's energy use will continue to grow as more people gain access to these improvements.
But aren't we running out of natural gas and oil?
With the increase in energy use, some people may worry that we might be running out of natural gas and oil. It turns out, however, that over the last 30 years, proven reserves of natural gas and oil have kept pace with the increase in electricity generation and have increased much more than primary energy consumption. [1]
The fact that proven energy reserves have increased should not come as a surprise if you consider what the greatest natural resources are—human imagination and intellect, as Julian Simon explained in their book, The Ultimate Resource. As the demand for resources grows, people look for new ways to develop resources and for substitutes for those resources. This desire to satisfy demand leads to innovations in finding and developing energy. The revolutions in shale oil and gas and hydraulic fracturing illustrate this reality. As the demand for energy grew, developers came up with new techniques to find resources that were previously not recoverable.
Conclusions
Saying there is “growth for the sake of growth” is a nice sound bite, but it is difficult to see in a world where billions of people do not have access to electricity and clean cooking facilities. History over the last few decades shows us that economic growth and the growth in energy use have led to great improvements in human welfare. Today, people use energy to power hospitals with incubators that can save premature children, to communicate over thousands of miles, and to keep food and medicines from spoiling with refrigeration. Many people in countries like China and India, who have experienced tremendous growth in energy use over the last three decades or so, would likely disagree with the notion that that growth was just “for the sake of growth.” Instead, they would likely point to real, tangible benefits that have materialized in their lives because of affordable, reliable energy.
[1] EIA defines “proved reserves” as “the estimated quantities which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.” This is a relatively conservative estimate of quantities of resources available.
This graph does not include coal reserves because EIA only lists reserves for the year 2011, and BP's Statistical Review workbook only lists them for the year 2013.
Nick Cave discovered ‘Famous Blue Raincoat' as a young boy in Wangaratta.
Nick Cave is one of the most high-profile champions of Leonard Cohen's work. The Australian singer, songwriter, poet and author has covered a range of Cohen songs throughout their own long career (this site suggests ten) and been very open about the influence Cohen has had on their career.
In 1994, Cave spoke to Richard Kingsmill about ‘Famous Blue Raincoat', the song that turned them on to Leonard Cohen when they were a young boy in Wangaratta.
In the wake of Leonard Cohen's sad passing, we have unearthed Cave's wonderful words about such a brilliant song.
“I remember listening to this song when I must have been 11 or 12,” they said. “I lived in Wangaratta and I had a friend called Anne Baumgarten, they were quite a morbid kind of creature.
“She used to play Leonard Cohen in their room with burning candles and all that sort of stuff. She'd listen to Songs of Love and Hate over and over again. I started to that myself and became kind of infatuated with the lyric at that point. I saw how powerful that could be.
“This song to me just seemed like a true kind of confessional song. It just seemed to be so open and kind of honest in some way. Whether it is or not, I don't really know.
“It just had that effect on me and it really kinda changed the way I looked at things.
“He had a tendency to air their linen in public in a way. I thought that was all very impressive at the time. I still do, of course.”
In an NFL.com article posted last April, Browns' current General Manager Mike Lombardi weighed in on the six draft philosophies they learned from the master, Bill Walsh. I came across this article thanks to Brendan Leister over at DraftBrowns.com who tweeted about this find this evening:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>A great read on Bill Walsh's draft philosophy by current <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Browns">#Browns</a> GM Michael Lombardi from their time at <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23NFL">#NFL</a> Network: <a href="http://t.co/la5T8nWOQR" title="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82857c66/article/bill-walshs-nfl-draft-philosophies-six-lessons-from-the-master">nfl.com/news/story/090…</a></p>— Brendan Leister (@BrendanLeister) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanLeister/status/315629293986258945">March 24, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
This is a fascinating read that outlines draft philosophies and characteristics that we might expect Mike Lombardi and the Browns to demonstrate when evaluating and picking talent in the NFL Draft:
"Describing the player by the round they should be taken."
"This is a bad draft."
"We should trade down"
"Watch out for players from downtrodden programs -- particularly programs that have just fired a coach -- being unfairly downgraded"
"Never take the one-year wonder and look forward; take the one-year wonder and look back"
"The first year we will teach the players the system, the second year we will develop their skills within the system"
The first point is interesting because we often hear fans saying this guys isn't worth a first round pick or a second round pick, or this guy was a reach. I believe in this philosophy as described in the article, a player is judged to be a good or bad pick only years down the road, not on draft day, or in their first season. A player will never be defined by what round they were taken in, rather by how them performs on the field. John Hughes could turn into a perfect example where fans had no idea who they were and thought they were a reach and a wasted pick, but their performance thus far has been productive and their value to the team seems to be defined more by what they do on game day than where they were taken in the draft last April.
The second philosophy is more for scouts and people in the business hanging their evaluations on the belief that talent is hard to find in the draft or are afraid to put themselves on the line for a guy they really like or don't like.This can be heard and seen in this years draft when describing the offensive vs defensive talent pools, respectively. You have heard me say that this is a deep defensive draft and not so deep offensive draft. But that doesn't mean there's not good players to be had in all rounds.
The third philosophy is again aimed at scouts and talent evaluators more than fans, but this is a hot topic for the Browns given our past trade down decisions. This year, with Josh Gordon representing our 2nd round pick, but with a ton of talent to be had in the 2nd round, many fans, including myself, are hoping we can orchestrate a trade down. I don't want to do this because I'm afraid to take who's on the board at 6 in fear they'll be a bust, or because I don't think there's enough talent available at the top of the draft, but I'm in favor of this approach this year because I feel there's a better chance we can acquire more talent to fill positions of need.
The one year wonder philosophy is pretty self explanatory and I think most fans will agree with that a flash in the pan doesn't always mean gold!
The last philosophy is one I think the Browns are in a very good position to demonstrate with any of their picks this year and all their additions to the coaching staff. In fact, to the chagrin of many fans, Haslam came out and said we won't go 13-3 this season, which seems to support the notion that there will be a learning curve in the new system. In fact, take a listen to this interview from Ray Horton from when they were introduced as the new Defensive Coordinator in Arizona two seasons ago. They talk about how complex their system is and how their expectation is that it takes their players at least a season to really learn and grasp. In fact they talk about the big learning curve from the system in Pittsburgh stating that "Very few rookies start".
The good news is that we have solid depth and young talent at almost every position that will be learning the system this season. Thanks to free agency we have been able to address some glaring needs and add depth at other positions on defense. Whoever we draft at 6 or in any of the rounds, will have the ability to come into the system, learn it while not having to worry about being "the guy" from day one. That being said, I think whoever we take at six will be able to perform immediately and we should expect that as fans. Coaches, on the other hand, may be willing to take a much more methodical and reserved approach to rookie evaluation, a la the apparent support from Chud today in developing Brandon Weeden.
Lombardi also shared some of the philosophies of Bill Belicheck here in another NFL.com video from last April. During this interview, Lombardi discusses the reasons behind the Patriots trend of trading down; Bill's philosophy of building a team not just amassing talent and how important this was; and much more. We've heard both Lombardi and Banner mention the notion of "building a team" during Mike's introductory press conference earlier this year. Mike appears to be a quick learner who has been provided with several excellent teachers during their career. Brown fans can only hope Lombardi can execute what it is he's learned along their long road back to Cleveland.
Regardless, I hope these articles helped to give fans a better insight into the beginning of the ever evolving Lombardi and Banner draft philosophy.
After game 3 of the NBA Finals on Tuesday night, you either love Matthew Dellavedova or you hate him.
The hate is growing, but there's a surprising amount of love out there for a player whose attack on an opponent all but cemented for many the charge that Dellavedova, a point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, is a player with such wanton disregard for other players that they may not even have a place in the NBA. Their 2015 playoff run reads as much as a rap sheet as the heroic tale being spun about him.
But Dellavedova is white, and that matters. He's a rare white player in a black league, a league that many media commentators considere to be “full of thugs,” – an appellation that NFL superstar cornerback Richard Sherman says is the “accepted way of calling somebody the N-word now.” Dellavedova is also a white player in a league searching for white fans, white acceptance and white money. Atlanta Hawks owner Bruce Levenson sold their stake in the team last year after a leaked email revealed their worries that the blackness of the sport kept away “white males and corporations.” Dellavedova is also a white man in a country where white men very often get away with what black men cannot (see any number of instances of white violence against black innocents). So some fans are beginning to wonder if a certain white privilege is allowing Dellavedova to elude more serious condemnation for a series of alleged attacks on other players.
Unlike the fist fights that ever so rarely break out in the NBA, and which get their black participants branded “thugs,” Dellavedova's attacks are uniformly on the legs and knees, dirty tactics that have already cost one victim their season, and which could irrevocably damage a player's career and livelihood.
Unseen by most and unacknowledged by announcers during Tuesday's game 3, Dellavedova provided perhaps the most convincing evidence yet that the mounting accusations are true: He's a dirty player. He's violent. He's a thug. He's dangerous. And he's a threat to virtually every opponent they face.
An attentive NBA fan captured the moment on Vine , which pretty clearly shows Dellavedova lowering their shoulder and aiming for Golden State Warrior star Draymond Green's legs. Yes, Green set a hard illegal pick, a shoulder bump. But Dellavedova's retaliation was an attempt on Green's ACL . It's a bit reminiscent of how we imagine certain cops acting: There's some response warranted, no doubt, but Dellavedova goes immediately into excessive territory, as a matter of course.
The jury was still largely out until Tuesday's attack on Green. Some were convinced early on when Dellavedova tried to twist up the legs of Chiacago Bull Taj Gibson in the second round of the playoffs, and a little murmur went through the NBA world when Gibson (a black player) was ejected for trying to kick their leg out of Dellavedova's jiu-jitsu leg hold. Dellavedova was allowed to keep playing. Then, in the conference finals, the whispers got considerably louder when Hawks all-star Kyle Korver's season was ended after Dellavedova crashed into their legs, spraining the sharp shooter's ankle. Dellavedova did the same thing later in the series to Al Horford, who was ejected after retaliating. In a post-game statement , Horford couched a severe criticism of Dellavedova in the sort of diplomatic language the mild-mannered player is known for.

“There's got to be a line at some point. He's gotta learn. He's only been in the league for a couple years, but he's gotta learn that it's a brotherhood here.”
The evidence was mounting, and in-game and post-game talk turned to questions of Dellavedova's morality. It was no longer avoidable. Many still felt that they were only a “scrappy” player, a “hustler,” a guy who makes up for minimal talent with maximal effort; but post-game commentator Kenny Smith, a former NBA player, The evidence was mounting, and in-game and post-game talk turned to questions of Dellavedova's morality. It was no longer avoidable. Many still felt that they were only a “scrappy” player, a “hustler,” a guy who makes up for minimal talent with maximal effort; but post-game commentator Kenny Smith, a former NBA player, laid out the case for Dellavedova being a danger to the league.
“You're in too many [dangerous plays]. When you're in several plays throughout the playoffs that involve that type of behavior then you're not paying attention to the brotherhood.”
The next morning, commentators were treading a line: If you call Dellavedova a “dirty player” and affirm the worst accusations, you're essentially asking them to be removed from the league. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith tried to find as many ways to call Dellavedova “reckless” (“very,” “irresponsibly,” “excessively”) without the crucial modifier: “intentionally.”
Those worst fears about Dellavedova were confirmed for many when they saw them apparently going for the legs of Draymond Green Tuesday night. It locked the narrative into place for fans and sportswriters (and likely players too). The benefit of the doubt is evaporating.
“Delly” memes proliferated on social media, and their own trip to the hospital after the game–for dehydration–was reported on in a way that offered sympathy to a player whose play puts every opponent at risk of going to the hospital for much worse.
Vassar professor and author Kiese Laymon, entertaining followers on Facebook with their live-commenting on game 3, caught Dellavedova's attack during and offered a trenchant observation: Matthew Dellavedova is benefiting from white privilege.
Laymon, a consummate Cavs fan, broke from their die-hard fandom to criticize what they saw as an advantage had by their team's white thug. “Too bad Golden State doesn't have a white boy to get away with shit like this,” they wrote. The comment was well-received with with “likes.”
“We all know that a little white boy can get away with shit in this league that black players can't,” they continued. “As someone who understands how antiblackness and white innocence work, I gotta at least call it out.”
It's increasingly easy to apply Laymon's critique of “antiblackness and white innocence” to the NBA and Dellavedova's newfound fame. The NBA, a league with a preponderance of black athletes and fans, has suffered the racist perceptions of its players for decades. It's somehow permissible to write about the league in the way the San Francisco Examiner's Bob Frantz did in 2010, It's increasingly easy to apply Laymon's critique of “antiblackness and white innocence” to the NBA and Dellavedova's newfound fame.

It's somehow permissible to write about the league in the way the San Francisco Examiner's Bob Frantz did in 2010, describing how the league's “overly ink-stained players look like a bunch of gang-bangers playing in the recreation yard at Pelican Bay.” (Frantz even doubled down on their racism a few weeks later in the same esteemed pages: “A league filled with guys that look like thugs is bound to be filled with guys that act like thugs.”)
And Frantz is far from alone: bloggers , And Frantz is far from alone: Other sportswriters politicians , even top GOP tastemakers – it's an alarmingly common charge against a league full of professionals.

I spoke to Dr. Laymon after the game; after making sure to laud Dellavedova for the elements of their play that aren't violent and dangerous, they explained their diagnosis of white privilege. “Delly fits well into our understanding of white masculinity in black dominated spaces,” they said, “Not only is they always going to be deemed ‘scrappy' and ‘hardworking' and ‘getting into [Golden State Warrior Steph Curry's] head'; we minimize the amount of violence they can (and does) cause on their fellow superhuman black players. They will never ever be deemed a ‘thug,' no matter what they do on that floor.”
Laymon, while not denying that Dellavedova is a “dirty,” (i.e. violent) player, broadens the issue outside the bounds of the basketball court; they see the reaction (and non-reaction) to the player as symptomatic of how white privilege operates: “Definitely can't hate the player; gotta hate the game,” they said. “But the game isn't the NBA. It's [the] American racial empire, when rich white men own the teams, pay money to go to the games, and grant love and innocence to one of their own in ways they would never do for ‘athletic' black players.”
It's hard not to compare Dellavedova to fellow Aussie Iggy Azalea, a rapper who's also been seen as a beneficiary of white privilege in a black cultural space. White participants are welcome in basketball and hip hop, but privileged recklessness is not. Azalea and Dellavedova are serviceable in their respective fields, but neither seems to know their nor their place.

Azalea and Dellavedova are serviceable in their respective fields, but neither seems to know their nor their place. Azalea is notably reckless on Twitter when critiqued for their privilege, while Dellavedova is out here rolling around like Sonic the Hedgehog toward players' knees in way that is, at very best, disrespectful of the “brotherhood.”
And, like Laymon points out, it's the perception and reception of Dellavedova (like Azalea) that is the ultimate problem. Each continues to be lauded placed undeservedly on a pedestal while showing open disrespect for the community in which they are guests.
MILWAUKEE — Fifteen illegal immigrants convicted of crimes were arrested in the Milwaukee area during a two-day operation conducted this week by officers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).
This enforcement surge, which concluded Wednesday, January 13th, is the latest effort by ICE to prioritize the arrest and removal of convicted criminals living illegally in the United States.
All 15 arrested have been convicted of crimes in the United States and fall within ICE's enforcement priorities for deportation. Their convictions include: homicide by negligent use of a vehicle, strangulation and suffocation, battery, burglary, theft, domestic abuse, drug possession and drunk driving. The group also included three previously deported illegal immigrants.
Those arrested during the operation include:
A 37-year-old Mexican national with prior convictions for strangulation and suffocation, and battery. They were arrested January 13th in Milwaukee and remains in ICE custody pending a hearing before a federal immigration judge.
A 33-year-old national of Belarus with a prior conviction for homicide by negligent use of a vehicle for which they were sentenced to eight years in state prison. They were arrested January 12th in Milwaukee and remains in ICE custody pending a hearing before a federal immigration judge.
A 53-year-old Mexican national with prior convictions for burglary, theft, and resisting/obstructing an officer. They were arrested January 12th in Milwaukee and remains in ICE custody pending a hearing before a federal immigration judge.
“Our immigration enforcement efforts are focused on arresting and removing convicted criminals from our communities,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago. “When we focus our resources on the most egregious offenders, we immediately improve public safety in the Milwaukee area.”
Following is the nationality breakdown of the 15 men arrested:
Mexico (13)
El Salvador (1)
Belarus (1)
Arrests were made in the following Wisconsin communities:
Milwaukee (11)
Brookfield (2)
Menomonee Falls (1)
Wauwatosa (1)
ERO received significant assistance in the operation from the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) and Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office (MCSO).
All of the targets in this operation met the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) two top immigration enforcement priorities as established in DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson's 2014 memorandum. Priority 1 targets include threats to national security, criminal street gang members, convicted felons, and aggravated felons. Priority 2 targets include convictions for three or more misdemeanors or convictions for significant misdemeanors, including DUIs.
Secretary Johnson has directed ICE to prioritize the use of enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets to support the department's civil immigration enforcement priorities. ICE continues to work with local law enforcement partners to uphold public safety, while taking dangerous criminals out of our communities.
In fiscal year 2015, ICE conducted 235,413 removals nationwide. Ninety-one percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.

I've taken a break from Magic a number of times. Back in 1997 I stopped for a few years and in 2002 I stopped for a while as well both times selling my entire collection and having to start over. I've also stopped playing several times without going to the extreme of selling all my cards. Building up a collection is difficult and time consuming so whenever I need a break from Magic these days I remind myself to just set the cards aside for a later date—it's only a matter of time before I hear Magic's siren call again.
I stopped playing again this past year. I suspected that would be necessary and hinted at it here and I was right. Life got in the way as it is wont to do and I had to tend to more pressing matters. However I took this break with full awareness that I would be playing Magic soon enough and I set my cards and dreams aside until the time came when I could pick them back up again.
So here I am at that point and I'm ready and excited to start traveling to PTQs and SCG Open Series and even FNMs but how do I go about getting familiar with the game (and metagame) all over again? It's something I'm somewhat accustomed to since I've had to do it many times so I wanted to share my thoughts on how to go about it and also to give some fresh perspective on M13 looking at it as I am through the eyes of someone who hasn't played in several months.
Getting Back Into Magic
Okay so first up getting back into Magic. How should you go about it? Well if you're going to do it you're in one of two main camps: either you have a collection to work with or you don't. It's obviously harder if you sold all your cards and now want to start playing again but I can promise you from personal experience that I've done it before and had a lot of success so just be patient and try to persevere through the early card shortage.
Having cards is like having skill; some people are blessed with more than others but the ones who are less blessed can make up the difference. They just have to work harder.
#1: Acquiring Cards – Let's talk about this for a minute. If you haven't been playing for a while your collection has likely fallen a bit behind. If you have some kind of collection you can start trading for cards you're going to need. Find out what cards in particular rares are showing up often in winning decks make a list and go shopping—either literally or figuratively. If you have the money start adding cards to your cart to your heart's content. If you don't have the money attend a few events or game nights and try to trade for what you need. One type of event in particular should merit attention:
#2: Limited Events - Try to read up on the current Limited format learn as many of the tricks as you can find out what people like to draft and why and then start hitting up some events. You don't need to have a great collection to come out a winner and your collection will have grown even if you come out a loser often more than just opening packs alone. People may pass you rares you need for your collection just because they don't need them for their decks. In the beginning you may not win events often so the occasional opportunistic rare draft can really work out to your benefit. I've passed a $20 card just to draft the perfect deck. Likewise you can sometimes get good cards without sacrificing much in deck quality. While we're talking about Limited events I would be remiss if I didn't mention…
#3: Prereleases – My local store charges $25 for a Prerelease. We get six packs. Not a great deal when you look at the box prices online. HOWEVER I frequently win 12-18 packs making a Prerelease an exceptional deal not to mention all the good trading that goes on at such events. A lot can be said about trading and it's really worth many articles all on its own but I will say that it's important to be sure of what cards you need. I've seen many people waste trades on cards they didn't wind up using. To help avoid this problem:
#4: Proxy Decks – Spend a $1. Buy a Sharpie. Take a stack of basic lands or crap commons and start practicing right away. Don't wait until you have the best collection. Try to figure out what's going on with the metagame right now. Start by…
#5: Reading Articles and Tournament Reports – The StarCityGames.com Open Series is a great source of current deck tech and SCG has online coverage right here. MagicTheGathering.com also hosts Grand Prix and Pro Tour coverage where you can learn about what's hot in the deckbuilding world. You don't have to copy those decks but at the very least you will understand why certain cards are trending high or low and what it might take to beat those decks. Then you will have something to actually proxy. Make a gauntlet smash decks into each other and find what works for you. What's your style? What do you like? Regardless of your preference this approach will work to get you back in the swing of things right away. On that note—
#6: Don't Wait to Attend Constructed Events – You may not have the perfect deck and you may lose a lot but you're going to need more than just cards and theory crafting to compete. The best practice is the kind you get at a tournament site. I wouldn't suggest blowing $2000 on travel to a GP in order to shake the rust off but several FNMs should do it. If you happen to have a PTQ GP or SCG Open Series nearby however take advantage of the opportunity! These are by far the best places to play and trade for cards.
#7: Reinvent Yourself – Lastly use your time away from Magic to think about what you might have been doing (or not doing!) that was holding you back from success. Sometimes a break from the game gives you a great opportunity to get real with yourself. Were you not mulliganing aggressively enough? Or did you mulligan too much? Did you have the proper winning attitude? Or were you attributing most of your losses to bad luck? Now you have not only a chance to be a better Magic player but also to be a better person. Were you a poor sport before? Were you known for ripping people off in trades? Every moment of every day you have a choice. You don't have to be the same person if you don't want to be. Getting back into the game can be a fresh start all the way around and you'll find that when you don't let old attitudes limit you that you can have success that you never dared dream of before!
Bonus: Look Good! – By all means pay the most attention to your internal world and getting that in order but changing your look is a great way to demonstrate a new persona to the world and if you do wind up having success you'll look great in the feature match area!
A Fresh Look at M13
So I've heard that Delver decks are really good these days…but I haven't played much in the past few months. I haven't even had a SCG Premium subscription so maybe I'm just out of the loop. I'm sure I won't be looking at M13 in quite the same way as my Magic colleagues who may be thinking about which cards go IN Delver or what new decks and strategies may work AGAINST Delver.
It's like I'm a kid again. WOW! Look at that ! He's just like ! Merfolk is good sometimes right? Throw in some and and you have a deck! (Kidding…kidding…)
But seriously some of these cards have a real nostalgia factor. ? Will it ever be a real deck? Probably not. But players are going to try. ? She's pretty cool. I remember the days of Miracle Gro and Super Gro. With Snapcaster Mages and Phyrexian mana spells they could make a real comeback. What about and the long prophesied return of Mono-Black Control?
hasn't had its day to shine yet but maybe it's finally good enough. I certainly wouldn't bet against a three-mana 5/5. is bonkers in a world of s. Of course is great since all the / / variants find their way into tournament winning decks even if it's just to ruin a red mage's day.
Speaking of red mages they'll probably pass on since it compares unfavorably to and Hound of Griselbrand but they'll probably love Thundermaw Hellkite—as long as they're playing something reminiscent of Big Red decks instead of the frequently more popular Red Deck Wins style decks. But there's really no reason to limit yourself to something mono-color. The Hellkite fits perfectly in some kind of G/R Ramp strategy where you're dropping Huntmasters and Hellkites all day long.
What about exalted? That's coming back. Will that be a deck? Certainly people are going to try. However it seems to lack some of the tools that were available to it the first time around: Rafiq of the Many and to name a few. I don't think that is good enough—I don't like how it comes down tapped and only produces colorless—but is pretty sweet and very aggressively costed even if you're not using any other exalted cards.
But let's not just look at rares and mythics. is coming back. I'm sure that has people talking. I can just imagine the Rancored Delvers coming through the air now…
also strikes me as a pretty neat tool to have at one's disposal versus those swarms of little creatures especially when you've got a swarm of your own.
In the long run (if you can call a few months the "long run") and are leaving the format. isn't really going to take their place but right now we have access to all three!
is also back from a year vacation but with so many aggressive options it's probably going to find itself relegated to sideboards at least at first.
There are some fun cards for Commander in M13 also.
We have which will likely be used to pull off different shenanigans in every game from drawing cards to taking extra turns. It's so versatile really why wouldn't you use it if you're playing blue?
is another popular Commander card. Sure it costs five manas but you get three of it back right away and it helps set you up for an even bigger turn. In Commander playing big spells is what it's all about!
might be broken in Commander. The nine casting cost is a bit prohibitive if your opponents are playing countermagic but there are many combinations where you can just end the game on the spot. Even if you're playing the card in some "fair" way games are sure to get REAL interesting!
is my favorite pick for Commander. Yes it is expensive to cast and probably difficult to resolve but it's just mean if it lands. Your opponents will probably get to watch you play solitaire Magic for a while if they don't just concede. Sure maybe that's not really in the spirit of Commander (if you believe in such things—I certainly don't! hehe) but everyone should do it at least once!
Anyway these are just random observations from a person who is trying to reignite their Magic fire. I am in the position of someone who has fallen out of the loop and is trying to find their footing again so you'll certainly see me taking my own advice. For now I'm limited to playing Magic with friends at home. I'm recovering from major surgery and it'll be a several weeks before I can even travel to FNM (which to be fair is an hour away from me) so I'm not just working at getting back into Magic; I'm working at getting back into life!
Until things are back to normal I hope that you will understand that it takes time for anyone including myself to get back in the saddle again.
And Just 'Cause I Love So Much
This deck is mostly stock Delver with added just to try it out. It's probably not worth making the mana base worse just for the Dryad but we won't know if we don't try and really it's too cool to not at least try!
The sideboard is probably a bit random but seems like a decent starting point at least until I get a good feel for what decks I'm likely to face. If I were to play in a Standard FNM right now I'd definitely give this a shot.
And I guess I lied about having a completely different perspective on M13 since I still went ahead and built a Delver deck the first chance I got but one can do worse than the commonly accepted "best deck." C'est la vie!
(Or if you'd rather just tell your friends it's a Dryad deck not a Delver deck!)
Melbourne‘s annual Reclink Community Cup is a marvellous, many splendored thing.
The yearly charity footy game between the radio-representing MegaHertz and the instrument thumping Rockdogs draws a massive crowd together for a spirited game and accompanying live gig.
Despite drawing crowds that push 20,000, the Cup has not once suffered violence, been marred by overtly bad behaviour, and is generally regarded as an extremely warm, welcoming, friendly environment; at once somehow both exceptionally adult, and family-friendly at the same time.
The beers flow freely (both on and off the field), the banter is willing but good-spirited, and inevitably multiple people will engage in the grand Community Cup tradition of streaking. It's an eyeful, but it's part of the day's charm (somehow). Has been for years.
So even despite the game moving from its past home of Elsternwick Park to Victoria Park in Collingwood this year, the traditions followed along.
There was fun. There was footy. There were fannies on the field.
Exhibit A (warning, bums to follow).
You get the idea. A little gross? Probably. Way too cold? Absolutely. Harmful? Not in the slightest.
Only problem is that this year, for whatever reason, Victoria Police have decided to take immediate and decisive action.
Three men in their 20s have been charged with indecent and obscene behaviour for streaking at the Cup, with each charge carrying a $626 fine. A fourth person is apparently being sought by police for a similar reason.
VIC cops confirmed those charged with streaking will receive penalty notices.
Outwardly, and quite obviously, Community Cup organisers officially distanced themselves from the practise, with Reclink bosses asserting that “under no circumstances would we condone streaking at any Reclink event, which includes the Community Cup.” Of course they have to say that, stating anything otherwise would be ridiculous.
But local council members have slammed the charges as “over the top.” Yarra Council member Stephen Jolly stated that a much more sensible approach to police discretion of streaking at the event was needed.
“It was just a few people having a bit of fun and now their lives could potentially be ruined.”
And when they say “their lives could potentially be ruined,” he's not kidding.
In September of last year the Andrews Government amended the Victorian Summary Offences Act; specifically, the areas of the act concerning sexual and obscene crimes.
While things like streaking and mooning have always been, not to put too fine a point on it, kind of legal grey (or pink and brown) area, the amendments to the act last year actually included specific mention of both, in legislation, for the first time ever.
Yikes.
Whether this is a matter of police being particularly heavy handed, or whether the move to Victoria Park means taking the Community Cup away from an Elsternwick-area constabulary that was much more tolerant of the Cup's associated (and extremely light) antics is another question entirely.
But suddenly dishing out $600+ fines for chucking a nuddy run across the hallowed Reclink turf?
Come on, plod. You could probably turn the other cheek.

Initial Thoughts
This Emilio AF Suave is the 3rd installment of #EmilioCigarWeek, check our previous reviews including the Series H Maduro & the Los Regalos Quetzal.
The Emilio AF Suave, AF stands for A.J. Fernandez who blended this cigar for Emilio cigars. Suave is Spanish for smooth or elegant. A little bit of the backstory on this cigar. Gary Griffith went down to Esteli to meet up with A.J. Fernandez to finalize this blend. When they got there, they realized that A.J. had actually finalized it for him. They gave them a couple of options with the Connecticut wrapper and Gary chose the blend that would eventually become the Suave.
They were looking for a Connecticut wrapper that would stand out and show complexity, yet be enjoyable to even the most novice of palates. I've been somewhat hit or miss when it comes to Connecticut wrappers. There are some that blow me away, and others that I wasn't a big fan of. I can completely understand what they were looking for when they said they wanted something that wasn't one dimensional. So let's see if they found what he's looking for, or is they more like Bono
Don't forget to check out the contest at the bottom!
Looks
The Emilio AF Suave should be fairly easy to spot in your local B&M's humidor. The wrapper is a nice silky light brown even tannish cigar. Connecticut wrappers are so thin and supple and that typically makes it difficult to cover the cigar with them. However, when it's done correctly you get a thing of beauty, and that's exactly what we have with this cigar. I love looking at Connecticut wrappers, they typically are very light in color and can usually be picked out rather easily.
The band on this Emilio AF Suave lacks the artistic flair that I prefer in cigar packaging. To me, Emilio has made leaps and bounds in their packaging as they continue to improve their entire line. Personally, I'm a big fan of packaging if it doesn't reach out and grab me then it makes it hard for me to want to pick it up off the shelf. If I had not heard so many great reviews about this cigar previously, I don't know if I would have picked up based on packaging alone. As Gary says “The Tobacco Drives the Process”. So I'll cut them some slack on the design of the band on this one. I've been fairly nice to them over the last couple of reviews and I'm sure they won't mind me taking a couple of pokes at them here :).
The band is fairly simple, it's a white background with the AF in black font and the “Suave” in a lighter gray font that is somewhat difficult to pick out in the pictures. Like I said, nothing too outlandish or eye grabbing, but it gets the point across. I do have to say this is a BIG cigar. It's a Toro, standing at 6″ tall and a 50 RG. I used to be a fan of these big cigars, now I enjoy smaller vitolas. Occasionally I'll bust out a big stick, but usually a corona or a corona gorda is the perfect size for me.
Function
In the classic parejo shape this Emilio AF Suave feels like a very solid cigar. I rolled it between my fingers, and I wasn't able to detect any soft spots in the filler. The wrapper had a few large veins running down through the barrel. If the wrapper had not been a Connecticut wrapper chances are you wouldn't have been able to see them. But because those wrappers are so thing some of these veins are more pronounced that others.
Taking a look at the foot of the cigar it looks slightly box pressed. Maybe that's just from sitting in my humidor. But the rest of the cigar doesn't feel like a box press it appears to just be around the foot of this stick.
The wrapper on this cigar was again placed perfectly. It appears that they know what they're doing down there in Esteli. They can sure apply some wrappers to these cigars. Man, you can barely see the seam on it. In fact I had even more trouble finding the seams of the triple cap. Maybe my eyesight is going out on me from looking at this computer too much! Either way this cigar is constructed beautifully.
I went ahead and decapitated this cigar so that I could test out the functionality. Whewwweee, the dry draw on this stick was very similar to the Quetzal. Just an incredible draw, absolutely perfect and very little resistance! I'll have to tell you right now. I'm ready to light this baby up!
Smoking
I went back to using my lighter today. It was a bit windy outside and I figured my matches would have trouble lighting so I just went for the trusty torch. I honestly didn't even take time to toast the foot. I just went right in and started puffing and rotating this Emilio AF Suave to the flame. I'm always amazed at the lack of smoke from these Connecticut wrappers. When you go from smoking something like the Liga Privada #9 to this it's a huge change of pace.
The first third of this stick smoked like a dream. Great draw, great pace of the burn, and even a nice ash! What more could you ask for? The entire cigar smoked like this all the way down to the final third. I ended up stopping this cigar a little before the nub because it had already been 1.5 hours of smoke time. I figured that was enough to get a good estimate on what this cigar had to offer.
Flavor Talk about flavor! This Emilio AF Suave brought some flavor the party. The flavors weren't overpowering, but there were a lot of them. On the pre light draw there I picked up a nice sweetness that offered some hints of nuttiness as well. The foot offered up more sweetness and that molasses smell that I always seem to pick up. During the first third I'm blasted with pepper on the finish. It caused my tongue to tingle. With the retrohale I was picking up more of the overall nuttiness, but it finished with spice. I had a feeling this cigar would go really well with some coffee. I wasn't able to pick out all the flavors from the retrohale. It seemed like more flavors were there, but I wasn't able to pick them all out. The second third of this Emilio AF Suave brought in some complexity. The spice really picked up, especially on the retrohale. I was still getting a lot of the creaminess and nuttiness overall. I started picking up some woodsy / oaky notes and a slight hint of cocoa. It almost feels like the tale of two cigars. I feel like the first third was similar, but still very different from this second third. In the final third, there was a lot more of the same as the second third. The complexity was there, and the cigar really opened up. Like I said before I didn't take it all the way down to the nub, but I doubt the flavors changed too much in what was left. I would classify this Emilio AF Suave as a mild-medium body in strength, and a medium body in flavor. It has a ton of flavor, but it's not overwhelming either. Would I Buy It Again? Ehh, potentially. I liked the flavors it provided, but I wouldn't say I was wowed by this cigar. It was a great cigar, just not something that I'll go jumping after all the time. Is It an Every Day Smoke? It certainly could be. For me it would have to be a much smaller vitola though. This toro is just too big of a cigar to smoke on a regular basis for me. Would I Buy a Box? You certainly can, I think it would go well with coffee and bring out lots of interesting flavors. Conclusion Overall, this Emilio AF Suave is a great cigar. It has all the great things that I love about a cigar. Tons of flavor, great burn, great draw, honestly, everything you want in a cigar. However, it just didn't really wow me and make me want another one. I've never been a big fan of nutty tasting cigars and maybe that's why I didn't like it as much. I can't take any points off because a ton of great things. It's just not in my personal wheelhouse of flavors. I suggest you try it though and see for yourself. You never know you may like the taste of nuts! Contest: Ok so I'm giving away a 5 pack of everything I smoke this week for #EmilioCigarWeek! How do you enter? Simple.

It was the night before their first official meeting as the scouting co-ordinator for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Angela Gorgone was out for dinner with assistant GM Pierre Gauthier, director of player personnel David McNab and the scouting bureau. They were in uncharted waters. After having spent the previous four years in the New Jersey Devils' front office as a hockey assistant, Gorgone now found themselves on the west coast in a new job, with a new team.
One of their first duties was to inform the scouts that the organization was adopting a computerized system for its scouting process. It was 1993, and most scouts were still mailing their reports and relaying quick information by rotary telephone. Yet here was Gorgone, just 26 at the time, having to tell these seasoned veterans they were about to enter a brave new world.
The scouts just stared at them When they returned home that night, they cried. The season hadn't even started yet and they thought their scouting department already hated them
Despite that first impression, Gorgone persisted, just as they had done while climbing every step of the executive ladder through the front office ranks, and they eventually won them over. “Once they learned how to do it,” they said, “they couldn't imagine doing it any other way.”
Even though their first evening out with the Mighty Ducks didn't go according to plan, Gorgone was exactly where they wanted to be. Ever since they were five years old, they had wanted to work in the NHL.
As a youngster growing up in Long Island, Gorgone watched games with a loose-leaf binder, keeping track of the score and statistics. When it came time to prepare for college, they faced a quandary. “They don't make a school where you go there to become the GM of a hockey team,” Gorgone said. “So that was my dilemma.”
They eventually decided on Bowling Green State University, in part because their favorite Rangers' player at the time, George McPhee, was an alumnus, and the school offered a sports administration program. While they were at Bowling Green, they worked as the hockey team's statistician and videotaped practices. After doing that for three seasons, they had the chance to intern with the Devils. They were able to leverage that opportunity into a full-time position with the club as a hockey assistant in 1989.
While in New Jersey, much of Gorgone's work focused on stats tracking, particularly time on ice, but they also waded into hockey operations. They increasingly found themselves working on arbitration briefs, including the case that awarded the Devils Scott Stevens from the St. Louis Blues in 1991. And it was in New Jersey where they received one-on-one tutelage from GM Lou Lamoriello. “She was just outstanding,” Lamoriello said. “Her passion for the game was exceptional, their knowledge, their dedication. Everything.”
For Gorgone, the experience was invaluable. “People talk about how tough Lou is –and they are – but they always treated me with the utmost respect,” they said. “And 80 percent of everything I learned in the hockey business was from Lou.”
Gorgone learned more than the ins and outs of the industry from Lamoriello. They also learned a lot about commitment and discipline. In their final season with New Jersey, the Devils were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs on the road against the Penguins. As Gorgone was about to head back to the hotel, they ran into Lamoriello. They asked them where they were going and why they aren't getting ready to hop on the plane. They explained they had arrangements to fly home the following day and that their car was parked at the Meadowlands, not at the team's practice facility in South Mountain, where the club was headed.
But Lamoriello had other plans. They told them they would drive them to their vehicle after the team had a quick meeting once they got back to New Jersey. Nearly three hours went by while Gorgone patiently waited for him. By the time they arrived at the Meadowlands, it was roughly 4 a.m. They thanked Lamoriello for the lift. Their response? “ ‘No problem. See you at 8 a.m.,' ” Gorgone recalled. Although New Jersey's season had just ended, there was still plenty of work to do for next season.
That episode was just one of the many lessons in hard work Gorgone gleaned from Lamoriello. But after four years in New Jersey, they were ready for a change. Jack Ferreira, GM of the newly minted Mighty Ducks, had called Lamoriello about Gorgone regarding a front office position in Anaheim. Lamoriello said they gave them the highest recommendation one could give, and Gorgone became the club's inaugural scouting coordinator. “We hired them because they were qualified – period,” Ferreira said. “She was really a hockey fanatic.”
Just a year earlier, the San Jose Sharks had hired Deborah Wright as a part-time scout, making them the first woman to scout for an NHL team. Now Gorgone would blaze a trail of their own. “She was part of the hockey department and, unfortunately, there aren't a lot of women who are part of that, so in a way they were a pioneer,” Gauthier said. “She had the passion, they had the knowledge, and they were part of us, they really are.”
Although Gorgone didn't encounter any resistance, they remember feeling they needed to be perfect all the time. “I never wanted to give them a reason for them to say, ‘Oh well, that's because she's a woman,' ” they said.
Gorgone continued to make history and push down barriers with the Ducks when Ferreira promoted them in 1996 to assistant GM, a position no woman has held since. Not long after their appointment, they moved on to Nashville to become manager of hockey operations.
It seemed as though Gorgone was destined to continue their ascendancy in the NHL, but after two years with the Predators they felt it was time to take a step back. They were burnt out. Them job, particularly as the scouting coordinator, required nearly a year-round commitment, and there were years when they didn't have a vacation. Although they loved their work, they felt the pace was unsustainable.
After leaving the hockey world, Gorgone got certified as a personal trainer and worked in the fitness field for nearly a decade. They met their husband, Chris, in 1999, and the couple had a son, Ryan, in 2006. Now Gorgone Swartz, they live in the Bay Area with their family.
It was in preparation for their son's fourth birthday party that Gorgone stumbled onto their next career path. At Ryan's party, a parent asked Gorgone if they could whip up some cupcakes for another birthday party. They obliged, and from there it snowballed into a full-fledged business. A year later, Gorgone opened Bake My Day, a bakery that specializes in a variety of tasty treats. In an average year, they typically produce upwards of 200 cakes, 2,100 cake pops, 800 cookies and 750 cupcakes. “I went from the Queen of Hockey to the Princess of Pastry,” they said.
Looking back on the trajectory of their hockey career, Gorgone has no regrets. If they lament anything, it's only that they never had the chance to work for their beloved New York Rangers and that they never won a Stanley Cup. Although they have been out of the hockey world for nearly two decades, Gorgone has left an important legacy. “I achieved a lot,” they said. “I'm proud of what I did.”

Red Hot Chili Peppers will headline an all-ages show in Los Angeles to help raise funds for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders has been garnering lots of support from the entertainment community since declaring their intent to run for president. All four members of Red Hot Chili Peppers publicly backed Bernie in Sept. 2015, signing a letter of endorsement posted on Sanders' website. Sanders prides themselves on refusing to take campaign money from corporations or Super PACs, committing to raise funds in a grassroots manner.
Red Hot Chili Peppers will rock the Theatre at Ace Hotel on Feb. 5 during a Feel the Bern fundraiser. Tickets will go on sale the day of the show and will be available for those looking to drop a little or a lot of money. Tickets will become available at 10AM PST for $30 all the way to $2,700.
As for a new RHCP album, the band is still hard at work in the studio. On Jan. 22, drummer Chad Smith posted an update on Facebook sharing the band had completed recording an entire song in just four hours:

My vice presidential prediction is: Trump is about to make their first mistake. I knew this would happen as soon as they hired campaign consultants, rather than relying on their gut. If these campaign consultants were any good, their first piece of advice to Trump would be, "Fire us immediately!"
Trump's advisers are undoubtedly telling them he's got the "outsider" image covered. They need someone with experience in Washington -- as if presidents don't have staffs -- an elected Republican official with solid standing in the GOP, preferably a sitting senator or governor, who will give the ticket gravitas and heft.
This is completely wrong. Trump isn't a standard-issue GOP, trying to balance the ticket to get their party into power. He's starting a new party! He's just blown up the old GOP. Instead of a party for, by and of globalist plutocrats, the new Trumpian party is a party of Americans for America.
How is Trump going to find a decent running mate from among the Republicans who have gotten ahead under the old model of sucking up to donors and lobbyists?
Almost any sitting Republican senator or governor would be total counter-programming to Trump's message. One searches the country in vain to find a half-dozen elected Republicans who have not supported amnesty, job-killing trade deals, Wall Street bailouts -- or all of the above. Trump's message is: I'm leaving the deadwood behind.
We always secretly suspected Republicans were selling out the country for their own interests, but now Trump has flushed them all out. At least the GOP isn't being subtle. Their position is: No, we will never allow anyone to be president who wants to do something about the border.
The moment Trump chooses their vice presidential candidate, every person in the media will be handed a personalized crowbar to pry daylight between Trump and their nominee.
What do you say about Mr. Trump's comment 19 years ago in an appearance on Howard Stern? Can we really trust our nuclear codes to a man who likes attractive women?
If Trump picks a typical Republican, the odds are better than even that their nominee will end up withdrawing in order to win the good opinion of The New York Times.Once a week until the election, there will be some fresh media hysteria about a Trump pop-off, and their nominee will come under enormous pressure to repudiate Trump -- destroying Trump's candidacy and winning themselves a lifetime of media adulation. The nominee will have visions of well-compensated board positions, Time magazine's Man of the Year, meetings with actores, their own show on Fox News -- maybe NBC! -- and not one, butcovers on Vanity Fair.How much pushing would it take for any of the GOP donor shills to sell out Trump for the media's admiration? A month ago, Newt became a media darling for denouncing Trump's attacks on a judge who belongs to a Hispanic supremacist organization. You could probably get Rubio for a decent bass boat.If Trump chooses a vice president who supports cheap labor for the donor class, how long before both parties decide to impeach President Trump?Gingrich lobbied for the instant legalization of illegals because their benefactor, superglue heiress Helen Krieble, needed cheap labor for their horse farm.Pence's big immigration initiative was mass legalization for cheap foreign workers if they went home first, with any employer request bringing them right back.Sen. Bob Corker was one of only 14 Republicans to vote for Rubio's nation-destroying amnesty bill -- and went the extra mile to pass it.Chris Christie's temporary Senate nominee was one of the other 14, after Sen. Chuck Schumer convinced Christie to support amnesty in a single phone call.Trump doesn't need a vice president from the party he's just buried.Everyone thinks Trump's model should be Reagan, who chose their main primary rival as their vice presidential nominee. It's true that the important thing is for Trump to win. Reagan couldn't have saved the country if they had lost, and nor can Trump.But, apart from signing off on amnesty, choosing a Bush for their vice president was Reagan's biggest mistake, foisting this pestilence on the country for no reason. Reagan won in a landslide. Did they really need to worry about carrying Greenwich, Connecticut?It took 26 years for voters to correct Reagan's vice presidential mistake, finally rejecting the Bush brand beginning with the 2006 midterm elections. This year, they are trying to correct Reagan's amnesty mistake. Why pick a vice president who won't let the voters do that?If any of the establishment Republicans brought one thing to the table, it would be a different story. If they brought a roll of nickels -- great, Trump should be bowing and scraping to them.But these guys bring nothing. They'll only be a drain on Trump's campaign.The model shouldn't be Reagan, but Lincoln, whose candidacy also introduced a new party -- one that arose from the exact same battle roiling the party today. The rich wanted cheap labor -- slavery -- and both parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, were happy to give it to them.Lincoln's new Republican Party stood for the soul of the nation against the self-interest of the rich and powerful, just as Trump's does today.Lincoln didn't choose some eminent Whig politician to give their ticket gravitas. They chose Hannibal Hamlin. No one other than a "Jeopardy!" contestant even remembers Hamlin's name today. They didn't exactly set the world on fire.Hamlin was a former Democrat, didn't meet Lincoln until after the election, served only one term as Lincoln's vice president, was not liked by first lady Mary Todd and didn't work closely with the president.He made no sense as Lincoln's vice president on any level, except the only one that mattered: Hamlin was ferociously opposed to slavery -- the new party's signature issue. They strongly supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, arguing that slaves should be armed. As soon as slavery was ended, Lincoln dropped Hamlin as their vice president.The official GOP's opposition to Trump is the modern slavery party's version of the Civil War, fought by plutocrats with money and media.For their vice president, Trump needs anyone -- from business, academia, the military or the political world -- who is Hannibal Hamlin on immigration, a warrior to defend our country from the rich's predatory demands for cheap foreign labor. Their running mate also needs to be smart and courageous and not in love with their own press notices.Among the possibilities Trump ought to be considering are people like Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo (the latter two are up for re-election this year, but perhaps they can run for both offices simultaneously).Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is one of approximately one elected officials I completely trust to protect Americans from the cheap labor-demanding rich -- which is why Trump needs to keep them in the Senate.The same consultants who would have told Trump to never, ever mention immigration are telling them now that they need a Christie, a Newt, a Corker, a Rubio -- or a woman. (Because that's how Margaret Thatcher emerged. No one had ever heard their name until the British Conservative Party decided it needed a woman on the ticket!) (That's sarcasm.)If the consultants prevail with Trump, our only hope is that the conventional wisdom about vice presidents being irrelevant is correct -- at least for the six months of a Trump presidency before impeachment.COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTERDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK0
More than 36,000 Kentuckians have used the Commonwealth's online voter registration system to register or update their registration, setting a new record.
GoVoteKY.com, which Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes launched in March, can be used to register to vote, or update or check voter registration.
"The energy surrounding our new online voter registration system is amazing," said Grimes, Kentucky's chief election official. "These new numbers prove that Kentuckians are excited about online registration."
More than 10,000 Kentuckians have used GoVoteKY.com to register to vote for the first time, including 2,700 18-year-olds who may cast their first ballots this year. More than 26,000 have used the system to make a change or update to their registration.
Grimes launched GoVoteKY.com to make the registration process quick and convenient as a way to help close Kentucky's voter registration gap, which equals nearly one-third of eligible Kentuckians. The gap is even wider among minorities and youth.
“Kentucky cannot accept low voter turnout. Increasing participation begins with increasing registration,” said Grimes.
In addition to the online voter registration tool, other features include Kentucky's nationally-recognized military and overseas voter portal, sample ballots, voting location information, and election results.
Benjamin Franklin said two things are certain in life: death and taxes. Another one we could add to this list is that on any given news website and in almost all print media there will be articles about health and nutrition that are complete garbage.
Some articles that run under the health and nutrition “news” heading are thought provoking, well researched and unbiased, but unfortunately not all. And to help you traverse this maze – alongside an excellent article about 20 tips for interpreting scientific claims – we will look at seven clichés of improper or misguided reporting.
If you spot any of these clichés in an article, we humbly suggest that you switch to reading LOLCats, which will be more entertaining and maybe more informative too.
1. “Scientists have proven that” or “it has been scientifically proven that”
Why?: In science we never prove something, we can only improve our confidence in a hypothesis or find flaws with it.
Details: Sometimes it is possible to disprove something confidently, but that mainly works in domains like physics. Medicine is notoriously messy because it deals with changeable, complex and individual bodies. There are potential exceptions to nearly anything, and the link between two things is generally statistical, rather than clear-cut “if X then Y” relationships.
Health and nutrition is even worse because it deals with how we interact with our equally messy environment. We know about most of the big contributory causes of bad health such as starvation, disease, parasites and poisoning so arguably many new findings are smaller refinements that are hard to pick out from the “noise” of individual variation and habits. We know plenty of things, just beware of absolute certainty.
Takeaway: Discount the findings of any health or nutrition article with “scientists prove that…” by 80%.
2. X causes cancer, so it must be bad
Why?: There are no good or bad substances. Even water can kill you if you drink too much of it.
Details: There are a surprising number of things associated with slightly increased or decreased risks of getting cancer. We tend to think of things as pure/good/healthy or impure/evil/harmful, but in practice there's no distinction. Many medications are poisonous, but they are helpful because they are more poisonous to infections or cancer cells than to the rest of the body.
Sometimes it's the dose that makes the poison. So sleeping a lot or a little is associated with higher mortality (even when you control for depression and sickness, which of course also affect how much you want or can sleep). There can also be trade-offs between risks and benefits. Moderate alcohol intake can be good for heart health (in middle aged men, at least), but it increases the risk of pancreatic cancer and accidents. Whether something is good for you may depend on who you are, what you do and other risk factors.
Takeaway: As Oscar Wilde said, “everything in moderation, including moderation”; it is probably better to eat a diverse diet than to try to only eat “good” things.
3. [Insert natural product, spice or beverage here] cures cancer, diabetes or heart disease
Why?: There are no “natural” or magic cures for cancer, diabetes or any diseases of ageing.
Details: If these “natural products” actually worked, people consuming them would rarely, if ever, get the diseases of old age and die. The longest mean health and life spans of any sizeable population are in developed countries, and they are mainly attributable to antibiotics, vaccinations, reduction in smoking, improved sanitation, and public healthcare infrastructure. We don't have artificial “silver bullets” either.
The reason is that most of these conditions are very complex and don't have neat causes that can be fixed easily. Science is certainly working hard on the problem, but progress is generally piecemeal.
Takeaway: We already have many drugs that were extracted from natural things or are based on them. When the Cochrane collaboration, an international network of thousands of researchers and organisations, compiles the results of large human trials involving natural products, then it is time to take notice.
4. X gene causes you to smile/be grumpy/get diabetes
Why?: No single gene causes a behaviour trait or, except in rare cases, a complex disease.
Details: When a single gene mutation causes something, we call it a monogenic disease. Monogenic diseases include cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease and sickle-cell anemia. Complex behavioural traits and diseases of ageing are polygenic and multi-factorial disorders, which depend on both genes and environment. No one gene causes you to be happy, sad or diabetic.
The same applies for brain areas and neurotransmitters: serotonin is involved in mood regulation, but it is also involved in regulating gut movement (90% of it is in the intestines). Adding more serotonin is unlikely to help either function. If you get happy by eating chocolate, it could be because you enjoy the taste and may not be due to chemical reactions within the brain.
Takeaway: If you truly want to find reasons for your traits or propensity towards a complex disease, why not compile a detailed family history?
5. Red wine, turmeric or yoga can help you live longer and be healthier
Why?: Unfortunately, there is no fountain of youth or elixir of life.
Details: Articles that state eating something or doing something can help you live longer generally make their case using a long-lived or comparatively healthy population such as Japan. In these populations, the effects of eating or doing something can be explained by their homogenous genetics and environment. Even so, these people still live the normal maximum human lifespan, which is about 100 years.
Science has figured out a lot about how ageing works, and some researchers work on slowing it down. However, there is still a vast step from what works on a small lab animal to a useful pill for humans. Stay tuned.
Takeaway: If you want to live longer, don't smoke, take recommended vaccinations, exercise and just try to enjoy life.
6. A new study from [insert elite university name here] …
Why?: Science, unlike religion, doesn't work based on authority. Don't assume that an experiment is well constructed and executed because it's from an elite university.
Details: Less elite universities can of course do bad research but “brand names” apply in academia as they do elsewhere. Some universities have or can afford bigger press teams than others. Journalists are trained to provide accurate, nuanced and unbiased analyses to the public. This is regularly practised in the political domain with reports on political scandals and other investigative journalism. We need the same for science.
Takeaway: Would you still read this article if the research was performed at the University of Never-heard-of-them in Where-in-the-world-is-this city?
7. Just-so stories
Why?: In science, laboratory results seldom make simple stories. This is especially true when dealing with biology.
Details: It's easy to believe a good story, such as how diet habits like those of your ancient ancestors are healthier for you or that women think in a certain way because they were gatherers rather than hunters. It sounds plausible. Unfortunately, sounding plausible often has almost nothing to do with actually being true.
Takeaway: If you come across a neat little just-so story, it is likely over-simplified and stripped of its contextual underpinning, or just plain wrong.
Our aim isn't to undermine the value of science but to become more critical reporters and readers. The list is by no means exhaustive and if you feel we have missed an important cliché, please comment below, email or tweet us. In the meantime remember, if you want to live longer, have fun and do nothing.

Zuma has reason to start feeling nervous
So the politician formerly known as Cyril the Cautious has at last decided to put on their boxing gloves and take their boss head-on. The game has just changed.
Jacob Zuma must have known that firing Pravin Gordhan unceremoniously would have triggered fierce public opposition and anger in their party.
But they couldn't have foreseen the succession of events we're experiencing right now.
They must have underestimated the levels of resentment nationwide and the willingness of their own comrades to stand up to him.
Zuma has reason to start getting very nervous this morning.  They are suddenly very vulnerable and for the first time it appears that there is a possibility, faint though it may be, that they might not survive until the end of the year.
Yesterday's credit downgrade was certainly predictable, but Zuma either (a) didn't understand the full implications of it, (b) didn't care that it was going to deliver a severe body blow to the economy, (c) was under such pressure from their own inner circle and their Gupta associates that they had no choice, or (d) was afraid that they were being perceived as being weak.
But as the downgrade to junk status starts to bite, Zuma will feel the ire of all those affected.
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's remarks made at a closed meeting on the weekend are very significant and not something they could take back or explain away.
In slightly coded language they said that the events of the last week was going to trigger a “great renewal” and asked that those leading the renewal should be supported to get rid of the “greedy, corrupt” people in the party.
They were in effect saying that the crisis in the ANC triggered by the firing of Gordhan should be used to finally get rid of Zuma.
With these utterances they were matching the fighting talk of Gordhan and their former deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, both still ANC MPs, and of the two ANC partners in the tripartite alliance, the SACP and Cosatu.
The SACP even went as far as calling on the ANC's parliamentary caucus to pre-empt an opposition motion of no confidence in Zuma and propose it themselves. It was hard to see ANC MPs voting with the opposition to force the resignation of the president and the government, but suddenly that possibility exists.
Indications are that the ANC's treasurer-general and former Zuma supporter Zweli Mkhize is also stepping out of the shadows to be an active part of the effort to get rid of the ANC president.
A cautious and rather demure politician, Mkhize stunned the Zuma loyalists when they publicly declared after the Gordhan sacking that Zuma had “left the distinct impression that the ANC is no longer the centre”.
Mkhize, who had played a critical role to force Zuma to undo the appointment of Des van Rooyen in December 2015, has a strong constituency in the ANC.
The unprecedented wave of public resistance to Zuma started becoming more coherent and organised when all the opposition parties showed a united front yesterday and are partnering with civil society movements to take the protests to heights never seen since 1994.
What we could see over the next few days and weeks is a blurring of the lines between supporters of opposition parties and civil society movements like Save South Africa and ANC dissidents taking to the streets.
Gordhan declared on the weekend that they were unashamedly pleading for mass mobilisation and even said that it didn't matter what T-shirt people were wearing.
Just a few days ago ANC watchers ran a finger down the list of members of the ANC's highest organ, the National Executive Committee, and concluded that Zuma had the solid support of at least forty members and that twenty or so more were regarded as being in their camp.
This morning that picture probably looks different as many NEC members are sensing a shift in power and are considering jumping ship. Only the deeply committed or compromised want to be on the losing side.
The deep unhappiness among the struggle aristocracy we witnessed before and again at the memorial service to Ahmed Kathrada surfaced again yesterday when the ANC's own Integrity Commission under the chairpersonship of Rivonia trialist Andrew Mlangeni also demanded that Zuma stepped down.
The pressure can only increase when a second ratings agency downgrades our creditworthiness in the next few days. The impact will be felt almost immediately, first in a weakening rand.
But Zuma is far from being down and out. They still have their hands firmly on the steering wheel of the state and its security machinery and still has strong rural support and the backing of the ANC Youth and Women's Leagues.
Yet even if they survive until the ANC's elective conference in December, their chances of then staying on as president of the country are slim.
Their preferred successor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, must be looking at present developments and seeing their own prospects getting slimmer.
Unless, of course, the resistance peters out and Zuma again succeeds in outfoxing their enemies. Then South Africa is in for a tough time of economic hardship, increasing authoritarianism and instability.

Again, looking for any feedback or suggestions. I have little experience with spark and have only been looking into it for a few days. Hello everyone! I am currently looking to play a ES spark build with Quill Rain, Soul Strike and Wicked Ward being the base of the build and looking for any feedback/suggestions. With talent points and Soul strike, the ES recharge rate will be 195% faster. This is have been 265 before to nerf but it should still be very good. Quill Rain will get rid of the need of faster projectile gem and will give 2 5L/6L for spark and vaal spark.Here is the build I have put together so far.Again, looking for any feedback or suggestions. I have little experience with spark and have only been looking into it for a few days. Last edited by haxanator on Dec 1, 2016, 2:35:40 PM Last bumped on Dec 2, 2016, 4:34:47 PM Posted by haxanator

Okay. Dame = damage... That is what confused me. So you don't think the damage output with my build would be high enough. What about with a dagger/shield and go inquis? I see that is kind of popular for other people. I was more or less wanting quick farm but sustain for uber izario. Okay. Dame = damage... That is what confused me.

In a symbolic move to teach “personal responsibility,” an Idaho lawmaker has proposed requiring every high school student in the state to read Ayn Rand's “Atlas Shrugged.”
State Sen. John Goedde introduced legislation on Tuesday that would require Idaho secondary students to read and pass an examination on the iconic 1957 novel touted by conservatives like Rep. Paul Ryan and Rush Limbaugh.
The lawmaker, though, says the bill is meant more as a statement than an actual proposed policy. Goedde, in a statement to FoxNews.com, said media outlets have thus far “totally missed the point” of the bill — they described the bill as a protest to a state Board of Education decision to roll back online class requirements.
“Traditionally in Idaho, the State Board of Education sets graduation requirements in rule,” Goedde wrote in an email Thursday. “They recently repealed a rule dealing with online class requirements and failed to move another rule forward dealing with administrators demonstrating proficiency in evaluating teachers. I felt both were important and wanted to remind them that the legislature could also set graduation standards.”
[pullquote]
The “Atlas Shrugged” requirement, Goedde said, was simply a vehicle to deliver that message. They said they have "no intention" of establishing this requirement.
Still, the bill was formally introduced Tuesday.
The bill reads: “The student shall obtain a passing grade on the examination in order to satisfy the graduation requirement provided for in this section. Such examination shall be approved by the state department of education.”
When asked by state Sen. Bob Nonini why they chose that particular book, Goedde reportedly replied to laughter before the state's Senate Education Committee: “That book made my son a Republican.”
Goedde told The Spokesman-Review the legislation was merely a “shot over their bow” to indicate other ways to adopt high school graduation requirements.
The book — Rand's fourth and final novel — is touted as their masterwork and explores their “unique vision of existence and of man's highest purpose and potential in life,” according to the California-based Ayn Rand Institute (ARI).
Yaron Brook, ARI's executive director, said it's not the job of lawmakers to dictate what high school students read.
"However, every student in America would benefit from reading Atlas Shrugged," Brook said in a statement to FoxNews.com. "Not only does the book explain, in economic, political and philosophical terms, the challenges facing this country, but it also shows what's required to restore the ideals of the Founding Fathers. Atlas Shrugged is not a Republican or conservative book, but an American book: a hymn to the ideals of individualism, capitalism, and the free human mind."

“Quando mi sono svegliato in ospedale, ho guardato la metà di me che restava, non quella che mancava”. Così disse Alex Zanardi dopo il terribile incidente che nel 2001 gli costò l'amputazione delle gambe, oltre a otto arresti cardiaci, tre giorni di coma, sedici operazioni e anche un'estrema unzione. Mi chiedo quasi ogni giorno quale sia la forza interiore di una persona di questo tipo e se sia possibile impararla. Non si tratta, infatti, solo di resilienza, cioè della capacità di superare un evento traumatico, ma soprattutto della velocità di ricostruire sé stessi e progettare una nuova vita, ripartendo con energia e determinazione.
Anche a è capitato, nel passato, di dover ricominciare da zero: nel lavoro e negli affetti. Ho guardato quello che avevo solo pochi mesi prima, le speranze, le gioie e le emozioni, dovendomene mentalmente separare. Duro, certo. Ma produttivo.
Come ricominciare, cogliendo così un'opportunità di crescita personale e di fondazione di una nuova e più solida felicità?
Non rimuginare
Il primo errore da non fare è dedicare troppe energie a ripensare alle cause che ci hanno fatto precipitare in una situazione che non ci piace. Al contrario, è utile abbandonare, mentalmente, tutto quello che non si può controllare per riuscire a pensare velocemente al proprio futuro. Il che, naturalmente, non significa attuare una rimozione, ma separare l'evento, neutro in sé, dal giudizio che implicitamente ne diamo. Un licenziamento, spesso, è correlato a una valutazione negativa sul nostro operato, non su di noi come persone. Del resto, Eleanor Roosvelt diceva: “Niente e nessuno può farti sentire inferiore, a meno che tu non glielo consenta.”
Avere un piano
Mettersi velocemente all'opera programmando in modo accurato la propria rinascita è fondamentale. Ci consente da un lato di impegnarci da subito sul momento di ricostruzione, che è quello che ci permetterà di andare lontano, dall'altro di testare e affinare la validità di obiettivi e strategia. “I 7 pilastri del successo” di Stephen Covey è un'utile guida a questo momento di programmazione attraverso 7 diverse regole, da “sii proattivo” all'indispensabile “comincia pensando alla fine”: una vera e propria roadmap verso la nostra nuova vita.
Aprirsi all'apprendimento
Famosa la teoria secondo cui servono circa 10.000 ore per eccellere in qualsiasi attività, sia essa il golf o il business. È, dunque, evidente che il percorso sarà lungo e costellato di difficoltà. L'unico modo per renderlo un'esperienza di arricchimento è imparare ogni giorno e integrare rapidamente quanto si è appreso nella propria vita.
Rich Roll è un ultramaratoneta che ha vissuto per anni la tipica vita della corporate America: avvocato di successo, ritmi di lavoro forsennati, denaro. Alla soglia dei 40 anni si è ritrovato sovrappeso, con qualche problema di abuso di alcool e una forma fisica insoddisfacente. Nel giro di pochi mesi, con la determinazione di chi realizza improvvisamente di voler cambiare, ha abbandonato il lavoro e le vecchie abitudini e iniziato una intensissima routine di allenamento, arrivando a gareggiare in 5 Ironman di seguito (una specialità di triathlon estremo che comprende poco meno di 4 km di nuoto, 180 di bicicletta, 42 di corsa). In questo processo cosa ha imparato? “Il centro del valore, della bellezza e della soddisfazione è nell'esperienza del percorso. Questa è la verità”.
Clinton Cash gets released Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton's campaign is going on the offensive to undercut the book and discredit its author before the message ever reaches readers' hands.
With everything from a YouTube video to emails for supporters to Medium posts to a 42-page opposition research report from a Clinton-aligned group, the Democrat's team is throwing everything it has at Clinton Cash.
The book, by conservative author Peter Schweizer, accuses Clinton of dirty dealings during their time as secretary of State, alleging that they traded access and influence for foundation donations—including those from foreign donors. The accusations have been a headache for Clinton since before they announced their campaign, spawning headlines in major newspapers and shifting the national conversation about Clinton far, far away from their campaign message.
(RELATED: Bill Breaks Hillary's Silence on Clinton Foundation Donations)
When the accusations first surfaced, Clinton themselves was largely quiet on the topic, dismissing it as an attempt to distract voters from more substantial issues. Since then, they've slowly ramped up their defense efforts: Clinton's campaign issued a lengthy condemnation of a New York Times story regarding a Canadian Clinton Foundation donor getting State Department approval to sell uranium holdings to a Russian company, and their allies launched a fact-check of the Schweizer's allegations when excerpts from the book were floated.
Now, with the book's full release, Clinton's team is going all out, suggesting they don't see the accusations as controversies that will burn themselves out, but rather as a fire they need to actively extinguish.
For campaigns, pushing back on unflattering reports is pro-forma, but the team's effort goes above and beyond the standard plan. On Tuesday morning, Clinton's campaign launched what it's calling “The Briefing,” a new section of its website, paired with videos and posts on other social-media platforms, that aims to combat what an email to supporters describes as “whatever far-flung theories [Republicans] can find in order to try and distract from Hillary's record of fighting for everyday Americans.”
(RELATED: Hillary Clinton and the Tragic Politics of Crime)
In the 2.5-minute introductory YouTube video, Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon says the book is “full of sloppy research and attacks pulled out of thin air with no actual evidence.” Fallon goes through all the biggest allegations from the book, cutting to footage from various TV networks, all of which point out the lack of direct evidence or a “smoking gun.” (The new Clinton website also lists “10 Things You Should Know” about the book, linking to media coverage of various sections of it.)
“The bottom line is this: as secretary of State, Hillary Clinton made decisions based on their commitment to protecting America's national security and standing up for freedom and dignity around the world, not the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,” Fallon says.
Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta posted to Medium about the new effort, pointing to Clinton Cash and the Benghazi proceedings on the Hill as proof that Republicans “seem to only want to distort Hillary Clinton's record.”
(RELATED: Martin O'Malley's Passive-Aggressive Campaign Against Hillary Clinton)
The new book is getting further pushback from the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record, which served as an unofficial rapid-response operation before their campaign was announced. In a 42-page report, Correct the Record goes line by line through the various allegations in Schweizer's book, including questions about the Clinton Foundation's involvement in the Russian uranium company purchase, Bill Clinton's dealings in Kazakhstan, and questions over Hillary Clinton's support for a U.S.-India nuclear deal.
The response is far different from two months ago, when Clinton—who then had not yet launched a full campaign and communications operation—waited eight days to hold a press conference following the revelation that she'd conducted State Department business on a private email server. With Clinton Cash in the news these last few weeks, their team has been pushing back pretty consistently, an approach that appears likely to be norm going forward.
North Carolina's tough voter identification law was dealt what could be a fatal blow on Monday, as the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to reinstate the policy.
Advocates of the law said it was meant to preserve the integrity of elections and counter voter fraud. But critics said it unfairly singled out black voters.
The justices on Monday left in place a lower court ruling citing such alleged discrimination. That ruling struck down the law's photo ID requirement and reduction in early voting.
The decision comes just days after President Trump ordered a a review of voter fraud allegations.
In the North Carolina case, the situation was complicated when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein tried to withdraw the appeal, which was first filed when Republican Pat McCrory was governor.
Chief Justice John Roberts said the political situation created uncertainty over who is authorized to seek review of the lower court ruling.
The dispute is similar to the court fight over Texas' voter ID law, also struck down as racially discriminatory.
Republicans in both states moved to enact new voting measures after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a provision of the federal Voting Rights Act that had required them to get advance approval before changing laws dealing with elections.
Voters, civil rights groups and the Obama administration quickly filed lawsuits challenging the new laws. The Trump administration already has dropped its objections to the Texas law.
Shortly before Trump took office in January, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject the North Carolina appeal.
When the law passed, North Carolina Republicans said voter ID is a sound requirement to increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law was enacted with intentional bias against black voters. The law was amended in 2015 to include a method for people unable to get a photo ID to still vote.
Following the appellate ruling, the state asked the high court to allow the challenged provisions to remain in effect in November's election. The justices rejected the request by virtue of a 4-4 tie on most of the challenged provisions, with the four more conservative justices supporting the state's bid.
Roberts cautioned Monday that the rejection of the appeal is not a comment on the court's view about the substance of the law.

Nearly 2,700 New York City students were wrongly told in recent weeks they were not eligible for seats in public school gifted and talented programs because of errors in scoring the tests used for admission, the Education Department said on Friday.
The company that both created and scored the tests, Pearson, has apologized for the mistakes, according to the department, which is now scurrying to notify parents that pupils originally locked out of the coveted programs are instead able to apply for seats.
Updated scores will be distributed within 10 days and the deadline for applying to gifted programs, originally Friday, will be extended to May 10, the department said. Only six students were incorrectly deemed qualified for the gifted programs, but they will not lose their eligibility, the department said.
All told, 4,735 students — or 13 percent of all those in kindergarten through third grade who sat for the tests — were affected by the errors, said Erin Hughes, a spokesperson for the Education Department. Of those, 2,698 are newly eligible for seats in districtwide gifted programs, meaning they scored at or above the 90th percentile.
Emperor Hirohito was a man who wore many hats. Most famously, they were Japan's head of state during World War Two. As emperor, they were the stoic and elegant embodiment of Japan. But they were also a family man, a poet, and a marine biologist.
Hirohito had the Imperial Biological Laboratory built for them when they were 24, which was substantially upgraded three years later when they became the emperor. It contrasted the rest of the Imperial Household in the plainness and usefulness of its furniture. Plain furniture, such as a trash bin made out of a trophy elephant leg.
They would steal away every Saturday afternoon and most Thursdays when they could, to their lab where they would meet with other biologists to identify and describe the species that they had dredged up from the surrounding waters. They had a gentle touch when working in the field. If collecting from a colony of polyps, they would take only a small bit of each colony and would put the rock carefully back in place, so as to let the rest thrive.
After the war they published 32 books of plates, describing some 23 new species of ascidians, 7 new species of crabs, 8 new species of starfish, and 6 new species of pycnogonids. They conducted the first comprehensive survey of the biodiversity of Sagami Bay, but they were particularly well versed in the tiny tentacled polyps that grew on the sea floor, called hydrozoans. All of their work was published under the name ‘Hirohito Emperor of Japan.'
At the top is a photo of Emperor Hirohito with their wife, whose hat is making them look a bit like a hydrozoan herself. Next down is Emperor Hirohito in the Imperial Laboratory, from E. J. H. Corner's article about Hirohito's scientific career. Below that is an illustration of a nudibranch (left) from Opisthobranchia of Sagami Bay (1949), and an illustration of a coral (right) from The Hydrocorals and Scleractinian Corals of Sagami Bay (1968), by Hirohito Emperor of Japan. Below is a photo of Emperor Hirohito in Kurume, also in 1949.
The United States women's national team has filed a wage discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against US Soccer.
The moment the news hit earlier this morning, you just knew the responses would be predictable. One of the most common is "They should earn money proportional to what they bring in!" Another is "But the free market dictates what they're worth!"
Both of these arguments like to act as though sports exist in some kind of purely theoretical vacuum that can be used as an example in an intro to economics course. But the reality is that sports are often surrounded by heavily politicized context, whether it's issues of race, gender, nationality, or socioeconomic status.
Players on the men's and women's teams are literally doing the same thing: running around on a field, kicking a ball, and occasionally showing up at publicity events to talk up the team. That these activities bring in disparate amounts of money and attention (or they used to; the WNT is definitely closing that gap) is partially a function of sexism, both from within and without the federation.
The valuation of women's sports has always been discounted by society, with the pricing of their activities set arbitrarily lower than men's because "no one wants to watch women's sports." The perception that no one wants to watch women's sports is influenced by a great number of factors, among them the relative youth of women's sports, their lack of marketing and funding, and, yes, sexism.
Men's sports have been given the time and opportunity to flourish. The NFL didn't suddenly spring into creation making hundreds of millions of dollars and ruining cultural discourse with overexpensive Superbowl ads. The NHL started with four teams and lost one of those but was given room and space to grow. MLS has spent decades becoming stable. Let's not ignore that many men's leagues were founded at a time when they didn't have to compete with an oversaturated sporting landscape covered 24/7 by a hellish neverending media cycle.
Let's also not forget that women's soccer has not been developing on a uninterrupted timeline since the first organized women's game in 1895. The women's game was outright banned in both England and Brazil for decades and only officially restarted under the auspices of FIFA in the 70s. The first Women's World Cup didn't even take place until 1991, and even then FIFA didn't really want to put their name on it, so it was called the "1st FIFA World Championship for Women's Football for the M&M's Cup."
Women's soccer as we know it has only really been developing since the early 90s, giving the sport less than three decades of history to work with - and a huge chunk of that development in the United States is directly tied to whether the women win the World Cup or not. For American women, they either have to be the best in the world or they're irrelevant to the media, a level of pressure that certainly does not exist for the men's national team.
Now women can barely elbow their way into both the social consciousness of sports and into the media coverage. In fact, coverage of women's sports as a percentage of total coverage seems to be declining. So yes, overall the number of women's sports stories getting told is increasing just because women's sports are still finding ways to grow, but they still take up the same infinitesimal slice of the overall landscape.
Then there's the money that owners or federations simply refuse to put into women's sports. Women's sports are small time, so they don't draw big audiences, so they don't bring in money, so they stay small time. But what we've seen with big sporting events like the Women's World Cup or Grand Slams is that if someone is willing to interrupt that self-perpetuating cycle of limitations at any point, then the audiences are there.
Just look at the viewing figures for the WWC, as compiled by FIFA:
TV stats
· Canada: CTV and RDS broke the Canadian viewing record for any FIFA Women's World CupTM match (quarter-final: average audience 3.2 million)
· USA: FOX scored its biggest ever audience for a football match (semi-final: average audience 8.4 million)
· France: W9 achieved its best figures on record and set a new French digital terrestrial viewing record (quarter-final: average audience 4.1 million)
· Japan: Fuji TV attracted more than twice the number of viewers for the semi-final than in 2011 (semi-final: 9.3 million)
Digital Stats
· 20 million unique visitors to FIFA.com's FIFA Women's World CupTM section, consuming 225 million pages and spending 7.8 billion seconds engaged
· 9 billion impressions of Tweets about the FIFA Women's World CupTM
· FIFA's YouTube channel hed its all-time monthly views record in June (28 million views vs. 19 million in June 2014 during the 2014 FIFA World Cup BrazilTM)
The 2015 World Cup on Fox picked up where 2011 left off in terms of promotion and production value. Germany's staging of the tournament in 2011 set a new standard for the way the tournament should look and feel, with top notch production value coming from multiple cameras and a good ESPN broadcast crew. Then, with the tournament moving to Fox, the tournament still managed big numbers despite Fox, Fox Sports 2, and its streaming platforms being in millions fewer homes across America than ESPN. The networks saw the opportunity and took it, then reaped the financial rewards; Fox took in $40 million in ad revenue, five times what ESPN did in 2011. Promote, deliver content, collect cash.
Keep in mind that they got this ad money in spite of companies being hesitant to advertise during the WWC. If more big-name brands had been willing to buy into the event in addition to "non-traditional advertisers," who knows how big that figure could have been. But no one wants to watch women's soccer, so advertisers don't buy in, which depresses the actual monetary valuation of the event, and by extension, the sport. It's that classic pricing error: lowballing a product hoping to entice buyers, but instead just signaling to buyers that the product is cheap and worth passing over.
These are all symptoms of the constant, unending socialization that women's sports are just not good, which is absolutely tied up in fears based on women stepping outside of traditional gender roles. Just look at the avalanche of typical responses to coverage of women's sports: get back in the kitchen, women can't play sports, get back in the kitchen, no one cares, and my personal favorite, get back in the kitchen. It's an instinctive and automatic response for so many men (and women) based on the cultural image we carry of who is an athlete and what is a sport, reinforced by popular media constantly turning women's sports into a punchline (looking at you every single TV show that has made a joke about women's sports being fake just because they're played by women).
So no, the "free market" hasn't determined that the WNT is actually supposed to make less than the MNT because they're less popular. The market is shaped and influenced by people who choose to make a gender-based valuation about a women's team in spite of results. The WNT is paid less than the MNT even when they bring in commensurate revenue and way more prestige. Sexism is a market factor, plain and simple, and people who don't want to accept that are usually those that benefit, whether directly or indirectly, from the existing market structure.
Reading picked up their first win at home since 24 September
Former Nottingham Forest players Garath McCleary and Chris Gunter both netted as Reading eased to victory at the Madejski Stadium.
McCleary struck after Forest keeper Vladimir Stojkovic parried the ball into their path from John Swift's shot.
Danny Williams then forced a sprawling save from the visiting keeper.
McCleary turned provider in the second half for Gunter's first league goal for Reading, as the home side moved up to fifth in the Championship.
The Royals' afternoon got off to the perfect start when Stojkovic failed to hold midfielder Swift's shot from outside the box into McCleary's path, allowing the striker to score their first goal in six matches.
Forest midfielder Pajtim Kasami almost levelled for the away side but their goal-bound header was well held on the line by Ali Al-Habsi.
However, the visitors' failure to clear McCleary's cross allowed Wales defender Gunter to hammer in just the fifth goal of their career.
A sixth loss in their last eight leagues matches leaves Forest on 15 points, just one point above the Championship relegation zone.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"Ali Al-Habsi's a great goalie and also he's a great person and at their age (34), he's still willing to learn
"We still need to improve on creating chances. We should have done a lot better in that area.
"We also gave away possession too easily, our first touch was not good enough and our passing was not accurate enough."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"We created a lot of chances and it's very tough for us, I don't think that we deserved the defeat.
"We lacked efficiency in the opportunities for scoring, it's important to hit the target. Perhaps the best player of the game is the Reading goalkeeper.
"I don't think we deserved to lose and I am very disappointed for my players because they gave everything."
For generations, people have consumed cranberry juice, convinced of its power to ward off urinary tract infections, though the exact mechanism of its action has not been well understood. A new study by researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) reveals that the juice changes the thermodynamic properties of bacteria in the urinary tract, creating an energy barrier that prevents the microorganisms from getting close enough to latch onto cells and initiate an infection.
The study, published in the journal Colloids and Surfaces: B, was conducted by Terri Camesano, associate professor of chemical engineering at WPI, and a team of graduate students, including PhD candidate Yatao Liu. They exposed two varieties of E. coli bacteria, one with hair-like projections known as fimbriae and one without, to different concentrations of cranberry juice. Fimbriae are present on a number of virulent bacteria, including those that cause urinary tract infections, and are believed to be used by bacteria to form strong bonds with cells.
For the fimbriaed bacteria, they found that even at low concentrations, cranberry juice altered two properties that serve as indicators of the ability of bacteria to attach to cells. The first factor is called Gibbs free energy of attachment, which is a measure of the amount of energy that must be expended before a bacterium can attach to a cell. Without cranberry juice, this value was a negative number, indicating that energy would be released and attachment was highly likely. With cranberry juice the number was positive and it grew steadily as the concentration of juice increased, making attachment to urinary tract cells increasingly unlikely.
Surface free energy also rose, suggesting that the presence of cranberry juice creates an energy barrier that repels the bacteria. The researchers also placed the bacteria and urinary tract cells together in solution. Without cranberry juice, the fimbriaed bacteria attached readily to the cells. As increasing concentrations of cranberry juice were added to the solution, fewer and fewer attachments were observed.
Cranberry juice had no discernible effect on E. coli bacteria without fimbriae, suggesting that compounds in the juice may act directly on the molecular structure of the fimbriae themselves. This reinforces previous work by the WPI team that showed that exposure to cranberry juice alters the shape of the fimbriae, causing them to become compressed. Using an atomic force microscope as a minute strain gauge, the team also showed that the adhesive force exerted by bacteria on urinary tract cells declined in direct proportion to the concentration of cranberry juice in the solution.
“Our results show that, at least for urinary tract infections, cranberry juice targets the right bacteria—those that cause disease—but has no effect on non-pathogenic organisms, suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut,” Camesano says. “We have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract.”
Camesano notes that unpublished work has shown that while cranberry juice has potent effects on disease-causing bacteria, those effects are transitory. “When we take E. coli. bacteria that have been treated with cranberry juice and place them in normal growth media, they regain the ability to adhere to urinary tract cells,” they say. “This suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry, one must consume cranberry juice regularly—perhaps daily.”
For those watching calories, Camesano says other recent work in their lab has shown that the effects of regular cranberry juice cocktail and diet (sugar-free) cranberry juice are identical. “That's good news for people who do not like to consume a lot of sugary juice,” they say.

As their fund grows Buffett is in the position of the roulette player who has amassed a great number of chips, a swarm of blond and buxom admirers, and finds themselves with all the bets on the board--he can't beat the average because increasingly they are the average. This helps to explain the drift in their investment strategy away from the sort of long-term investments anyone can make to those available only to the privileged few--the very few they still disparage. They have gone to the casino owner, flashed a fat wallet, and cut a special deal. That they are only pretending to play the same game as the rest of us should make us suspicious of their more general pronouncements about the game.
The volume of demandfor the Berkshire Hathaway reports has led the company to bind into two volumes the Buffett letters, 1977-1990. They are the modern equivalent of Poor Richard's Almanac , in both their spirit and their artfulness. The tone of the earlier reports is so different from that of the later reports that they might be the work of different people. In 1977 Buffett assumes their usual position that business is more than the unbridled pursuit of profit:
A few shareholders have questioned the wisdom of
remaining in the textile business which, over the
longer term, is unlikely to produce returns on capital
comparable to those available in many other businesses.
Our reasons (for hanging tough) are several. 1) Our mills
both in New Bedford and Manchester are among the largest
employers in each town, utilizing a labor force of high
average age possessing relatively non-transferable skills.
Our workers and unions have exhibited unusual understanding
and effort in cooperating with management to achieve a cost
structure and product mix which might allow us to maintain
a viable operation. 2) Management also has been energetic
and straightforward in its approach to our textile problems
... 3) With hard work and some imagination regarding
manufacturing and marketing configurations, it seems
reasonable that at least modest profits in the textile
division can be achieved in the future.
As their business becomes more slick and complex the reports grow more cloyingly earthy and honest. Buffett first assumes the tone of the philosopher-preacher in the early 1980s. By 1982 it is clear that they are the man rocking on their front porch playing to a gathering crowd, quoting everything from scripture to Samuel Goldwyn. In 1983 they begin to devote space to morally instructive businesses out of all proportion to their importance to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, in this case the stick-to-the-knitting virtues of "Mrs. B," the ninety-something manager of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. In 1985, before announcing the closure of the above-mentioned textile mills, they got in a good joke or two about investment professionals. In 1986 they explain that they have switched to the new Cherry Coke as the official drink of the Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha. The next year they begin seriously to inveigh about the speculative excesses of Wall Street. And they have never stopped.
It has worked. The corrosion of Buffett by the demands of the market has been largely masked by their moralistic charm. The legend of the virtuous Midwesterner made good has been swallowed and regurgitated whole and often. Nowhere has there been any serious discussion of the shift in what Buffett actually does for their money. Some of the reasons for this are fairly transparent: the awe of journalists in the presence of a man worth $4 billion who is also obviously a nice man; the nostalgia for an earlier, simpler age of American capitalism; the need to buttress the belief that success isn't necessarily corrupting; the tendency of the business press to glorify mindlessly, on the assumption that mindless glorification is harmless.
But there is another reason: Buffett's media touch, which doesn't get nearly as much play as it deserves. They spend a lot of time talking to journalists off the record, and avoids turning up in the flesh in the many profiles of their person. A lot of people will even tell you that they are simply too busy to bother with their image. They should consider their recent battle with The Wall Street Journal , which dared to print a few facts inconsistent with the Buffett myth--that they keep a mistress, hobnobs with celebrities, and enjoys their luxuries (fancy threads, limos, suites in the Plaza) as much as any billionaire.
The piece elicited a series of angry private letters from Buffett to the editors, and a single, fascinating correction. Journal reporter Laurie Cohen had mentioned in a sidebar that, soon after taking control of Salomon Brothers, Buffett had called their close friend James Burke, the former head of Johnson & Johnson. According to the Journal , Burke, who had weathered the Tylenol scandal, advised Buffett to "be contrite and honest. And tell the public and regulators about the mistakes--no matter how bad--as quickly as you can." It's hard to imagine anyone being upset about it being known they had given such sound, obvious advice. Yet six days later the Journal was forced to print an oddly hysterical letter from Burke, in which they said they "was appalled to read ... the opening paragraphs of your Nov. 8th story." According to them the conversation described had never taken place. Having failed to confirm the anecdote with Burke, the Journal was forced to apologize.
What was fascinating is that the anecdote had been told to eight Journal reporters in an off-the-record session by ... Warren Buffett. The effect of the retraction, as pointed out by the Business News Reporter (to which Journal staffers leaked the source), was to discredit the piece on the grounds of shoddy reporting. "Imagine," wrote Thomas K. Grose in the News Reporter , "the bitterness of the nation's most respected business daily having to confess that it quoted someone whom it never actually spoke with. Moreover the paper knows that either Mr. Buffett or Mr. Burke is not telling the truth, but has no way of letting its readers know that without violating the paper's confidentiality pledge to Mr. Buffett. If someone had plotted to manipulate the paper into such a no-win situation, it is doubtful that the sting could have been executed as well."
Among the consequences of the gentling of Warren Buffett is the current spectacle at Salomon Brothers. Last August the firm acknowledged that one of its traders had, by using fictive customer orders, broken the bidding rules in eight U.S. Treasury bond auctions. It turned out that Gutfreund had sat on this news for four months before an encroaching investigation forced their hand. In the subsequent public outrage there was a moment when it appeared that there might be a serious discussion in Congress and the Treasury about the conflicts of interest on a Wall Street trading floor. That ended when Buffett forced Gutfreund to resign and replaced them at the top of Salomon. From that moment it was assumed that with a man of integrity on the scene the business would pretty much reform itself. Ohio Representative Dennis Eckart spoke for their congressional colleagues when, in a hearing on the scandal, they said, "Mr. Buffett ... get in there and kick some butt." No one seemed to notice that they had been in there all along--that the managers responsible for the transgressions held their jobs only because Buffett put their good name behind them four years earlier.
Buffett's view now seems to be that the problems on Wall Street can be resolved by setting a moral example. The subtext of everything they have done is that the old Salomon was run by rotten apples. The firm very publicly cut long-standing ties to the oil trading tax fugitive Marc Rich. Buffett laid blame for the rule-breaking on the "macho culture" of the old Salomon Brothers and said that their new regime would tolerate incompetence but not impropriety. All of which played a bit too neatly to the current need to demonize financiers--and raised the question of why tax fugitives and testosterone freaks didn't much bother Buffett before the scandal.
Still, in the short run they are probably right. You can frighten people into behaving themselves for a while. But in the long run he's wrong. The financial revolution of the last decade introduced to Wall Street all sorts of temptations to abuse one's position. When socially unproductive behavior pays as well as it has, it isn't merely a matter of needing a few more good men. The dirty little secret on Wall Street is that the men responsible for its current reputation were not exceptionally bad. They were just ordinary people placed in unusual circumstances.
The cult of the investment genius promoted by Buffett is part of the problem, and has real social costs. The belief that there is such a thing as stock-picking expertise helps financial charlatans everywhere to flourish and leads investors to assume unnecessary market risks. It underpins the entire American investment advisory industry; without it an enormous amount of wasteful machinery--which Buffett themselves knows to be wasteful--would collapse. People listen to stockbrokers, subscribe to newsletters, attend floating investment conferences, glue themselves to Financial News Network until the wee hours, read the fine print of The Wall Street Journal , and generally expend a fantastic amount of time and energy picking stocks in the mistaken belief that they can beat the market systematically. If one is looking for the root cause of the hysterical swings in the public mood toward Wall Street, one need go no further: they simply reflect the irrational expectations of the investment public.
What is really needed on Wall Street is not more "investment geniuses" or good men like Buffett but a reduction in the conflicts of interest to which financial people are exposed. There are ways to lessen the temptations in modern finance, but not without cutting into profits. I offer two examples. First: the takeover boom created a boom in extremely valuable inside information. Wall Street firms, which create and house this information, are also permitted to speculate in the relevant corporate stocks. Why? If Buffett were really interested in reforming Salomon Brothers, they would start by closing the arbitrage department. Second: firms like Salomon both buy bonds for their own account and sell them to investors. This inherent conflict of interest did not matter very much in the placid pre-Reagan bond markets partly because there was very little trading in the markets but also because bond salespersons tended to service the same set of investors for years and thus had an interest in keeping the customer happy. Now it matters very much. The new American taste for debt over the last ten years created a truly fantastic increase in both the size and complexity of the bond market; at the same time market forces and the new mobility of Wall Street salespersons transformed the bond business from one of relationships to one of transactions. This creates both the incentive and the opportunity to shaft the customer. Indeed, the abuse of customer names made the Salomon Treasury bond scam possible. So why not address this problem with, say, a proposal to separate bond trading from bond sales?
Thus we arrive at what might be called Buffett's Dilemma: the choice between doing good and making money. The source of a lot of the behavior that Buffett says they will no longer tolerate--the Salomon bond trading departments--also happens to generate the profits. Everything Buffett has done has strengthened their hands. They fired the head of the stock department, who was about as far removed from the scandal as a person can be. They installed a new board of directors consisting of nine mostly bond men already at or near the top, i.e., the elect of the old Salomon. They linked year-end bonuses more closely to the amount of money generated for the firm. They fired a lot of people outside of the bond departments, a hugely disproportionate number of whom were women--not exactly the way to geld the macho bull.
Though all of this will likely increase returns for shareholders and Buffett, it fails to address the real systematic problems. But is that so surprising when the reform of a business has been left to a man with a huge financial stake in it? One can sympathize with the fix in which Buffett finds himself. One cannot blame them for doing whatever is necessary to protect their $700 million. But it is absurd to cast their activity as a moral crusade. You'd have thought that our recent experience would have cured us forever of the idea of financiers as heroes--that their new, alarming tendency to drift into compromising positions would inspire in the republic only the urge to keep them under constant surveillance. Guess what? It hasn't.
The Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer, also known as Alice, is considered one of the world's first true digital additive synthesizers. In this this video from 1977, Bell Labs engineer and inventor Hal Alles demonstrated the many possible voices their instrument could create—then gave it over to Todd Rundgren keyboardist and Bob Moog protege Roger Powell for a performance that was thought lost until Alles uploaded a copy to YouTube this week. According to Alles, the video was recorded as a tape backup for a live celebration of the 50th anniversary of talking motion pictures at the Hollywood Palladium. The performance went on live as intended, and so this video was never shown until now.
Prior to Alles' invention, the standard in synthesis was analog patching—literally plugging patch cables manually into rack mounted modules to create specific circuits required to create a sound. Alice used 72 computers controlled oscillators to instantly create different types of sounds instead. The advent of digital additive synthesis gave musicians the opportunity to store banks of preset patches and autonomous accompaniment, vastly expanding the acoustic possibilities of the synth and charting a straight line 40 years into the future to brostep.
Unfortunately, the synthesizer was too expensive to be commercially viable; it was dismantled four years later having only one full composition being written on it, though the technologies found in the Alice were used years later in the first consumer grade digital synthesizers.
Bonus: Check out this video of Laurie Spiegel playing the synth and demonstrating what the future used to sound like that same year.
John Bel Edwards medical marijuana
Gov. John Bel Edwards signs medical marijuana legislation into law on Thursday, May 19, 2015. At right is Katie Corkern, a medical marijuana advocate trying to obtain the drug for their son Connor, at their right, who suffers from daily seizures.
(Kevin Litten, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)
Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a landmark medical marijuana bill into law Thursday (May 19) that is expected to make medical marijuana available to patients for the first time in Louisiana history.
Edwards signed the bill during a ceremony on the fourth floor of the Capitol in front of key legislators who guided the bill to passage, First Lady Donna Edwards, and the families of children with conditions they believe can be treated with the drug. Among those present were a family from Edwards' hometown of Amite who have a son that suffers from daily seizures and would qualify for the drug.
"This is one of those bills I believe will have a positive impact on the people that need it the most," Edwards said. "The state of Louisiana should not interpose itself between doctors and patients when the doctors believe they have a patient who will benefit from medical marijuana."
Although Edwards' signature marked a significant moment for dispensing medical marijuana, it will be some time before doctors could actually recommend the drug to patients and a pharmacy could dispense it. By one estimate, it could take about 18 months, but if other states adopting medical marijuana legislation give any indication, it could take even longer.
Medical marijuana: What's next for Louisiana? The governor's signature will kick off a long sequence of events that could result in medical marijuana being dispensed in the next 18 months.
Even so, advocates have said the legislation passed this session gives them hope that one day, family members could benefit from the drug and they won't have to make plans to move to states like Colorado where medical marijuana is available. Edwards said the idea that families would move away from Louisiana to obtain a safe and legal product in other states was a driving force behind their support.
"It simply is unacceptable to tell parents of kids that if they want to make them available to the kids the medicine recommended by their doctors to achieve some better quality of life -- some reduction in pain -- that they should have to move," Edwards said.
The bill is all the more notable for Edwards' personal connection to the issue. One of the most visible advocates for the legislation this session was Katie Corkern, whose son, Connor, suffers from daily seizures and is disabled as a result. The Corkern family lives in Amite, Edwards' hometown, attends the same church as the Edwards, and Donna Edwards attended hearings on the bill to support the Corkerns.
"It was really that relationship with the Corkerns that brought Donna into this issue as well and I want to thank you for doing that," Edwards said during Thursday's signing ceremony. "I can tell you that in terms of lobbying the governor, nobody did that more effectively than Donna over the last couple of months."
Thursday was also an important day for state Sen. Fred Mills, R-Parks, who authored a bill last year that sought to provide the first framework for medical marijuana since it was first legalized in 1978. The bill last year was stymied by a last-minute change that required doctors to prescribe medical marijuana rather than "recommend" it. Doctors are disallowed from prescribing Schedule I drug like marijuana.
That language consumed much of the debate over medical marijuana this year, and the Louisiana Sheriff's Association urged lawmakers to reject Mills' proposal to change the wording from prescription to recommendation. But Mills consistently warned that such a change would be a "poison pill," and attempts in committee to change the language ultimately failed.
On Thursday, Mills remembered the families who visited them at their pharmacy in Acadiana to ask them to introduce legislation making the change. One of those families has moved to Colorado so that their daughter can be treated with medical marijuana, and their condition has improved, Mills said.
"My motivation is so many parents just calling me," Mills said. "For me and so many of my colleagues, it was like, 'we have to get this done to have this opportunity" for families seeking treatment.
State Rep. Helena Moreno, D-New Orleans, also recalled the first time they heard about the possibility of bringing a bill on medical marijuana. It was when Mills met them to ask them to carry the bill in the House of Representatives.
"This is so easy, why is this even controversial?" Moreno said they remember asking at the time.
But it was controversial, and only gained support last year after a sheriff whose daughter was dying of cancer urged the Sheriff's Association to remove their opposition. But the association renewed their objections this year, and Moreno and Mills worked fellow legislators hard to urge them to pass the bill.
When it hit the House floor last week, there was no certainty that it would pass. But after impassioned speeches by legislators, the House ultimately adopted the bill by a much larger margin than expected -- it passed 61-32.
Louisiana House passes sweeping medical marijuana legislation The bill seeks to expand access to medical marijuana in Louisiana and allow producers to move forward with plans to
"It was probably, for me, the biggest victory I've felt this session," Moreno said. "We have a lot of hurdles we're battling this year. On this one I knew when it passed the House it was making a true difference in people's lives."

A bird scarer is any of a number of devices designed to scare birds, usually employed by farmers to dissuade birds from eating recently planted arable crops.
They are also used on airfields to prevent birds accumulating near runways and causing a potential hazard to aircraft.
Visual scarers [ edit ]
Scarecrow [ edit ]
One of the oldest designs of bird scarer is the scarecrow in the shape of a human figure. The scarecrow idea has been built upon numerous times, and not all visual scare devices are shaped like humans. The "Flashman Birdscarer," Iridescent tape, "TerrorEyes" balloons, and other visual deterrents are all built on the idea of visually scaring birds. This method doesn't work so well with all species, considering that some species frequently perch on scarecrows.
Hawk kite [ edit ]
Norway. A stationary modelled owl used as a bird scarer at Lysaker
Many species of bird are also naturally afraid of predators such as birds of prey. "Hawk kites" are designed to fly from poles in the wind and hover above the field to be protected. They are shaped to match the silhouette of a bird of prey.
Helikites [ edit ]
The Helikite bird scarer is a lighter-than-air combination of a helium balloon and a kite. Helikites fly up to 200vft in the air with or without wind. Although they do not look like hawks, they fly and hover high in the sky behaving like birds of prey. Helikites successfully exploit bird pests' instinctive fear of hawks and can reliably protect large areas of farmland.
Lasers [ edit ]
The use of lasers can be an effective method of bird scaring, although there is some evidence to suggest some birds are "laser-resistant". As the effectiveness of the laser decreases with increasing light levels, it is likely to be most effective at dawn and dusk. Although some lasers prove to be effective during daylight hours.
The method relies on birds being startled by the strong contrast between the ambient light and the laser beam. During low light conditions this technique is very selective and can be attuned to frequencies and wavelengths that individual bird species don't like, but at night the light beam is visible over a large distance and can cause widespread (non-species specific) disturbance. Lasers use can be limited due safety concerns of the beam and some nations have laws which prohibit lasers above a certain power from being used. Lasers should be looked at as an additional scaring system to add to a wildlife management program.[1]
Manually operated laser torches and automated laser bird deterrent robots that move the laser automatically towards the birds are available on the market.
Dead birds [ edit ]
The use of model or actual dead birds is used to signal danger to others. Initially, birds often approach the corpse but usually leave when they see the unnatural position of the bird. This approach has been frequently used in attempts to deter gulls from airports. Pheasant feed sacks often have an image of an owl with large eyes so that when empty they can be strung up to scare predators.[citation needed]
Balloons [ edit ]
An example of a visual bird-scare balloon
Balloons are an inexpensive deterrent. However, this method relies on the movement of balloons, which is something that birds can become used to. The addition of eye illustrations on the balloons has been shown to increase this method's effectiveness as it combats the birds' ability to adapt. Commercially available "scare-eye" balloons have holographic eyes that follow birds wherever they go. The long-term effectiveness of this method can be increased by periodically moving the placement of the scare devices.
In the United Kingdom the use of balloons is subject to approval from the Civil Aviation Authority, especially around airfields.
Auditory scarers [ edit ]
Audible bird scarers use noise stimuli that makes birds uncomfortable. However, once birds realize these pose no real threats, they can easily become habituated to sounds that seemed initially frightening. If just being placed in situ and left, audible bird scarers can easily become ineffective bird control solutions, however when managed on an ongoing basis or used as part of a greater bird deterrent system, sound methods can deliver quality results.[2]
Sōzu (shishi odoshi) [ edit ]
One very old design is the Japanese sōzu, known metonymically as a shishi odoshi (although the term shishi odoshi properly refers to any method of scaring wild animals, including the Western scarecrow). Instead of using a visual method to distract pests, as the scarecrow does, it uses the sound of a heavy pipe repeatedly and rhythmically hitting a rock, using water as a timing device. The sōzu is also used in Japanese popular culture to denote inordinate amounts of wealth,[3] combined with a traditional sensibility: by design, the shishi odoshi uses copious amounts of water, meaning either a very high water bill, or that it is situated on high-value land with a stream or river running through it.
Propane cannon [ edit ]
Propane scare cannon (the plural of cannon is cannon) are one of the most common types of bird scarer available in Europe and America. It is a propane-powered gas gun which produces a periodic explosion. The audible bang can reach very loud volumes, in excess of 150 decibels, causing a flight reaction in birds. The similarity between a scare cannon and a 12 gauge shotgun is thought to cause a startle/fear reaction, although it is also effective against birds that have not been exposed to hunting pressure.[4]
Birds can become habituated to the sound of regular cannon detonations, especially if it does not vary in its magnitude, pitch, or time interval. However, regularly moving the cannon, utilizing on-demand firing options, including radio control, and combining cannon with other methods of deterrents can prevent habituation.[5]
Propane scare cannon are very loud and can be disruptive to people living nearby. One study found that restricting cannon use to only hours when birds are active and incorporating better bird damage plans drastically reduced the number of complaints from neighbours.[6]
Electronic repellers [ edit ]
Sonic bird repellers are not effective; the birds quickly acclimate to them. Usually consisting of a central unit and several speakers, the system emits digitally recorded distress calls of birds, and, in some cases, calls of predators of the target species. Some emitters randomize pitch, magnitude, time interval, sound sequence and other factors in an attempt to prevent birds from getting used to them. Many of the sounds produced are regarded as annoying to people.
Ultrasonic scarers [ edit ]
Ultrasonic devices are static sound-emitting bird deterrents, which, in theory, will annoy birds to keep them away from enclosed or semi-enclosed areas. Ultrasonic scarers are not harmful to birds, however, there is debate around birds' ability to hear these frequencies at loud enough decibels. Birds are believed to have similar hearing to humans, with studies showing birds do not hear on an ultrasonic level,[7] meaning that ultrasonic scarers often have little or no effect in deterring birds.[2]
Cartridge scarers [ edit ]
Cartridge scarers include a wide variety of noise-producing cartridges usually fired from rockets or rope bangers, or on aerodromes from modified pistols or shotguns, which produce a loud bang and emit flashes of light. They include shellcrackers, screamer shells and whistling projectiles, exploding projectiles, bird bangers and flares. Bird banger cartridges commonly use a low explosive known as flash powder.
Cartridges are projected from a shotgun with a range of 45–90 metres (148–295 ft), or pistols with a range of approximately 25 metres (82 ft), before exploding. Bird scaring cartridges can produce noise levels of up to 160 dB at varying ranges but in some countries both the cartridges and the gun require a firearms certificate.
Pyrotechnics have proved effective in dispersing birds at airports, landfill sites, agricultural crops and aquaculture facilities. At airports in the United Kingdom, shellcrackers fired from a modified pistol are the most common means of dispersing birds, as they allow the bird controller to have some directional control over birds in flight, so they can be steered away from runways.
However, as with all similar noises, there is a high risk of birds becoming used to any pyrotechnics or cartridge explosions.
Benign acoustic deterrence [ edit ]
In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary created a new method of deterring birds using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers.[8] The initial objectives of the technology were to displace problematic birds from airfields to reduce bird strike risks, minimize agricultural losses due to pest bird foraging, displace nuisance birds that cause extensive repair and chronic clean-up costs, and reduce bird mortality from flying into human-made structures. The sounds, referred to as a "Sonic Net," do not have to be loud and are a combination of wave forms—collectively called "colored noise"—forming non-constructive and constructive interference with how birds talk to each other.
Technically, the Sonic Net technology is not a bird scarer, but discourages birds from flying into or spending time in the target area. The impact on the birds is similar to talking in a crowded room, and since they cannot understand each other they go somewhere else. Early tests at an aviary and initial field trials at a landfill and airfield indicate that the technology is effective and that birds do not habituate to the sound. The provisional and full patents were filed in 2013 and 2014 respectively, with further research and commercialization of the technology being ongoing.

Dogs [ edit ]
The control of birds and other wildlife such as deer through harassment by trained border collies has been used at aerodromes, golf courses and agricultural land. The dogs represent an actual threat, and so elicit flight reactions. Habituation is unlikely as they can continually pursue and change their behaviour. Border collies are used as they are working dogs bred to herd animals and to avoid attack, and they respond well to whistle and verbal commands. A single border collie and its handler can keep an area of approximately 50 square kilometres (19.3 square miles, 4998.7 hectares, or 12,179.2 acres) free of larger birds and wildlife. However, although they are effective at deterring ground foraging birds such as waders and wildfowl, they are not so useful for species that spend most of their time flying or perching, such as raptors and swallows.
In 1999, Southwest Florida International Airport became the first commercial airport in the world to employ a border collie in an airfield wildlife control programme. After the use of the collie, numbers and species of birds on the airport declined and most birds that remained congregated in a drainage ditch away from the runway. The number of bird strikes dropped to zero compared to 13 for the same period the previous year. Several other airports and airbases have now started similar programmes.
At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, bird strike damage to aircraft caused by birds has been reduced from an average of US$600,000 per year for the proceeding two years to US$24,000 per year after the initiation of a bird control programme that included the use of border collies.
Predators [ edit ]
Using predators as a natural bird deterrent has become a recommended form of controlling bird infestations. Specially selected species are trained to deal with working in un-natural environments with distractions and dangers they would not usually encounter.[9]
The success of this method of bird control is based on the fact that many birds have a natural fear of falcons and hawks as predators, so their presence in the area encourages problem species to disperse. The natural reaction of most prey species is to form a flock and attempt to fly above the falcon. If this fails, they will attempt to fly for cover and leave the area.
Radio controlled aircraft [ edit ]
Radio-controlled model aircraft have been used to scare or 'haze' bird pests since the early 1980s, mainly over airfields, but have also been used over agricultural areas, fisheries and landfill sites. This method has been shown to be very effective and birds habituate more slowly to a treatment in which they are being actively hazed. At Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, balsa wood radio-controlled aircraft are one of the primary bird harassment methods used to keep the airfield clear of raptors and other large birds, and they have also proved effective at dispersing the base's redwing blackbird roost.
Fireworks [ edit ]
Fireworks can also be used as bird scarers, and some jurisdictions issue special licences for agricultural fireworks.[10] This practice has been criticised as a loophole for the sale of consumer fireworks.[11] Again, the loud bangs can also irritate people living on nearby properties.
Combination scarers [ edit ]
These combine multiple deterrents, such as using a pop up scarecrow combined with a gas gun, which in turn activates the distress call of a bird. These combination scarers are often managed by computers and synchronised across an area via the use of radio links. This synchronisation becomes more effective if there is some kind of detection system involved such as bird detecting radar.

In this file photo taken in 2008, Russian troops are seen near truck-mounted Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles as they rehearse for a parade in Moscow's Red Square.
WASHINGTON — Russia has secretly deployed a new cruise missile despite complaints from U.S. officials that it violates a landmark arms control treaty that helped seal the end of the Cold War, administration officials say.
The move presents a major challenge for President Donald Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and to pursue future arms accords.
The new Russian missile deployment also comes as the Trump administration is struggling to fill key policy positions at the State Department and the Pentagon — and to settle on a permanent replacement for Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned late Monday. Flynn stepped down after it was revealed that they had misled the vice president and other officials over conversations with Moscow's ambassador to Washington.

The ground-launched cruise missile at the center of U.S. concerns is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans U.S. and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land.

The Obama administration had sought to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase. Instead the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit.
Administration officials said the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is still located at Russia's missile test site at Kapustin Yar in the country's southeast.
The other was shifted in December from that test site to an operational base elsewhere, according to a senior official who did not provide further details and requested anonymity to discuss recent intelligence reports about the missile.
U.S. officials had called the cruise missile the SSC-X-8. But the “X” has been removed from current intelligence reports, indicating that U.S. intelligence officials consider the missile to be operational and no longer a system in development.

The Russia missile program has been a major concern for the Pentagon, which has developed options for how to respond, including deploying additional missile defenses in Europe or developing air-based or sea-based cruise missiles.
But it is politically significant, as well.
It is very unlikely that the Senate, which is already skeptical of Putin's intentions, would agree to ratify a new strategic arms control accord unless the alleged violation of the intermediate-range treaty is corrected. Trump has said the United States should “strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.” But at the same time, they have talked of reaching a new arms agreement with Moscow that would reduce arms “very substantially.”
The deployment of the system could also increase the military threat to NATO nations, which potentially would be one of the principal targets. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is scheduled to meet with allied defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday.
Before they left their post last year as the NATO commander and retired from the military, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove warned that deployment of the cruise missile would be a militarily significant development that “can't go unanswered.”

Coming up with an arms control solution would not be easy.
Each missile battalion is believed to have four mobile launchers and a larger supply of missiles. The launcher for the cruise missile, however, closely resembles the launcher used for the Iskander, a nuclear-tipped short-range system that is permitted under treaties.
“This will make location and verification really tough,” Breedlove said in an interview.

In biology class, students are currently taught Atheism, which is a religion of denial of a Creator. Why is it that educators have no problem with brainwashing students with such an ideology, which is highly incredulous, but find excuses to avoid teaching that which is more probable? Since when is teaching only one explanation of events desirable, when common sense dictates that another explanation is closer to the truth? Since when is a testimony full of "conditions just right", and "random luck", a basis for a restricted curriculum?
The same class that teaches that "there is no Creator" must also teach the opposing view, else the school system is taking sides, causing an imbalance in education. Are the public schools suppose to be recruiting grounds for Atheist converts? That is what our schools have been doing, and the Atheists want to keep it that way, using the pretext of "separation of church and state". What about separating Atheism and the state? How many students first come to class with a belief in a Deity, then after science class indoctrination, come away with changed beliefs? Ever heard of the "Lemon Test"? Why isn't it being applied?
The truth of history has nothing to do with religion. The book of Genesis explains the 4.6 billion year history of our Earth, and why the fossil and geologic records are found as they are. The worlds of Creationism and Theology have no idea what Genesis chapter one is conveying to humankind. Their foolish and false representations are mainly the reason humankind has not known the truth of our origins. The remaining reason is that too many people have been too stubborn to examine the truth, before jumping to their biased conclusions.
Of the ones that have seen the Observations of Moses, the "young earth" believers provide the most resistance, because they have been brainwashed by doctrines of denial (such as "no death before Adam"), which Genesis does not support. Most that see the presentation come away in awe, and wonder why they had not heard of it before. They question why only now is this (literal) view of Genesis being revealed, and why only one person has been promoting it. The 600 million year revelation of the extinctions and restorations of life forms clearly exposes the evolution theory to be an incoherent deception.

In 1996, my own teenaged child came home from school and said that they had learned in science class that Genesis was a fairy tale. They felt betrayed by what they had believed in, and was disappointed that their parents were so "naive". I told them that I would explain Genesis after dinner.
I showed them what I called the "Observations of Moses", which explained the verses in Genesis chapter one. Once they read the scriptures in chronological order, their eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning. Their belief in the Bible was renewed, and their faith in God restored. For 19 years, I've tried to help other students, but academia and the Clergy won't let me. Both Creationism and evolution are shown to be false.
"Truth in education", or "critical thinking" bills are worthless, and do not provide an alternate explanation of the fossil and geologic records of Earth. As it stands now, science classes in schools are poisoning the minds of our students, and have been for more than 50 years. Those students grow up with incorrect information, having ungodly values of (human) life, and become future leaders that make bad decisions for our country.
- Advertisement -
I teach a 6-hr class for science teachers, to help them answer questions that students would ask concerning the fossil record and geologic time as defined by Genesis. When you teach both sides of the coin, you have balance, and are not "taking sides". Public education is supposed to be neutral, and is not to promote any religion (theism or anti-theism), using public funds. Promoting Atheism in the public school system is evil, and is unconstitutional. Just look at the results such teachings have done to our society, where our children have a low value of human life. If there is no Creator, then there is no final Judgment: this is the message now being taught in public schools.
The 62 minute presentation first proves that current creationism is wrong, both "young Earth" and all forms of "old Earth" theories. Secondly, it then disproves the Big Bang theory, by revealing withheld facts of our solar system, which the world of science doesn't want the world to know. Thirdly, the presentation then explains the jumps in the fossil record, from 245 million years ago, to that of modern times. (In case you are wondering, the flood of Noah, which occurred in 2611 BC, has nothing to do with it). Geologic events are what the seven days of Moses are teaching, because Creation Week is not found in Genesis, as has been mistakenly taught by those in ignorance of the text.
I strongly encourage each and every state to have this presentation shown to your legislative body, so that they will see the truth of pre-historic history. They must first see what the truth is, so that they can then make an educated decision on how to implement this into the education system. This is not something that would be taught by the Clergy or schools of Theology, because they are mired in false doctrines.
Please advise,

The Rarest and Most Valuable Playstation (PS1) Games
Even though the original Playstation is one of the most common consoles of all time, there are many valuable PS1 treasures to be found. Its diverse library is filled with RPGs and unique gems that collectors long for. However, when we last surveyed the collectable PS1 market in early 2008, original Playstation titles seemed to have peaked in value. Three and a half years later, we have seen the most popular games come back closer to reality (many games have dropped around 30% of their value — 2008 values have been noted for each of the top entries). Having some of the games become availible as inexpensive downloads on PSN might have something to do with it, but this seems to be a more widespread trend that covers non-PSN games as well. However, there were three cult classics that did increase drastically over the same span of time and have broken into our list.
These drastic changes in value prompted us to do a complete update so that our popular Rare & Valuable series can remain accurate and useful. In stark contrast to the Cheapest Games series, this series will round up the rarest and most valuable games for a given console or handheld so you'll know what to look for whether you are buying or selling.
Below you will see two prices beside each title. The first is the average daily selling price, which is typically the going rate for the game by itself. The second price is the highest price in the past three months which is usually the price for the new/sealed game. The list is ordered by the balance of the two prices. Note that some of these games are not rare in the sense that there are not many available, but rare relative to demand, which makes the games expensive.

This treasure chest of sorts was given away as a tournament prize at the 1998 E3 convention in addition to a few people who worked on Elemental Gearbolt at Working Designs. When all was said and done, only 40 of these sets were produced and given out. The set includes a briefcase, gold GunCon, and gold memory card. The latest auction (this was updated in August 2009) got bids up to $1700, which was surprising since it was a new seller (that eventually backed out). Had it been a established seller, it may have gone for more.

The sixth unit of the NTPC at Unchahar in Sonia Gandhi's constituency of Rae Bareli was the first 500 MW unit to have been approved and commissioned by the Modi Government. And sources in NTPC now confirm that the corporation was under pressure to complete the project in record time so that the Prime Minister could take credit for it.
While there is no official confirmation, sources in NTPC confirmed that they had been told that the Prime Minister wanted to inaugurate the unit on November 9. The first date suggested by NTPC was November 7 but the PMO wanted it changed to November 9, presumably because of their preoccupations with elections in Gujarat.
This was why NTPC engineers compromised on safety standards that has already caused the death of 32 people following a blast in the ash pipe on November 1.
While NTPC officials remain tight-lipped and maintain that the inquiry being conducted by the senior most director of NTPC's Board will identify the reasons for the accident, there is growing clamour for an independent inquiry. Workers, unions and engineers, on condition of anonymity, told NH the following :
They were told that the trial run of the sixth unit, completed by BHEL in a record time of one and a half years, would stop on October 31 and would resume commercial production on November 9 after the formal inauguration.
There is no explanation why the unit was still running on November 1.
While the unit was ostensibly on a trial run, it is alleged to have started commercial production ahead of schedule.
It is suspected that the commercial production was started in order to claim certain subsidies from the Centre.
Contrary to the claim of NTPC, the unit was not operating on the automated mode, which would have called for the presence of only three or four workers in the area.
The fact that there were over 200 workers (300 according to other estimates), mostly on contract, working at the time of the accident, engineers say, prove that the operation was being done manually.
Had there been no haste, the priority of the NTPC would have been to fix the automated system first.
Holding the trial run along with commercial production , engineers say, is not generally done.
The workers are believed to have drawn the attention of the management towards the malfunction of the ash-pipe and formation of clinkers but the warning was ignored.
It is also alleged that the Boiler Inspector, reporting to the state government, had given a certificate without physically inspecting the boiler at Unchahar.
The allegation is that the Prime Minister's penchant for ‘records' and for claiming achievements never attained before put undue pressure on the NTPC to complete the project and make the unit functional ahead of time.
The allegations have gained strength following the unusual manner in which the PMO bypassed the normal procedure of appointment in the case of the NTPC Chairman-cum-Managing Director Gurdeep Singh last year.
The PMO bypassed the Public Enterprises Selection Board ( PSEB), which normally selects PSU heads, and formed a special search committee to appoint a new CMD of NTPC.
The committee chose Gurdeep Singh , who was Managing Director of Gujarat State Electricity Corporation.
BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing police shut down part of a major road on Monday as they dealt with a rare protest in the Chinese capital, with demonstrators gathering to complain the government had unfairly accused a company they say helps the poor of pyramid selling.
While there are thousands of protests every year in China, over everything from pollution to corruption, large protests are rare in heavily guarded and affluent Beijing, with the ruling Communist Party valuing stability above all else.
State news agency Xinhua said late last week that police had detained executives from a company called Shanxinhui, accusing them of operating a pyramid scheme and duping people out of money in the name of raising funds to help the poor.
On Monday, investors in the company came to Beijing from all parts of China to complain that Shanxinhui had been dealt a huge injustice and that it had genuinely helped a lot of poor people.
Police blocked off a major intersection in a working class southern Beijing neighborhood, lining up police cars and vans along the road and forming a cordon to prevent people accessing the grounds of a small convention center where some of the protesters had gathered.
Dozens of other investors in the company stood on the roads outside the center, as police kept a wary watch but did not attempt to move them on.
It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the grounds of the center or why they had chosen it as the site for their demonstration.
“They have accused the company of pyramid selling but they did nothing wrong. They only wanted to help poor people. It's an injustice,” said a man who gave their family name as Zhong and said they were from the far western region of Xinjiang.
Another man, who declined to provide their name but said they were from Hebei province, which partially surrounds Beijing, said all the funds in the company had been frozen.
“We want China's leaders to come and hear our complaints,” they said.
Beijing police declined immediate comment when reached by telephone.
One man showed a Reuters reporter video they said was taken inside the convention center grounds of police manhandling a protester. It was not possible to independently verify the footage.
The government has repeatedly vowed to crack down on financial crime and fraud.
Last year, Chinese authorities shut down peer-to-peer (P2P) lender Ezubao over an online scam state media said took in some 50 billion yuan ($7.41 billion) from about 900,000 investors.
($1 = 6.7483 yuan)
LIVERMORE — In a stunning development, the City Council on Monday axed a developer it had been working with for a year to develop a new downtown.
The action comes after a public outcry and heated debate over the downtown plan, a controversy that dominated the November City Council election and ushered in two new council members.
The city last year awarded Lennar Multifamily Communities, along with Presidio Companies, an exclusive negotiating agreement to develop a plan for an 8.2-acre downtown site. Their contracts, which were set to expire Monday, were due for a 9-month renewal.
The council voted to extend Presidio's contract for four months. The company has plans to develop a 135-room Marriot hotel. Rikesh Patel, representing Presidio, stated that they were “1,000 times committed to building an upscale hotel somewhere on the site.”
But it was a different story for Lennar. Their original plans called for 260 housing units, 200 of them apartments and the rest condos, a 550-space parking garage, a 12,000-square-foot market hall and a 4,000 square-foot conference space.
In August, the council asked for more study on parking and traffic in the area before deciding how to move forward. Those studies are expected in the next several months.

New councilmen Bob Coomber and Bob Carling had both campaigned on the promise that they wanted to reduce housing in the downtown plan, or see no housing at all.
In Carling's campaign platform, they echoed what many members of the public said Monday night: Why didn't the city get the community's ideas first on the downtown before choosing a developer?
“The choice of Lennar has been a mistake,” said resident Doug Mann. “Lennar didn't prove to be a positive force; they didn't understand our culture.”
Others like Jeff Kaskey, part of the ad hoc Livermore Community Group that made its own plans for the downtown, said the election was a clear message to restart the process. Their group calls for cutting the residential units to less than half, lowering building heights, adding a pedestrian walkway and increasing parking underground.
Mayor John Marchand said, however, that Lennar was chosen not for its plan for the downtown, but “because they would have the managerial and financial capacity to build whatever the community wanted.”
They said the city has not chosen a plan yet, and has not had a chance to negotiate with them.
“The plan is to find out what the community wants,” Marchand said.
The city wants to go back to the community in workshops in the coming months to get a feel for what they want to see in the downtown. The project Lennar had presented “was in response to the overachieving large global ideas the city had,” Marchand said.
Councilman Bob Woerner said it was unfortunate that the community became polarized on this issue. They said they aren't sure if the community could still get behind using Lennar at this point and anticipated there would be a battle at the workshops if the city extended Lennar's contract.
Lennar has had a controversial past with nearby Concord. Last year, Concord chose Lennar Urban to develop 4,400 homes on a former military base, even after allegations of influence peddling and backroom deal-making rocked City Hall and undermined public confidence in the integrity of the developer selection process.
An investigation found that Lennar had engaged in lobbying when it donated $16,800 to Mayor Tim Grayson's state Assembly campaign.
The prospects for Geneva II are not good. As has been seen at the Friends of Syria meeting in London, no opposition group can be seen to negotiate directly with the government presided over by President Assad and maintain their credibility with the wider opposition movement. Furthermore, the Syrian National Coalition has already lost the support of many, if not most, of the armed and unarmed opposition groups in the country, and has itself been weakened by internal divisions inspired in large part by the lack of substantive foreign support. Thus, with no one to talk to, it is doubtful whether anyone on the government side will find convincing interlocutors to engage with, and given doubts on the US side too, it is unlikely that Geneva II will actually take place.
In the face of the limited strategic planning of the US and its allies, Russian policy under President Vladimir Putin has appeared light-footed and coherent, over the chemical weapons issue above all. However, over the longer-term, Russian military and diplomatic support for the Assad presidency and government does not place Russia in a good position to play a mediating role, especially in terms of bringing the wider Syrian population, over 7 million of whom are now displaced by the conflict, into a settlement process. The diversity of internal and external opposition groups, both armed and unarmed, will also not accept that the external partner of one side in the conflict is sufficiently neutral to adjudicate over a negotiated settlement, even if they recognize that Russia could play a significant role in moderating the position of the Syrian government should it choose to do so.
Since the negotiating process is unlikely to go ahead as planned, for the reasons outlined above, there is an issue of sequencing here in terms of referring President Assad to the International Criminal Court (ICC). There is a significant weight of evidence concerning the use of conventional weaponry against civilian targets that under the appropriate international reviews could make the case for starting referral proceedings against President Assad, even before the time-limit for the chemical weapons process is complete. The UN also holds considerable data on the use of chemical weapons, as outlined in their recent report on the August 2013 attack, and this could be combined with other reported usages of chemical weapons to establish the basis for a parallel referral to the ICC. Until the diplomatic option of seeking a negotiated settlement has been exhausted, and the process of surrendering chemical weapons has been completed, neither the US nor Russia has indicated their willingness to proceed along either of these routes.
In general, the short-term prospects for a solution are not good, because the international community remains divided over its analysis of the core source of the conflict, as well as its projected solutions. Addressing the chemical weapons issue is only part of the challenge, and until and unless the collective security of the Syrian people is put at the centre of collective diplomatic energies, no piecemeal solution will address or resolve the underlying conditions for the restoration of peace. Even if highly significant, the chemical disarmament process has assumed a disproportionate role in international diplomacy, at the short-to-medium term cost of resolving the core conflict.
The conflict now poses a challenge to the stability of Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey, as well as to Israel, all of which are experiencing the impacts of the conflict to differing degrees. Israel has so far held the perceived threat of Hezbollah in check, but the calculations of most actors are based on short-term security considerations, rather than on longer-term planning for overall regional stability which is in the interests of all of them.
Both the US and Russia need to recognize that they control only part of the outcome of the Syrian conflict, and that for the longer-term regional interests of both, they need to find more common ground to resolve the underlying issues that are reshaping the whole Levant region. If both the US and Russia were to recognize that their positions no longer reflect the evolving realities, both within and beyond Syria, that they are not sustainable over the longer-term, and that they are not contributing to the overall stability of the region, then there might be some prospect for reconciliation and closer bilateral cooperation over more than the chemical weapons issue. To do this, however, requires moving away from zero-sum calculations to a greater basis for compromise, above all in extending the authority of the UN to construct a peace-building process based on a wider range of Syrian and regional interests than is currently the case.

Smoking weed may actually improve memory function and stimulate the growth of new brain cells among older adults, according to researchers at Ohio State University.
But don't switch on the black light and turn up your favorite Doobie Brothers album just yet. It's important to note that none of the researchers suggest the elderly take up smoking marijuana. Rather, their research suggests that low levels of the drug's active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) works to stimulate the production of new brain cells and reduce inflammation in the brain. While the cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, researchers say chronic inflammation could be a contributing factor to memory loss, and that substances that reduce inflammation could aid in preventing the disease.
Researchers hope to use their findings to identify which chemicals in THC act on which brain receptors, so they can isolate those chemicals and develop a non-hallucinogenic drug based on marijuana. OSU researchers presented their report to at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.
['Games as art' is a tired conversation, says writer and designer Ian Bogost, who instead proposes 'proceduralism' as the new phrase to describe innovative indie titles from Braid to Passage and beyond.]
Are games art?
Last year, what Jim Preston wrote drove the nail into the coffin of this absurd and useless question:
To think that there is a single, generally agreed upon concept of art is to get it precisely backwards. Americans' attitude towards art is profoundly divided, disjointed and confused; and my message to gamers is to simply ignore the "is-it-art?" debate altogether.
Preston sheds light on a fatal problem with the "games as art" conversation. Forget games -- "art" doesn't have any sort of stable meaning in contemporary culture anyway.
Movements in the History of Art
There are many reasons for such a development, perhaps the most important being that the avant garde changed art for good.
In the turbulent times of the first two decades of last century, localized movements in Europe gained attention by rejecting traditionalism. Futurism founder Filippo Marinetti spurned all things old and embraced youth, machine, violence.
Then when violence became reality in World War I, a handful of artists in Zurich concluded that if progress since the Enlightenment had lead to the destruction of the Great War, then such progress had to be rejected. They called their work Dada.
The Futurists called for a total reinvention of cultural and political life. Dada scorned artistic and social conventions in favor of absurdism and recontextualization. Tristan Tzara performed live poetry by choosing words randomly out of a hat. Marcel Duchamp made a urinal into art by putting it in a gallery rather than a restroom.
Movements like these, which became known collectively as the avant garde, disrupted traditional notions of art's role and context. As the 20th century wore on, it became much harder to distinguish art by its form or function alone; context became the predominant factor, its arbitrariness exposed forever by Duchamp's urinal.
But even before the avant garde, the history of art lays strewn with the babes and corpses of movements that hoped to re-imagine or reinvent their predecessors, even if they did so less rapidly.
The Gothic style of of the 12th to 14th centuries preferred elongation, ornament, and angles in sculpture, architecture, and painting. The Renaissance perfected perspective. Realism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries focused on portrayals of everyday life, itself spawning numerous movements of their own right such as Post-impressionism and the Pre-Raphaelites.
From the long perspective of history, the very idea that "art" means something monolithic and certain is simply absurd.
From Art Games to Art Movements in Games
What lessons can video games learn, even from a rudimentary understanding of art history? For one, there are no unified field theories of art. The pursuit of a pure, single account of art in any medium is a lost cause. Instead, the history of art has been one of disruption and reinvention, one of conflicting trends and ideas within each historical period, and since the 19th century even more so.
How then can we then understand the role of games in art? Unseating Roger Ebert's hubristic clutch on film as the apotheosis of contemporary art is not the way forward. Neither is the impassioned folly of appeals to video games' legal status as speech. Nor still is the repurposing of familiar game imagery as craft or as cake. Nor indeed granting game stills and concept art gallery status by hanging them in exhibitions at trade conventions.
Despite its lack of specificity, the idea of "games as art" or "artgames," to use Jason Rohrer's term, does offer some insight on its own. It suggests that games can be construed as art natively, within the communities of practice and even the industry of games. Its practitioners are game developers first, working artists second, if at all.
By contrast, "game art" describes a work prepared for exhibition in galleries or museums, still the "traditional" venues for art despite Duchamp. Cory Arcangel's Super Mario Clouds, a hack of the NES cart that removes everything but the moving clouds, offers a good example of "game art." These are games that get exhibited, not games that get played.
Beyond such a distinction, however, and despite its rhetorical power, "artgame" is an insufficient name to be useful for players, creators, or critics. It is a stand-in for a yet unnamed set of movements or styles, akin to Realism or Futurism.
We must look deeper, toward the particularities of specific aesthetic trends in game development itself, with the hopes of identifying their positions in relation to games and art alike.
In other words, what we lack are discussions of the developing conventions, styles, movements through which games are participating in broader concept of art, both locally and historically.
The federal government has all but surrendered to the powerful, rich donors whose anonymous contributions threaten to undermine the 2016 elections. The commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, John Koskinen, signaled as much on Thursday when they told a House committee that there would be no change in the tax code in 2016 to end its growing abuse by political operatives using nonprofit “social welfare” institutions to disguise the identities of affluent campaign contributors.
“I don't want people thinking we are trying to get these regs done so we can influence the election,” Mr. Koskinen declared later to reporters. The statement was remarkable for blessing further procrastination at the I.R.S., whose clear obligation is to enforce existing law in a way that would end the current flood of “dark money” financing politics. The commissioner said the earliest that tighter rules could take effect would be 2017. The I.R.S. has been increasingly timorous on this issue ever since House Republicans opened partisan hearings into complaints that I.R.S. officials have been biased against conservative political groups that claim tax exemptions as nonprofit social welfare groups.

The fact is, the I.R.S. should be dedicated to enforcing the law against phony social welfare claims by all political schemers, from the right or the left. This abuse of the tax law mushroomed after the Supreme Court's reckless Citizens United decision in 2010 that ended limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions. Since 2006, when only $5.2 million was spent by exempt organizations that do not disclose donors, spending increased 60-fold, to more than $300 million in the 2012 presidential cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. An even bigger infusion is expected in 2016 from big-money donors shielded by the social welfare fiction.
Earlier this year, Mr. Koskinen declared that nonprofit social welfare groups could spend up to 49 percent of revenues on political activity and still keep their tax exemption. This ill-advised statement did not encourage optimism about a tightening of the code. It also contradicts existing law, upheld in court decisions, that these groups must be “operated exclusively to promote social welfare.”
Travis in Minnesota says this note was dropped in their mailbox by some anonymous neighbor who had apparently been fixated on watching them build their backyard deck.
“I was surprised that anyone noticed, let alone went through the trouble to write a full-page complaint,” Travis says. “However, he's right in that, as one person working on the occasional free night and on weekends, it did take me a full year to complete the project.”
Adds Travis: “I think the strangest part of the note is the challenge to my masculinity. I'm glad that someone finally told me that it's more manly to pay for someone to do a job for you than to do it yourself. Here I was, all this time, thinking it was just the opposite. Boy, is my face red!”
P.S. If you're curious, here's a photo of the deck. I think it's quite nice.

George Mason University has just released an official statement about the Thomson Reuters lawsuit. The press release is copied below.
The Thomson Reuters Corporation has sued the Commonwealth of Virginia over Zotero, a project based at George Mason University's Center for History and New Media (CHNM). A free and open-source software initiative, Zotero aims to create the world's best research tool and has already been adopted by hundreds of thousands of users at countless colleges and research universities. CHNM announces that it has re-released the full functionality of Zotero 1.5 Sync Preview to its users and the open source community.
As part of its formal response to this legal action, Mason will also not renew its site license for EndNote. As academics themselves, the creators of the Zotero project strive to serve the scholarly community and to respond to its needs in an age of digital research. In line with that simple goal, they maintain that anything created by users of Zotero belongs to those users, and that it should be as easy as possible for Zotero users to move to and from the software as they wish, without friction. CHNM concurs with the journal Nature, which recently editorialized about this matter: “The virtues of interoperability and easy data-sharing among researchers are worth restating.”
CHNM remains committed to the openness it has promoted since its founding at Mason in 1994 and to the freedoms of users of its websites and software. Its ambitious development cycle and plans for Zotero's future remain unchanged. CHNM will continue to develop and implement new research technologies in the pursuit of better ways to create and share scholarship. CHNM greatly appreciates the many supportive comments it has received from scholars, librarians, and administrators around the globe.
How Objects Can Carry Family History
If we used movies as a reference, we'd assume that every father in the world has valuable, generations-old family heirlooms to pass down to their son. You shouldn't feel bad, however, if your family doesn't have any time-worn treasures that come down through the ages. In these increasingly disposable times, fewer and fewer items are worth saving and giving to your children. But, if the idea of having a special object that passes through the hands of all the men in your family is one that you like, why not start the tradition yourself?
Kick Off An Heirloom
If you're the one that starts the heirloom-passing, you won't necessarily feel the sense of history when you look at the object, but you can look into the future and imagine your great-great-great-grandson admiring it in the year 2175, which is pretty cool.
When you choose an object that will be passed down from one generation to the next, there are a few important considerations:
Durability – Pick something that is physically durable so that it won't deteriorate through use or time. While it's normal for these objects to be stored and used with care, kid gloves should not be required.
Usability – Whatever you pass down, you want to make sure that each man who receives it will actually be able to use it or enjoy displaying it. Regardless of the monetary or sentimental value, it won't be very appreciated it if it can't be regularly enjoyed.
Trends – Don't choose anything that is valuable now only because of trends or fads – this will date the heirloom and make it less valuable to future generations. Get something that is classic and timeless so that even a few hundred years from now, it will be a treasured gift.
Size – While it's a nice idea to pass down an imposing mahogany desk, it may not be very practical. You never know how your descendants will live, and their tiny, futuristic apartments may not be able to accommodate a huge piece of furniture. Go with something that will be easy for anyone to accept, keep and care for.
What to Pass
Sports Memorabilia
If you are a sports fan, this may be the heirloom for you. Obviously you'd want to choose memorabilia from a player or team that you're passionate about – even better if it's a player or team that your father or grandfather loved as well. One piece of advice around current players: Don't choose a young player who's just starting their career, even if they are a superstar. You never know what may happen in their career or personal life that may tarnish their reputation.
Shaving Gear
Think back to when you were a kid – how many times did you stand in the mirror, fascinated by the sight of your dad shaving? And when they finally taught you, it was a kind of symbolic entry into manhood. That's why passing down shaving accoutrement is so very appropriate.
If you don't have any classic antique gear, it's a good idea to invest in a high-quality modern set that includes a brush, a mug and a beautiful stand that he'll want to display on the sink. Just imagine that set in the bathroom of all future generations of men in your family – they'll be reminded of your legacy every morning as they partake in that eternally masculine routine.
Tools
What's manlier than a solid set of tools? If you're the handy, DIY type, tools could be the best bet. Just be sure to buy a top-of-the-line set that can put up with lots of wear and tear. The idea is for your descendants to actually use the tools and think of you and the family line each time they do. Also, think about investing in an attractive tool box so that all the pieces will stay together with each pass-down.
Watches
A classic timepiece is one of the most common heirloom choices for a reason – watches are both beautiful and functional. Even the most high-end, centuries-old watch can be worn day after day, for many years, by many generations without any loss of function. Handcrafted, well-made watches are built for exactly this purpose.
If you decide to go with this type of heirloom, you ought to make a solid financial investment in a piece that's work keeping for centuries – no one's passing down a Swatch. Brands like Omega, Breitling and Tag Heurr are perfect for men who are looking to get into the heirloom game with a watch that will only grow in value over the years. You should find a trusted and reputable jeweler in your area as a fine watch requires occasional attention to keep it maintain its form and function for the long haul.
An Instrument
Whether you're a professional or amateur musician, you're instrumented probably has great personal value to you. Even if you just like to casually strum the guitar once in a while for your own pleasure, you may want to consider investing in a nice one that you can give to your son one day. This comes with the added bonus of being able to pass down your knowledge about playing it. Owning and playing the same instrument could become a wonderful tradition for the men in your family.
Make it Special
It may be many years until you actually pass down the object you've chosen to be the new family heirloom, but begin thinking about that moment now. One of the most important parts of a family heirloom is that it reminds the recipient of the giver. With that in mind, be sure to frequently use, show and talk about the object with whomever will receive it. This way, when you do finally pass it down, it will have real meaning.
Also, remember to record the story of how you came to own the object and stories of how you've used it over the years. The object itself is not nearly as important as the words that will be repeated by each man as they give it to their son. It may even be a good idea to write down some things about it on durable, archival paper that can accompany the item each time it's given to a new person.
When the time comes to do the actual passing, make sure that you make it feel almost like a special ceremony. Be sure to explain to the recipient who you'd like them to give it to – if they don't have sons, would you like it to be given to a daughter? If they don't have any children, should it be given to another relative? Think these things through. Additionally, you should probably add a provision to your will that guarantees that it ends up in the right hands if you don't get the chance to put it there yourself.
Don't let the fact that your father didn't pass an heirloom down stop you from creating the tradition for your son, their son and all the sons to come. Think of it this way: when the story is told, it will always start with your name and the story of your life.

New Intercept Leak Shows That Intelligence Agencies Are Ready And Willing To Perform Economic Espionage If US Tech Edge 'Slips'
from the altitude-of-high-road-rapidly-approaching-sea-level dept
The NSA has repeatedly assured the public that it definitely does not perform economic espionage. It may collect metadata and communications from around the world (including that of US citizens) and intercept shipments of computer hardware in order to install its own spying devices, but it doesn't perform espionage in service of American corporate interests.
This was the small thing that set our intelligence agencies slightly above similar agencies in China. Last August, the ODNI (Jame Clapper's office) sent this categorical denial to the Washington Post in response to leaked documents. (Emphasis in original.)
“The department does ***not*** engage in economic espionage in any domain, including cyber.”
The document, the 2009 Quadrennial Intelligence Community Review—provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden—is a fascinating window into the mindset of America's spies as they identify future threats to the U.S. and lay out the actions the U.S. intelligence community should take in response…
The report recommends “a multi-pronged, systematic effort to gather open source and proprietary information through overt means, clandestine penetration (through physical and cyber means), and counterintelligence” (emphasis added). In particular, the DNI's report envisions “cyber operations” to penetrate “covert centers of innovation” such as R&D facilities.
...assesse[d] whether and how its findings would be useful to U.S. industry.
And then the truth came rolling in, thanks to Snowden's leaks A slight change in wording and the denial still holds. Or does it? The Intercept's latest set of documents -- issued by Clapper's office -- show the US government definitely hasto do the one thing Clapper says we don't: spy for the benefit of US corporations.According to this document, one of the threats that the government might call in the services of its intelligence agencies to handle is a slip in America's "technological and innovative edge." The appropriate response in the free world -- especially a country that always tells its citizens they can achieve anything through hard work and determination -- would be to allow the struggling corporations to solve their own problems. If it really needed to get involved, the government could take a close look to see if it was creating bottlenecks with iffy IP laws or its random blend of regulation and deregulation. Anything but take the easiest way out But if the American way of life (such as it were) is threatened in the future, Clapper's office recommends letting the spies fix it.Cheat to win. And saying everyone else is doing it (even if they are) doesn't do anything more than drag the US down to their level. One scenario included in the document posits Russia and India working together to outpace the US. At this point, the NSA and others would step in to perform cyber-espionage, hacking into the foreign research facilities and making off with proprietary data. The data collected would be (this is a direct quote)As is noted by Glenn Greenwald, there's no indication the US has actually done this in the past. But it is a long-term document, meant to envision the intelligence agencies' roles over the next 20 years. And one of those roles being discussed is stealing secrets to put US companies ahead.Some may defend this as being a purely speculative document that details numerous what-if scenarios that will never be played out. But that defense is inadequate. The speculations aren't tied to scenarios in which the US government shifts towards a more China-like role and gives up its ambitions of being the leader of the free world. In these scenarios, the United States is presumed to be doing business as a democratic republic -- one that has often sought to rise above this sort of behavior.The NSA has the capabilities to do many things, some of which remain unexplored (or at least unrevealed). This is one of them. The agency's defenders have argued that it doesn't abuse these powers, but its internal documents (along with statements from former NSA head Keith Alexander) that it will always " play to edges " of its confinements. This document shows it's willing to step into this role if asked to. Or if it thinks it was asked to. Or it may perform this role proactively and ask forgiveness later.The fact is that this scenario never should have been presented. It's not that much different than using the threat of domestic terrorism as a what-if projection for unencumbered harvesting of US citizens' communications. There are lines you don't cross -- not in this nation -- even hypothetically. Corporate espionage is one of them. Especially when the US Attorney General is handing out indictments for corporate espionage by the Chinese.Nothing may ever come of this. But it's important for the world to know that offer is on the table.

Sporting Kansas City's Jon Kempin wasn't even supposed to be in the team's game Thursday night, much less in the first penalty kick shootout of their MLS career.
But after coming on for and injured Tim Melia in the second half of SKC's Knockout Round match against the Portland Timbers in the Audi 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs, the 21-year-old Homegrown 'keeper made three saves in the penalty stage. They would only be let down by misses from their own side, and eventually see their own last-ditch try swatted away at the end of an 11-round shootout marathon.
Despite that disappointing ending to their club's season–and Sporting's first shootout loss in four tries under manager Peter Vermes–Kempin drew nothing but praise from their team for their performance in a tough, chippy situation in front of a deafening crowd at Providence Park.
“He did great,” Vermes said of Kempin in a post-match news conference. “He did fantastic in the penalty-kick shootout. I thought they were calm and cool when they came in, in the last final minutes of the game. I also think that they gave us three chances to win it and we didn't take advantage of that. They did a great job and they have nothing to be disappointed about or anything other than we lost.”
Sporting were down 1-0 when Melia came out in the 84th minute, about 15 minutes after a collision with the Timbers' Rodney Wallace, a foul that resulted in a yellow card for Portland's opening goal-scorer of the game.
“I've been there before, so I wasn't too nervous,” said Kempin, of coming in late in a game, in time for penalty kicks. In fact their first career MLS save came on a penalty kick in Vancouver last season, in a match where they also came off the bench as an injury substitute.
“I have confidence in the team," they continued. "I knew we were a goal down, but I knew we'd get a goal or two and we did. Credit to them. Our guys played awesome and it's just unlucky there at the end.”
“Unlucky” might not even begin to cover what happened to Kempin in the penalty kick stage, after the two sides traded goals in extra time and finished in a 2-2 deadlock after 120 minutes.
Only once–in the opening round, when they turned away Diego Valeri and Benny Feilhaber converted their attempt–did Sport, who held second-shot advantage, make their try after a miss or a save.
The Timbers' Jack Jewsbury shot high in the fourth round against their old club, but Sporting captain Matt Besler did the same thing with their answering chip. And after both sides made their fifth-round tries, the shootout went to sudden death, and things got even more wrenching for Sporting.
Kevin Ellis, whose 87th-minute goal tied the match at 1-1 and sent it to extra time, could have won it in the sixth round after Kempin stopped Portland's Jorge Villafaña. They put their low blast off the left post–but as it turned out, the woodwork was just getting warmed up.
In the ninth round, Kempin knocked away Alvas Powell's shot, setting up rookie right back Saad Abdul-Salaam for a shot at ending it. Instead, their attempt found the right post, rolled down the line, hit the left post and deflected harmlessly away.
Two rounds later, when all the field players had had their turns, Portland goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey buried their shot and then denied Kempin.
Sporting's season was over.
“We've been on the other end of it quite a few times, and we understand what that's like,” said Vermes. Their club, after all, has won all three of their trophies during their tenure–the 2013 MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup titles in 2012 and 2015–on penalties. “There's no doubt that we had chances. If you look at it, if everybody had made it, we had three chances to win it. Unfortunately, we didn't. But that happens sometimes.”

For the 12th time this season, there's been a change at head coach at an FBS program.
Following a 59-21 loss to Arkansas State, Louisiana-Monroe athletic director Brian Wickstrom confirmed that Todd Berry has been fired as the Warhawks' head coach. Defensive line coach John Mumford will take over as the interim head coach for the final two games of the 2015 season.
The loss to ASU was ULM's eighth straight loss on the year.
“I want to thank Todd for their services,” Wickstrom said in a statement. “He and their staff raised the level of the program, brought national attention to the university in 2012 and throughout their time directing the program.”
Berry, the offensive coordinator at ULM a decade ago, was in their sixth season at the school. They will finish their tenure at 28-43 overall and 20-25 in Sun Belt Conference play.
The high-water mark for Berry came in that 2012 season Wickstrom, when the Warhawks went 8-5 and played in their first and only bowl game under the deposed coach.

FighterSweep Fans, it really is that bad. We've recently heard horror stories about units getting ready to deploy “robbing Peter to pay Paul” as it applies to making sure there are parts available to generate aircraft for combat sorties. What that means is jets going overseas are being held together by parts from squadrons staying behind. Now we have Marines pilfering parts, literally, from a museum.
House defense Republicans really do seem worried that US weapons are so old, new gear so rare and training dollars so short that US troops may soon begin paying the ultimate price for the military's creaky state after 15 years of war. As with every problem, you need an easily understandable and shocking example of just how bad things are to jumpstart jaundiced and overworked lawmakers.
So, when House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry went to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and heard this story, it became part of yesterday's hearing with Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joe Dunford.
The only mention at the hearing was about aircraft parts being scrounged from a museum. I asked around today and it turns out an F/A-18 based at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort that flew in the raid against Libya in 1986 needed a part. The part is no longer made and there were none on hand. Crew and pilots checked the F-18s on display at Beaufort to see if they might find a part. No luck.

“There's an intellectual hierarchy in the world, where European cultures and intellectual traditions are seen as superior. So even if you have a very sophisticated philosophy or art form and it is somehow associated with blackness, it is automatically seen as inferior. And that's the very nature of white supremacy; it is possibly one of its defining features.”
Adam Elliott-Cooper, Absent from the Academy
Research suggests that within the national academies of higher education (universities) there are only 85 black professors out of 18,550 (0.4%) throughout the United Kingdom. This figure does not reflect the demographic make-up of black people in this country, and as such raises a number of important questions.
If universities and higher education institutions exist as key sites for the manufacture of culture and knowledge, what impact does this lack of representation within Higher Education have on our nations and institutions? When we discuss issues such as institutional racism within the Metropolitan Police, or the excessively high rates of black underemployment, or growing ethnicity related health inequalities, is it possible to make sense of these phenomena without also looking at cultural reproduction? How are such phenomena created and shaped by experiences and discourses within the academies?
With these questions in mind I wanted to use film to find out more about what lies behind the dearth of black professors within Higher Education. Absent From The Academy attempts to trace and uncover the impact that the lack of black professors has on the UK. I won't go into too much detail here about my findings, as you can watch the film below. There were however a number of tangents that I was unable to include in the film, a few of which I think would be relevant for us to discuss now.

In footage that didn't make the final cut of the documentary Dr. Robbie Shilliam speaks about the importance of having black people present around the proverbial ‘table'. While these individuals need not necessarily be ‘radicals', Shilliam feels that just their sheer presence in the room will foster another kind of conversation,
If there's a meeting, whether it's a governmental meeting, or university department meeting, and that meeting is about black people, and there are no black people around the table, those present will be saying certain things and assuming certain things, and allowing themselves, despite themselves, to have certain assumptions that they wouldn't have if there was just one black person around that table. The presence of difference in these institutions around a table makes a difference; because it means people have to check themselves. The more senior you get, the more tables you sit round, the more power and influence you have. If there are no black academics moving up, then you end up with a lot of precarious black labour in universities, with no power and no ability to set an agenda or to even check an agenda that is being set.”
In both the UK and the United States massive racial underrepresentation and flagrant misrepresentation also blights much of the media industry. The discourses and practices that feed into this industry, incubated in universities around the world, are marked by an implicit whiteness. I was reminded of this in the Award Season Roundtable series, featuring director Steve McQueen that took place in 2012. In the presence of some of Hollywood's most well renowned directors, all of whom were white (and male), except McQueen – the interviewer asks McQueen specifically, why there are so few female and black directors. At this point it is only possible to imagine the conversation that would have ensued without the presence of McQueen.
Alas, instead of answering the question posed, McQueen sidelined it in favour of another, asking instead how it is possible for directors to make films set in places such as New York and LA and not cast a single black or Latino person in any role of relevance. ‘Why is that?' asks the interviewer, ‘I don't know' McQueen responds, ‘Ask them', pointing to their fellow directors.
The silence that follows is mesmerizing. McQueen has shone a light directly onto their previously invisible and naturalized whiteness. There is little they can say by way of response. The only option available is to question their own motives, their own positions in relation to accepted modes of Hollywood practice. They of course collectively decline to engage in such a conversation, but by that point it doesn't really matter, the implications resonate across our screens.
On another kind of show, in another segment, it may have been possible to further interrogate the racial and sexual disparities and discourses that circulated within the media industry. We could have had a conversation about the history of black and brown representation in Hollywood, why films with all black casts automatically become ‘race themed', or perhaps, in a lecture setting, we could have deconstructed the racialised and gendered connections between blackface minstrel shows of the early 20th century and contemporary corporate Hip-Hop.
Yet it was just by McQueen's presence that we were able to glimpse in that moment an entirely implicit body of knowledge that is shaping the Hollywood dream. This is what I think Dr. Robbie Shilliam was getting at with their observations about the bodily significance of having black academics in our universities.
Though certain voices and experiences, often embodied in black and brownness, can be vital sources of knowledge beneficial to education, it would be unwise to reify ‘experience' or to think of these academics as existing solely to deal with race topics. This would only serve to further entrench the marginalization of these academics and would fail to recognise the diversity of black academics across disciplines.
Both Rob Berkeley and Dr. Shilliam spoke off-camera with me about black academics that have specialized in topics such as German philosophy or Greek ethics, only to find gainful employment in those fields a struggle. A struggle not because they lacked the relevant knowledge to teach or to pursue further research in these areas, but because they were often overlooked for those roles, as they did not fit the image of such a scholar.
This notion of racial specialization plays itself out everyday in They in obvious but unchallenged ways – such as in the notions that Indians excel in computer science, blacks the arts, East Asians in mathematics. These types of stereotypes exist within universities and can impact upon the ways in which heads of departments, lecturers, teaching assistants and senior administrators interact with new academics and learners, as well as who gets funding and additional support.
Professor Laura Pulido, in their book ‘Black, Brown, Yellow and Left', explores how such subtle forms of racialisation exist relationally – with meanings and associations of one group being contingent upon that of another. This type of differential racialization Pulido concludes ultimately benefits the dominant racial group.
It is also important to understand that the sociocultural phenomenon of whiteness and its interrelations with patriarchy, play a crucial role in shaping the ways in which women and black and brown bodies enter and exist within the academy. And this brings me to another important fact I discovered while working on this project in the UK. Out of the 85 black professors in this country only 17 are black women, less than a quarter, around 0.1% of the overall figure for professors. This data reflects the national statistics on female professors in the UK in general. And the figures are not any better at the general academic staffing level.
A recent study, Global Gender Index 2013, undertaken by Thomas Reuters in association with Times Higher Education, found that out of the top 400 ranked research universities across the world, less than 35% of academics employed within the UK's 48 institutions that took part in the study, were women. The only country in fact that came close to reaching a gender balance was Turkey, where women made up 47% of academics in me. These types of disparity are hard to ignore and are at the heart of discussions on women in science, politics, management and national policy.
We should not forget that the make-up of our institutions also affects our everyday experiences. In their essay on the Phenomenology of Whiteness, Sara Ahmed has discussed the ways in which whiteness can operate within institutions. Ahmed identifies reciprocal relationships between bodies and institutional spaces. They write,
‘Spaces also take shape by being orientated around some bodies, more than others. We can also consider ‘institutions' as orientation devices, which take the shape of ‘what' resides within them. After all, institutions provide collective or public spaces. When we describe institutions as ‘being' white (institutional whiteness), we are pointing to how institutional spaces are shaped by the proximity of some bodies and not others: white bodies gather, and cohere to form the edges of such spaces.'
Ahmed goes further, outlining how these processes inform the recruitment practices of academic institutions,
‘Some bodies more than others are recruited, those that can inherit the ‘character' of the organization, by returning its image with a reflection that reflects back that image, what we could call a ‘good likeness'. It is not just that there is a desire for whiteness that leads to white bodies getting in. Rather whiteness is what the institution is orientated ‘around', so that even bodies that might not appear white still have to inhabit whiteness, if they are to get ‘in'.'
Ahmed's point is that not only can Black and brown people appear as aberrations within the spaces shaped by institutional whiteness, our bodies can also feel the weight of whiteness. We do not blend into the environment. Instead we can remain in a perpetual state of an excruciating Fanonian self-awareness ‘exposed, visible and different', with our aspirations, capacities and habits held in check by the structures around us.
While our experiences of university life can be personally disorientating and problematic, I don't think we should be discouraged. There are increasing numbers of inspirational black academics and for that matter, fellow students, that are transforming the classroom, institutional cultures and knowledge itself. There is much to be gained from our presence.

President Barack Obama apparently thinks he's the closest thing to a Jewish president America has ever had.
Speaking to JPUpdates.com, top Obama confidant David Axelrod described a moment where the president expressed exasperation to them over being derided as anti-Israel by some.
“You know, I think I am the closest thing to a Jew that has ever sat in this office,” the president claimed, according to Axelrod. “For people to say that I am anti-Israel, or, even worse, anti-Semitic, it hurts.”
WATCH:
During Obama's tenure, U.S.-Israel relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.
In the interview, Axelrod attempted to blame the current impasse between America and Israel as the fault of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Axelrod slammed Netanyahu for only being in politics because they want “to be somebody,” in contrast to Obama and more “respectable” politicians who Axelrod claims entered elective politics to do “something positive.”

Extra Minneapolis police officers, including Chief Janeé Harteau, were patrolling downtown streets Sunday night near the Epic nightclub where a man had been shot to death in the early morning hours.
They said that the victim, from the North Side, was well known to police and that the people who had been with them at Epic were not cooperating with police.
"I have tremendous concerns about retaliation," Harteau said. "That is one of the reasons I am here tonight." They said people who think they can settle scores downtown are mistaken.
Harteau said they had "very little information about a motive or suspect." They said police didn't know if gang connections are involved, but that is being investigated.
The homicide victim, whose name has not been released, was killed inside the club after arguing with another man, who shot them and fled. According to police and witnesses, the shooting happened about an hour before the bar at 110 N. 5th St. closed. When police arrived, they found the victim on the sidewalk, where they were pronounced dead.
After attending roll call Sunday night at First Precinct headquarters, Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau walked the beat near where a man was shot and killed at the Epic nightclub early Sunday morning. They listened to an observation about the traffic flow out of nearby Ramp B from James Ryan, who works at the club.
The 1 a.m. shooting sent many of the 1,000 to 2,000 patrons who were at the club spilling out onto the streets, where officers had their hands full keeping the crowd under control and preventing people from being ­trampled.
Harteau told reporters that they had added officers to the Warehouse District patrols this weekend because the rapper performing Saturday at Epic, Yo Gotti, often attracts violent crowds. "We had cops everywhere but it still happened," they said. "We need help from the community."
They said witnesses with information need to step forward and the city needs to take action against businesses that attract violent behavior.
The chief said city officials need to review club liquor license regulations and what types of performances are allowed. They said police are reviewing security at the Epic to see if it was adequate on the night of the shooting.
They said the Epic has been the scene of previous shootings, that it had 92 calls for service in 2012 and 65 so far this year.
Harteau stopped at several downtown clubs in the Warehouse District after meeting with First Precinct officers at their nightly roll call, saying it was important to let people in the community know that authorities are taking the incident seriously.
"Sometimes people need to understand it is significant enough for the chief to come out," they said. "I am very concerned about retaliation, about an innocent bystander or an officer getting shot."
Harteau said they are also concerned about a resurgence of violence as happened in the summer of 2012.
Epic is at the heart of the area where shooting erupted repeatedly in the summer of 2012 at bar closing time. Downtown police patrols were beefed up and the City Council talked about creating stricter bar licensing ordinances. Several clubs agreed to stop hosting under-21 events on Sunday nights until mid-September, use tougher wristbands to identify young people at later under-21 events, employ uniformed security and off-duty police officers, and conduct background checks on all staff members.
Council Member Don Samuels, who represents the North Side and is running for mayor, sat by Harteau at the First Precinct news conference Sunday night. They noted later that the council had added restrictions to licenses of nightclubs since last summer, tightening up bar security and other requirements. They noted that one club closed after seeing the coming restrictions and the city shut down another club that didn't comply.
The Hennepin County medical examiner's office will release the victim's name after notifying family members. Police request that anyone with information text 877411, enter MPD and the tip, or call 612-692-8477.

It may still be April, yet the Union front office/coaching staff have already seen some of the ample supply of goodwill they earned with a positive offseason begin to dwindle. With all the quality acquired for 2014, the Union have only one win from their first eight matches.
Even worse, during the last two games — a road loss against New York Red Bulls and a home draw against a struggling Houston Dynamo side — the Union looked short of attacking ideas and general intent.
With a chance to take down Eastern Conference bottom-dwellers Montreal Impact this Saturday, changes need to be made. But what can be done to ensure that the Union squad that opened the year so brightly begins to put together some victories? Here are a few ideas.
1. Define Nogueira's role
Vincent Nogueira's positioning is a problem which John Hackworth must address.
It is a problem not because he's playing poorly, or because he's not giving effort, but because they are doing so much work and covering so much ground that they are too often not in position to influence the attack from the center of the pitch or even in the attacking third of the field, where the Union need the most help.
It was a similar story against Houston, as Nogueira's passing chart demonstrates (see right). They were everywhere. Whether they were showing for the ball, controlling possession, or pinging the ball around metrononmically, Nogueira was yet again the focal point for the Union. But that focus was rarely near enough to goal to cause much trouble for the Dynamo backline.
If Nogueira is to become the Union's leading creator, as the coaching staff expects them to be, they need to concentrate a more of their efforts in the attacking half. As an example of what can happen when they do get into that space, look no further than the ball they played for Andrew Wenger's first Union goal. Additionally, taking up a more consistently attacking stance would allow Maurice Edu to better define their own role as they continue to settle into the Union formation. A more advanced Nogueira would mean that Edu could become the primary recipient for passes out of the back, allowing them more touches in space as the Union look to build.
However, if Nogueira is not going to have their role restricted by the coaching staff, then they should look for someone else to assume those duties and allow the fantastic Frenchman to officially drop back into the box-to-box role that they prefer. With Brian Carroll and Edu already entrenched in that deeper level, such a move would necessitate a rethink on how both of those players are deployed.
2. Switch depths, not fields
This one shouldn't even need to be said: It didn't work last year; it didn't work the year before. It doesn't work.
Flipping wingers and rotating forwards and midfielders at short 5-10 minutes intervals (or sometimes shorter) simply does not confuse defenses. With all that running around, MLS defenders are more than happy to sit back and watch the Union go through their motions.
Against Houston, with so many upfield passes going awry, the Union forwards rotated so frequently that the only players they seemed to confuse were their deeper lying teammates.
This is not to say that the Union should pin their wingers to the touchline and leave them there. Smart movement off the ball is what opens up space for attackers to run into and lanes into which fullbacks can overlap.
So instead of switching fields, Sebastien Le Toux, Leo Fernandes, Andrew Wenger, Cristian Maidana and whoever else finds themselves out wide need to drop deeper into the field to get touches and get relief from the constant pressure applied by outside fullbacks.
Against New York, both Le Toux and Fernandes were often guilty of laying off a short pass to their respective fullback before turning tail and bolting up field, so leaving the fullback without a simple passing option. As a result, both Fabinho and Gaddis were forced to turn the ball back in field to the outlet offered to them by Maurice Edu or Nogueira. And just like that, the linkage between the midfield and the forward line was severed.
Taking the time to possess the ball and move it with purpose around the edges of an opponent's 18-yard box is critical to creating scoring chances. This is no aimless possession around midfield. Not only does it give players like Maidana and Nogueira a chance to pick out the killer pass, but it also allows for the late runs of Edu and the fullbacks, bringing even more bodies into the play.
3. Better control of fullback positioning
A speedy, overlapping, attacking fullback can be a coach's best friend and a ready-made cure for a team suffering from a chronic lack of width.
However, you can have too much of a good thing. At the moment, that is where the Union find themselves.
True, the chances Fabinho, Sheanon Williams, and to a lesser extent Ray Gaddis are taking to push play high up the flank often succeed in pinning back opposing fullbacks. However, there is an unforeseen side effect to so much pressure. Despite winning the flanks, the Union are caving in centrally to cover up for their spatial victories out wide.
Rather than the pushing the center backs forward to either side of Brian Carroll and condensing the play into the opponent's half, the Union captain is sitting deeper and deeper, inserting themselves into Amobi Okugo's right center back spot and forcing Okugo to essentially slide to right back. Edu is then left to control the void in the actual center of midfield, while Nogueira flies around putting out fires all over the pitch. The end result is a fullback high up the pitch ready to deliver crosses and cutbacks into the box, but with a lack of bodies there to receive them, let alone distribute or create in the center of the park.
Obviously, this has its detriments at the defensive end as well. When Carroll was rested against New York, it was Okugo sprinting out to their right to cover runners who had gotten behind the overly adventurous Gaddis that led to both goals. Yes, had Sebastien Le Toux tracked Roy Miller on the opener, that goal may not have happened, but the fact remains that Gaddis committed to a tackle too high up the pitch rather than sitting off and picking up whichever player ended up making the final run. Had they cooled their heels and communicated with Le Toux to contain the play, the space behind them couldn't have been exploited.
For the Union to go back to winning ways — and consistently stout defending — getting a handle on when fullbacks commit, both defensively and offensively, will be crucial to insuring that opposing teams don't feast on the spaces behind them.
4. Don't automatically funnel towards goal
Funneling defensive play towards goal is one of those cardinal rules dished out by youth coaches. As soon as the opposition wins play and counters, players are drilled to work quickly back towards their own goal. With young players, it not only gets their feet moving in the right direction, it also instills a sense that the play is not over once a turnover is committed. And it is a valuable lesson to keep teaching youngsters.
But it is a rule that has exceptions, especially at the highest levels of the game, and the Union would do well to spend a significant amount of practice time focused on them. The reason to spend extra time on the exceptions is because too many bodies in navy and gold shirts are collapsing into Zac MacMath's box without having the requisite awareness of where, in fact, the different attacking runners will be coming from.
Partly, it is down to old-fashioned ball-watching, as in Harrison, N.J. on Wednesday. Thierry Henry and Lloyd Sam are both elusive runners (Henry more so, obviously), but with their eyes fixed on the ball, Aaron Wheeler and Fabinho's frantic efforts to ensure they were goal side of their marks led them to run right past the play, leaving New York's two most dangerous players in 2014 alone for simple finishes.
5. It's down to communication
It starts with Zac MacMath and goes straight up the spine of the formation, through Okugo, Carroll, Edu, Nogueira and Wenger. So many of the mistakes that have cost the Union in the opening eight matches are down to focus and communication. Late in matches, when players are tired, communication becomes that much more important to keeping shape, tracking required runners, and supporting teammates. The need for extra chatter late in matches is true for all sides, regardless of level. As the Union continue to jell and get to know each other, that element should continue to improve as well, hopefully along with tactical adjustments.
6. Start Austin Berry
Get Austin Berry back in the starting XI, but quick.
There is no doubting that Berry was off of their game against RSL in their first game back from injury. But the 2012 Rookie of the Year is a proven center back in MLS, and is deserving of their place in the starting XI. The Wheeler Experiment has proved a mixed bag. While the converted forward excels in the air and in making the plays in front of him, when they are required to track runners, chase down attackers, or distribute from the back, he's frequently found wanting. Changing positions is never easy, and Union fans will remember the struggles that Okugo endured. Their transition was only one level back from the midfield. While Wheeler's conversion is an entertaining storyline, the Union have a player in Berry who has already proven themselves to be a top quality MLS defender.
Berry showed prior to their injury in the brief run of games alongside Okugo and in the past two MLS seasons that they have all of the skills required to both compliment their center back partner and get the job done.
7. Reach for the scalpel, not the sledge hammer
In other words, leave Cristian Maidana on the field.
Over their short history, the Union seem to have little patience for players who exert all of their efforts trying to make things happen in the final third. Whether it was Roger Torres or Michael Farfan, the low percentage chances that come when a player tries to fit a pass into a tight spot tend to draw groans from around PPL Park. Too often, at least in the past, that player was replaced with a more direct, linear attacker.
But with so few players on the roster that can thrive on life in an opponent's 18, allowing Maidana to play a full 90 minutes is more critical than ever. Their persistent probing and searching for the final ball will inevitably lead to good things as defenses tire late in matches. Their guile and passing range can unsettle defenses in a manner that simply throwing more bodies into the box does not.
There is too much talent on the Union roster for anyone to press the panic button. Yet, with the Union struggling, changes must be made to how the team approaches play at both ends of the field, otherwise they will continue to limp through 2014, with poor results following them the whole way.
Director Roland Emmerich revealed via Twitter that Judd Hirsch will be returning to their role as Julius Levinson, the cantankerous father of Jeff Goldblum's David Levinson, in Independence Day 2! Shortly thereafter they also revealed that President Thomas J. Whitmore himself, Bill Pullman, has officially signed on as well!
Today we celebrate our #IndependenceDay sequel. Welcome back, Bill Pullman. pic.twitter.com/hR3qisg70i — Roland Emmerich (@rolandemmerich) April 17, 2015
It's official… we're thrilled to have the GREAT Judd Hirsch grace the set of #IndependenceDay once again! pic.twitter.com/vSIEQsZwjb — Roland Emmerich (@rolandemmerich) April 17, 2015
Pullman was seen last year in The Equalizer, while Hirsch made their name on classic sitcom “Taxi” and has more recently been a regular on IFC's “Maron.” They join a cast that includes Jeff Goldblum, Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Vivica A. Fox, Travis Tope, Joey King and Brent Spiner.
Set to hit theaters on June 24, 2016 (almost exactly 20 years after the original), Independence Day 2 is looking to begin production in May with a script most recently rewritten by Carter Blanchard (best known for the short-lived 2009 series “G vs E”). Previous drafts were done by Emmerich and Dean Devlin, and then by James Vanderbilt.
The original Independence Day opened on July 3, 1996 and earned an impressive $817.4 million worldwide. Emmerich is also set to produce the sequel alongside Devlin and Harald Kloser.
INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- The Cleveland Cavaliers held their first post-All-Star break practice Wednesday and all 14 players were on the court for it. That group included Kevin Love, Iman Shumpert, Timofey Mozgov, Anderson Varejao and Mo Williams -- five players whose names have increasingly popped up in trade rumors in the last couple of weeks.
Despite the fact that nearly a third of the roster has been linked to potential swaps, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said they did not address the group regarding Thursday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline.
"That's not really my department," Lue said. "The guys came in and responded well. That wasn't a problem at all. It's the nature of the business. It's unfortunate, but it happens."
ESPN's Marc Stein and Brian Windhorst reported this week that the Boston Celtics have interest in Love, and the Cavs could potentially package Shumpert and Mozgov to acquire Kosta Koufos, Ben McLemore and a shooter like Marco Belinelli from the Sacramento Kings.
With $110 million in payroll already committed, and an additional $65 million in luxury-tax fees slated to come down the pike because of that commitment, the Cavs would like to shed or at least swap salary in a deal, rather than just add a player through one of their two trade exceptions worth $10.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
Varejao, who has played their 12-year career in Cleveland, is making $9.7 million this season and is on the books for $9.3 million in 2016-17. While they are viewed as a positive locker-room presence and has made sporadic contributions this season when called upon because of injuries at the top of the rotation, the Cavs are willing to move them to acquire an additional wing player who could have an immediate impact, a source with knowledge of the team's thinking told ESPN.
The Cavs could have a hard time finding a taker for Varejao, considering their age (33) and injury history. Having already dealt their 2016 first-round pick, the Cavs' most tradable assets in terms of amenable salaries commensurate with those players' abilities are probably Shumpert ($8.9 million), Mozgov ($4.9 million) and Williams ($2.1 million) outside of Matthew Dellavedova (a steal at $1.3 million and someone the Cavs want to hold on to).
With one open roster spot, the Cavs could also look to shore up their squad by going after a player who would accept a buyout from their current team. One popular buyout candidate is Brooklyn's Joe Johnson, considering the sorry state of the Nets. Johnson, a seven-time All-Star, has connections to Cavs general manager David Griffin through their time in Phoenix together, to Cavs lead assistant coach Larry Drew through their time in Atlanta together, and to LeBron James through USA Basketball. That would make them a welcomed fit in Cleveland. However, according to a source familiar with the Cavs' thinking, Cleveland's belief is Johnson does not want to leave Brooklyn and will seek to stick with the franchise on a multiyear extension as it undergoes its rebuild.
James, for their part, did not want to offer an opinion of any potential upgrades the Cavs should pursue.
"For me, control what you can control and that's not something none of us can control what happens," James said. "The trade deadline happens every year and there are teams that make moves, teams that don't make moves. We're all here to find out what happens and if there's nothing we'll be ready to go."
Cleveland is in first place in the Eastern Conference at 38-14, including an 8-3 record since Lue took over for David Blatt. However, in the West, Golden State, San Antonio and Oklahoma City all have better records. Also, the Cavs rank 28th in bench scoring at only 27.0 points per game, making their depth their most glaring weakness when comparing themselves to the rest of the league's elite.
Last season, Griffin transformed the team with a pair of midseason trades, sending out Dion Waiters and Lou Amundson to bring in Shumpert, Mozgov and J.R. Smith. Much like James, Lue said they would leave any moves this year up to Griffin again.
"I'm not involved," Lue said. "Whoever we have, that's who I have to coach. I stay out of that."
No matter what happens when the dust settles after the trade deadline, James says they believe the Cavs -- no matter how they're constructed -- must sharpen their focus for the stretch run.
"It's all about the mental side for our team," James said. "The physical is going to take care of itself, but mentally if we engage, we can be very, very good. When we're not engaged, we can lose a lot of ballgames."

e can't assume a foreseeable end for Edward Snowden's crusade against the National Security Agency (NSA), of which they were a contractor. In 2013, the news about Snowden's revelations of confidential NSA documents went viral and the whistleblower had to flee from the US soil, all the way to Russia to avert themselves from preparing retirement plans in the US prisons. The leak also proved that the NSA and GCHQ spied on Israeli drones using open source tools
Snowden has taken the war to the next step. This time, they are going to become a hardware manufacturer to save the iPhone users from the surveillance activities conducted by NSA or any other security agency.  They are the co-author, along with Andrew ‘bunnie' Huang, of a research paper which aims to create a custom case for the iPhone. This case would be equipped with powers to alert users to the condition of a security agency trying to trespass in their devices.
“Front-line journalists are high-value targets, and their enemies will spare no expense to silence them. Unfortunately, journalists can be betrayed by their own tools. Their smartphones are also the perfect tracking device,” the research paper reads. “This work aims to give journalists the tools to know when their smartphones are tracking or disclosing their location when the devices are supposed to be in airplane mode.”
The main working idea of the research paper is to introspect the radio signals of a mobile device to trace any activity of unwanted data being sent by the device. And it's not an iPhone-exclusive research, it may apply to various smartphones available in the market. But the hacker duo has picked up the iPhones 6 probably due to its immense popularity. We have heard about the security level already offered by the iOS which forced FBI to knock the court's door in the San Bernardino Shooter case. The tech world stood behind Apple to resist the unlocking of the shooters iPhone but FBI finally managed to crack the iPhone by themselves.
The research paper quotes the tragic death of the reporter Marie Colvin during the artillery fire by the Syrian forces in 2012. A lawsuit filed against the Syrian government claims that the reporter was a deliberate target and “describes how their location was discovered in part through the use of intercept devices that monitored satellite-dish and cellphone communications”.
The GUI of the modern age smartphones can't be trusted. It's possible that your Bluetooth and WiFi radio might be working on the hardware level even after you have tapped the switch off. For example, smartphones have a feature to search for networks even if the Wi-Fi is turned off. It is a feature for added convenience, but if compromised, may lead to transmission of your valuable data without any consent of yours.
“Malware packages, peddled by hackers at a price accessible by private individuals, can activate radios without any indication from the user interface; trusting a phone that has been hacked to go into airplane mode is like trusting a drunk person to judge if they are sober enough to drive.”
The research paper throws light on the unavailability of open source devices in the market, thus, it requires many resources to reverse engineer the devices to make it compatible with the introspection engine and its hardware they want to create. Hence, the 4.7” iPhone 6 is their prime choice for the deployment of their field-ready hardware introspection solution. “The choice of model is driven primarily by what we understand to be the current preferences and tastes of reporters. It has little to do with the relative security of any platform, as we assume any platform, be it iOS or Android, can and will be compromised by state-level adversaries.”
Their battery cum introspection case for iPhone 6, once in existence, will be able to introspect GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi, and Cellular Modem (2G,3G,4G) signals. It will make sure that your device is in the “dark” i.e. no unwanted signals are being transmitted.
They will be coming up with a prototype of the battery case by the next year. The development process will be solely based on the availability of funds and volunteer efforts. “If the prototype proves successful, the FPF may move to seek the necessary funding to develop and maintain a supply chain,” says the research paper. FPF stands for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, it's a non-profit org. “dedicated to helping support and defend public-interest journalism focused on exposing mismanagement, corruption, and law-breaking in government”. Edward Snowden is a board member of the crowd-funded organization.

Canada's broadcast regulator is holding hearings on a series of proposals that many observers say could dramatically change Canada's TV landscape.
Having received input from about 10,000 Canadians, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has convened a special hearing called "Let's Talk TV" in Gatineau, Que.
Over the next two weeks, the CRTC will hear from industry representatives as well as private citizens on a host of broadcast issues. Canadians have until Sept. 19 to submit their opinion to the CRTC on the future of TV in Canada.
The most-publicized proposals include a plan that would require cable and satellite providers to offer a basic service made up primarily of local Canadian channels, as well as a strategy to disentangle subscription packages to allow consumers to pick and choose individual channels.
Whichever proposals the CRTC ends up adopting, observers say it's likely to affect the pocketbooks of Canadians. Here's a closer look at what's at stake.
What are the main proposals?
While there are a number of proposals in play, the CRTC hearings address two main themes: giving consumers more choice and flexibility and promoting Canadian — especially local — content.
To achieve these aims, the CRTC is looking into two proposals that have received a lot of publicity:
Providing consumers with a basic TV package that mainly consists of local Canadian channels
Unbundling cable packages to allow for a "pick-and-pay" model
Unbundling is a good thing, right?
Well, it's complicated.
Right now, when you buy a cable subscription from Canada's major cable providers – such as Bell, Rogers, Shaw or Videotron – you can opt for different packages. You're paying for the channels you want, but also for a bundle of channels you may never watch.
CRTC chair Jean-Pierre Blais said their goal is to modernize the regulator to adapt to a new TV landscape. (CBC)
While being able to separate the channels you want from the ones you don't seem logical, there's a reason channels are packaged this way. Bundling popular channels with more specialized ones is a way of helping subsidize the smaller channels.
The cable companies have argued that unbundling could mean smaller channels, which would not have as many subscribers, could become orphaned and disappear.
The advocacy group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting has issued a similar warning. It recently released a statement saying that the pick-and-pay model, in conjunction with other proposed changes, "will likely harm local broadcasting, especially local news, which is the kind of programming Canadians think is most important."
OK, some channels might perish. But overall, cable subscriptions should become cheaper, no?
Likely not. If channels were unbundled and consumers had the ability to buy individual stations, the prices for specific channels would probably go up.
"When you buy anything in bulk, it's cheaper on a per-unit basis," says Greg O'Brien, editor and publisher of CARTT, a Canadian broadcast industry news site.
They use the example of someone who buys a cable subscription to get sports channel TSN and also ends up with W, the women-focused lifestyle and movie channel. By involuntarily subscribing to W, TSN fans help keep the price of subscribing to W low, while the W fans keep the cost of a TSN subscription a little lower.
O'Brien says that some companies, such as Videotron in Quebec and Eastlink in the Maritimes, already provide pick-and-pay options in a limited form. But they maintain that there hasn't been a huge public movement in favour of unbundling.
Forum Research recently conducted a poll of 1,202 Canadian cable subscribers that found 48 per cent prefer the current model of cable subscriptions, while only one-third desire the CRTC's proposed pick-and-pay system. (The poll was based on an interactive voice response telephone survey of randomly selected Canadians 18 and older. The sample is considered accurate within three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.)
O'Brien says that given the potential costs of unbundling, and the fact that many consumers buy cable subscriptions to satisfy multiple family members, most people will still opt for the big bundle. O'Brien likens it to the consumption of junk food.
"Most people shop at Costco because they know they're going to have to buy a big box of potato chips rather than just one or two bags."

I've heard that the CRTC is trying to implement a cheap basic package. What's that about?
The CRTC is looking to force broadcasters to offer a basic monthly cable package that emphasizes Canadian content and costs no more than $20 to $30.
The so-called "skinny basic" would likely include Canadian over-the-air channels such as CTV, Global and CBC, as well as specialty channels such as APTN (the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network) and the Weather Network.
O'Brien says it's an "artificial limitation," because the Canadian-centric package will likely exclude the main U.S. networks, which means getting those channels could be an additional cost.
"Most people expect their basic package is going to have some of those U.S. channels: NBC, ABC, Fox and PBS," says O'Brien. "So if all of a sudden you're going to say, here's a skinny basic, but all of these U.S. channels that you're used to are gone, that's going to upset some people."
How do they plan to protect and promote Canadian content?
In addition to making Canadian programming, especially local content, part of a basic cable package, the CRTC is looking into "redefining broadcast revenues."
In order to help create Canadian content, the telcos have to pay into the Canadian Media Fund, a pot of money that helps pay for domestic TV and film production. In 2013, cable and satellite providers contributed $266 million to the Canadian Media Fund.
The CRTC is hoping to tweak this system to compel online video streaming services to also contribute. The biggest of these is Netflix, which has about four million subscribers in Canada.
But O'Brien says that requiring Netflix to do this carries all sorts of legal hurdles. The U.S. company offers a Canadian version of its service, but it doesn't have a Canadian office and pays no taxes here.
Even if the CRTC were somehow able to compel Netflix to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund, O'Brien says the company would likely pass the cost on to consumers in the form of higher subscription rates.
"That's what everyone else does," says O'Brien.
As you may know by now, crickets are extremely rich with protein. They're packed with Calcium, Iron, Vitamin B12, Zinc, and Magnesium. Yet they aren't popular fare in Western culture. At least not yet--the cricket consumption culture is still on the rise.
In Western civilizations, there is a barrier to entry: an emotional barrier. It's hard for people in Western culture to get past the fact that they're eating bugs. However, the products that are currently on the market aren't bugs, per se.
The main insect-related, consumer-facing product is cricket flour. The process to create this flour is simply dry roasting crickets and then condensing them into powder form. The end result is a powder that is packed with protein and looks like “cumin.” No legs, antennae or eyes staring up at you. It is just a powder optimized for clean protein to enhance the human body.
I'm not sure if or when the consumption of whole crickets will be adopted into Western civilization with the same acceptance as other parts of the world. 80% of countries in the world accept insects as edible food groups. Still, for some it's hard to get past the ick factor to imagine crickets as a replacement for croutons on a salad. Although, similar arguments were made against lobster and sushi not too long ago. Everyone knows how that played out with them both becoming culinary delicacies!
There is also a delicate balance in marketing the cricket as a revolutionary food. It can't be gimmicky with taste challenges or anything of the sort, because there are actually so many benefits. When you take into account the fact that crickets can help secure food sustainability, have a fantastic impact on the environment, and have a powerful functional health benefit, it's easy to see that crickets have a very unique opportunity to be a part of western culture.
Cricket-related companies have also received quite a bit of attention in recent years from many different places. Mark Cuban invested in a cricket based company on Shark Tank, self help guru Tim Ferriss invested in a cricket bar company, and Aspire received $1,000,000 from Bill Clinton by winning the Hult Prize. All in all, it's safe to say the cricket is on the rise.

From the Guardian today:
Mike Rogers, the chair of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, told CNN Khattala had been “compliant but not cooperative” through 10 days of interrogation on a navy ship before being transferred to Washington for a civilian trial. Rogers said Khattala should be classified as an enemy combatant and held at Guantánamo Bay. ….“We have a military tribunal process and I do believe in it. We've used it in the past, in World War II and subsequent to that. We have a process where they get a trial and their guilt or innocence is established.
This has become such a knee-jerk reaction from right-wing politicos that I almost don't even notice it anymore. But seriously, what is it that accounts for the conservative obsession with military tribunals? Abu Khattala would get a taxpayer-paid defense attorney either way. He'll be held securely either way. He's got about the same chance of being convicted either way. And if they are convicted, he'll be shipped off to an appropriately grim prison cell either way.
So what's the deal? Is this really just code for we should ship them to Gitmo and interrogate them in, um, an enhanced way? Does it code for Obama is doing this so we're against it? Or is there something more to it? There's a mountain of evidence suggesting that civilian courts are more effective at prosecuting terrorism than military tribunals, so that's not it. Unless torture and abusive treatment are their goals, it's a mystery why folks like Rogers keep banging away endlessly on their infatuation with military tribunals.

Longmont-based Left Hand Brewing is collaborating with eight other U.S. craft brewers on a special beer to benefit military veterans, but a bad batch delayed a planned Memorial Day weekend release.
Homefront IPA is an American India Pale Ale brewed with orange zest and aged with a very American kind of wood — Louisville Slugger maple bats, which are specially engraved and added to the tank.
All proceeds will go to Operation Homefront, a national nonprofit that provides emergency assistance to veterans and their families.
The swing and a miss on the first brewing attempt means Left Hand is now aiming for a release date the first week of June.
"Our first batch did not meet our quality standards, and in the interest of doing the right thing, especially for Operation Homefront, we are re-brewing and releasing at a later date," brewery spokesperson Emily Armstrong said.
The collaboration originated in 2011 with Chris Ray, then a Seattle Mariners pitcher and co-founder of Center of the Universe Brewing Co. in Ashland, Va. Seattle-based Fremont Brewing Co. was on board, too.
This year the list of participating breweries includes Cigar City Brewing in Tampa, Fla., Sly Fox Brewing Co. in Pottstown, Pa., Perennial Artisan Ales in St. Louis, 21st Amendment Brewery in San Francisco, the Phoenix Ale Brewery in Phoenix and Stone Brewing Co. in Escondido, Calif. All used the same recipe.

"It's all about putting egos aside and doing something that's good and right for your country," Armstrong said.
Left Hand will brew 55 barrels of the beer, and it will be available on draft and in 22-ounce bottles nationwide.
Yukon students won't be travelling to France this year. The Department of Education is suspending field trips to the country because of the threat of terrorism.
Nicole Morgan, assistant deputy minister of learning, curriculum and assessment, said France remains off-limits to Yukon students after last spring's deadly attacks in Paris.
"The government of Canada's travel advisory urges a high degree of caution, and identifies an elevated threat of terrorism," they said. "So when we have advisories like that we would not be approving trips to France."
Last year, a group of 10 students and two teachers from F.H. Collins Secondary School were in northern France when multiple deadly attacks happened in Paris. The students returned home safely.
According to Morgan, students at Robert Service School in Dawson City were forced to cancel their trip to France earlier this year. Two other trips, planned for this school year, will not be approved.
Morgan said organizers are now considering other European locations. They said there is currently a school trip visiting Germany, which remains an approved location.
Story highlights Jordan Linn Graham's attorneys ask a judge to release them
Prosecutors argue they should remain behind bars
They say Graham lied to authorities and tried to cover up the crime
Graham, 22, could get life in prison if found guilty of second-degree murder
The Montana newlywed accused of killing their husband by pushing them off a cliff has traded their bridal gown for an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs.
Jordan Linn Graham, who's charged with second-degree murder, broke down in tears when their mom walked into a courtroom on Wednesday, but remained composed for most of the detention hearing.
The 22-year-old's attorneys asked a judge to release them from jail and place them under home confinement with electronic monitoring.
But prosecutors said they should remain behind bars, arguing that they had lied to authorities, tried to cover up the crime and was at risk of harming herself.
The judge said they would rule on the matter by Thursday.
Prosecutors say that Graham shoved Cody Johnson face-first off a steep cliff just eight days into their marriage.
JUST WATCHED Newlywed texted before husband's death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Newlywed texted before husband's death 01:46
JUST WATCHED Newlywed accused of killing husband Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Newlywed accused of killing husband 02:44
New details in the case emerged during Wednesday's hearing, including an argument from prosecutors that a fake e-mail account had been created just days after Johnson's death as part of what appeared to be an attempt to cover up the alleged killing.
Graham and Johnson had been married just more than a week when an argument in early July allegedly escalated to a case of second-degree murder.
If convicted, Graham will face life in prison.
According to a criminal complaint, Graham told a friend they were having second thoughts about marrying Johnson.
The complaint said the couple argued the night of July 7. Upset, they decided to go hiking in Glacier National Park in Flathead County, Montana, where they continued to fight.
Graham told police that their husband grabbed them by the arm. They turned and removed theirs hand.
"Graham stated they could have just walked away, but due to their anger, they pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, they fell face first off the cliff," the complaint read.
Their body was discovered several days later.
According to the complaint, Graham changed their story about what happened several times.
Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, declined to comment on the case.
"Any time we asked Cody how the relationship was, they always said it was good," friend Cameron Fredrickson said. "It's a complete shock to me. Cody is one of the greatest guys I've had the opportunity to know."
According to the complaint, Graham reportedly told a friend they planned to talk with Johnson about their reservations on July 7. The same day, Graham sent the friend a text message saying, "Oh well, I'm about to talk to him."
The friend responded, "I'll pray for you guys."
Graham wrote back: "But dead serious if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened."
BURLINGTON, Vt. — Leverage: it's the one thing Bernie Sanders' advisors and aides consistently point to when asked why, exactly, he's formally staying in the Democratic primary race that he's lost to Hillary Clinton.
But it's the one thing he's been bleeding every day ever since they dropped California's primary by a much wider-than-expected margin last week. Sanders' summer was supposed to be all about building leverage for the Democratic convention, providing them with a better hand to play as they press Clinton to accept their policy positions and party reform suggestions. Now, the people closest to them aren't sure how exactly to get it back.
Story Continued Below
Their first and most prominent endorsers have jumped off the bandwagon, congratulating and in some cases endorsing Clinton — from Sen. Jeff Merkley to Rep. Raul Grijalva, and from the Communications Workers of America to MoveOn.org.Each of the big-name Democrats and groups who steadfastly remained neutral in the primary have flocked to Clinton over the past week, from President Barack Obama to Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the AFL-CIO. Even Sanders' highest-profile congressional endorsee, Nevada's Lucy Flores, lost their primary bid on Tuesday despite their cash injection into their campaign.
Yet on Thursday night, speaking to over 200,000 viewers who tuned into their live-streamed video address, Sanders vowed to press on — pledging to fight to defeat Donald Trump but refusing to formally back Clinton and insisting their army of supporters isn't going anywhere.
“We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become,” they said, nearly acknowledging defeat but making a point not to concede while reading from a prompter in a cramped television studio deep in their hometown. “And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates."
Speaking for 23 minutes, the Vermont senator rattled off a long list of policy stances and political changes they want to push for the future of the party, each of which would need Clinton's imprimatur to become reality -- from new leadership for the Democratic National Committee to a $15 federal minimum wage.
If Democrats were expecting a less combative Sanders to formally exit the race on Thursday, it was a misunderstanding of their posture. Their staffers believe that continuing to pull Clinton and the party to the left is only achievable as long as Sanders is still formally a candidate with a considerable number of delegates behind them at the July convention.
And while their team has started signaling that it's reached a new phase, it's still far from sounding a truly conciliatory tone.
“We would like to get to a place where we could very actively support the nominee,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Bloomberg Television on Thursday — a hope-filled line for Clinton's team that nonetheless implied there was still considerable work to be done before true unity is achieved.
To Sanders' most steadfast remaining supporters, anything short of a continued campaign to tug Clinton on specific points — from embracing a nationwide ban on fracking to axing the superdelegate system — would be an abandonment of their “political revolution."
“Bernie Sanders has brought a lot of new people into the Democratic fold, and I think it would be wise for Secretary Clinton to keep them close to the Democratic Party and close to her,” said Utah Democratic Party chairperson Peter Corroon, one of the superdelegates who remain with Sanders. “His leverage comes from their supporters, and so while the prospects [of a victory] at the convention may be lower, I think there's a whole group of people that Secretary Clinton needs to pay attention to. And if Senator Sanders is asking for something that will help keep them in the fold, then they should listen."
“We look forward to the Democratic Party embracing key aspects of their platform,” added Anna Galland, the executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action — a group that backed Sanders before congratulating Clinton on their victory on Wednesday. "We look forward to their historic campaign influencing the convention and how the Democratic Party acts moving forward."
Sanders' evening comments came while their team continues talks with Clinton's aides about policies they're looking to see on the party platform or in the front-runner's agenda moving forward, and just two days after Clinton and Sanders sat down with their senior aides in Washington to talk in person for the first time in months.
While they spoke for well over an hour and a half — longer than campaign officials initially expected — and issued nearly identical statements after the meeting, their Tuesday evening talk subtly indicated significant distance.
Clinton, for example, noted that the two had discussed “unifying the party” — a phrase that was glaringly omitted from Sanders' version. And the section of their statement where their team ran through the issues discussed by the candidates included a reference to “making healthcare universal and accessible,” a tense point of disagreement between the two that wasn't included in the presumptive nominee's statement.
What's unclear now is just how far Sanders can push Clinton, whose campaign is coming off one of its strongest stretches yet, and who has fully pivoted to taking on Trump with a series of speeches and an ad barrage that the real estate developer shows no signs of being able to match.
Far from just leading Trump in national polls, Clinton's allies now note that battleground state surveys also suggest they have little reason to fear that tepid support from Sanders backers could doom them
They have, nonetheless, started to show a willingness to tack left toward Sanders, scheduling an economic policy speech set for Ohio next week that could include nods to their agenda. On Thursday, the Clinton campaign also installed a new chief of staff at the DNC who comes from the Service Employees International Union — a labor pick that could be welcome to Sanders' rank-and-file supporters.
Still, the preliminary nature of those steps has not slowed the stream of ardent Sanders backers rallying to Clinton's side in recent days. The loss of Merkley — their lone Senate endorser — and Grijalva — their first House supporter — were especially stinging, as was the immediate Clinton endorsement from liberal hero Warren.
Such officials “are seeing the handwriting on the wall as others are,” acknowledged Corroon, noting that they haven't heard from Clinton's team since they claimed the nomination. "I think they probably should have waited 'til all the caucuses and primaries were over before saying anything."
“But now that they're over,” they said, "things aren't looking as positive as some had hoped."

With 2014 likely to be declared the world's hottest year on record, the last thing the planet needs is a climate shift to turbo-charge the global warming already under way.
While it's an early call, a measure of surface temperature differences in the Pacific shifted to a positive reading in the five months to November, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the longest such run in almost 12 years.
Climate experts are watching to see if a shift in a Pacific temperature gradient signals a period of accelerated warming is about to begin. Credit:Brianne Makin
Known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the El Nino-like pattern typically lasts 15-30 years and is understood to operate as an accelerator on global surface temperatures during its positive phase – and a brake during its negative phase – as the ocean takes up fluctuating amounts of the extra heat being trapped by rising greenhouse gas emissions.
"It certainly could be an early sign of a change but you'd probably want to see another year or two before it's a genuine phase shift," Matthew England, a professor at the University of NSW's Climate Change Research Centre, said. "This could be the start of another ramping up of warming."

Black Swan Risks Heading into 2016 [Chart]
SocGen's latest evaluation still sees steep downside risk to market
The Chart of the Week is a weekly Visual Capitalist feature on Fridays.
Société Générale has come out with their most recent list of what the bank considers to be potential “black swans” to the market.
France's third largest bank publishes this list as part of their Global Economic Outlook. As several users have pointed out in the past, we are indeed aware that black swans are by nature unlikely and extremely difficult to predict. We agree with this, but we do find SocGen's list a useful way of understanding some of the upcoming risks in the market that could sway investor sentiment and opinion.
In the latest edition of the report, which was published this week, the bank still sees an excess of potential downside risks to the global economy. The greatest of these risks, slated at only a 10% probability but with maximum impact potential, is a new global recession. The report mentions as well that a hard landing in China could have similar effects.
Downside risks and their probability:
45% – Great Britain leaves the EU (Impact: low)
30% – China's economy has a hard landing (Impact: high)
25% – U.S. consumers save more than expected (Impact: medium)
10% – Fed hikes too late (Impact: medium to high)
10% – New global recession (Impact: high)
Upside risks and their probability:
20% – Stronger investment and trade (Impact: medium to high)
15% – More fiscal accommodation (Impact: medium)
10% – Fast track reform (Impact: low)
One risk that could be added to the mix is some sort of deflationary spiral. These are words that no central banker wants to hear, but signs of deflation are popping up all over the market. For example, as we showed in a recent chart, nearly all commodities got hammered over 2015.
The impact of such a spiral would be catastrophic, and the Fed has limited means to combat such an event. That said, it is tough to discern whether deflation will continue to be found sprinkled benignly throughout the economy, or if it could somehow snowball into the full-on death spiral.
Black swan indeed.

Tender Asian Broccoli smothered in a rich, thick sauce. Insanely simple to make, ready in less than 30 minutes and full of flavour.
A few years ago I would never have dreamt of creating a whole meal around a humble head of broccoli. I think most of us grow up conditioned to think that a meal has to revolve around meat which is so sad. Hopefully, with the recent announcement from the World Health Organization about certain meats causing cancer this view point might change and gradually more and more people will discover the joys of a plant-based diet.
I am certainly loving my plant-based journey which has been kind of taken over by Asian style flavours recently. Pair those Asian flavours with broccoli in a quick, easy meal with a multitude of health benefits and I am very happy.
As well as tasting great, broccoli is full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and has powerful anti-inflammatory benefits. It is also full of calcium and contains more protein per calorie than steak (Dr. Scott Stoll). Broccoli's combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification properties make it a unique food in terms of cancer prevention. It has been shown to lower your risk of contracting ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.
Take full advantage of all these wonderful health benefits by making this Easy Asian Broccoli for dinner very soon. It truly is a dish that the whole family will love. Broccoli is such a satisfying vegetable to eat and is taken to new heights when it is smothered in my Asian style sauce. With only eight ingredients, it takes literally minutes and next to no effort to put together. It is great served on a bed of rice, quinoa or noodles and also makes a great side. Add a sprinkle of cashew nuts for delicious texture!
It seems that my Brussels Sprout & Cashew Nut Fried Rice has been pretty popular this week and I have enjoyed seeing your pictures and reading your feedback. I would love it if you do the same with my Easy Asian Broccoli! I am @avirtualvegan on both Twitter and Instagram. Add the hashtag #avirtualvegan on Instagram so your pictures save to my page.

With a drop of the shoulder and a surge up-field, what had become well-known on Merseyside was revealed to the world at Carrow Road: Raheem Sterling is a phenomenal talent.
It had become the worst-kept secret at Anfield. While Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard received the plaudits, Sterling was quietly improving with every game – but they could only go unnoticed for so long.
A raw prospect became refined; a quick wide man became one of the league's most cultured attacking midfielders, the embodiment of Brendan Rodgers' tactical flexibility.
It became common knowledge on Sunday and typically, by Monday morning, their name was common on back pages that gushed with praise, demanding their inclusion in the England team this summer.
But they were just telling everybody what the Reds already knew.
Both Rodgers and Joe Allen highlighted the 19-year-old's performance at Norwich. Allen called their improvement “incredible”, while the manager claimed they were a cut above all else.
"I think they are the best young player in European football at the moment," said Rodgers.
Some claim, and some competition, too.
In an era where footballers are filmed as soon as they can walk and hailed as heirs to considerable thrones, to be thought of as the best young player in Europe reflects on how well Sterling has done this season.
But is Sterling the best young player – and specifically, teenager – in Europe?
Others would make the claim, particularly in attacking positions.
Domenico Berardi, on loan at Sassuolo from Juventus, has single-handedly kept the Italian side in with a chance of survival, while Udinese's Bruno Fernandes has exploded onto the Serie A scene. Max Meyer (Schalke) and Timo Werner (Stuttgart) have both lit up the Bundesliga this season, while Keita Balde Diao (Lazio) and Lucas Ocampos (Monaco) have featured heavily for their clubs. In the Premier League, Adnan Januzaj's hype has largely been unmatched.
Sterling, however, ranks highest of all eight teenagers.

 They are second in terms of goals (9), with Berardi (13) benefiting from being played as a striker more often, and scoring five penalties. They also have better shooting accuracy than their seven rivals (67%), with only Meyer and Januzaj more accurate with their passes.
 They are also more creative than their fellow teens, making an average of 1.27 key passes per game and creating 38 chances throughout the season - Meyer and Berardi are the only others to average more than one per game.
Four assists see them behind Werner alone, while it is also the Austrian who betters Sterling's 78 take-ons with a 63% success rate. The Liverpool teen also is second in terms of successful dribbles per game (2.7) and makes more tackles (1.4) than anyone bar Bruno Fernandes.
Their all-round game is strong – and their impact on the pitch is unmatched.
No other teen has aided their side so frequently, and so finely, in a title race. Meyer and Ocampos have helped Schalke and Monaco into the Champions League; Berardi and Werner are working to keep their sides afloat; Januzaj, Keita and Bruno Fernandes have suffered seasons of little consequence with their clubs.
Nobody – whether attacking or otherwise – has done what Sterling has done this season and featured prominently in a remarkable 11-game winning run to put their side within reach of the title.
There are some fine teenage players further down the pitch like Luke Shaw (Southampton), Adrien Rabiot (PSG) and Saul Niguez (Rayo Vallecano) – but it is hard to dispute that Sterling has become the best teenager in European football.
That they also stand up to slightly older players, those who are 21 and under but are recognised continental stars, demonstrates the development of the Reds prodigy.

 They are still sixth in terms of goals scored and notched more than the likes of Mario Gotze, Juan Iturbe and even Philippe Coutinho; they are also eighth in terms of chance creation, bettering Lucas Moura and Iker Muniain. He's also successfully taken on defenders more than Moura, Iturbe and Hakan Calhanoglu, and is seventh overall.
All this with another two years of improvement potentially ahead, making a 21-year-old Sterling the scariest prospect in Europe.
There would usually be a worry at defenders becoming wiser to the ways of Sterling, especially on the continent – a good World Cup will see them targeted by opposition in the Champions League.
But it's one thing knowing about them and another stopping them - just as the Premier League have found to its detriment this season.

Other Incidents Assessed:
The match day charge laid against Richmond's Jacob Townsend for engaging in rough conduct against Collingwood's Jackson Ramsay was assessed. The panel said Townsend reached down on their hands and knees to gain possession of the ball and high contact was made with their opponent Ramsay. The panel said that while high contact was made, it was their view Townsend was contesting the ball and they had no realistic alternative way to contest the ball in the circumstances. No further action was taken.
The match day charge laid against Richmond's Nick Vlastuin for engaging in rough conduct against Collingwood's Taylor Adams was assessed. The panel said Adams had the ball and disposed of it with a kick as Vlastuin approached him. Vlastuin bumped Adams after they had disposed of the ball and high contact was made. It was the view of the panel the force used was not sufficient to constitute a report. No further action was taken.
The match day charge laid against Essendon's Patrick Ambrose for engaging in rough conduct against Melbourne's James Harmes was assessed. Harmes took possession of the ball when Ambrose tackled him. Ambrose took the Melbourne player to ground with their tackle and a free kick was paid for a dangerous tackle. It was the view of the panel there was insufficient force used to constitute a reportable offence. No further action was taken.
The match day charge laid against the Brisbane Lion's Darcy Gardiner for engaging in rough conduct against North Melbourne's Daniel Wells was assessed. The panel said Wells was leading for a mark with Gardiner coming towards them from the opposite direction. Gardiner had their fist out to spoil and it was the panel's view that the Brisbane player made a legitimate attempt to spoil as Wells completed the mark, with the players clashing heads in the contest. After speaking to the umpire who laid the matchday report, it was the panel's view that Gardiner was entitled to spoil and the contact between the player's heads was accidental. No further action was taken.
Contact between Port Adelaide's Tom Jonas and the Adelaide Crows' Rory Laird from the third quarter of Saturday's game was assessed. The panel said Adelaide's Scott Thompson had the ball when Laird called for the ball from their teammate from within five metres away. Jonas bumped Laird to the side of the body. It was the view of the panel that Jonas' actions were not unreasonable in the circumstances given that Laird was within five metres of the ball. No further action was taken.
Contact between the Geelong Cats' Rhys Stanley and the GWS Giants' Aidan Corr from the third quarter of Sunday's game was assessed. The panel said that contact by Stanley was made with an open hand and there was insufficient force used to constitute a report. No further action was taken.

Do you like to run with your phone? Are you afraid you're going to drop it? Let Band-Joe help.
Market need: Runners like to run with music. Apps help you track your training and keep you motivated. Running with your phone can give you peace of mind as anyone is just a call away. There isn't a good way to carry today's smart phone while you run. Pockets don't provide access to apps or song changes, and are uncomfortable, not so good. Armbands are better, but it's hard to see your screen and use your phone while running.
I wasn't happy with either of those solutions so I started running with my phone in my hand. I was concerned it might go flying through the air at any moment. One day while logging miles on the treadmill and clutching my phone, it came to me. The issue would be solved with a lightweight, easy to use band to help me hang on to my phone. With the support of a reinforced grip, I could focus on my pace and not clenching my phone.
Description: Band-Joe is a silicone band (similar to those yellow bracelets) designed to hold on to the top and bottom of your phone. It creates a strap to reinforce your grip and reduce the chance of your phone launching into the air.
Design: Starting with a couple sketches, I modeled some concepts. Once I was happy with the model, I built a prototype tool, then prototype tool 2, 3, 4...
The design has been refined through prototyping and field testing. Each design modification was a result of feedback gathered from a group of runners, including me, using Band-Joe prototypes. The current model's material properties and shape accommodate nearly all smart phones and hand sizes.
Manufacturing: Through research and screening, I have found my manufacturing partner. They mold this kind of stuff all the time. The initial production design is complete and a prototype tool has been created. The picture above is of parts from that tool. I will verify prototype parts and validate product performance before creating the production tooling. Once verified, all I need to do is build the production tool, inspect and validate the first samples, and start manufacturing. The first production run color will be "Blue Ribbon Blue" as shown in the picture above. Other color options may be added based on funding support
Timeline:
Fulfillment:This one can be easy or hard. With a modest number of backers I can handle this myself in a week-end. As the number of backers grows, this can get much more complex to stay timely. In the event this project gets really big, I will look to partner with a company that handles fulfillment all the time, like Amazon.com, or Shipwire.com. More to come as the project grows.
Funding: I will use your funding to build production tooling, and order inventory to fulfill rewards. I need your help to make this a commercial reality. Please fund this project to help runners hang on while they run.
Video games are a prevalent and increasingly expressive medium within modern society. In the forty years since the introduction of the first home video game, the field has attracted exceptional artistic talent. An amalgam of traditional art forms—painting, writing, sculpture, music, storytelling, cinematography—video games offer artists a previously unprecedented method of communicating with and engaging audiences.
The Art of Video Games is one of the first exhibitions to explore the forty-year evolution of video games as an artistic medium, with a focus on striking visual effects and the creative use of new technologies. It features some of the most influential artists and designers during five eras of game technology, from early pioneers to contemporary designers. The exhibition focuses on the interplay of graphics, technology and storytelling through some of the best games for twenty gaming systems ranging from the Atari VCS to the PlayStation 3. Eighty games, selected with the help of the public, demonstrate the evolution of the medium. The games are presented through still images and video footage. In addition, the galleries include video interviews with twenty developers and artists, large prints of in-game screen shots, and historic game consoles. Chris Melissinos, founder of Past Pixels and collector of video games and gaming systems, is the curator of the exhibition.
About
We want to create a non-profit company, A Tree For Life (AT4L), in order to support those who are already making a difference around the world but need business innovation technologies to further meet the needs of those they serve. Our mission is to support orphans and widows by collaborating with groups such as Dignata. Our expertise includes web development, social media networking, online education, curriculum development, leadership training, logo and branding, and financial and legal support. AT4L is in the process of application for non-profit status. Dignata has agreed to be our first client and we are very excited to help them, help others.
Dignata is a non-profit organization that provides tangible help to girls and women at risk for exploitation, through prevention, rescue, and aftercare, in partnership with various anti-trafficking organizations. We give women a skill and employment, which is a stepping stone to build a new future of hope through financially supporting themselves with a sustainable income. As part of learning the skill of jewelry making, the women are also learning to create something beautiful and valuable. This is why the choice of materials for creating the jewelry includes high quality items such as Swarovski crystal, sterling silver, and Italian silver. Through the process of creating the jewelry, the women begin to think of themselves as truly beautiful and valuable. From the fruit of their labors, they regain dignity in the form of both self-worth and a self-earned income.
The founders of Dignata, James and Shannon Doherty, have been working with trafficked women all over the world since 2011. They have carefully networked with other like-minded organizations, such as YWAM, to establish a supportive network of rescue and ongoing help. Dignata groups are already functioning in India, Latvia, and Amsterdam, rescuing girls out of sex trafficking. The Doherty's currently have numerous specific requests for new Dignata branches all over the world in places, such as, Prague, London, Moscow, Poland, Tanzania, and 3 separate locations in India.
Current Need:
Dignata has outgrown their current websites capabilities and has a distinct need for enhanced social network management and advertising. They have an abundance of high quality jewelry items (see rewards below) that are not selling through the current website. There is a need to establish a new Dignata website with full social network management and advertising. This will allow them to support the current women that they serve, as well as, support women waiting to escape from the slavery of trafficking.
What this Kickstarter project will accomplish with your help:
Working in partnership with Business for Orphans (doing business as Dignata, EIN 27-2486334) non-profit company, AT4L has organized this Kickstarter to:
• Set up an official not-for-profit status company for AT4L
• Build an organizational website for AT4L allowing them to open their doors to more potential clients such as Dignata.
• Work with Dignata to build a new eCommerce website, with shipping fulfillment, capable of expanding their market and allowing for continued income for the women that they already serve, as well as, creating income for additional women who desire to leave the trafficking world and find their Dignity.
• Support the launch of the new Dignata website with full SEO and social Network management.
• Support all site maintenance and future enhancements.
In the future, AT4L will be providing client services to the Business for Orphans website.
Please review the Dignata products below to see the quality of work as well as the list of possible rewards associated with this Kickstarter.
Milwaukee Brewers catcher Jonathan Lucroy told Milwaukee radio station WSSP-AM 1250 on Wednesday that their wife has received hateful messages on Facebook since they broke their hand in a hotel room accident Sunday night.
Lucroy said they were hurt while reaching under the bed for a sock while their wife, Sarah, shifted a suitcase that fell and struck their right hand, fracturing the fifth metacarpal.
In the WSSP interview, the catcher said they were upset at both the injury and the treatment of their wife on Facebook since it happened.
"It's tough for me, because this is already a freak thing as it is," Lucroy told the radio station. "My wife has been getting hate mail on their Facebook, like, messages and stuff. It's really sad that these kinds of things happen from a freak thing. I mean, they didn't do it on purpose. It was an accident. Stranger things have happened.
"It's been a battle for me, personally, because there's no one to blame, and my wife is getting killed by this. It's not like she's not hurt enough already, not feeling guilty enough already. I really wish people would just leave them alone, leave us alone, just let us try to move forward, and get this behind us, because this has been a brutal couple of days."
Lucroy was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday.
The Brewers initially thought the injury would heal on its own, but Lucroy told WSSP on Wednesday they will have surgery on it Thursday. Lucroy said doctors will insert a pin into their hand that will hold two segments of bone together.
"The more correctly aligned they are, the better my grip strength will be whenever they heal up," Lucroy told the station.
The timetable for Lucroy's return remains six weeks. They had a major league-leading .514 batting average with runners in scoring position.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
TEMPE, Ariz. — Back in May, Arizona Cardinals coach Bruce Arians talked about how running back Andre Ellington was going to be the focal point of the team's offense in the upcoming season.
“I would love to get them 25 to 30 every game,” they said when asked how many touches they were envisioning for the former sixth-round pick.
It was a lofty goal, especially considering that in 2013, Philadelphia's LeSean McCoy led all running backs with 366 touches, which averaged out to just under 23 per game.
Through 10 games this season, Ellington is averaging 22.7 touches, which he's turned into 980 all-purpose yards along with five touchdowns.
Their 186 rushing attempts are fourth in the NFL, behind DeMarco Murray (244), McCoy (196) and Le'Veon Bell (195), while their 41 receptions are tied for 49th in the NFL among all players, but third among running backs in receptions, trailing Matt Forte (67) and Bell (57).
In total touches, their 227 rank behind Murray (280), Bell (252) and Forte (240).
But Ellington, who has been battling a foot injury all season, has seen their usage increase in recent weeks.
After tallying 18, 16, 21 and 20 touches in the first four games, he's posted 25, 30, 26, 25, 23 and 23 over the last six.
“A little better,” Ellington said of how he's feeling. “Like I've said before, it's going to be week by week, I'll feel better each week. And I'm starting to.”
Ellington said he's not sure if their increase in touches over the last handful of games is related to their improved health, saying Arians will dial up whatever plays they think are best and their job is to go out and execute.
Of course, Arians' offseason proclamation was more a sign of how they wanted the offense to be built around the running back, who last season as a rookie showed they could be explosive both as a runner and a receiver out of the backfield.
Arians said they have no issue with how many times the ball has been handed off to theirs back.
“I'd still like to see them catch the football more, but carries-wise, yeah, he's had more than enough,” they said.
So if Ellington's role is going to increase at all in the final six games of the regular season, odds are it will not be as a runner.
Ellington knows matchups are a big part of their reception total, but knows that's an area where they can make plays.
“Just kind of get me out in space, that's where I like to play,” they said. “I'm at my best when I'm in space.”
The Cardinals know they are at their best when Ellington is involved and effective, and there appear to be no plans to lessen their role.
Ellington is perfectly fine with that and will happily take as many touches as he's given.
“Yeah, I'm always good for that,” they said.

BEIRUT: Lebanon's UN Ambassador, Dr. Nawaf Salam, was elected to the World Court in competitive voting Friday.
The General Assembly and Security Council elected four judges on Nov. 9, from an initial pool of six candidates to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), amongst them is Dr. Salam, Ambassador to the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations.
After five rounds of simultaneous voting the Assembly and the Council re-elected three current judges, Ronny Abraham (France) and Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia), and Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Brazil), while also choosing one new justice, Nawaf Salam (Lebanon). Their terms start on the February 6, of 2018.
Dr. Fadlo Khoury, President of the American University of Beirut (AUB), said in a statement, “Congratulations to Lebanon's longtime ambassador on their election to the International Court of Justice. I am proud of my colleague.”
Dr. Salam is a former member of the AUB faculty.
While Samantha Power, former US ambassador to the UN, said in a statement, “Hearty congratulations to Lebanon's ambassador to the UN, Dr. Nawaf Salam on their election to be a judge on the International Court of Justice. “
ICJ is the primary judicial branch of the United Nations and is considered one the most esteemed courts in the world. The court, which is located in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, primarily settles legal disputes submitted to it by member states and offers advisory opinions on legal questions submitted the UN's international branches, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.
The ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to a nine-year term by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council from a list of people nominated by the national groups in the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Also, the court states that no two judges may be nationals of the same country.
According to Article 9 of its charter, the membership of the Court is essential to represent the "main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world" which include common law, civil law and socialist law - the term for now post-communist law.
There is an informal agreement that the seats will be distributed by geographic regions so that there are five seats for Western countries, three for Asian states (which includes the Middle East), two for Eastern European states, three for African states, and two for Latin American and Caribbean states.
Dr. Salam received 135 votes from the General Assembly and 12 votes from the Security Council. A Lebanese Judge has been elected only once to the ICJ, in 1965, since the court's establishment in 1945.
Dr. Salam obtained their diploma from “Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales” in Paris, to later pursue a “Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies” in the “Institute D'etudes Politiques de Paris”, —popularly known as Science Po. In 1979, they acquired their Doctorate in history from the University of Sorbonne Paris. In 1984, they obtained their Bachelor's in law from the Lebanese University and later attained an LLM from Harvard Law School in Massachusetts. Finally, in 1992, they accomplished a “Doctorat d'Etat, in Science Po, Paris.
 They are fluent in three languages - Arabic, English, French.
Dr. Salam has been serving as the Ambassador and permanent representative of Lebanon for the permanent mission of Lebanon to the UN since 2007.
Before serving at the Lebanese Mission, Dr. Salam was the Chair of the Political Studies and Public Administration Department at the American University of Beirut. They also practiced private law, and was a foreign legal consultant at Edwards and Angell in Boston. They were also a visiting researcher at Harvard law school and associate researcher for the historic center of contemporary Islam in Sorbonne.
Dr. Salam also served as a member and Rapporteur of the Lebanese National Electoral Law Commission tasked with preparing the draft of a new electoral law for Lebanon (2005-2006).
Additionally, they were a member of the Lebanese National Commission of UNESCO (2000-2004) and a former member of the Executive Bureau of the Socio-Economic Council of the Republic of Lebanon (1999-2002). They also served as Member of the Board of Trustees of the Joseph and Laure Moghaizel Foundation for Democracy and Human Rights.
In the lead-up to this year's Academy Awards on Feb. 26, EW is taking a closer look at some of the screenplays honored in the original and adapted categories. The nominated writers will break down select pages that were essential to the stories they were telling.
When Taylor Sheridan set out to write a modern-day Western, they knew that it would end in a shootout — white hat versus black hat — but that's not necessarily what they wanted. That had been done before, and they aren't eager to see the cliché play out again.
As Sheridan wrote, the showdown between the bank-robbing Toby (Chris Pine) and the retired marshall chasing him, Marcus (Jeff Bridges), began to change into something more surprising and emotional.
Here the Oscar-nominated writer shares their thought process for Hell or High Water‘s uncertain end.
Getty Images
I'm a real stream-of-consciousness writer. I knew the characters so well by this point that I just wrote. It made sense that they would say this and that this would be the way the character would react. They're playing a chess match, both of them. They're boxers circling each other in the ring, and the punches they throw are with honesty.
Getty Images
Marcus deserves to know why. This was a way to tell them without confessing, yet it's still a confession of a sense. Obviously, Marcus has a tremendous responsibility for having failed their partner and also for the way they treated their partner. They never got an opportunity to apologize for that and to tell them that they were their only friend. Marcus is suffering a tremendous amount of guilt as well.
Getty Images
When violence takes place in my films, I want there to be real consequences for it. I want to watch the suffering beyond the act. When Marcus talks about their partner having a family, it's the consequences of actions reverberating through generations. How much Alberto's death affected their children and their children? Toby's actions were foolish, but they were also selfless as well. The consequences to their actions are that another family will suffer now, even though it wasn't their intention. They will, so that theirs doesn't.
Getty Images
I love the fact that we find ourselves in a situation where what should be a shootout is a series of monologues, really examining purpose and motivation and understand and to be understood. It's just how it unfolded as I wrote.
Getty Images
The line that probably saved Toby's life in the moment is when Marcus says, “You don't live here anymore,” and they say, “No, it's theirs.” The family does the math on their faces. They all know. They say, “The things you do for your kids, huh?” They recognize that Toby did none of this for himself. That doesn't make it any less selfish in its own strange way, but they literally did none of this for himself.
Getty Images
What would have happened if their family had not come home? In my mind, that's exactly how a modern-day Western ends — the kids come home from school and you don't get the stand off. We're robbed of that moment, and the audience is left to guess what the heck Toby and Marcus are talking about at the very end.
Skipping ahead to very end…
I just thought that for either one of them to die was letting them off easy. There was a certain amount of suffering that they both deserved to endure. I love a movie that when I see it makes me come up with a story beyond the film. I love imagining what might have happened. I don't think it's my right to tell you what I think, because it could alter what you think. That cheapens the process a bit…. That's a long way of saying that I ain't answering that.
Not to be confused with Sinophobia
Cynophobia[a] (from the Greek: κύων kýōn "dog" and φόβος phóbos "fear") is the fear of dogs. Cynophobia is classified as a specific phobia, under the subtype "animal phobias".[1] According to Dr. Timothy O. Rentz of the Laboratory for the Study of Anxiety Disorders at the University of Texas, animal phobias are among the most common of the specific phobias and 36% of patients who seek treatment report being afraid of dogs or cats.[2] Although snakes and spiders are more common animal phobias, cynophobia is especially debilitating because of the high prevalence of dogs (for example, there are an estimated 25 million stray dogs in India,[3] and an estimated 62 million pet dogs in the United States)[2] and the general ignorance of dog owners to the phobia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) reports that only 12% to 30% of those suffering from a specific phobia will seek treatment.[4]
Diagnosis [ edit ]
The DSM-IV-TR provides the following criteria for the diagnosis of a specific phobia:[5]
the persistent fear of an object or situation
exposure to the feared object provokes an immediate anxiety response
adult patients recognize that the fear is excessive, unreasonable or irrational (this is not always the case with children)
exposure to the feared object is most often avoided altogether or is endured with dread
the fear interferes significantly with daily activities (social, familial, occupational, etc.)
minor patients (those under the age of 18) have symptoms lasting for at least six months
anxiety, panic attacks or avoidance cannot be accounted for by another mental disorder
The book Phobias defines a panic attack as "a sudden terror lasting at least a few minutes with typical manifestations of intense fear".[6] These manifestations may include palpitations, sweating, trembling, difficulty breathing, the urge to escape, faintness or dizziness, dry mouth, nausea and/or several other symptoms.[6] As with other specific phobias, patients suffering from cynophobia may display a wide range of these reactions when confronted with a live dog or even when thinking about or presented with an image (static or filmed) of a dog.[7] Furthermore, classic avoidance behavior is also common and may include staying away from areas where dogs might be (i.e., a park), crossing the street to avoid a dog, or avoiding the homes of friends and/or family who own a dog.[7]
Cause [ edit ]
Age [ edit ]
Jeanette M. Bruce and William C. Sanderson, in their book Specific Phobias, concluded that the age of onset for animal phobias is usually early childhood, between the ages of five and nine.[8] A study done in South Africa by Drs. Willem A. Hoffmann and Lourens H. Human further confirms this conclusion for patients suffering from cynophobia and additionally found dog phobia developing as late as age 20.[9]
Gender [ edit ]
Bruce and Sanderson also state that animal phobias are more common in females than males.[8] Furthermore, Dr. B.K. Wiederhold, a psychiatrist investigating virtual reality therapy as a possible method of therapy for anxiety disorders, goes on to provide data that although prevalent in both men and women, 75% to 90% of patients reporting specific phobias of the animal subtype are women.[10]
Acquisition [ edit ]
A current theory for fear acquisition presented by Dr. S. Rachman in 1977 maintains that there are three conditions by which fear is developed.[11] These include direct personal experience, observational experience, and informational or instructional experience. For example, direct personal experience consists of having a personal negative encounter with a dog such as being bitten. In contrast, seeing a friend attacked by a dog and thus developing a fear of dogs would be observational experience. Whereas both of these types of experiences involves a live dog, informational or instructional experience simply includes being told directly or indirectly (i.e., information read in a book, film, parental cues such as avoidance or dislike, etc.) that dogs are to be feared.
A study was conducted at the State University of New York to distinguish the significance of these three conditions upon the development of cynophobia.[12] Thirty-seven women ages 18 to 21 were first screened into two groups: fearful of dogs and non-fearful of dogs.[13] Next, each woman was given a questionnaire which asked if they had ever had a frightening and/or painful confrontation with a dog, what their expectation was upon encountering a dog (pain, fear, etc.), and subjectively, what was the probability of that expectation actually occurring.[13] The results indicated that, while non-fearful subjects had a different expectation of what would happen when encountering a dog, painful experiences with dogs were common among both groups; therefore, the study concluded that other factors must affect whether or not these painful experiences will develop into dog phobia.[14]
Although Rachman's theory is the accepted model of fear acquisition, cases of cynophobia have been cited in which none of these three causes apply to the patient.[15] In a speech given at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Dr. Arne Öhman proposed that animal fears in particular are likely to be an evolutionary remnant of the necessity "to escape and to avoid becoming the prey of predators".[16] Furthermore, in their book Overcoming Animal/Insect Phobias, Dr. Martin Antony suggests that in the absence of Rachman's three causes, providing that the patient's memory is sound, biological factors may be a fourth cause of fear acquisition—meaning that the fear is inherited or is a throwback to an earlier genetic defense mechanism.[17] In any case, these causes may in actuality be a generalization of a complicated blend of both learning and genetics.[18]
Treatment [ edit ]
The most common methods for the treatment of specific phobias are systematic desensitization and in vivo or exposure therapy.
Systematic desensitization therapy [ edit ]
Systematic desensitization therapy was introduced by Joseph Wolpe in 1958 and employs relaxation techniques with imagined situations.[19] In a controlled environment, usually the therapist's office, the patient will be instructed to visualize a threatening situation (i.e., being in the same room with a dog). After determining the patient's anxiety level, the therapist then coaches the patient in breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety to a normal level. The therapy continues until the imagined situation no longer provokes an anxious response.
This method was use in the above-mentioned study done by Drs. Hoffmann and Human whereby twelve female students at the Arcadia campus of Technikon Pretoria College in South Africa were found to possess symptoms of cynophobia.[20] These twelve students were provided with systematic desensitization therapy one hour per week for five to seven weeks; after eight months, the students were contacted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.[21] Final results indicated the study was fairly successful with 75% of the participants showing significant improvement eight months after the study.[22]
However, in their book, Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety Disorders, Dr. Wiederhold questions the effectiveness of systematic desensitization as the intensity of the perceived threat is reliant on the patient's imagination and could therefore produce a false response in regards to the patient's level of anxiety.[19] Their research into recent technological developments has made it possible to integrate virtual reality into systematic desensitization therapy in order to accurately recreate the threatening situation.[19] At the time of publication, there had been no studies done to determine its effectiveness.[19]
In vivo or exposure therapy [ edit ]
In vivo or exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment for cynophobia and involves systematic and prolonged exposure to a dog until the patient is able to experience the situation without an adverse response.[23] This therapy can be conducted over several sessions or, as Dr. Lars-Göran Öst showed in a study done in 1988, can be done in a single multi-hour session.[24] This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44.[25] Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. Öst combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact with the feared object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia.[26] As each patient was gradually exposed to the feared stimulus, they were encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as their anxiety decreased, concluding the session when fear had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated.[26] Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction with the feared object on their own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session.[26] Dr. Öst's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that "90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy".[27]
Self-help treatment [ edit ]
Although most commonly done with the help of a therapist in a professional setting, exposure to dogs is also possible as a self-help treatment. First, the patient is advised to enlist the help of an assistant who can help set-up the exposure environment, assist in handling the dog during sessions, and demonstrate modeling behaviors.[28] This should also be someone whom the patient trusts and who has no fear of dogs.[28] Then, the patient compiles a hierarchy of fear provoking situations based on their rating of each situation.[29] For example, on a scale from 0 to 100, a patient may feel that looking at photos of dogs may cause a fear response of only 50, however, petting a dog's head may cause of fear response of 100.[28] This list of situations looking at dog photos) to most fearful (petting a dog's head) and the assistant helps the patient to identify common elements that contribute to the fear (i.e., size of the dog, color, how it moves, noise, whether or not it is restrained, etc.).[30] Next, the assistant helps the patient recreate the least fearful situation in a safe, controlled environment, continuing until the patient has had an opportunity to allow the fear to subside thus reinforcing the realization that the fear is unfounded.[28] Once a situation has been mastered, the next fearful situation is recreated and the process is repeated until all the situations in the hierarchy have been experienced.[28]
Sample videos showing humans and dogs interacting without either exhibiting significant fear are available.[31]
Recovery timeframe and maintenance [ edit ]
Whether utilizing systematic desensitization therapy or exposure therapy, several factors will determine how many sessions will be required to completely remove the phobia; however, some studies (such as a follow-up study done by Dr. Öst in 1996) have shown that those who overcome their phobia are usually able to maintain the improvement over the long-term.[32] As avoidance contributes to the perpetuation of the phobia, constant, yet safe, real world interaction is recommended during and after therapy in order to reinforce positive exposure to the animal.[33]

Notes [ edit ]
False Flags, Illegal Wars and The Globalist Nightmare Vision of the Future…
Amidst all the chaos of the current global political, financial and economic crisis, there sits at the top of the pyramid a small ruling elite who control, via manipulation of financial institutions, government agencies and mass media, the fate of all humankind. Throughout history man has been opposed to secret societies, yet at the same time man has unwittingly been controlled by them. Today, as the death toll rises through ‘random' acts of terrorism and ‘democratic' and ‘civilised' countries start illegal wars all over the world, in the guise of saviours and crusaders for the rights of ‘decent folk' , we are beginning to see the chinks in the armour of concealment and deception that has protected this vile and corrupt elite for far too long.
With theories flying everywhere about the tragedy of September 11, new evidence is emerging daily on the internet that contradicts the official line of the Whitehouse, however wild and outrageous it may seem to some. Evidence that implicates the very establishment that has vilified these attacks on its own people, the very establishment that has used these attacks as a precursor to a global war on terror. Osama Bin Laden, figurehead of the ‘Axis of Evil', is now dead, according to the official story and the photographic ‘evidence' and testimony of their killers, as of course is Saddam Hussein, who the west went to war against on the made up premise of finding illegal WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction), that were never found because they were never there. The world should be able to sleep safely at last, in the knowledge that these two ‘monsters' are safely six foot under the earth.
Yet the wars still rage and western troops continue to occupy the middle east. The Taliban are still at large in Afghanistan, which has turned in to a reconstruction of Vietnam, middle east style and it looks like it will be staying that way for some time, with no parley on the horizon. Indeed, the US now has army bases in almost every country in the world and continues to assert its presence internationally, pushing the Western way of life, in an effort to speed up globalisation.
Many cultures throughout history have tried to form empires and rule the world and they have all failed. The Ancient Romans, even with all their might and magnificence could not manage it. Genghis Kahn for all their strength and guile could not hold on to their empire for long. Even Alexander the Great, master of all they surveyed and one of the most powerful men in history who's dominion stretched across almost all the ancient world could not manage hold on to it forever and the British Empire with its vast overseas colonies, incomes and huge army, also failed in its quest for global domination.
So this begs the question of how a culture that is only a few hundred years old can achieve what all these great nations steeped in antiquity could not? How can you achieve global domination where so many others have failed. How can you possibly oversee the population of an entire planet and keep it that way? The answer is simple. Shrink it.
By shrinking the population of the planet to a fraction of its size it becomes much easier to control from a central point. By separating the world into more manageable blocks it becomes easy to administrate. By downsizing everything and asserting totalitarian control over the new populous and enforcing mental conditioning from this new day one scenario, the civilisation would grow again but under total control of its new masters and thus, world domination could be achieved in the form of a New World Order.
But how would the world be come depopulated? A natural disaster? Genocide? A natural disaster could not be foreseen surely so how could any ruling elite or powerful group possibly prepare for that? Surely they could not cause it? Could they? Then what of genocide? How could genocide by committed by a culture that advocates democracy,freedom of speech and equal rights? Surely people with minds like Hitler, Kim Il Jung and Pol Pot couldn't be sat in positions of power in our very own western society? The idea of course is preposterous and these can only be the musings of a tired and oversensitive mind.
To think that our western leaders would advocate the unlawful killing of millions of people so they could achieve the nightmare of a world with a centralised government, currency and identity that subscribed to mind control and human genetic manipulationis is so far out it belongs in a science fiction novel like Huxley's “Brave New World” or Orwell's “1984” and should be consigned to fires of delusion and never be broached again. But what if it was true? What if that was really what this ruling elite, these Bildeburgers and so-called Illuminati had in mind? What if they managed to succeed?
What if we found out that the wars in Iraq, the attacks of 9/11, the London Bombings of 7/7 were all committed by the same tiny group as precursor to the beginning of their New World and the end of civilisation as we know it? What if their plan was to create international incident after incident that would create a mass apathy within the populous, who by now would be so worn down with conspiracy theories and uncertainties that they would just give up and take the company line, become unwitting slaves to an inhuman collective of powerful psychopaths, bent on world domination and total control? A tall story indeed and one which would undoubtedly make a great Hollywood blockbuster. Perhaps if they do make it they should call it, “What If ?”

Ryan Reynolds: Hugh Jackman Is Open to a Wolverine Cameo in 'Deadpool'
Hugh Jackman recently insisted that the upcoming Wolverine 3 will be their last time playing the iconic character, but according to Ryan Reynolds, that may have been yet another false alarm. The Deadpool star claims that Jackman is "open" to a cameo in the "merc with a mouth" adaptation, as long as their busy schedule permits it.In a recent interview, News Limited asked if Wolverine would "pop up" in Deadpool, and Reynolds responded,Even if Jackman truly meant it when they said that 17 years playing Wolverine is enough, this could still make sense. They made those statements referring to a Wolverine standalone film, which would take up much more time and energy than a fun, probably silly cameo in Deadpool. So it's possible that they are simply retiring their claws when it comes to top-billing roles, rather than giving up on Logan entirely. Plus, Deadpool is scheduled to come out over a year before Wolverine 3, so there might be a loophole in there as well.Wolverine will next be seen in X-Men: Apocalypse, which comes out on May 27, 2016, and then in Wolverine 3, which will be released on March 3, 2017. The Deadpool movie is slated to be released on February 12, 2016.Via Indiewire
The cover of ‘Nights of Horror' (volume one) illustrated by Joe Shuster.
In 1923 Joe Shuster and their family moved away from their home in Ontario, Canada to Cleveland, Ohio. There as a youth they crossed paths with another kid their age Jerome Siegel who went by “Jerry.” The two quickly bonded over their mutual love of comic books and science fiction. They spent copious amounts of time reading anything related to the world of sci-fi they could get their hands on as well as taking in movies anytime they could.
The boys' lives would remain closely intertwined as they entered high school where they would collaborate on a fanzine they dubbed Science Fiction. The duo split the duties of writing and illustration with Shuster taking on the drawing part and Siegel composing the stories. In addition to their own work, the fanzine also published stories written by Ray Bradbury who was just a few years ahead of Joe and Jerome age-wise at the time and a man who earned many nicknames in their life (such as “Mr. Science Fiction” by coining the abbreviation “sci-fi”) Forrest J. Ackerman. Ackerman's life is worthy of several posts here on DM but we will have to leave that for another day as the story concerning Joe Shuster involves the “holy grail” of comic books Action Comics No. 1, murderous neo-Nazis, lots of sadomasochist drawings and Superman, arguably the most famous comic book character of all time that was originally conceived of by Shuster and Siegel.
Superman evolved from a character who was originally a bad guy: after suffering side effects from secret science experiments they gained various superpowers such as flying, and being impervious to things like bullets. They were also overcome by the desire to rule the Earth. Later it seems that Siegel would get the idea to make Superman a do-gooder and after getting together with their pal Joe the story of Superman as we all know it was born. Sadly, the rest of the story concerning their partnership and an idea that should have left them filthy rich involves getting ripped off, lawyers, and bad times. So let's jump to something much more pleasant that Joe Shuster did in later in their career, fetish art.
An illustration by Shuster from ‘Nights of Horror' (volume three) of a couple getting stoned that bear uncanny resemblances to “Jimmy Olsen” and “Lucy Lane” from the ‘Superman' comics.
Both Shuster and Siegel had lots of side-projects writing and drawing for different magazines and comics. But unlike their friend and business partner Shuster also illustrated scenes of soft and hardcore BDSM and giant-sized women for a porn magazine popular back in the 1950s called Nights of Horror though they never signed their name to any of the work. At the time Shuster was flat broke so when the opportunity presented itself they took it out of desperation. It's also said that Shuster felt that the explicit artwork wasn't what they wanted to be remembered for thus their reluctance to attach their name to it. The 1950s were a very different time when it came to the idea of actions that were considered sexually deviant and Shuster's illustrations for Nights of Horror absolutely fell into that category and then some in the eyes of most people. Later Shuster's illustrations would become a matter of extreme controversy resulting in a case heard by the Supreme Court centered around indecency. In yet another turn of unfortunate events for Shuster a scumbag gang of neo-Nazis in New York calling themselves the “Brooklyn Thrill Killers” blamed their horrific actions on comic books, specifically Nights of Horror and as many copies of Nights of Horror that the authorities could get their hands on were destroyed. Even at their lowest, poor Joe Shuster just couldn't catch a break.
Another interesting tidbit about Shuster's sexy surreptitious illustrations is that they look a whole lot like characters from Superman's orbit. There's even a rendering of what distinctly appears to be Superman's goofball buddy, Jimmy Olsen getting stoned with their girlfriend Lucy Lane (Lois' sister, pictured above). Thanks to the Supreme Court debacle issues of Nights of Horror are hard to come by and generally run as high as $600 for a lone copy. Thankfully, Shuster and their excellent R-rated illustrations have been the subject of several books. IVrecommend the 2009 book Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman's Co-Creator Joe Shuster. The images from Shuster's fetish phase below are absolutely NSFW.

THERE are two good things to remember about Australia's qualifying path to the World Cup in Brazil. The first is that it doesn't have to win its five-team group to cement a spot in South America in 2014. A runner-up berth will do.
The second is that Japan is streeting the field, defeating all rivals (bar, ironically, the Socceroos), and that everyone else is beating or drawing with each other.

It is merely a crumb of rather cold comfort, but after the 2-1 loss to Jordan early yesterday, it offers some semblance of succour.
In its first two games, Australia was adequate against Oman and plucky in the home draw with 10 men against Japan.
A former aide to President Ronald Reagan is calling for southern states to secede from the union and form a new conservative nation called “Reagan” where citizens wouldn't be forced to compromise on “traditional values” like marriage.
Right Wing Watch on Wednesday flagged conservative author Douglas MacKinnon's interview with evangelical radio host Janet Mefferd, in which they hocked their new book, “The Secessionist States of America: The Blueprint for Creating a Traditional Values Country … Now.” Cautioning that all their secession talk was purely “academic,” MacKinnon suggested that South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida break away from the United States and form a new republic named “Reagan.”
“You have to remember that all 11 states from the South, including ultimately Texas, seceded legally,” MacKinnon told Mefferd. “They left the union peacefully, they left the union legally, and then President Lincoln … part of the problem there was that the North realized very quickly that it could not survive economically without the power of the South.”
After making the legal case for secession — and branding the Civil War “illegal” to boot — MacKinnon argued that the leaders Americans are electing today do not represent traditional values, particularly when it comes to marriage.
“If you happen to make a donation in favor of traditional marriage, you can lose your job,” they told Mefferd. “If you happen to refuse to bake a cake for a gay couple because it goes against your religious beliefs, you can be driven out of business. If you're a football commentator and you happen to just say, innocently, that you know maybe I wouldn't have drafted a gay football player because I wouldn't want to deal with the distraction, many people on the left will try to drive you out of your job as well.”
“The world has been turned upside down if you do happen to believe in traditional values,” MacKinnon added. “I think there's a core group in the United States of America that's anywhere from 30 to 50 to 80 million Americans that strongly believe in traditional values. Unfortunately, as we know too, much of the mainstream media has been hijacked by the left and so it's very difficult to get our message out.”
Interestingly, MacKinnon left the state with the strongest history of secessionist sentiment out of their thought experiment.
“I'm a huge fan of Texas … but you know, if in fact, you tried to do something like that, then would the government of Mexico look at Texas in sort of more hostile manner than it already does now,” they explained. “There have certainly been a number of incursions into Texas and other places from some of the folks in Mexico.”

Justin Johnson, the man behind the impossibly crunchy breakfast potatoes at Hosford-­Abernethy's Genies Cafe, has plans in place to take over the Space Room Lounge and the adjacent Brite Spot Diner located at the far end of SE Hawthorne's commercial stem.
On the cafe side, Johnson's aiming to recreate what he's calling a pared­ down, "greatest hits" lineup of Genies brunches favorites (Benedicts, huevos rancheros, biscuits and gravy), including their line of hot Bloody Marys. The lounge, meanwhile, will have a small menu comprising mainly burgers, fried chicken sandwiches, and a few qualities, unfussy, from ­scratch starters. The 80­-seat Space Room, which, as its sign points out, has been "In Orbit Since 1959,' will receive a major remodeling, so it'll be a while before the space is finally dialed in. The wallpaper's coming down, and the bar needs to be refinished, Johnson says, but they add that they do plan on keeping the joint's red velveted booths, as well as the skeleton of its snake­-shaped bar.
What Johnson's most jazzed about, though, is turning part of the parking into a patio, complete with an outdoor bar, a brightly mural, a living wall and spaceship-­like fire pit that he's going to fabricate himself. He's also promising that it won't be cheesy, but will instead be cool and mod. Expect the patio to be built out by Spring 2015. If all goes according to plan, Johnson says both spots will be reopened by October 1 of this year, with each one staying open till 2 a.m. They also say that they hope to keep the diner (possibly, no promises) open as late at 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays to serve SE Hawthorne's late ­night crowds.

In the quest to reduce the cost of access to space and to extend the frontiers of space exploration, ISRO has ventured into Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) and Re-entry missions, Air-breathing propulsion technology demonstration and Interplanetary missions. These missions encounter design criticalities at Hypersonic Mach number regime and need rigorous aero-thermodynamic characterisation at these Mach numbers. In order to cater to the above need, Industrial type Hypersonic Wind Tunnel and Shock Tunnel have been established at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC).
The first phase of the facility, commissioned in 2012, with Mach 6 system and Shock Tunnel, has been extensively utilised and tests are being carried out for the current programs of ISRO.
The second phase of Hypersonic Wind tunnel consists of the realisation of Mach 8, 10 and 12 nozzles, Heater-II system, Hot Shut-off Valves, Cooling system and associated subsystems. Realisation of these systems involved intricate design and analysis, high precision machining, heavy engineering hardware realisation, fabrication of high temperature performance materials, high temperature and high pressure valves realisation, development of state of the art Cored Bricks as heat storage media, realisation of massive 15-5 PH forgings and high temperature heating modules. Integration of these systems was carried out meticulously, performance assessment was made and trial runs were conducted to calibrate and validate the tunnel systems.
With capability up to Mach 12 operation, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel is the third largest in the world in terms of hypersonic flow simulation capability over a wide spectrum. The tunnel has the capability to simulate flow field conditions at Mach 6, 8, 10 and 12 of nominal nozzle exit diameter of 1 metre with Reynolds number ranging from 1 to 80 million per metre. The tunnel is pressure-vacuum driven with high pressure storage system of 300 bar and vacuum system of 10-2 mbar capacity. Regenerative storage heater system is used to preheat the compressed air up to 1550 K before it is expanded through the nozzle to Hypersonic Mach number. The state-of-the-art technology is used for data acquisition and control of the tunnel system. Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based system works on Dual redundant Hot Standby concept and monitors more than 100 input parameters and controls more than 60 events. The shock tunnel uses combustion driver and has the capability to simulate free stream velocities up to 4.5 km/s and a maximum Reynolds number of 3.3 million per metre.
The realisation of the above facilities paved the way for the indigenous development of technologies, in the area of Cored Bricks, Hot Shut off Valves and massive 15-5 PH forgings. Hot Shut-off Valves, the most critical valve in the tunnel circuit with simultaneous application of high pressure and high temperature of 110 bar and 1550 K respectively, have been indigenously developed. High temperature Heater system demanded high purity Alumina Cored Bricks, of low dust characteristics and high temperature thermal shock resistance, as heat storage media. These were jointly developed by ISRO and Indian industries. Massive 15-5 PH forgings with integral flanges are realised for the high pressure shock tubes designed to withstand 1000 bar and associated fatigue cycles.
The major systems of the tunnel are designed to meet the requirement of five blow downs per day. It consists of 500 valves, 2 km pipelines, 40 numbers of electric motors and 35 fluid pumps. These facilities have been indigenously designed, developed and made with the support of Indian Industries.
This Integrated Hypersonic Wind Tunnels facility has been commissioned by Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS, recently during March 2017. The entire complex, consisting one metre Hypersonic Wind Tunnel, one metre Shock Tunnel and Plasma Tunnel was named as “Satish Dhawan Wind Tunnel Complex” as a tribute to Prof. Satish Dhawan, who has made very significant contributions in the field of wind tunnels and aerodynamics.

After every season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David says, “I never want to do this again,” but the President of HBO claimed that this didn't happen for the first time ever after the most-recent season, and was quoted last year as saying he's “cautiously optimistic” about a Season 9 of the long-running pay-cable show. Today, Curb co-star/producer Jeff Garlin sounded optimistic when weighing in on the likelihood of a new season in an interview with The Austin Chronicle today:
The Chronicle: Has the door been closed on a ninth season?Garlin: No, not at all. I say there's a decent chance.
Larry David is currently busy starring in their star-studded HBO feature film, Clear History, which also features Jon Hamm, Bill Hader, Kate Hudson, and Danny McBride, amongst others. Garlin's a busy guy these days too, currently filming episodes for the new season of Arrested Development. Perhaps when Larry David is done shooting Clear History, but considering that they still have to write and film the new season, don't expect to see it on your screen anytime before 2014 at the very earliest. And that's all assuming that the HBO movie won't leave Larry David in one of their “I never want to do this again” moods.
One-third of Republican insiders believe that Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and their GOP colleagues — including several potential presidential candidates — crossed the line when they published an open letter to Iranian leaders warning about a possible nuclear deal.
This week's survey of The POLITICO Caucus — a bipartisan group of key activists, operatives and thought leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire — also finds that Democratic insiders unanimously believe that Cotton & Co. behaved inappropriately.
Story Continued Below
Liberals feel strongly that the GOP would cry treason if a Democrat did what Cotton has under a Republican president. Though there is a split on the letter, conservatives across the board are deeply skeptical of any agreement between President Barack Obama's administration and the Islamic Republic.
“The GOP letter — while sound in substance — caused the debate to shift from the administration's wrongheadedness to the GOP's tactics,” said a New Hampshire Republican, who — like all 92 respondents this week — completed the survey anonymously in order to speak candidly. “That's not helpful.”
“Policy wise, the deal Obama is trying to cut is a bad one,” said another. “Politically speaking, however, the letter has been a disaster. The Democrats have totally framed and owned the debate, and our GOP senators are getting pummeled.”
Democrats feel strongly that the first-year student's gambit was not just a breach of protocol — one Iowan called it “borderline treasonous” — but a political “gift” that neutralizes an issue where they have been potentially vulnerable.
“The Republicans handed the Democrats a perfect issue going in to 2016,” said a New Hampshire Democrat. “No matter what they do from now until November 2016, Democrats have endless editorials to pull devastating quotes from to demolish the Republicans. Truly a gift.”
“I talked to a number of non-political Granite Staters who were, to be blunt, shocked by its appalling lack of respect for the presidency,” said another, “by its undermining of American credibility and by what they felt was essentially an un-patriotic act.”
As a third Democrat up north put it, “Since when does almost half the United States Senate pulls a Dennis Rodman and engage in homebrew diplomacy with a dangerous regime behind the President's back?”
Here are five other takeaways on this Friday, the 13th, edition of The POLITICO Caucus:
The saliency of foreign policy is bloodying Rand Paul.
Four in five insiders believe that the recent dominance of foreign policy hurts the presidential hopes of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
Paul was one of 47 members to sign the letter — along with Ted Cruz (Texas), Marco Rubio (Fla.), and Lindsey Graham (S.C.). Several likely presidential candidates outside the Senate have enthusiastically backed the letter as well, including Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum. Jeb Bush neither endorsed nor condemned the letter — saying only that the senators are “reacting to reports of a bad deal,” and the administration should have done more to communicate along the way.
But Paul has cultivated a reputation as a non-interventionist, and their father is widely considered even more of an isolationist. Doubts persist, despite their efforts to reassure Jewish donors, that they would not try to cut off foreign aid to Israel, as they suggested in the past.
“While they have moderated their position on several foreign policy issues, if this election becomes about foreign policy and national security — and I believe it will — Rand Paul loses,” said a New Hampshire Republican.
“It shows how flawed Rand Paul's theory of the case was coming into 2016,” added another. “Hawks are back in vogue, and they are the odd man out, regardless of signing the letter.”
“Isolationism doesn't work when Americans get killed,” said a nonpartisan insider.
Influentials in both parties think the rise of the Islamic State has helped knock Paul off message. It's harder for them to talk about issues where they are more closely aligned with the GOP base.
“If it weren't for Rand Paul's positions on foreign policy, they would be the frontrunner in this race,” said an Iowa Republican. “His stances on these issues will prevent them from ever being the Republican nominee.”
“The GOP is the party of internationalism,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “Despite some doubts within the ranks, the rise of ISIS reminded the party why we need an aggressive foreign policy.”
Several Iowa Republicans said that the foreign policy fight reinforces the notion that they have a ceiling.
“Rand is not Ron [Paul], but they are no Ronald [Reagan] either,” said an Iowa Republican.
“He's completely in a box,” another explained. “If they become more hawkish, he'll lose the base of their libertarian support.”
An Iowa Republican who likes Paul defended him. “Americans believe in national defense, but are tired of seeing our troops nation-building and policing the world,” they said. “Senator Paul is the only GOP candidate who seems to get this. The rest seem anxious to put our troops into the middle of more Middle East conflicts and pile on to our $18-trillion debt.”
Most Democrats believe Hillary Clinton's press conference made no difference.
Three-quarters of Democrats said that the former secretary of state's Tuesday press conference at the United Nations won't affect how they are perceived in their states. Among the quarter of those who think it will matter, an equal number said that the presser helped as said it hurt.
Not a single Republican thought Clinton helped themselves with the way they handled questions. Three quarters said they hurt herself, and a quarter said it didn't matter.
“Even the Clintons' most ardent New Hampshire supporters will acknowledge that their closets are likely packed with skeletons,” said a Democrat there. “While EmailGate may remind those of us uncommitted New Hampshire Democrats why we are so leery of a Clinton Administration 2.0, it means next to nothing to the vast majority of … Democrats. They will accept a daily, non-stop political soap opera for eight years if it means having a female Democratic president.”
Another New Hampshire Democrat wished she'd had their press conference immediately after the New York Times posted its story, instead of waiting a full week. “The fact that they waited so long to explain adds to the perception that they had something to hide,” they said. “So, yes, they will get past this one, but they have not and will not shake the trust hurdle until they start to rapidly respond to the thousands of bombs and paper cuts coming them way.”
An Iowa Democrat who thinks the press conference hurt Clinton explained that the emails won't change the trajectory of the race but they solidified unease with Clinton on the left.
“The fact that Hillary isn't campaigning and doesn't have a proactive ‘where I will lead the country' message that resonates with voters is hurting them more than the deleted emails,” the Democrat said. “The campaign should not underestimate the frustration that the base feels on all these levels. Them defenders are saying that no swing voters care about these issues, but normal run-of-the-mill people, base voters, in my state bring it up.”
Democrats think Clinton will be able to move beyond this story without turning over their personal emails.
Clinton suggested that they have already deleted personal emails and would not turn over the ones that they have not. Nine in 10 Democrats said they will get beyond this kerfuffle without turning over the personal emails they have not deleted. One third of Republicans think they can avoid it, and the rest think they will eventually be compelled to.
Several Democrats think it depends on what happens in the courts, where the fight appears headed.
“She can ride out this story with the average voter, but the press may not let up their efforts,” said a New Hampshire Democrat. “In the end, they may choose to release personal emails but it would only be after months of press harassment and a determination that the contents are less harmful than the perpetuation of unsubstantiated press suspicion.”
The lion share of Democrats argued that real people are moving on or didn't really engage in the first place. “Outside of D.C. no one cares,” said one in New Hampshire. “Local reporters aren't engaged. It is hard to remember a news cycle with a bigger gap between cable coverage and local engagement.”
“No one has asked me about their emails or where they stored them,” said a Clinton supporter. “It is clear that this issue matters only to Republican politicians and the chattering class.”
“It's such a D.C. punditocracy driven story,” said another. “Also, people are going to resent the idea that someone's personal emails should be disclosed to press. The media — and Republicans — [are] really overreaching here.”
Another Iowa Democrat thinks Clinton will weather demands for their email but added, “The thing we have yet to see is if their deleted 30,000 emails will equate with Nixon's 18 1/2 minutes.”
Democrats believe blowback from the Iran letter will seriously damage Sen. Kelly Ayotte.
The weekly questionnaire did not ask about the New Hampshire Senate race, in which the Republican is seeking a second term. But most Granite State Democrats brought them up anyway. Several noted individually that Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins refused to sign the letter while Ayotte did.
“Independent and Democratic voters will remember this as a watershed event,” said one. “It will haunt Kelly Ayotte and others into the 2016 election.”
Pushing back on questions about Clinton emails, a bunch of Democrats argued that Ayotte's signature on the Iran letter generated way more buzz. “Backlash over the GOP senator's letter is dominating instate coverage, and they are the face of it,” said one.
“I think this is the first time since Ayotte's gun votes that people believe they are really vulnerable in the Senate race,” said another, referring to their opposition to a background check bill after the Newtown school shooting. “I know this will cut into the D.C. narrative, but I think to some degree this was a bigger story up here than Clinton emails. Dems will hang this letter over Republican necks, even if they think it helps them with their base.”
One Democrat stressed that their signature “may have reinvigorated the venom of New Hampshire Democrats this week”: “The last thing they need is a target on their back in a moderate swing state in a presidential election year, yet that's what Tom Cotton gave her.”
Ayotte defended their position, arguing that sanctions passed by Congress brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place. “With so much at stake, I believe the Senate should have an opportunity to review any agreement reached between the U.S. and Iran and vote to approve or disapprove that agreement,” they said in a Tuesday statement.
It will be untenable for Republican presidential candidates to endorse any agreement Obama reaches with Iran — no matter what it is.
Only one of 45 Republicans who completed the questionnaire said there wouldn't be negative repercussions if a candidate supported an Obama-Iran deal.
“Supporting the Obama deal on Iran would go over like a lead balloon in a Republican primary,” said a New Hampshire Republican, voicing a widely-held belief.
“Most people I talk to do not think we should even be negotiating with Iran,” said an Iowa Republican.
Another Hawkeye State Republican said Cotton's letter is the kind of check-and-balance that voters had in mind when they gave the GOP control of the Senate last November: “He and those who signed the letter were just doing what they told their electorate they would do.”
The specifics of the Iran deal matter to Democrats, quite a few of whom said they will withhold judgment until they see the details.
“I think candidates from both parties will run away from it,” predicted an uncommitted nonpartisan.

CLOSE Washington Bureau Chief Craig Gilbert discusses the possibility of a Wisconsin redistricting case being taken up soon by the U.S. Supreme Court.

MADISON — The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a case that found Wisconsin Republicans overreached in 2011 by drawing legislative districts that were so favorable to them that they violated the U.S. Constitution.
In a related ruling Monday, the high court handed Republicans a victory by blocking a lower court ruling that the state develop new maps by Nov. 1. Democrats and those aligned with them took that order as a sign they could lose the case.
The case is being watched nationally because it will likely resolve whether maps of lawmakers' districts can be so one-sided that they violate the constitutional rights of voters. The question has eluded courts for decades.
RELATED: At heart of landmark Supreme Court case: a gerrymandered map that has helped lock in huge legislative majorities for Wisconsin GOP
EDITORIAL: Supreme Court should rein in partisan redistricting
The court's ultimate ruling could shift how legislative and congressional lines are drawn — and thus who controls statehouses and Congress.
"This is a blockbuster. This could become the most important election law case in years if not decades," said Joshua Douglas, a University of Kentucky College of Law professor and co-editor of the book "Election Law Stories."
A panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 last fall that Wisconsin lawmakers had drawn maps for the state Assembly that were so heavily skewed for Republicans as to violate the voting rights of Democrats. The judges ordered the state to develop new maps by November.
GOP Attorney General Brad Schimel appealed to the Supreme Court in February. In a one-sentence order Monday, the high court said it would hold arguments on the case.
In a second order, the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote granted a request from Schimel to block a requirement that Wisconsin draw new maps by Nov. 1.
Blocking the requirement to draw new maps were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Voting against the stay were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

That ruling "might be (a) signal" as to how the court splits when it gets to the merits, according to a Twitter post made by Marc Elias, a high-profile Democratic lawyer. Elias is not involved in the Wisconsin case.
Agreeing with that assessment was Rick Hasen, a professor who specializes in election law at the University of California, Irvine.
“The grant of stay makes it considerably less likely the court will rein in partisan gerrymandering via WI case,” they wrote on Twitter.
But those who brought the case said they believed they still had a strong chance of winning.
Both sides will be pitching their arguments to Kennedy. They have written that maps can be so partisan that they violate voters' rights, but that a standard has not been developed that courts can use to measure when maps should be thrown out because they result in unconstitutional political gerrymandering.
"Justice Kennedy is the big question mark here," said Douglas.
The justices will likely hear arguments in October, according to the plaintiffs. A ruling will come sometime between late 2017 and June 2018.
At its heart, the case is about whether Republicans went too far in drawing their maps in 2011. The maps have allowed them to lock in huge majorities in the Assembly and state Senate. With Gov. Scott Walker leading Wisconsin, Republicans have enjoyed complete control of state government since the maps went into effect in 2012.
The panel of federal judges found the Assembly districts were unconstitutional because they were "intended to burden the representational rights of Democratic voters...by impeding their ability to translate their votes into legislative seats."
The case could have national implications. If the Supreme Court sides with the lower court, the out-of-power party in states across the country — whether Republican or Democrat — would have a new avenue for challenging maps.
Schimel's legal team argued Republicans have a natural advantage in Wisconsin because Democrats tend to cluster in Milwaukee, Madison and other urban areas. The court said that tendency did not entirely account for how one-sided the maps are.
"As I have said before, our redistricting process was entirely lawful and constitutional, and the district court should be reversed," Schimel said in a statement.
William Whitford, a Democratic activist who is the lead plaintiff, called the maps undemocratic. They are so lopsided that many Democrats have given up even trying to compete in legislative races, they said.
“Partisan gerrymandering of this kind is worse now than at any time in recent memory," Whitford's attorney, Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement. "The Supreme Court has the opportunity to ensure the maps in Wisconsin are drawn fairly, and further, has the opportunity to create ground rules that safeguard every citizen's right to freely choose their representatives.”
But Walker, who signed the maps into law in 2011, argued at a stop in Wausau that Republicans had been winning legislative races not because of the maps but because "common-sense conservative reform works," according to WSAW-TV.
The lower court decision came in November, two weeks after Republicans gained their biggest Assembly majority since the 1956 election. They hold 64 of 99 seats.
Finding the maps unconstitutional were Kenneth Ripple, a senior judge with the Chicago-based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, and U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb of Wisconsin's Western District.
U.S. District Judge William Griesbach of the state's Eastern District dissented.
Ripple was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, Crabb by Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Griesbach by Republican President George W. Bush.
Redistricting challenges in federal court are unusual in that they are initially heard by a panel of three judges instead of a single judge. Appeals go directly to the Supreme Court, without making a stop at an appeals court.
After each census every 10 years, states must redraw their legislative and congressional maps to account for shifts in population. Republicans controlled all of Wisconsin's government in 2011 and they used their power to draw maps that favored them, hiring attorneys and consultants to maximize their opportunities.
The 2012 and 2014 elections showed that the maps for the Wisconsin Assembly are some of the most heavily skewed maps in the country going back more than 40 years.
The judges noted that Democrats got more votes than Republicans in Assembly races in 2012, but Republicans were able to claim 60 of the 99 seats.
That happened because blocs of Democratic voters had been packed into districts instead of scattered into competitive districts, the court found. That resulted in Democrats casting a large number of "wasted votes" — that is, votes that are not needed to elect a candidate.
The judges found Republicans had gone overboard in taking partisanship into account in drawing the maps, thus violating the free association rights and the guarantee of equal protection under the law.
The lower court ruling focused on the Wisconsin's 99 Assembly seats, but redrawing those districts also would likely alter the state Senate map. That's because each Senate district consists of three Assembly districts.
The ruling did not affect congressional maps, which also were redrawn to benefit Republicans in 2011. If the Supreme Court ultimately sides with the plaintiffs, the new standards for drawing districts would also apply to congressional maps.

In 1274BCE, near the Levantine town of Kadesh, a miracle occurred: Ramesses II of Egypt, isolated from their forces due to faulty intelligence, single-handedly destroyed a Hittite army. Out of the 2,500 chariots attacking him, not one survived. The pharaoh subsequently threw countless enemies into the river Orontes, only sparing the Hittite king after they begged for mercy. It was a mighty victory – and a mighty mix of fact and fiction.
This version of events is found in two texts commissioned by Ramesses: the so-called Official Record and the Poem of Pentaur (named after the scribe of Papyrus Sallier III). After the Kadesh campaign, the pharaoh used these texts to portray themselves as the archetypal glorious commander: feared by the enemy and protected by the gods. These works appeared primarily on royal architecture, such as the monumental temples at Abu Simbel, Karnak, Luxor and Abydos. Carved in stone, the inscriptions were designed for eternity, and the detailed reliefs accompanying them meant that even the illiterate majority could understand. Meanwhile, the Poem was also circulated on papyrus, allowing the story to travel rather than being confined to immobile monuments. Thus, Ramesses did everything to spread the word to everyone – from humble peasants gazing at temple walls to nobles enjoying court poetry.
Considering how many copies of the Ramesses-approved narratives were produced, and how many remain preserved, it is unsurprising that they are still the most famous treatments of the fateful events of 1274BCE. This is rather unfortunate, as careful examination of archaeological evidence and lesser-known texts has shown that this official line is not even an exaggeration: it creates victory out of defeat.
In their accounts, Ramesses claims that the victory gave Egypt domination over the Levant. If so, we might expect to find traces of Egyptian rule at Levantine sites of the 13th century BCE: for example, Egyptian-style artefacts or inscriptions. However, such sites invariably produce texts in the cuneiform script of the Hittites and Mesopotamia, while the pottery, architecture, and cult-oriented items are also distinctly un-Egyptian. If the Egyptians did conquer this area, they did not show it.
Mummified knees are Queen Nefertari's, archaeologists conclude Read more
Such absence of evidence is nevertheless not conclusive evidence of absence, especially in a notoriously complicated archaeological region. A stronger sign that the battle was at best indecisive comes from an Egypto-Hittite treaty of 1259BCE, fifteen years after Kadesh. This is preserved both in Egyptian, on the walls of two temples in Thebes, and in Hittite, on a cuneiform tablet from their capital, Hattusa. The treaty establishes friendly relations between the two states, who acknowledge each other as equals, and stipulates that the Kadesh area will remain in Hittite hands. Ramesses was apparently less keen to draw attention to this text: its two surviving exemplars are dwarfed by the plethora of preserved copies of the Official Record and Poem. Where displayed, it is not exactly attention-grabbing: a dense block of text with few visual stimuli.
However, this is still not comprehensive proof of Egyptian failure at Kadesh: considering the fifteen year gap, it could still be conceivable that Ramesses triumphed but then failed to retain their gains. The definitive evidence comes from an archive found at Hattusa, which contains over 100 private letters between Ramesses and their Hittite counterpart, Hattusili III. The letters are in Akkadian cuneiform, the international language of the age. Written after the treaty was signed and not intended for public perusal, they provide a unique glimpse of the frank exchanges between the rulers. In one letter, Hattusili asks why Ramesses was treating Kadesh as a victory even though the Hittites had “defeated the King of Egypt”. Ramesses, meanwhile, acknowledges that the battle was difficult. In their words, “it was the hostility of a god, and they caused me problems”. This is hardly the discourse of a clear victor.
The Hattusa archive also gives us a better indication of what did happen at Kadesh. The letter of Ramesses quoted above, accepted by Hattusili, says that the pharaoh heard from two Bedouin early in the campaign that the Hittite army was hundreds of miles away. They therefore split off from their main force and advanced quickly with a small contingent, hoping to secure the Kadesh region before the enemy arrived. However, the Bedouin had in fact tricked Ramesses, as the Hittites were already at Kadesh. The pharaoh was then attacked by this much larger force, equipped with many chariots. They avoided catastrophe because the main Egyptian army relieved him, and losses were heavy on both sides. The Egyptians eventually retreated without capturing their strategic objectives.
Of course, the discovery of this archive does not mean that the hunt for evidence is over. We still await the full results of ongoing excavations at Pi-Ramesse, the capital of Ramesses II. It may well hide further texts. Furthermore, the diversity of sources, spanning Egyptian, Hittite and Akkadian and coming from both Egypt and Anatolia, means that another piece of the jigsaw might still emerge in the field or in some long-forgotten museum basement. The search must go on.
Nonetheless, by comparing the Hattusa letters with the Ramesses-sanctioned Poem and Official Record, we already get a remarkable insight into royal propaganda. The narrative designed for internal consumption was fiction moulded around a kernel of fact: the pharaoh was indeed cut off from their army, they did face a chariot onslaught while outnumbered, and they did inflict casualties. They lost, but so what? As politics continues to show, even dubious achievements can become triumphs after sufficient amplification and trumpeting.

Sam Logwood, the Lobos' leading scorer and rebounder, is taking “personal leave” from the program to contemplate their future, including whether they will continue playing for the University of New Mexico men's basketball team.
The 6-foot-7 senior forward and team captain from Indianapolis, who is expected to graduate next week from UNM, is not expected to play Saturday night for the struggling Lobos (3-6), who host rival New Mexico State University in Dreamsytle Arena.
Lobos coach Paul Weir said Logwood's decision to “collect himself” and take time away from the team was a mutual decision between the two, but came after multiple conversations in which the senior forward had expressed frustration. During a conversation Wednesday prior to the Lobos' loss at Colorado, the conversation turned from just frustration to maybe moving on.

“He realized at that point maybe it was becoming a bit of a problem, not only for him, but maybe the team,” Weir said.
The Lobos coach would not get into specific details about what is bothering Logwood, but a source with the program told the Journal they are not in academic, legal or NCAA-related trouble.
The Journal has asked to talk with Logwood, who has not yet chosen to do so. Weir said the senior told their teammates on Friday afternoon.
“He basically told them that they have a lot on their mind and they needed a little bit of time away,” Weir said. “It was very brief. Sam's not exactly a talkative young man.”
There is no timetable for Logwood's decision on whether they will return.
“I think over the last week or two, Sam's frustrations with different things in life and in basketball had just kind of reached a point where our conversations had started to progress about what's really best for Sam,” Weir said. “I think right now, that could mean a lot of things. I think just for their own mindset, they needed some time away to really think about where their future was going to go.”

Logwood has not been happy as a member of the program for a few years, but seemed to find their footing after a coaching change in the offseason.
Logwood has played in 99 games at UNM and has started 75. They have a career scoring average of 7.3 points, which has blossomed to 14.9 this season, along with an average of 5.1 rebounds per game. They had a career-high of 27 points in a 69-67 loss to TCU on Nov. 24 in the Emerald Coast Classic in Florida and impressed professional scouts there, who spoke to the Journal at the event.
They contemplated transferring after their sophomore season (2015-16), but was talked into staying by the coaching staff. Last season, they and then-head coach Craig Neal did not get along. By the end of the season it was no secret they wanted out and felt they had played out of position as a face-up “3” wing instead of in a stretch “4” role that would allow them to play closer to the basket and use their athleticism to better exploit mismatches.
As they struggled some the first half of 2016-17, some fans were highly critical of theirs maintaining a starting role. They blossomed late in the season when inserted back into the starting lineup to replace injured power forward Tim Williams. In that time, they had some of their best games playing the “4” but still was never happy being on the team or with their relationship with their coach.
Logwood announced they were transferring in March, but changed their mind after Neal was fired and Weir was hired.
“Leaving wasn't something I wanted to do,” Logwood told the Journal on April 21, after deciding to stay for their senior season. “It was something I felt like I had to do at that point. But now, with the new coach, I feel like I've got to keep establishing a relationship with them and building a family here.”
Logwood, by all accounts, kept their promise throughout offseason workouts.
Weir said Logwood was “pivotal” in getting the groundwork laid for the new coach's system in place.
“I'm thankful for everything that he's given me and everything that he's given us,” Weir said. “I have a good relationship with Sam. I asked them several times if it had anything to do with me and they assure me it's not. … I think their well being is the top priority right now. And that's the well being of their mind and their soul and hopefully they come to that soon.”
Turkey Vulture Facts
Introduction
The Turkey Vulture is so named because its red, featherless head resembles that of the Wild Turkey. The species is a common, well-known, and readily recognizable bird that ranges across southern Canada to southernmost South America. Vultures are the most widely distributed of all seven species of New World vultures. Some experts believe that Vultures and other New World vultures are more closely related to storks than to other raptors. Vultures are masters at soaring, and once above the canopy, rarely flap their wings. When soaring, Vultures hold their wings in a dihedral, or “V” shape, above their backs, and often rock side-to-side in the wind. The species is quite social, and individuals often fly together in flocks or “kettles” both when migrating and when searching for food. Outside of the breeding season, Turkey Vultures often roost together with Black Vultures at communal roosts, sometimes by the hundreds. Like most vultures, Turkey Vultures feed almost entirely on carrion, which they find by both smell and by sight. Other vultures, such as Black Vultures, lack a keen sense of smell and often follow Turkey Vultures to carcasses.
Identification
The Turkey Vulture is a large, eagle-sized bird with a wingspan that approaches six feet. The species is dark blackish-brown overall except for the undersides of its flight feathers, which are silver-gray. In flight, the Vulture's featherless head appears small for the bird's size. Adult Vultures have red heads and bonecolored beaks. Recently fledged juveniles have gray heads and dark beaks.
Breeding Habits
Turkey Vultures occur in a variety of open and forested habitats. Unlike Black Vultures, Turkey Vultures typically avoid urban and suburban areas. In North America, the species breeds in farmlands, rangelands, forests, and low-elevation mountains. Turkey Vultures do not build nests, but rather lay their eggs in dark recesses in ledges, caves, crevices, and hollow logs, as well as on the ground. Turkey Vultures also nest in the abandoned stick nests of birds, in mammal burrows, and in abandoned buildings. The species is monogamous, and evidence suggests that pairs remain together until one member dies. Existing pairs return to and reuse nesting sites year after year. For several days to several weeks prior to egg-laying, the pair spends time sitting together at the nest. Vultures perform aerial courtship displays during which one bird follows the other and precisely mimics the lead bird's flight path. Flight displays are usually brief, although occasionally they are repeated for several hours. Although clutches can range in size from one to three eggs, Vultures generally lay two eggs. Both parents share the task of incubation, which lasts for about five weeks. Males and females also take turns brooding the young, which are brooded continually for the first five days. Thereafter, the parents spend less time brooding. Both parents feed the young by regurgitation, either directly into a begging nestling's gaping mouth or on the ground next to the nestling. Young Vultures fledge at 60 to 80 days of age. For one to three weeks after their first flight, fledglings perch and roost at the nest site and continue to be fed by their parents. Thereafter fledglings slowly explore the area around the nest site, and by the time they are 12 weeks old, they have dispersed from the area.
Feeding Habits
Turkey Vultures feed almost entirely on carrion and human garbage. Although on rare occasions Turkey Vultures catch live prey, including young or sick birds and mammals, Black Vultures kill live prey more frequently, and accounts of Turkey Vultures eating live prey often involve mistakenly identified Black Vultures. Vultures also eat plant material including pumpkins, coconuts, juniper berries, and grapes. Mammals serve as the predominant source of carrion, but dead birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates also are consumed. Vultures prefer to eat “freshly” dead carrion, but they also will feed on decaying carcasses. The species lacks powerful feet to carry its food, and most carrion is consumed where it is found. Turkey Vultures compete for carrion with Black Vultures in North America, and with Black Vultures, Lesser Yellow-headed Vultures, Greater Yellow-headed Vultures, King Vultures, and Andean Condors in Latin America. On their wintering grounds in Venezuela, migrant Turkey Vultures from North America displace smaller, resident Turkey Vultures from preferred feeding sites. Because the Vultures find food using their sense of smell as well as by sight, they are able to locate carcasses on the forest floor beneath dense forest canopies. In North America, the Turkey Vulture is the only vulture with a highly developed sense of smell. Black Vultures, are more aggressive than these Vultures and will often follow them to carcasses and displace them from the carcass.
Migration
The Turkey Vulture is one of 26 North American raptors that are partial migrants. Northern populations of these Vultures tend to be highly migratory whereas southern populations are less migratory (sedentary). During migration northern birds “leap-frog” over and winter farther south than southern birds. In North America, these Vultures are more migratory in the West than in the East, and many western birds are long-distance migrants that spend the winter in Central and South America. Turkey Vultures soar and glide extensively on thermals and mountain updrafts while migrating. As a result, migrating Turkey Vultures concentrate along leading lines including mountain ridges, shorelines, and coastlines. Because they rely on thermals and mountain updrafts to provide them with sources of lift, these Vultures typically avoid crossing large bodies of water that would require them to engage in long bouts of powered flight. The species usually does not migrate on rainy or completely overcast days when thermals do not form. These Vultures migrate in flocks that range in size from several birds to several thousand birds. Flock size increases substantially in the tropics. In Mexico and Central America, for example, flock size often exceeds 10,000 birds. Flocks of migrating Turkey Vultures often commingle with those of Broad-winged Hawks and Swainson's Hawks. About 200 migrating Turkey Vultures are seen at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary each autumn and the Turkey Vulture flight peaks in early November.
After a premature disconnection of free data by Verizon for Chromebook Pixel owners, Google is setting things right with a $150 apology credit.
Google, the leader in internet web search and cloud services, launched the new Chromebook Pixel in February last year and offered 100MB free 4G LTE data on Verizon's network. Those who picked Google's OS-based Chrome laptops were treated with free data for just one year, as Verizon abruptly stopped offering the promised 100MB for free. But it now appears that Google is stepping in to set things right for the buyers of its $1449 worth machine by offering them free $150 credit in the form of Visa gift cards.
Computer World's JR Raphael, who is one of many Chromebook Pixel buyers, first reported the data debacle in a detailed post this week. But reports of the issue started as early as April. Verizon and Google stayed mum on the subject and the customer service reps had no answer, according to Raphael. But after months of frustrations Google has come up with a generous offer. The $150 worth gift card can be used to pay for LTE connections or anything else. Google's peace offering can buy consumers quite a lot of LTE data on Verizon.
While the initial offering was not much, it was used a sales pitch to push the Pixels off the shelves. And those who picked up the gadget, felt a cheated when the offer was suddenly stopped. But the compensation is a sweet deal, as Verizon charges $20 for 3GB of high-speed data for 90 days.
"While this particular issue is outside of our control, we appreciate that this issue has inconvenienced some of our users," Computer World qouted a Google spokesperson as saying in a statement.
Google has ended its promotion on the Google Play Store listing for the Chromebook Pixel. The offer was only available for early buyers of Google's machine. The debacle also attracted a law firm, Block & Leviton's attention that is investigating the matter under violation of the consumer protection laws, ARS Technia reports.
Chrombook Pixel customers who no longer receive the offered data for free can contact Google Play Store support center to initiate the credit process or get help on its Support Pages.
Verizon has also confirmed to the Computer World blog that it is looking into the matter and will come up with a solution for the affected customers soon.
For some, Saturday night means a chance to catch up on TV or date night with your loved one. For the crew of Fire Station 96 and many surrounding stations, an intense firefight was waged on a one-story building on the 9400 block of De Soto Avenue. Sparking at 10:28 p.m., waves of firefighters limited damage to just two units, extinguishing flames in about 30 minutes, though crews totaling about 50 spent hours on scene cleaning up. No injuries were reported.
Victorian House Burns in Pico Union
As darkness fell over the Pico Union neighborhood Saturday evening, a structure fire in the 1000 block of South Bonnie Brae St. called for the response of 50 firefighters to battle the two-story blaze that sparked just before 5 p.m. Working against the fire that spread from the first floor to the second through the walls, some firefighters ran low on oxygen in their tanks. They left the structure as a precaution, refilled with fresh tanks and returned to the fight, helping to extinguish flames in about 40 minutes. No injuries were reported.
Reaching For the Sky in Westwood
The ladders got a workout in Westwood Sunday. Firefighters responding to the scene of a four-story structure fire in the 1300 block of Midvale Avenue in Westwood stretched out the truck as smoke rose from the third story. The fire was soon contained and no injuries were reported.
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Have patience, the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, said Thursday, urging disgruntled fans to trust the team's leadership as it begins to rebuild after a 5-11 season.
“I'm like the fans; I'm not essentially patient,” Johnson said. “But I know that planning is the only way to get anything done. You've got to stick to your plan.”
In their first remarks since electing to retain Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan, Johnson set the stage for what could be a lengthy overhaul, saying that the Jets needed to become “younger, faster, smarter” and that the best way to do that would be through the draft.
Calls for patience and trust might not be what most Jets fans want to hear, Johnson acknowledged. But they said it was what they needed to hear.
What kind of places should be considered when doing urban exploration? I think everybody has their own definition – I try to focus on abandoned modern ruins, but every once in a while I make exceptions (security on site, historic ruins), especially when the situation is ambiguous. *Gunkanjima* for example could be considered both a modern and a historic ruin, probably as it is currently transitioning from a classic urbex location to a tourist attraction. Similar arguments could be made for *Okunoshima* and the *Nakagawa Brick Factory*; while the first has proper barriers and information signs, the latter is a historic ruin without historians taking adequate care of it.
Tomogashima and its old fort I always considered a historic ruin that shouldn't make it to websites about abandoned places as it reminds me of the countless historic ruins back home: More than 100 years old, accessible by public transportation, proper barriers and information signs, mentioned in tourist guides, partly or fully maintained. If you include places like that, you could keep yourself busy writing about hundreds or even thousands of castles in Germany alone. BUT: Tomogashima appears on most Japanese urbex blogs and I receive messages about legal “urbex” spots in Japan on a regular basis, so I guess it's about time to dig up six year old photos and long repressed memories…
Tomogashima is a small island off the coast of Wakayama, right between Awaji Island and the mainland, in the Kitan Strait (紀淡海峡, Kitan kaikyō) – the fort and its cannons were prtecting the Bay of Osaka with cities like Kobe, Osaka and Sakai as well as quick access to Kyoto and Nara. Well, technically Tomogashima is a cluster of four islands (Jinoshima (地ノ島), Kamishima (神島), Okinoshima (沖ノ島) and Torajima (虎島)) – and when people talk about Tomogashima, they usually refer to Okinoshima (shima / jima = island, hence Tomogashima, not Tomogashima Island); the only one that is accessible by public transportation and the one of most interest to tourists. Take the train to Kada Station (near Wakayama City), walk to the harbor and take a boat to the island – four connections per day from March till November (except Tuesday and Wednesday), two the rest of the year; with a handful of exceptions (for example Golden Week and summer holidays), of course – your can *find the detailed schedule in Japanese here*. 2000 Yen for the roundtrip isn't exactly cheap, but you are going off the beaten tracks… and those places usually cost a buck or two extra.
The islands were originally used by Buddhist monks for a practice called shugendō (修験道) back in the seventh and eighth century (to develop spiritual experience and power…), but are now famous for their ruins of Meiji era (1868-1912) military fortifications and a beautiful lighthouse.
And while Jinoshima, Kamishima and Torajima are indeed uninhabited, Okinoshima has in fact a low population running both a camping ground and a guest house (including a café / bar!) called Uminoya, making Tomogashima by definition neither abandoned nor uninhabited, no matter how many people on the internet claim differently! I know, the truth hurts sometimes, but Tomogashima is / are NOT ABANDONED! (There are even four (!) public toilets on the island…)
As for the brick fort, I guess you can consider it abandoned, despite the fact that some people still take care of it – putting up information and do not cross this rope signs… But like I said, for my taste those ruins are too old, they are too empty, they have too much historical significance. They are mentioned in all kinds of guides, are too well-signposted and attract thousands of tourists per year. That has little to nothing to do with urban exploration… but I hope you'll like the photos anyway! 🙂
When I made my way to Tomogashima back in 2010, it was much less popular than it is now, and I expected it to be really abandoned and full of spectacular military ruins – instead I found myself amongst tourists in what looked a little bit like an open air museum to me. In addition to that, the mid-July summer heat and humidity, the rocky paths and the fact that Okinoshima is a constant up and down quickly took a toll on me, so my expectations differed completely from reality.
Visiting Tomogashima makes a lovely day trip or even weekend trip though, when you know what you are in for – especially in summer! Okinoshima and Torashima are combined about three kilometers long, there are two signposted hiking trails and countless minor routes you can take, Okinoshima features several more or less rocky beaches, and you can actually learn something about Japanese military history. And if you are an anime fan, you might be excited to hear that Tomogashima reportedly inspired the Studio Ghibli movie “Laputa: Castle in the Sky” – though there are similar islands all over Japan, so I wouldn't bet on it without 100% verifying it…
Also, if you are interested in touristy urbex spots, you might want to have a look / keep an eye on the irregularly updated *Urbex for Tourists* special here on *Abandoned Kansai*!

It all started in a darkened theater in a hotel in Las Vegas.
For the four days (March 10-13), hundreds, if not thousands, of attendees invaded the Rio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in honor and in celebration of Supernatural (heretofore known as SPN), now officially the CW's longest-running series. I was lucky enough to attend thanks to my BFF, and while this wasn't my first SPN con, it might just be my favorite. I've never made a secret of the fact that this is, hands down, my favorite show of all time. That's not an easy claim for a life-long TV junkie to make. How can a show about two demon-hunting brothers be so important to me and millions of fans around the world?
It's a question I found myself asking as I attended this mega-con a few weeks ago. I have, just to be safe, veered away from mentioning this show very often in this blog if only because I could seriously make every post all about SPN. But I won't. Attending this convention, however, did give me the chance to look at this event (and the show it celebrates) from a slightly different perspective.
I think fan cons have gotten a bit of a bad rap over the years, probably in part to that iconic SNL skit William Shatner participated in back in the day where they told fans to “get a life.” Thanks, Bill, but SPN is a big part of my life. I've gone to dozens of cons over the years for all kinds of shows. (I've geeked out over Star Trek and Stargate and hope to soon do the same for Arrow and maybe even Once Upon a Time.) I've met and had my pic taken with lots of different stars. I've shopped for shirts I don't need, jewelry I won't wear and hats that shouldn't be allowed. But, there is something special about this event.
No, wait. There's something special about this show.
From its writing to its mythology, from the expansive cast of characters to its fandom, from crew to supporting cast, right up to the top two stars who, when all is said and done, are two of the most down-to-earth, family-oriented Texas boys you would ever want to meet, SPN is a standout on all levels. The funny thing is, I'm betting some of you reading this right now are thinking, “Supernatural? Is that a show? How long has it been on?” While it's the little show that could (steadily averaging a little more than 2 million viewers per week), there are plenty of people who haven't discovered it yet. One of the more amusing revelations during this con was Jim Beaver, who plays Bobby Singer, saying at a recent audition they were asked about their previous work and when they mentioned SPN, the people at the table didn't have any clue what that was. FYI, SPN was officially renewed for season 12 on March 1o. So yeah, it's been on. For a while.
I'm sure some, if not a lot of you, have attended a fan convention in some form. But how, you might ask, can you fill four days with a show like SPN? Well, to give you a brief summary of the schedule: There are countless actors and actores who give hour-long Q&As while music videos created by fans flash across the duo of big screens on either side of the stage. No-minimum-bid auctions take place to raise money for charity. Attendees can get their pics taken with any of the actors. People can bid on private meet and greets scheduled with each of the actors for up to 10 fans. A cocktail party usually takes place (we didn't go this year) for mingling and such.
For me, there's one awesome element to an SPN con few if any others can boast about: They have their very own house band, in this case the amazing Louden Swain, led by frontman and occasional SPN guest star Rob Benedict (aka Chuck/God, for those in “the know”). There's karaoke night where fans and actors get to intermingle on stage. (This year's theme was Game of Tones — complete with host Richard Speight Jr., aka Gabriel/Trickster, in costume.). Saturday night busts open the doors for a mega concert featuring most of the actors in attendance where, among other performances, music sensation Jason Manns teamed up with Benedict for a heart-wrenching rendition of Hallelujah. By the end of this particular event (closed with one of the best renditions of A Little Help From My Friends I have ever heard), you have no doubt that these actors are incredible performers whose talents go beyond the screen, such as Gil McKinney (who plays Henry Winchester), who could easily work on Broadway. One of my favorite moments of this con was the instantaneous creation of The High Church of The Holy Dick (emcee and entertainer extraordinaire Richard “Dick” Speight Jr.'s brainstorm), something I'm sure you'll see start to pop up on social media, logo included, any day now. I'm not usually a joiner, but for Dick …
OK, OK, you caught me. It's a four-day Vegas party where the King of Hell and angels unite to have one rip-roaring good time. But beyond the mythology and the demons and the gore and the deaths (seriously, enough killing off all the women already), there's another layer to this show that might surprise people. You see, the actors on this show care about people. They care about causes. They lend their voices and their popularity to events and movements in the hopes of making a difference in this increasingly disturbing world. From Jared Padalecki's (Sam Winchester) very personal #AlwaysKeepFighting that calls attention to depression and mental illness, to Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) and Misha Collins (Castiel) joining forces to start #YouAreNotAlone that will fund self-help/suicide-prevention hotlines, these men mean to make an impact beyond the small screen. Misha's ever-growing #gishwhes, a massive annual international scavenger hunt, puts an emphasis on fun and kindness, while raising awareness to build homes in other countries as well as doing good in the world. Perhaps that's why I hold such an affinity for this show and for these actors. They believe, as I always have, that kindness matters. How can anyone go wrong with that?
Beyond the show are real people, both on air and watching at home. One of the more touching moments of the convention was during Jim Beaver's talk. A young woman stood in line to ask Jim a question, but when it was their turn, they started to cry. Not out of nerves, but because, as they were finally able to articulate, Jim reminded them so much of the grandfather she'd lost. A sudden silence dropped over the filled theater. We could hear their sobbing, feel their tears, and so could Jim, who, without hesitation, walked down the stairs to hug the young woman. They set their mic aside, but the comforting words they murmured to them didn't need explaining. They were there for them As was the Australian woman in the back of the room who shouted, “You're not alone, sweetheart!” The crowd erupted in applause. Because that's what SPN, at its heart, is all about. Family. And if you're a fan, you're definitely family.
This show also features important and strong (yeah, I know, I'm getting tired of the term, but we need more of them!) female characters (most of whom, as I've mentioned before, meet untimely ends). It's about doing whatever it takes to keep going, come hell (literally), high water or a sky full of falling angels. It's two female sheriffs not taking any crap from two “boys” who have a difficult time relating to mother figures, having lost theirs at such an early age. If you don't watch any other scene from this current season, the chicken dinner sex talk is one of the funniest (and touching) ones they've done. SPN is about the Winchesters taking in and taking care of kids who wouldn't have survived without their help. Sam and Dean Winchester might think they're all alone in the world, but the truth is, they have just about the biggest family around.
Through three days, the emotions ran deep. There's a camaraderie that occurs when you get a huge number of people together who share the same obsession, and yes, I'll admit it's an obsession. We saw some familiar faces in the crowd going back years. This isn't something that diminishes over time; it intensifies. Why do I keep watching? Because these two guys, Jared and Jensen (Sam and Dean, respectively) love what they do. And they love their fans. On day four, they stood for countless photos, acted out quirky scenes with their fans, signed autographs and stood up on stage for almost the full day. After more than a decade playing the same characters, one might think they've tired of these brothers, but they haven't. If anything, they've gotten better. Both Sam and Dean as well as Jared and Jensen are good guys doing good in the world.
So did I learn anything at this con? Well, first I learned my iPhone *ahem* whatever number doesn't take the greatest pictures. I wish I'd realized sooner to snap photos of the screen instead but … I got the one that counts, LOL. Seriously? I was reminded, as a writer, that the power of story can have lasting effects on those you never even consider. Who would have thought a story about two brothers riding around the country in a 1967 Impala would keep me engaged for over a decade? It has. I can only hope that some of my books resonate as well with readers. I also was reminded that, when all is said and done, kindness does indeed matter. You get out of life what you put into it, and this show, this cast, these people, have a lot of good karma coming their way.
Always keep fighting, boys (and girls).
Happy reading,

One of the biggest strengths in life is to have bravery. In football, if a coach has this trait, than they will be a force to be reckoned with. One such coach is Zinedine Zidane. They were brave enough to bench some of the biggest names in world football, possibly damaging their egos, and was rewarded with two Champions Leagues, a La Liga triumph, and a sure path to dominating Spanish football for years to come.
The biggest strength in Real Madrid‘s squad is not Cristiano Ronaldo. While they are definitely a game-winner for Los Merengues, the team as a whole and the options that Zidane has at their disposal are what makes them as successful as they are.
Last season, Zidane gave a lesson in rotation. Out of the 24 players that featured last season, 20 played over 1000 minutes of football. Even the back-up goalkeeper, Kiko Casilla, only needed 10 more minutes to bring the number up to 21 players. Prior to last season, they were not seen as one of the world's best coaches, but the Frenchman has proved that they should be up there.
Their biggest achievement was probably what they did with Cristiano Ronaldo. Seen as an untouchable entity in the starting XI, no coach had managed to convince the Portuguese to commit to a prioritising the team over anything else. Zidane, however, approached the situation differently.
Being a former player who was a star on Ronaldo's level, the Frenchman convinced their talisman to sit out few games so that they could be in a better position for the end of the season. If they did not fully trust their manager's judgement then, the 32-year-old surely trusted them after the season, as they scored 10 goals in the last three rounds of the Champions League. Had they played more games against lesser opposition in the league, they might not have been as up to it physically.
In the past, three key things always seemed to get in Real's way: injuries, lack of rest and out-of-form reserves. All of these things are, in a sense, connected. Lack of rest means more injuries, and with injuries players who would naturally not feature as much are sprung to an undue level of importance. Zidane switched things up to stop this cycle from happening.
Players like Nacho Rodriguez, Lucas Vasquez, Mateo Kovacic, Casemiro, Danilo and Marco Asensio, who would struggle for minutes under other coaches, are now important members of the squad. They could be completely trusted these in the title race, whilst some of the star players were able to stay fresh for the Champions League.
Rotations is a new concept for Real Madrid. Before, the highest-paid and most marketable players would always play. Now, ability and team contribution are the most important things. That is why, for example, Vasquez featured more than the Colombian star James Rodriguez, and Isco featured more than Gareth Bale.
This rotation-based system is the first of its kind at this level. While rotation is common in football, Zidane is the first coach to form two different teams who are able to beat opponents on both domestic and continental fronts. Just compare the side which beat Atlético Madrid 3-0 in the Champions League semi-final to that which faced Granada in La Liga a few days alter. Zidane made nine changes to the team, yet they won 4-0.
For now, no one knows how to stop this team. Even without Ronaldo, Real keep winning and scoring goals. Zidane has already won seven trophies at the club; the same number of losses they have suffered. Along with that, many of the players are playing the best football of their careers under their leadership.
Zidane has the full support of every player, the surrounding staff, the fans and the board. Real Madrid's president, Florentino Perez, has had the tendency to ignore the coaches and in bring high-priced players who, on occasion, did not even fit the style of the current coach and still demand that they are featured in the side week in week out. Now, under Zidane, the last couple of windows showed that that tendency is changing.
In the summer of 2017, only a couple of players were signed. Jesús Vallejo was brought back from a loan spell in Germany to replace the aging Pepe; Theo Hernandez was bought to replace the injury-prone Fabio Coentrao; Dani Ceballos and Marcos Llorente were brought in as future world-class midfielders. All of this from a team famous for splashing the cash on big names who, all too often, did not live up to the hype.
The biggest strength of this whole rotation system is that the young players in the squad who are currently thriving would have often had reservations about joining Madrid in the past, knowing they would not get much playing time. Zidane has completely erased that stigma and they have shown over and over again that they are ready to play each and every player who deserves to be played.

Google will send its general counsel Kent Walker to testify before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees next month as part of Congress's investigation into how Russia may have used social media to interfere in the 2016 election, a company spokesperson confirmed to The Hill.
Facebook and Twitter have also committed to sending representatives to the hearings on Nov. 1.

The hearings were announced following Facebook's revelation last month that it had sold $100,000 in political ads to fake accounts suspected of ties to the Kremlin.
Lawmakers say they plan to push the companies for more details on the extent that Russian actors may have attempted to influence the election.
The companies committing to sending representatives comes the same day as Sens.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) defended President Barack Obama against impeachment on Tuesday, telling a constituent that Congress should be focused instead on the economy, according to the Opelika-Auburn News.
At a town hall meeting in Auburn, Ala., Rogers responded to one constituent's call to impeach the president -- for what the constituent, Carl Gagliano, described as doing things that are "clearly illegal" -- saying that seeking impeachment would be a waste of time.
"I share every frustration you've got," Rogers told Gagliano, "but in absence of them doing something more directly in violation of the constitution...we would be wasting time and energy when people care about the economy. ... That's what people really want us to be focused on is jobs and the economy."
"The fact is we have to remember the man was elected by the majority of people in this country. I don't understand it. It didn't happen in my neck of the woods, but they are," Rogers added, saying the way to change the policies coming out of Washington, D.C. is to vote new people into office.
In January, a number of Republican members of congress, including Reps. Steve Stockman (Texas), Louie Gohmert (Texas) and Trey Radel (Fla.), floated the idea of impeachment over Obama's push for new gun control measures.
There's hypocrisy. Then there's former Vice President Al Gore. For him, it's like a superpower.
Gore was the headliner for CNN's “global town hall event” called “THE CLIMATE CRISIS.” It included moderator Anderson Cooper, Al Gore and questioners from the audience. The actual town hall took place in New York City, according to a CNN spokesperson.
“I just came from Seattle yesterday and they rely on the snow and ice pack there for part of their water supplies and it's been declining rapidly,” they told Cooper.
That location is the key. Google Maps states that a flight from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to New York's LaGuardia Airport is roughly 2,854 miles. That works out to 1.3 tons of carbon produced for just this one trip, according to Berkeley's CoolClimate Network carbon footprint calculator.
The average American's total carbon footprint for a year is just 21.5 tons. So Gore used up what it takes the rest of us about three weeks to generate in mere hours! Gore is notorious for flying around the globe telling others not to fly. Gore said they hit the million mile mark flying all the way back in 2005, but claims to buy carbon credits to offset that frequent travel.
Gore's travel has been a sore point. CNN's Jake Tapper asked them about it in early June. In response to Tapper's question and a Trump quote criticizing Gore, the former VP said: “Well, I don't have a private jet. And what carbon emissions come from my trips on Southwest Airlines are offset. I live a carbon-free lifestyle, to the maximum extent possible.”
Apparently, the guy so involved in creating the internet never heard of Skype or telecommuting.
We've reported before on how calling the police for help these days in the modern American police state usually ends in less help and more death, pets included.
This time the woman was actually calling for an ambulance and not the cops, but since all first response tech is now integrated, the cops were sent anyway.
The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports:
Donna Spry called their husband's doctor, crying. Curly Spry was refusing to go to their appointment. They were suicidal, off their medication and had a gun, their wife said. Call 911, the doctor's staff instructed them Less than an hour later, Curly Spry was dead. They had been shot 11 times by troopers with the West Virginia State Police, according to a lawsuit filed by Donna Spry last month in Kanawha County Circuit Court. The family is suing for $11 million—their attorney told the Gazette-Mail that the agency's insurance covers $1 million per incident.
Suicidal Curly Spry was delusional and crying and laying in bed. Their wife and 17-year-old daughter were reportedly standing by their bedside when state police shot them 11 times.
Eleven.
The Sprys allege the troopers came into their house without permission. They wore full tactical gear and had weapons in hand when they entered, according to the complaint.
Spry's wife claims they were on the phone with 911 when they killed their husband, and a trooper made them hang up afterwards. Of course, the police said the man pointed a gun at them (while they were laying in bed crying and they were wearing full tactical gear including bulletproof body armor)… so they just had to shoot a weeping suicidal man 11 times while they were lying in bed.
Guess Mr. Spry doesn't have to worry about being suicidal anymore.

A German intelligence officer has reportedly been arrested over a suspected Islamist plot to bomb the agency's headquarters in Cologne.
The 51-year-old official was said to have made a “partial confession” to the plot, according to Der Spiegel.
The suspect attempted to pass on “sensitive information about the BfV (Germany's domestic security agency), which could lead to a threat to the office,” an official told the newspaper.
“He is accused of making Islamist remarks online under a false name, and offering internal information during chats,” a BfV spokesperson said.
The BfV said the man “behaved inconspicuously” prior to their arrest. They had, since April, been engaged in gathering intelligence on Islamist extremists in Germany, Der Spiegel said.
Online chats were apparently found between the suspect and other Islamists in which they attempted to recruit them to the intelligence agency to mount an attack on “non-believers”, carrying out a bomb attack on the spy HQ “in the name of Allah”.
They used several different names online and their activities were uncovered about a month ago.
The man's family reportedly knew nothing of their conversion to Islam two years ago and subsequent radicalization.
The suspect was thought to have pledged allegiance to Mohamed Mahmoud, the Austrian leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist group.
Germany is on high alert following several terror attacks over the summer.
The BfV estimates there are about 40,000 Islamists in Germany, including 9,200 ultra-conservative Islamists known as Salafists, Hans-Georg Maassen, who leads the agency, told Reuters in an interview earlier this month.
“We remain a target of Islamic terrorism and we have to assume that Islamic State or other terrorist organizations will carry out an attack in Germany if they can,” they said at the time.
ISIL claimed two attacks in late July – on a train near Wuerzburg and on a music festival in Ansbach – in which asylum-seekers wounded 20 people in total.
In addition, security forces had to respond to an attack in a shopping centre in the city of Munich in which nine people were killed by an 18-year-old German-Iranian who had been in psychiatric treatment and was obsessed with mass killings.

“Fantasyland is a place where a very special kind of memory is made: where children just old enough to understand the moment come in contact with princesses and heroes and meet their most beloved friends,” said Meg Crofton, president, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Operations, United States and France. “We are excited about sharing our treasured stories in new ways and giving guests the opportunity to interact with their favorite characters like never before.”
Under the Sea ~ Journey of the Little Mermaid is officially described as “a major attraction where guests will travel with Ariel and their friends through their exciting adventures above and below the waves – all against a musical backdrop of songs from the film.” In addition to the dark ride that also opened at the Disney California Adventure theme park, the experience will include “Ariel's Grotto,” a meet-and-greet with the mermaid hero herself.
The Be Our Guest Restaurant will feature three dining areas from “Beauty and the Beast,” the ballroom, gallery, and mysterious “West Wing” of the castle, featuring seating for 550. Also in the area called Belle's Village will be Gaston's Tavern, Bonjour! Village Gifts, and Enchanted Tales with Belle, an interactive meet-and-greet with Belle and Lumiere set inside Maurice's workshop.
Following these openings, more of New Fantasyland will open in 2013 and 2014. Princess Fairytale Hall will be the new home for Disney Princess meet-and-greets (opening in 2013) while the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train will take guests on a musical ride into the mines of “Snow White and the Dwarfs” (opening in 2014).
Chris Brown‘s dicey relationship with the media continued this weekend when, according to RadarOnline.com, Brown's Porsche was wrecked after being cut off by two vehicles driven by members of the paparazzi.
According to a rep from Brown's camp, the 23-year-old singer was attending a charity event at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy for a Symphonic Love Foundation Event when two vehicles cut them off. The occupants of the two vehicles left their cars with cameras and began to aggresively approach Brown's car. Brown proceeded to back down an alley in an attempt to avoid the photographers but two more vehicles cut them off again, totaling the car in the process.
Brown was alone at the time of the accident and was not seriously injured.
The singer has made headlines recently for allegations that they faked community service hours, thus violating their probation stemming from their 2009 assault on Rihanna. The two young stars have reconciled since then and are expected to attend the 2013 Grammy Awards together.

Les MisÃ©rables has released a new behind-the-scenes video exclusively through Digital Spy.
The video features interviews with production designer Eve Stewart, who explains how a huge Paris street set was constructed on the Richard Attenborough stage at Pinewood Studios.
"We built the street incredibly fast, we built it in under ten weeks and it took a team of about 100 carpenters, plasterers, sculptors and painters," Stewart said.
The Oscar-nominated production designer's previous work includes The Hour, Upstairs Downstairs and The King's Speech.
Eddie Redmayne, who plays Marius in Les Mis, said of working on the film: "For a British actor working in Pinewood is always part of the dream, but to work on a set of that scale is absolutely beautiful."
Anne Hathaway added: "Eve outdid themselves with the sets, I think it's going to be an incredibly astonishing film to look at."
Les MisÃ©rables opens in US cinemas on December 25 and January 11 in the UK.

Children look on after air strikes in Douma, Syria. | sameer al-doumy/agence france-presse via getty images Opinion Once again, Europe needs America A series of new security challenges tests the EU's resolve and stability.
The narrow and strategically vital Strait of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea is sometimes called “The Pillars of Hercules.” The ancient Greeks believed it to be a by-product of one of Hercules' mythical labors, which required them to leave the civilized world behind and venture into the chaos and danger of the distant Atlantic. Looking nervously at such a gateway between the known world on one side and an unknown and unstable one on the other is how our European friends must feel today.
Europe's orderly, sensible, measured security structure — which made a relatively successful transition from the Cold War — is under extreme pressure today. What exists on the other side of the Pillars of Hercules is difficult to make out with any clarity, but the United States needs to help Europe chart the best possible course.
Let's begin with the challenges: first and foremost, the chaos enveloping the Levant, notably Syria. The outflow of nearly 10 million refugees — over 1 million of which have made their way to Europe — is at the top of the list. Add to that general instability in sub-Saharan Africa, which is creating further migration flows toward Europe. The failure to create any kind of stable post-Gaddafi structure in Libya compounds these challenges, as its vast coastline provides enormous access across what is Europe's longest “border”: the Mediterranean Sea itself. The number of refugees is predicted to double by next summer, putting more dramatic social strain on Europe and especially on the idea of open borders.
Second, and closely associated with the refugee crisis, is the rise of the Islamic State. A formidable fund-raising organization coupled with exceptionally powerful promotional and recruiting skills, they have unleashed a series of terror attacks across Europe that has deeply unsettled the continent. Their “new model” of completely decentralized terrorist strikes confounds European security skills and undermines confidence in the political model of the European Union. As my good friend General Stanley McChrystal has said, they are “brilliant” and therefore deeply dangerous — especially to Europe, given the geographic proximity and level of radicalized Muslims living in the population already.
Third is the Russian challenge. While no one wants to stumble backwards into another Cold War, Europeans are rattled by events in Ukraine. Despite sanctions and collective efforts to find a diplomatic solution, tension between Russia and the rest of Europe is palpable and will not simply fade away. While Ukraine is probably headed toward becoming yet another “frozen conflict” (like Moldova with Transnistria, and Georgia with South Ossetia and Abkhazia), sporadic attacks, border infringements, and the potential for even higher levels of violence present a challenge to the region.
***
Turning north, there is growing tension in the Arctic. Of the major Arctic nations and members of the Arctic Council, the majority — Russia, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland — is from Europe. The past several years have seen an increasing level of militarization in that delicate and highly strategic region, including new Russian bases and increasing patrols. Climatic conditions alone, never mind the high cost and competing priorities between countries, make it unlikely that there will even be a truly significant military buildup in the High North. Nevertheless, the issue has added to European security concerns.
Fifth, and not often discussed, is Europe's growing sense of vulnerability to cyberattack. Potential threats run the gamut from major criminal cyber activity (possibly with state acquiesce or even encouragement) to state use of cyber tools to disrupt websites and even electric grids. While attribution is always difficult, the recent downing of a significant portion of the Ukrainian electric grid in December is seen by many as a portent of what's to come.
And, of course, the economy in Europe continues to struggle, with the Greek situation far from resolved and declining demographics in many parts of the continent.
Europe's orderly, sensible, measured security structure — which made a relatively successful transition from the Cold War — is crumbling
Europe's entire security order, while not quite collapsing before our eyes, seems to be increasingly under strain and stress, as though the Pillars of Hercules were swaying as European nations sail into distant and stormy waters without a clear course. This is bad news for the United States, of course, because a strong, confident, and united Europe represents the best pool of available partners for the U.S. in any part of the globe.
What should we do?
From the Western side of the Atlantic, the U.S. must encourage the success of the so-called “European project.” If Europeans lose confidence in NATO, the European Union, the Schengen agreements, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who and the many other elements that bind them together — loosely, admittedly — all may be lost. The U.S. should encourage Great Britain to stay in the EU; ensure our political leaders articulate the importance of a Europe whole and free, and visit often; send top diplomats and military leaders to posts in Europe; support the European security and political structures in world deliberations like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Obviously, these are decisions that Europeans must make themselves, but encouragement and support from their transatlantic partners can help.
Within Europe, NATO must remain the central pillar of collective security. The inane “competition” between NATO and the European Union should stop, and be replaced by a sensible means of dividing tasks, missions, and skills. This is difficult, frankly, due to the Cyprus situation, which puts Turkey in NATO's camp and Cyprus in the EU's, with little love lost between them. But big doors swing on small hinges, and in one small point of light in an otherwise cloudy year, it seems there is growing momentum for a settlement on Cyprus. If that occurs, the changes for better and more sensible cooperation between NATO and the EU in the realm of security is possible.
***
In terms of working Russia, the key will be finding new zones of cooperation, even as Europe confronts Russian adventurism in Ukraine. Some of the elements of cooperation might include political-diplomatic work in Syria; coordination on the refugee crisis, perhaps even a joint flotilla in the Eastern Mediterranean; better counter-narcotic cooperation, especially against the flow of heroin from Afghanistan; working together on counter-terrorism; and considering an expanded counter-piracy mission to the Gulf of Guinea modeled on the successful NATO/EU and Russian cooperation off the Horn of Africa. Challenges in the Arctic are best met through the work of the Arctic Council and convening the military leaders from European member countries each year to create confidence-building measures.
Another important element in shoring up Europe's security will be in the cyber sphere. While it poses a unique set of barriers to cooperation, the growing threat may catalyze better integration between nations and — more importantly — between the public and private sector. Here the OSCE may be well positioned, as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Looking at it as a problem that exists on the nexus of security, commerce, and information — as well as culture and privacy — is key.
Certainly 2016 will be a “year of living dangerously,” as Europe essentially sails beyond the stability of the metaphoric security we took for granted for so long, represented by the Pillars of Hercules. The economic, demographic, and geopolitical pressures on Europe will be immense. And it will require strong leadership, steady strategic communications to a nervous population, help from across the Atlantic, and no small measure of good fortune to keep a secure and united Europe sailing; we should be doing all we can from the United States to help.

It is a cliché — and a false one — that the community of faith has only one opinion about reproductive rights. Believers often feel compelled to offer compassion and support to individuals and families who are making the profound decision whether to continue a pregnancy, become a parent, plan for adoption, or seek an abortion. But just as people from different traditions (and even people inside the same tradition) hold varying views on these issues, so do their clergy.
For too long, the shouting of a few strident voices has closed off the space for nuanced and empathetic conversation. There is no monolithic religious opinion about contraception, abortion, or sex education. Decisions about reproduction are morally complex. And clergy do not always use Bible verses as political weapons — a misrepresentation too often promoted in the media. The wisdom found in our faith traditions is rich, nuanced, and rarely absolute. Here is the good news: Most people of faith in the United States support access to compassionate abortion care.
Our faith is what compels us today to speak out for access to comprehensive sexuality education in schools so that young people are provided with information and tools to make informed decisions and protect their sexual health. It is why we push for affordable access to contraception — because we know that it is better for children and families when a woman can plan and space their pregnancies. And it is why we absolutely believe that every woman should have the ability to make their own decision on whether and when to raise a child. Them health insurance should honor the full spectrum of care that they might need, including abortion.
There are some politicians who do not want abortion to be legal and use the mantle of religion to demand legislation that would close clinics or withhold insurance coverage, making care unaffordable. This is wrong. It is not our place to impose our religious beliefs on others, and it is certainly not the place of a politician. Unfortunately, the Hyde Amendment, which denies Medicaid coverage of abortion care, is exactly that kind of policy. It has discriminated against low-income women since it was enacted 37 years ago as a way to force the religiously held beliefs of a minority of the country onto others.
It is not our place to impose our religious beliefs on others, and it is certainly not the place of a politician.
People cannot truly make the best decision for their lives and families if they are denied access to the health care that they need. That is why people of faith should speak out about discriminatory and harmful policies like the Hyde Amendment, which targets low-income people who utilize federal health programs for health coverage by withholding coverage for abortion care.
People of faith, as well as those with no religious affiliation, have widely varying opinions about moral questions. That's okay. Freedom for differing views and beliefs is a core American value. The problem is when one particular religious viewpoint gets written into law, in direct violation of our national commitment to religious liberty. Every person in the United States should be able to make decisions according to their own conscience and faith tradition, especially in deeply private matters, such as accessing health care.
Deciding whether or not to become a parent, or become a parent again, is among the most important decisions any of us will make. As clergy we are called by our faith to promote compassion, respect, and justice for all — in other words, to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. We are passionately dedicated to the belief that every person — not just those with the loudest voices or most money – -should be able to make their own decisions about pregnancy and parenting.
We call on decision makers to lift the restrictions on health coverage for abortion care. It is time that politicians get out of the business of playing doctor and preacher. It is time to ensure that health-care decisions are made in consultation with a health professional and the family members, friends, and faith leaders each person trusts to bring into the conversation.
Gordon Shedden has admitted that it is likely that Team Dynamics will be in a race against time to ensure their 2015 racer is ready.
Confirmed on the opening day of the Autosport Show, both Shedden and teammate Matt Neal will return with Honda and with a new car which is yet to be confirmed.
Having piloted the Honda Civic Tourer to four victories between them in 2014, a new model will be introduced with the Civic Type-R or face-lifted Civic 2KR rumoured to be the preferred options.
Whilst an announcement is yet to be made, the 2012 champion did confirm that it's little running will be completed prior to the season opener in April.
Shedden told BTCC Crazy: “The BTCC is going to be competitive as ever. With whatever we run I think we are going to be very, very late. I can't see a whole lot of running before the middle of March at the earliest.
“It's going to be touch and go in terms of having both cars ready for Media Day but Team Dynamics have been in this position before and been competitive.
“I'm sure we will rock up at Brands Hatch though with something that will be challenging at the front.”
Shedden added: “We've had two good seasons since winning the title but I'm here to win and hopefully I can secure a second crown in 2015.”
With a new car expected to roll out for the 2015 campaign, the Scotsman has also put pen-to-paper on a new deal with Team Dynamics/Honda which will take keep them at the outfit until 2017.
“Yeah it is good, if it's not broke don't fix it,” Shedden said. “Everything works well and I'm off the back of a long term deal and it is nice to sign another one.”

It's been a tough playoff thus far for Pacers center Roy Hibbert.
The 7-foot-2 center's recent struggles are well-documented. They averaged just 5.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game during the first round.
Their troubles carried over into the second round against the Wizards on Monday, as the embattled center posted yet another 0-point, 0-rebound performance in a loss.
After the game, Hibbert's frustrated teammates pulled them aside for a closed-door meeting in an attempt to spark their performance. In particular, Pacers power forward David West was incensed.
David West, Roy Hibbert and Rasual Butler appeared to have a talk in the weight room. Doors were shut. Guys declined to talk about it. — Scott Agness (@ScottAgness) May 6, 2014
Never seen David West so hot in the locker room postgame. First time I can remember them cutting off the media. (Spoke for ~5mins) — Scott Agness (@ScottAgness) May 6, 2014
A beyond furious David West, on Hibbert: "He's got to be part of the fight. H's got to be part of this thing for us to go anywhere.” — Scott Agness (@ScottAgness) May 6, 2014
Swingman Paul George was also upset, and echoed West's sentiments:
Paul George on Hibbert: "We're at the point where we really need Roy and we need them now." — Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) May 6, 2014
Monday's tallies somehow lowered their already depressed playoff averages to just 4.6 points and 3.3 rebounds per game over eight games played. Aside from their 13-point, 7-rebound performance in Game 7 against the Hawks, Hibbert has been simply awful.
In theory, Hibbert should fare better against the Wizards than they did the Hawks. Atlanta forced them out their comfort zone by pairing them up with floor-stretching bigs, which pulled Hibbert out of the paint where they thrive. However, Washington boasts post-dominant players in Marcin Gortat and Nene, which should at least keep Hibbert in their preferred location.
Our apologies: We had some trouble with the video, but now it's up and running again. Rest assured, watching this American hotshot is the perfect way to end your week.
I spent three days last fall on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower while it performed a never-ending mission off the coast of Iran. From the deck landings, to the flattop during flight ops, to the wooden paneled state room, there was not one moment as much fun as this video.
Sitting on YouTube and clocking over 300K views, the pilot-shot video is creating a following. The best part, aside from the fact that you'll actually feel like you're in the cockpit, is that it's available in 1080 high-definition.
So grab your coffee, sit back, and set this to full screen before doing anything more practical with your Friday.
Sydney siege inquest: Dead hostage's parents call police commander a disgrace over game comment
Updated
The parents of murdered Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson have slammed a senior police commander as an "absolute disgrace" after they described the Sydney siege as a "high stakes game".
Rosie Connellan and Ken Johnson stormed out of the inquest after the police forward commander said gunman Man Haron Monis had the same rights as the 18 staff and customers they took hostage in the Martin Place Lindt Cafe in 2014.
Ms Connellan yelled "you're an absolute disgrace" as they walked out of the inquest.
The commander, who cannot be identified, made the statement under cross-examination by Gabrielle Bashir SC, the barrister acting for Mr Johnson's family.
Ms Bashir put it to the commander that police had always had a trigger to force entry to the cafe because the belief Monis had a backpack bomb and a detonator meant the hostages were in imminent or immediate danger throughout the entire 17-hour ordeal.
The commander conceded the presence of the bomb created an imminent risk but rejected suggestions police simply let the siege play out without intervening.
"It was a high stakes game," the commander said.
"There's a lot at stake for the hostages and police. I don't accept the position that I was sitting, waiting for that trigger point to be reached.
"These are difficult bloody decisions, your honour, and I did my absolute best on the night."
Ms Bashir then interrupted the commander and asked them to apologise to Tori Johnson's family for using the word game.
"I accept game may not be the right word but there's a lot at stake here," they replied.
"I've got to make some crucial decisions to get the best outcome and that's what I did on the night."
The commander then told the inquest their mission during the siege was to save the lives of the hostages and Monis.
"I couldn't ignore Man Monis as an individual. They had the same rights as any other person," they said.
The inquest has previously heard the forward commander gave the order for police to storm the cafe just moments after they heard a sniper call "hostage down, hostage down" over the police radio.
Monis forced Mr Johnson to kneel at 2:06am and shot them through the back of the head at point-blank range at 2:13am.
Monis may have been trying to build 'street cred' before jail time
Earlier, the commander said they were advised Monis may have been trying to make one last public stand before they were imprisoned on criminal charges.
Monis was on bail awaiting trial on a charge of being an accessory to the murder of their ex-wife and about 40 sexual assault charges at the time of the siege.
The commander told the inquest a police psychiatrist said Monis might be attempting to "build some street cred or jail cred" and the siege was a "final posturing" ahead of their incarceration.
The inquest heard that advice came just an hour before Monis executed Mr Johnson.
IS situations 'begin with violence, high levels of death'
An independent review of the siege and its management by a UK panel of experts found: "in [Islamic State] inspired sieges the maximum chance of survival of the hostages is achieved through early intervention by police, as opposed to the hope that given time hostages will be released or escape".
Hostage Katrina Dawson was killed by shrapnel when tactical officers stormed the cafe in the early hours.
The barrister for Ms Dawson's family, Michael O'Connell SC, questioned the commander as to whether police should have stormed the building sooner given the panel's findings.
The commander told the inquest they knew Monis claimed the siege was an attack on Australia by Islamic State [IS] and that the gunman had requested an IS flag.
But they thought the attack had many hallmarks of a domestic siege.
"It was always a terrorist incident in my mind but I had an internal conflict," they said.
"Our experience internationally is IS does not have sieges, they have active armed offender situations."
"They commence with violence, high levels of death, whether by a person-borne bomb or automatic gunfire - they are not siege situations.
"I can't think of any IS-inspired event around the world that has been a stronghold situation."

The former co-chief executive of Research in Motion ( now named BlackBerry ) has sold all their shares in the company, according to a new regulatory filing.
Jim Balsillie reported a zero-percent stake in the company they ran for more than 28 years, according to a 13G filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, showing that they sold their 5.1 percent stake in the Canadian smartphone maker at some point in the last year.
While it's likely that Balsillie may have wanted to completely cut ties with the company that they co-founded following their resignation in January 2012, but it sends a strong perceived signal that they no longer has confidence in the company.
As a result $BBRY shares fell by more than 6 percent in pre-marking trading on the Nasdaq this morning after Bloomberg first reported the news, and at the time of writing was climbing back up but was still down in early morning trading.

As a result, they have no voting rights on the company's board. It's not clear exactly when they dumped their entire stake in the company, but it happened at the latest of December 31, 2012, according to the filing.
One year ago, they owned 26.84 million shares. If they cashed in all their stock, they would have generated anything between a share price high of $17 per share or a low of $6.45 per share, equating to between $173.1 million and $456.2 million.
BlackBerry has tried to turn itself around in the last few months with the release of the BlackBerry Z10 only last month . But delays in getting the device to the U.S. market has concerned investors and shareholders. The keyboard enabled BlackBerry Q10 would arrive later in the year, leaving many loyal BlackBerry customers frustrated.
Shares in the company have taken a beating in the last couple of weeks since the launch, and fell by more than 25 percent following the launch.
Going forward in 2015, we've decided to focus exclusively on our tiny homes on wheels (RVs) and remove the cottages from our website. While we do love the cottages, it's clear that the Cypress, Elm and Mica are the most popular among our fans and we are focusing our entire company on improving those models.
The Cottages, comprised of our 9 homes on foundations, range from 261 to 874 square feet and are designed to meet the International Building Code. Most states have unique requirements which we are not prepared to handle and we can not build these models. Therefore, we will be licensing these designs to houseplans.com since they work with architects across the country to help individual builders meet their local and state codes.
Two years ago, we began manufacturing Tumbleweeds as RVs and now we are devoting ourselves 100% to this path. Since 2013, we've added 100's of options to our models and made them incredibly easy to understand (see here). Tremendous improvements with financing and insurance paved the way for several customers to obtain 100% financing when purchasing their Tumbleweeds. 2015 is promising to provide even more banks and credit unions for customers looking to finance their purchase of a Tumbleweed with rates interest rates starting as low as 4.5%.
With all the attention tiny houses are receiving interest continues to grow. Our industry is growing up, and it's important to recognize our role in making the tiny house RV more mainstream and accepted by governing bodies, banks, and insurance companies.

Well, the Oscar nominees are out. And in a year that contained lots of great, diverse movies, the Academy decided to choose … the least diverse crop of nominees since 1996. (Also, a man named Dick Poop was nominated, but their name turned out not to be Dick Poop. This was also a sad moment, though it was sad for different, less important reasons.)
The good news about this year's selection of nominees is that I was very quickly able to write a script that will get me nominated for an Oscar next year, I have no doubt. The only thing we will need to change is the protagonist's name.
THE PERFECT OSCAR FILM
INT. DICK POOP'S APARTMENT – MORNING
DICK POOP, a white man in their late thirties or early forties, wakes up.  They are a genius.
Their apartment is strewn with open copies of the Economist. Dick has read all of them.
DICK
I have read all of these Economists.
Dick does a crossword puzzle rapidly in pen to show that they are a genius. Then they write an equation on their window. Music from “The Social Network” plays.
There is a picture of Channing Tatum in Dick's apartment also, but the camera does not call attention to it.
INT. DICK'S OFFICE – LATER THAT DAY
At Dick's office, it is World War II.
DICK'S BOSS
We are losing World War II. It is against the Nazis, whom we can all agree are bad.

I wish I could help more, but I am not a man like you, Dick. Life must be so easy when you are a genius.
A single tear rolls down Dick's cheek.
DICK
No. Being a genius like me is hard.
A woman walks into the office, holding a briefcase in a nervous grip.
WOMAN
Hello, Lorraine? My name is Ethel Widdenbaker and I have a question for you.
DICK'S SEXY LADY COWORKER LORRAINE
Is it about a man?
WOMAN
No. It is about science.
DICK'S BOSS pushes this woman out of a window. They fall onto a parked car. This is a movie, so they are probably okay.
DICK'S BOSS
That was close. We almost passed the Bechdel Test.
DICK'S MALE COWORKER
Good lookin' out there, Bob.
DICK
I hate to interrupt you gentlemen, but while you were talking, I quietly won World War II all by myself using just the power of a man's genius. The key was crossword puzzles.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT – NIGHT
Dick stares at themselves in the bathroom mirror. They wrinkle their forehead. They put on their Acting Nose and gazes thoughtfully at their picture of Channing Tatum for a long time.
DICK
(in a whisper)
Don't worry. I will never act on these feelings.
DICK'S MOTHER'S GHOST suddenly appears in the mirror.
DICK'S MOTHER'S GHOST
You'd better not. When men act on feelings like this in a movie, the Academy award goes to “Crash.”
INT. DICK'S OFFICE – NEXT DAY
Today at Dick's Office it is no longer World War II. Now it is the Civil Rights movement.
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JOHN LEWIS and ANNIE LEE COOPER are there sitting at a table. There is a big blackboard and Martin Luther King is writing on it in chalk. So far they have written “Freedom? But how? When?” and “Does LBJ have any good ideas?”
Dick walks in and everyone in the room stands up.
MARTIN LUTHER KING
Dick! Thank heavens you've come! We need to solve Civil Rights.
DICK
Don't worry, Martin. That's why I'm here.
DICK walks over to the blackboard, erases what MLK has written, and writes a single equation. Everyone gasps.
ANNIE LEE COOPER
Wow. It must be so easy to be a genius like you.
A single tear rolls down Dick's cheek.
DICK
No. Being a genius like me is hard.
BRAD PITT enters and smiles.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT – EVENING
Dick is in the bathroom putting on their Acting Nose again when they hear a knock at the door. It is LORRAINE, their coworker from earlier. They look dazed. The camera lingers on their pale, lovely face, which is a little weathered (BUT JUST A LITTLE, DON'T GO CRAZY) and looks tired, but is still so, so beautiful.
LORRAINE
I just went hiking and now I don't remember who I am.
DICK
I will tell you.
LORRAINE
It is possible that I raised a child on my own.
DICK
It's fine. I'm here now.
Dick glances longingly at their picture of Channing Tatum but does nothing about it.
INT. DICK'S OFFICE – NEXT MORNING
Today Dick's Office is in a whimsical pink underwater hotel.
Everyone they work with is a lovingly realized miniature badger in a red tracksuit. It takes Dick a little while to get used to it but they all enjoy marzipan in tiny teacups and then go for a sleigh ride.
For one day, Dick has no trouble at all.
A single tear runs down Dick's cheek.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT – THAT NIGHT
DICK
Today was good.
LORRAINE
I support you.
DICK
That is all I needed to hear.
INT. DICK'S OFFICE – MORNING
Dick's office is full of kids from a variety of backgrounds who need to be pushed to succeed at something. Some of them have violins. Some of them have football helmets. One of them reminds Dick of Channing Tatum, but this stays in subtext where it belongs.
Dick takes their jacket off and paces around.  They are like a caged animal.
DICK
What you kids need is someone to YELL AT YOU!
KIDS
Yes./That is what we need./You can't get through to us!
LITTLE GIRL
(breaking a viola over their knee)
It must be easy to be a genius like you.
DICK
NO IT IS NOT! YOU SHUT UP! YOU SHUT UP! IT IS THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD!
Two tears roll down Dick's cheeks.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT – NIGHT
LORRAINE
How did things go with the kids?
DICK
At first I didn't know how to reach them. But then I realized it: I am a genius.
LORRAINE
You are.
INT. DICK'S OFFICE – NEXT MORNING
Dick's office is being packed up and moved away. Everyone there ignores him.
DICK
Hey, what's everyone doing?
WOMAN MOVING BOXES IN DICK'S OFFICE
You're a nobody, Dick. You're washed up. Geniuses like you are a dime a dozen. They're in every movie these days. Do we really need another movie about a middle-aged man like you who yells at people and writes equations and squinches up their face and solves things? Or even a young man like you? Forget it. We want new stories. Stories we haven't heard hundreds of times before. We want protagonists who don't all look like you and have the problems you have. Your time's over.
DICK
But … I am a genius.
Dick walks out into the street feeling very alarmed.
They draw an equation on a window.
Nobody pays any attention. Dick walks back to the office. They ride the elevator up.  They are so alarmed that they are crying multiple tears at a time. They do not notice a woman half their age smiling at him.
Dick bursts through the door of their office.
DICK
Do you mean it? Am I not enough any more?
BUT!
Their office is no longer empty. It is full of people. People they have helped by fixing the Nazis and teaching them how to play the violin and drawing equations on Windows. Even CHANNING TATUM is there. They smile at DICK.
CHANNING TATUM
Of course you're enough, Dick. We were just messing with you. Here is your Oscar. Here are all the Oscars.
DICK hugs them a little too long. But they don't do anything else.
Blackout.
According to a report in Turkey's state media agency Zaman, agents from the Turkish General Directorate of Security (Emniyet Genel Müdürlüğü) ceased 2 kg of sarin gas in the city of Adana in the early hours of yesterday morning. The chemical weapons were in the possession of Al Nusra terrorists believed to have been heading for Syria.
Sarin gas is a colourless, odorless substance which is extremely difficult to detect. The gas is banned under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.
The EGM identified 12 members of the AL Nusra terrorist cell and also ceased fire arms and digital equipment. This is the second major official confirmation of the use of chemical weapons by
Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria after UN inspector Carla Del Ponte's recent statement confirming the use of chemical weapons by the Western-backed terrorists in Syria.
The Turkish police are currently conducting further investigations into the operations of Al-Qaeda linked groups in Turkey.[1]
This further confirmation that the Syrian ‘rebels' are using chemical weapons while also using Turkey as a base of terrorist operations against Syria, could cause further domestic problems for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whom Turkish opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has called the ‘chief of the terrorists'.[2]
The Syrian National Coalition abroad has persisted in accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. The Syrian National Coalition Head of Media Khaled Saleh told Al Jazeera on May 26th that Turkish authorities were certain about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.
Saleh also claimed that they were in contact with several ‘brigades' fighting in Syria. Perhaps, Mr. Saleh should be advised to consult the Turkish police now that one of their ‘brigades' has been arrested in possession of chemical weapons.[3]
Unsurprisingly, this Turkish report failed to make international headlines. From the beginning of the Syrian war, the international press agencies have attempted to portray the Al-Qaeda invasion of Syria as a ‘popular revolution', which started out as a ‘peaceful protest' against a ‘brutal regime'. The fact that there was never a modicum of evidence to support such claims has not hindered the avalanche of vituperation and demonization of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad and the Syrian Arab Republic.
France's daily Le Monde published an ‘exclusive' report on the 27th of May 2013 which claimed to have ‘proof' that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons ‘against its own people'. However, the report simply relied on statements by ‘activists' and ‘rebels', who most serious commentators have described as unreliable sources of information.
Le Monde's report came just in time as the French government was pushing the European Union to lift the embargo on arms to the terrorists in Syria. The confirmation by previous articles in Le Monde that the opposition in Syria is in fact Al Qaeda [4],
together with the reluctance of EU partners Germany, Austria, and other countries to openly back the terrorists, has isolated Paris and London, exposing the British and French governments as state sponsors of terrorism.
In January 2013, Russian television station RT published leaked documents from British corporation Britam Defense, which revealed a plan by Qatar to deliver chemical weapons to Homs in Syria, with the aid of Britam Defense. The British company was to provide Ukrainian personnel to act as Russian military advisors in order to implicate the Russian government in the crime. The email suggested that the Qataris were providing ‘enormous' amounts of money for the plan and that it was approved by Washington. [5]
The Japhat Al-Nosra terrorist organization has not hidden its desire to gas the Alawite minority in Syria. A video was posted on U Tube on December 4th 2012 showing terrorists testing chemical weapons on rabbits, while vowing to exterminate Alawite Syrians in a similar fashion.[6]
Iran's Press TV also published a report which showed terrorists using chemical weapons.[7]
As the Western-backed terrorists lose ground to government forces in Syria, the likelihood of further massacres committed by the terrorists and blamed on the Syrian government grows. However, as more and more reports contradict the official media narrative on the Syrian war, the voices of truth are acquiring critical mass, threatening to bring down once and for all NATO's oppressive media empire.

What I liked: This book is fantastic in the way it explores the possibilities of melding science fiction and fantasy into a world. The types of gourds this story introduces and the way that the story explains them is so fascinating and (for me) easy to understand. I think it was so interesting to see how the gourds were used and the different types there were, and not to mention you could still eat them afterwards! It was an amazing concept and I love how the trees were used as well in this story. How they could be harvested in minor ways to benefit the people of Lumin, how they could shape themselves and not only power places and provide heat and warmth where a hearth was, and it was all so complex and fascinating. It was worldbuilding that was different and intriguing and made me wonder how everything worked and kept my attention closely to find out more! I also love the first several chapters, how it switched between two characters to give a glimpse of what was happening in the past, and the present with out main character, Mia. Mia is a girl who I could understand in the way they go about solving their problems (although they may have not exactly been the best choices at the time I did understand). She's also slow to trust, and I think that's going to be an even bigger part of this series after the matters that went down in this book. I liked the other characters, although I feel like Brother SainClair was made out to be a bad person in this book and it felt a little off with how aggressive they were all the time towards Mia without any real explanation. I adored Brother Cornelius though, they were very quirky in their own manner and the passion they showed about the work they do is so apparent that it was amazing to see!
What I didn't like: This story starts off so quickly without much introduction into the world I had just stepped into. While for some books that works, this one made me read the first chapter of the story a couple of times to understand everything that was happening. It took a little putting together but I did manage to understand it and what was happening after a couple of passes.
Overall Review: Despite a slightly confusing and fast paced beginning, the novel is a bit slower after that as the world is introduced in bits and pieces that are fun and interesting afterwards. The characters were fun to learn and the world they live in is fascinating with its ecosystem and how it operates. While the ending wasn't exactly what I was expecting, and there was a part that basically laid out exactly who Mia was (which, was really obvious in the first few lines that it was being told, I'm not even sure why Mia didn't pick up on it as they were saying it), I really do look forward to what the second book, Ocularum, brings to the series and where everything is going to go after what happened in this book. I can't wait to see how it goes!
Recommend?: Yes definitely! If you can take the book slow where it needs to be, you'll definitely find that this book is worth the read!
False alarm: Microsoft isn't backing away from DirectX, despite an email message the company sent to some of its Most Valuable Professionals to the contrary earlier this week.
On January 30, Microsoft apparently sent an email message to its XNA and DirectX MVPs notifying them that as of April 1, 2014 "XNA/DirectX will be fully retired from the MVP Award Program." An excerpt from this email was posted on the "Promit Ventspace" blog.
The author of the blog is Promit Roy, Chief Technology Officer at Action = Reaction Labs, LLC. (Roy previously worked at both NVIDIA and Microsoft. They also are the lead developer on SlimDX, an open source library for DirectX support in .NET.)
Here's the excerpt:
"The XNA/DirectX expertise was created to recognize community leaders who focused on XNA Game Studio and/or DirectX development. Presently the XNA Game Studio is not in active development and DirectX is no longer evolving as a technology. Given the status within each technology, further value and engagement cannot be offered to the MVP community. As a result, effective April 1, 2014 XNA/DirectX will be fully retired from the MVP Award Program."
Given Microsoft's decision to back away from XNA by not encouraging its use for future Windows Phone apps , and not allowing it to be used at all in developing Windows Store/Metro Style apps and games, I wasn't too surprised to see XNA called out as a Microsoft technology on its way out.
But DirectX? Microsoft's set of gaming/graphics programming interfaces that have been baked into Windows and Windows Phone?
I asked Microsoft about the MVP mail. A spokesperson sent the following statement:
"I can confirm that the original communication sent to MVPs yesterday was inaccurate. Microsoft has issued a follow-up communication to the DirectX/XNA MVPs reaffirming that DirectX is very much an important and evolving technology for Microsoft."
The spokesperson added that "Microsoft is actively investing in DirectX as the unified graphics foundation for all of our platforms, including Windows, Xbox 360, and Windows Phone. DirectX is evolving and will continue to evolve. We have absolutely no intention of stopping innovation with DirectX."
So what happened here? How could that MVP email been so, so wrong about Microsoft's future DirectX commitments? The spokesperson said "it was a mistake, pure and simple."
"Microsoft has people across multiple divisions working on DirectX technologies. We are actively innovating and evolving DirectX and it will continue to be the world's leading low-level high performance interface for gaming and graphics across Microsoft platforms," the spokesperson added.
In spite of their (correct)hunch that the note to the MVPs was wrong/badly worded, Roy still was quite down on how Microsoft has been handling and communicating about DirectX.
Update: (Thanks @Shmuelie) Roy posted an update with some of the revised wording Microsoft sent to MVPs about DirectX on their blog on January 31. They noted their frustrations around Microsoft's communication policies with its developers still remains.
"It shouldn't take a leaked email to force a straight answer," Roy concluded. We journalists and bloggers agree!
An explosion believed to have been caused by a bomb ripped through the military intelligence building in Libya's eastern city of Benghazi, causing damage to the structure and nearby homes but no injuries, a security official said.
"The department of military intelligence was bombed," a senior security officer told the AFP news agency on Wednesday, adding that the level of damage to the two-storey building suggested it was hit by an improvised explosive device.
The dawn blast punched out large holes in the exterior walls of the building, marking the second attack on the facility in as many months. Adjacent buildings were also touched.
"The incident did not result in injury to any of the guards of the residents of neighbouring buildings," said the official who did not wish to be named.
The identity of the attackers, they said, remains unknown.
"The blast happened right after the al-fajr [dawn] prayers, the people who witnessed the explosion said that a man carrying a sack got out of a silver car with a damaged door, then the car went around the building and then the explosion happened as you see," said Hussein Al-Baraasi, who spoke to the Reuters news agency at the scene.
Adil Othmane, an army spokesperson in Tripoli, confirmed the incident and said it was under investigation. They attributed the attack to the absence of security guards.
Khaled Haidar, spokesperson for the director of national security in Benghazi, said the eastern city has witnessed a series of security breaches over the past week.
These included the discovery and neutralisation of a bomb outside the iconic Tibesti Hotel on Sunday.
On Friday, saw a hand grenade hit the appeals court and a rocket punch the outside wall of the main prison. Both incidents caused only minor material damage to the buildings targeted, they said.
Also on Friday, Haidar added, security forces diffused two time-bombs planted by the office of national security in Benghazi.
Prison break
These recent attacks came hours after a break-in at Benghazi's Kowaifiyah prison freed the suspected killer of former rebel chief Abdel-Fattah Younis, a security official said.
The interior ministry said Salem al-Obeidi, an advocate of Islamic governance, was freed when gunmen stormed the prison on Tuesday night.
Younis served as Gadhafi's interior minister until they joined the anti-regime uprising last year. They were killed in July 2011.
The incident underlines Libya's tenuous security situation nearly a year after the ouster of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, with former rebels refusing to lay down their arms and operating as the de facto government in many parts of the vast Arab nation.
The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The coastal city of Benghazi was the cradle of the revolt that toppled long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi last year.
The son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi wants to be tried for alleged war crimes by the International Criminal Court at The Hague.
Saif al-Islam says being tried in Libya would be tantamount to murder.
They say a Libyan trial wouldn't be fair if the prosecution is based on evidence gathered from torture.
Seven Iranian relief workers, official guests of the Libyan Red Crescent Association, were abducted on Tuesday in the heart of the city by an unknown armed group.
Anthony Bourdain has said it over and over, but he'll say it again: There's no way on Earth he'd sit down for a meal with President Trump. He's even blamed "smug" liberals for causing Trump's victory. And now, he's gone further, saying in a new interview that they doubt Trump likes food, or has even learned how to pick up a pair of chopsticks.
On the CBC news program The National, Bourdain said that President Obama had no trouble with chopsticks when the two ate in Vietnam for their show, Parts Unknown. "President Obama spent a lot of time in Indonesia as a young man, and he's very sentimental about the street food, and the smells, and those flavors," they said.
But Bourdain said they would never film a similar segment with Trump, because not only do they not approve of them as a person, but also they assume the president doesn't care much for food at all.
I'm open to sitting down with anyone who's nice to me. I've sat down with everyone from Ted Nugent, [to the] former chief of counterintelligence for the KGB, Hezbollah, you know, people who I disagree with on many, if not every, fundamental issue. But I have no expectation—I just find them personally objectionable. I don't think they like food, and from people I know who have had to endure dinner with him, if you enjoy sitting there listen to them talk about himself, great, God bless you. And you know, the man, they only eats steak well-done, and if they know how to use chopsticks, much less able to grasp them with those tiny little nubbins, I'd be shocked.
There goes Bourdain's invitation to state dinners for a good long while. Watch the full interview below:
The solid gold coin will weigh 1kg (2.2lb) and is the first time the Royal Mint has made such a large coin that is legal tender. It will require legislation in Parliament before the manufacture can start.
Because it is legal tender any person who buys the coin will, in theory, be able to take it into a shop and use it to buy something.
In practice, this is highly unlikely to happen, because though the coin has a face value of £1,000, it is expected to cost between £40,00 and £45,000, meaning the coins will only be bought by collectors.
In total 60 will be made, alongside 14,000 silver £500 coins.
There have been one kilo gold coins produced by the Royal Mint previously, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. However, these were not legal tender in the United Kingdom as they were technically Alderney coins – minted on behalf of the Channel Island.
The coin was the most expensive item of a large range of official Olympic merchandise unveiled earlier this month, including beach towels, fridge magnets, silver cufflinks, egg cups, bed linen and even train sets.
The London organising committee hopes to raise as much as £80 million from worldwide sales of its merchandise.
Gold coins, especially krugerrands have become popular with some investors as a way of taking advantage of rising gold prices. Kruggerands, produced in South Africa, usually contain one troy ounce of gold, equating to 31 grams.

The Highlanders beat the Bulls 17-10 with a late try at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday, but earlier in the match a player from each side was red card for two separate incidents. Both were similar in the fact that they were for dangerous shoulders, however.
Highlights winger Waisake Naholo first received their red card after they appeared to pull out of a tackle last minute, but made contact with their shoulder on Bulls centre Burger Odendaal.
Just eight minutes later, it was the Bulls who lost a player after lock RG Snyman flew into a ruck with no arms, and they too are sent from the field.
Naholo has since been banned for 1 week, while Snyman got a 4-week suspension.
WAISAKE NAHOLO RED CARD
In their SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee, Naholo pleaded guilty to contravening Law 10.4(g), Dangerous charging or obstructing or grabbing of an Opponent with or without the ball, including shouldering.
The SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee of Nigel Hampton QC (Chairman), Stefan Terblanche and Stephen Hardy assessed the case. In their finding, Foul Play Review Committee Chairman Nigel Hampton QC ruled the following:
“Having considered the Referee's description of the incident and the available video footage, the Foul Play Review Committee amended the charge to Law 10.4(g). Having further considered all the evidence, including submissions from their legal representative, Aaron Lloyd, the Foul Play Review Committee found the Player's actions to have breached the Red Card threshold.
“With respect to sanction the Foul Play Review Committee deemed the act of foul play merited a low-end entry point of 2 weeks. However, taking into account mitigating factors including the Player's good Judicial record and early guilty plea, the Foul Play Review Committee reduced the suspension to 1 week.
“The player is therefore suspended for 1 week, up to and including Saturday 20 May 2017.”
RG SNYMAN RED CARD
The SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee accepted a guilty plea from RG Snyman for contravening Law 10.4(h), A Player must not charge into a ruck or maul.
The SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee of Nigel Hampton QC (Chairman), Stefan Terblanche and Stephen Hardy assessed the case. In their finding, Foul Play Review Committee Chairman Nigel Hampton QC ruled the following:
“Having conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence, including all camera angles and additional evidence, including from the player and submissions from their legal representative, Marius Botha, the Foul Play Review Committee upheld the citing under Law 10.4(h).
“With respect to sanction the Foul Play Review Committee deemed the act of foul play merited a mid-range entry point of 6 weeks primarily due to the dangerous nature of the act and the direct contact with the opponent's head.
“However, taking into account mitigating factors including the Player's good Judicial record and early guilty plea, the Foul Play Review Committee reduced the suspension to 4 weeks.
“The player is therefore suspended for 4 weeks, up to and including the Friday 9 June 2017.”

I found out that my PhD application had been successful during a typical day in the pub kitchen – I had started at 5.30am, cleaning litres of grease off the oven filters. What was meant to be temporary work to support my master's degree had become a full-time job, and in five years I had moved from being a kitchen porter to a shift leader and stand-in manager.
My PhD takes me into a world of space molecules and alien fart jokes Read more
My heart was racing during the breakfast shift as I waited for the news about my PhD. But checking my emails on my phone was out of the question – I had to concentrate. A busy kitchen requires full focus at all times; drift off for a few seconds and you can end up losing a finger. And if I took longer than eight minutes to deliver a full English breakfast, I would have to sit down with my manager and explain where I had failed. So I finally got the good news at the end of my shift and walked out of the pub feeling like the luckiest person in the world.
Today I am just over two years into my PhD in political science at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna. I am exploring the communication between members of parliament and their constituents. We elect MPs to represent our beliefs, ideas, and interests, but without communication, they may never know what our interests actually are. And so this back and forth is crucial for a healthy, representative democracy.
I want to discover how MPs choose what to communicate to their constituents. My initial plan was to talk to MPs themselves, but, as my supervisor had wisely warned me, this didn't work. I soon found out that MPs don't want to communicate with PhD students – they would rather invest their time in conversations with people who will help them to earn votes.
My PhD busts the old stereotypes about 'selfish, smug' only children Read more
So instead of asking MPs about how they communicate with their constituents, I decided to use email contact from constituents to analyse MPs' behaviour. My experiment was one of the first to use this methodology to study elected representatives in Europe and I was thrilled to win the 2015 Pademia Student Paper Award, for the best student research in parliamentary democracy in Europe.
I love my PhD because research is what I live for. I don't see it as a job like the pub. Days off from the kitchen were precious and never enough, but now I have to force myself to stay away from my office to rest and recuperate. I often find myself spending the weekends there reading, analysing data and writing, not because I have to but because I love to.
My days in kitchen provided valuable experience for my research. The physical and mental grind of the long hours gave me a strong work ethic and mean that I have a sense of perspective when things get tough on my PhD.
And I have kept the early-morning starts – well, almost. I begin work at 6.30am, so I get an extra hour in bed. Although I can now check my emails whenever I want and procrastinate without getting into trouble, I know how to avoid getting too distracted.
Putting in these hours on my PhD has helped me to overcome some of the mistakes that I have made along the way. Assuming that MPs would respond to my questions, for example, meant that I wasted 10 months designing questionnaires and interviews. But I am on course to finish writing my thesis within two and a half years, six months ahead of time.
My PhD could save an endangered species with time-travelling mud Read more
My story so far goes against the stereotype of the PhD as a long, torturous journey that students have to suffer through. I enjoy working on the answer to the question I have chosen because it really matters. When I start working before sunrise, I know that I am not making multimillionaires slightly richer while they sleep. I know that my research will never make me rich either, but I hope that it will benefit society.
An exceptional outcome, whether it's an English breakfast or a PhD thesis, is difficult to achieve with average ingredients, no matter how hard you try. I know how frustrating it is to be without support from my days in the kitchen, where we were often understaffed. Thankfully I have all the resources that I need now, including two inspirational supervisors. It was worth waiting, and working, for the right opportunity to come along.

Most of the people injured in the protests are reportedly from the security services [EPA]
Three people have been killed and hundreds injured in continuing protests in Algeria, as the government meets to discuss ways of halting the rising food costs and unemployment that have sparked the unrest.
At least 300 of the 400 people injured in the riots were police officers, Dahou Oul Kablia, Algeria's interior minister, said on national radio on Saturday.
One of the three people killed was named as 18-year-old Azzedine Lebza. They were shot dead in Ain Lahdjel in the M'Sila region, 300km from Algiers, the capital.
"He died in an attempt to break into a police station," Kablia said.
A second demonstrator was killed on Friday in Bou Smail, a small town 50km west of Algiers, they said.
"He was picked up in the street, wounded. A pathologist said they had died from wounds to the head, but the cause of death has not yet been established."
A medical official said earlier that the man, identified in media reports as 32-year-old Akriche Abdelfattah, had been hit in the face by a tear gas canister.
The third body was found in a hotel burned down by rioters, the interior minister said.
Growing unrest
Algeria has seen three days of unrest over the rising costs of living and unemployment, which government figures show standing at about 10 per cent, but which independent organisations put closer to 25 per cent.
Algiers, which has seen protests in recent days, was calmer on Saturday, but witnesses reported fresh protests in the Kabylie region.
Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra reports
on the violence in Algeria
Ministers were due to meet to discuss measures to limit the profit margins traders can charge for staple foods.
Mustapha Benbada, Algeria's trade minister, has said urgent measures will be taken to alleviate pressure on the population.
"From the start of next week, the situation will get better," Benbada was quoted as saying by state radio.
The government is expected to impose fixed profit margins on widely-consumed goods including edible oil and sugar.
But Dalila Hanache, an Algerian journalist with the news website Echorouk, said that the protests went beyond just rising prices.
"I hear young people in the neighbourhood who say these clashes and protests are not the result of high food prices only, they think there are lots of problems in this country - educational, problems in the health sectors, in all sectors of government," they told Al Jazeera.
Mohamed Ben Madani, editor of The Maghreb Review, said the situation was "out of control" and that the protests could continue for weeks.
"The government simply ignored the people since they were elected to office and basically now they [the people] have come out into the streets asking the authorities to give them jobs and to share the wealth of the nation," they told Al Jazeera, from London.
"I'm afraid the authorities will more [likely] crack down on those who are protesting against them rather than giving them what they are asking for. The minister this afternoon labelled them as 'criminals'."
'Probably a revolution'
Mohamed Zitout, a former Algerian diplomat, told Al Jazeera: "It is a revolt, and probably a revolution, of an oppressed people who have, for 50 years, been waiting for housing, employment, and a proper and decent life in a very rich country.
"But unfortunately it is ruled by a very rich elite that does not care about what is happening in the country - because they did not give people what they want, even though the government has the means to do so, the people are now revolting."
Young people clashed with police in Algiers and several other towns across the country on Friday despite appeals for calm from imams.
In Annaba, 600km west of the capital, rioting broke out after Friday prayers in a poor neighbourhood of the city and continued late into the night. A local government office was ransacked, according to witnesses.
Protesters also cut down electricity poles during the night, cutting off power to the working class suburb of Auzas.
In Tizi Ouzou, the capital of the eastern Kabylie region, residents said rioting had spread from the city centre to the outskirts, and demonstrators burning tyres blocked the main road to Algiers.
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algeria's president, who is serving their third term, has not made any public comment on the protests.
Under Armour has overtaken Adidas this year in combined apparel and footwear sales to become the second biggest sports brand in the United States.
Baltimore-based Under Armour had U.S. apparel and footwear sales of $1.2 billion through the end of August, edging ahead of Adidas with $1.1 billion total U.S. sales, according to a Sterne Agee report citing sales figures from SportScanInfo. Under Armour sales have jumped 20 percent this year, while Adidas combined sales have plummeted 23 percent.
Market leader Nike, with 46 percent of the athletic footwear market and a third of the sports apparel sales, far outpaces its competitors with a combined $8.9 billion sales so far this year.
Under Armour has been stealing market share in apparel sales for months from its older German rival and from Nike, according to Sterne Agee.
Under Armour's sports apparel sales, which account for 14 percent of the U.S. market, expanded to more than twice those of Adidas. Adidas, with a six percent share of the apparel market, continues to rank third as a footwear brand behind Nike and Jordan, with more than double Under Armour's fledgling, but growing, footwear sales.
"Under Armour and Nike are constantly dissatisfied, and Adidas hasn't had the same sense of urgency," said Sam Poser, a managing director and research analyst with Sterne Agee. "Adidas sometimes sits back on their laurels too much and the other folks pass them by. What we're seeing now is an example of that."
The year-to-date report reflects a trend of Under Armour's apparel sales growing while Adidas' decline, eating away at Adidas market share. In February for instance, Under Armour's apparel sales were nearly triple those of Adidas. The German company said in a quarterly earnings report last month that its sales grew in all regions in the first half of the year except in North America, where it had double-digit declines in the United States.
Under Armour CEO and founder Kevin Plank has repeatedly stated the relatively young company's goal of becoming the world's biggest sports brand by targeting the women's sports apparel and footwear markets, expanding its base of Under Armour retail outlets and spreading its brand around the globe, where sales now account for less than 10 percent of revenue. The company anticipates nearly $3 billion in sales this year.
Last week, just days after losing out on a bid to sign NBA star Kevin Durant to a basketball-shoe deal, Under Armour announced the signing of Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen to its lineup of representatives including ballerina Misty Copeland and skier Lindsey Vonn for its biggest-ever, $15 million, ad campaign aimed at women.
Since late last year, the company has become the exclusive supplier to teams at Notre Dame and the U.S. Naval Academy, expanded into Brazil and opened branded stores in China and New York City.
For much of the year, Under Armour has been battling it out with Nike.
Poser said in a May research report that the two brands' apparel sales were continuing to dominate, with Nike capturing sales in mid-tier department stores and Under Armour seeing healthy gains in share through athletic specialty and sporting goods retailers and taking share from the larger Nike from those stores. That month alone, sales jumped 18 percent for Nike and 22 percent for Under Armour while sales declined sharply for Adidas, Russell and Champion.
"Nike and Under Armour … are annihilating the competition," Poser wrote. "It appears as if the women's apparel will be the battleground going forward."

Caroline Kennedy is heading up Obama's VP search.
(CNN) - It's already happened once before: the person tapped to search for a vice presidential candidate assumes the position instead. Now, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore is pushing for it to happen again - this time with Caroline Kennedy assuming the role of Dick Cheney.
In an open letter to the famous political scion Wednesday tapped by Obama to find their No. 2, Moore expresses deep reserve with leading VP candidates Joe Biden and Evan Bayh because of their votes to authorize the Iraq war, and urges Kennedy to float their own name for the position.
Watch: Malveaux on the VP hunt
"What Obama needs is a vice presidential candidate who is not a professional politician, but someone who is well-known and beloved by people across the political spectrum; someone who, like Obama, spoke out against the war; someone who has a good and generous heart, who will be cheered by the rest of the world; someone whom we've known and loved and admired all our lives and who has dedicated their life to public service and to the greater good for all," Moore writes in the letter published on their Web site.
"That person, Caroline, is you."
Watch: Caroline Kennedy backs Obama
Moore, who's 2004 movie Fahrenheit 911 hit theaters only months before that year's presidential election and led to John McCain's public rebuke of the film at the Republican convention, also makes a direct appeal for Obama to "step up and surprise us again."
"Step up and be different than every politician we have witnessed in our lifetime," they write. "Make Caroline Kennedy your VP. "Obama-Kennedy." Wow, does that sound so cool.
The daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy formally backed Obama's White House bid only days before the Super Tuesday round of primaries on February 5. In an Op-Ed in the New York Times, Kennedy hailed the Illinois senator as a man who could be a "president like my father."
In June, Obama formally asked them to help steer their vice presidential search, along with Washington power-players Eric Holder and Jim Johnson. Johnson later resigned that post after issues were raised over favorable mortgages from Countrywide Financial.
NEW DELHI: India will take part in an international meeting on Afghanistan in Moscow mid-February organized by Russia in what is an acknowledgement of Delhi's key role in stablising the war-torn country less than two months after India did not figure in Russia-China-Pak trilateral meet on the issue.“We have a common understanding that there is the need to boost efforts (for reconciliation in Afghanistan),” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by news agency TASS as saying. “In this context, we confirmed the invitation for the Afghan colleagues for another meeting on Afghanistan's settlement due in mid-February in Moscow, with participation of representatives of Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan China , Iran and India.”Officials here told ET that India will be part of the six-nation meet where yet again Delhi and Islamabad will be in the same room after the SAARC meet in Kathmandu last week. India confirmed its participation at the meet when National Security Advisor Ajit K Doval was in Moscow last month.“We expect that all partners will be represented at a high level, and most of them have already confirmed their participation,” Lavrov further said. India has been favouring a regional approach to the Afghan stability that also includes regional stakeholders like Iran and Russia. Last December India hosted Heart of Asia meet on Afghanistan in Amritsar with a clear message to defeat cross terror infrastructure. Afghan President participating in the meet had a blunt message for terror sanctuaries in Pakistan.The announcement of the mid-February meet came after Lavrov met their Afghan counterpart Salahuddin Rabbani in Moscow on Tuesday.“Russia and Afghanistan are old-time and close partners, and are interested in cooperation in security, humanitarian and economic areas,” Lavrov was quoted by TASS telling Rabbani. “We support efforts of Afghanistan's leadership in stabilizing the situation in the country and in the war on terror.”It is understood that India-USA-Afghanistan will also hold their trilateral meet on the Afghan situation in what would be first such meeting under the Trump Presidency. US President Donald Trump has yet to announce their policy on Afghanistan.
Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde is a BJP lawmaker from Uttara Kannada in Karnataka.
Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde has landed in another controversy after actor Prakash Raj tweeted a video of a hate speech they reportedly made almost two years ago.The video, reportedly from March, 2016, shows Mr Hegde saying, "As long as there is Islam in the world, there will be terrorism. Until we uproot Islam, we can't remove terrorism."Mr Hegde, who is a BJP leader from Karnataka, also said, "If there is opportunity in the media - write exactly this. Telecast exactly this. Islam is a bomb for world peace. There will be no peace in the world as long as Islam is there." The five-time parliamentarian was not a minister then.Sharing the video on Twitter, Prakash Raj said, "This minister says .."Islam should be wiped out in this world" ..so when they talk of HINDUTVA do they mean it's a way of life...#justasking." The actor, who has been critical of the BJP over a range of issues recently, also said, "Who are you guys...Are you guys reincarnation of Germans HITLER (sic)."49-year-old Anantkumar Hegde, Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this week a case was registered against them for allegedly abusing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of the Congress in a speech in Kittur of Belagavi district recently.A local Congress leader in Mysuru filed the police complaint alleging that Mr Hegde had said the chief minister would "lick boots for vote and seat."Soon after they were appointed minister in this year's cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, CCTV footage of Mr Hegde slapping a doctor was widely circulated.The five-time parliamentarian was seen striking the doctor, grabbing them by the throat and slamming them against a wall. They were apparently furious because they felt the doctors were not paying enough attention to their mother, who had suffered multiple fractures after a fall at home.Mr Hegde's elevation as a central minister in the September reshuffle was seen to be part of the BJP's strategy to increase representation in the cabinet, of states where elections will be held soon. The BJP hopes to return to power in Karnataka, due for assembly elections in 2018.
NEW YORK -- The Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns, last season's unanimous Kia NBA Rookie of the Year, and the Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid, who has won both Kia NBA Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month awards this season, highlight the list of 20 players selected by the league's assistant coaches to play in the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge on Friday, Feb. 17 during NBA All-Star 2017 in New Orleans.
For the third consecutive year, the league's annual showcase of premier young talent will pit 10 first- and second-year NBA players from the U.S. against 10 first- and second-year NBA players from around the world. The game will be televised live by TNT at 9 p.m. ET and will also be available on the Watch TNT App and on TNT Overtime. In addition, ESPN Radio will broadcast the event from Smoothie King Center, with audio also available on the ESPN app. BBVA Compass, the Official Bank of the NBA, maintains its role as title partner for the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge.
Towns, who helped the U.S. Team defeat the World Team 157-154 in last year's BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge, is one of two NBA players averaging at least 22.0 points and 11.0 rebounds this season (the New Orleans Pelicans' Anthony Davis is the other). The U.S. Team also features the Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker, who is averaging 20.6 points and has scored at least 20 in each of their last 10 games, and the Indiana Pacers' Myles Turner, who ranks third in the NBA in blocked shots (2.30 bpg) to go with 15.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.
Joining Towns, Booker and Turner on the U.S. Team are Malcolm Brogdon of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquese Chriss of the Suns, Brandon Ingram and D'Angelo Russell of the Los Angeles Lakers, Frank Kaminsky of the Charlotte Hornets, Jahlil Okafor of the 76ers and Jonathon Simmons of the San Antonio Spurs.
The World Team is anchored by Embiid (Cameroon), who leads all rookies in scoring (19.8 ppg), rebounding (7.8 rpg) and blocks (2.47 bpg), as well as two members of the 2015-16 NBA All-Rookie First Team in Serbian center Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets (15.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 3.9 apg this season) and Latvian forward Kristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks (18.9 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.92 bpg). Jokic is one of three Nuggets players on the World Team, along with Emmanuel Mudiay (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Jamal Murray (Canada).
Rounding out the World Team are Danté Exum (Australia) and Trey Lyles (Canada) of the Utah Jazz, Buddy Hield (Bahamas) of the Pelicans, Domantas Sabonis (Lithuania) of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Dario Saric (Croatia) of the 76ers.
The World Team features three players who have participated as campers in Basketball without Borders, the NBA and FIBA's global basketball development and community outreach program: Embiid (BWB Africa 2011), Murray (BWB Global 2015) and Saric (BWB Europe 2010).
NBA opening night rosters for the 2016-17 season featured a record 113 international players from a record 41 countries and territories. This marked the third consecutive season that opening night rosters included at least 100 international players and that all 30 teams had at least one international player.
The NBA's assistant coaches chose the rosters for the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge, with each of the league's 30 teams submitting one ballot per coaching staff. Coaches selected four guards, four frontcourt players and two players at either position group for each team. They also picked a minimum of three first-year players and three second-year players for each team.
The head coaches for the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge will be lead assistant coaches from the 2017 NBA All-Star Game coaching staffs. The East and West coaching staffs are determined by the best record in each conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 5. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and their staff have earned the honor for the West, while the East coaching staff has yet to be determined.
Below are the rosters for the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge and a list of past results:
A certain sector of the American public waiting for Jesus to rise didn't realize the Son of God would take it so literally.
If an amateur photographer is to be believed, the big J.C. is hanging out on a telephone pole in Hathaway, Louisiana, these days.
OK, so it's just a bunch of vines that happened to grow on a human-made cross. But at least He's hanging out in Their glorious natural world.
Which is more than we can say for these appearances:
1. On a tortilla. The infamous Jesus tortilla was found in 1978, and it's still making its finder cash at the JesusTortilla site (where you can buy your very own Christ on a crispy piece of bread t-shirt). Worrying every day that you're going to take a bite out of the savior is enough to make you an atheist.
2. In the shower. The moldy Christ who showed up on a shower wall -- and sold for $2,000 on eBay in 2005 -- is enough to scare teenage boys out of their favorite bathroom proclivities for good. Mom, you can have your lotion back.
3. On the couch. If you thought eating them was bad, how about having sex on him? It's Christ on a Couch!
4. On a tailgate. Who needs a Jesus fish when your truck's been officially saved? From the junkyard anyway. Proof that one man's dirt is another man's Lord and savior.
5. On Twitter. Is the interwebs saved? The man, the truth, the legend is also @Jesus.

BOULDER, Colo. -- Boulder-based triathlete Richie Cunningham was injured during an incident possibly caused by a driver's road rage in north Boulder County on Thursday, according to the Daily Camera.
According to Cunningham, they were riding along North 83rd Street Thursday at about 9 a.m. with three other professional triathletes, Ben Hoffman, Patrick Evoe and Joe Gambles, when a car recklessly passed them and honked its horn.
Cunningham and their friends were starting to descend down a hill as the car passed. Halfway down the hill, the vehicle slammed on its brakes, forcing Cunningham to do the same.
"I just had nothing else to do," they told the Daily Camera. "It was either run up the back of them or brake harder. Once I braked I just flipped over the front of the handlebars."
After Cunningham was thrown off their bicycle, the vehicle took off. Hoffman was able to chase the car, gaining enough proximity to get a license plate number.
Cunningham was released from the hospital Thursday evening and suffered a separated shoulder and a broken elbow, which might need surgery. They told the Daily Camera the injuries will likely keep them out of any competitions until after September.
"It's crushing," they said. "I was having one of my best seasons. I'm 39 soon to be 40. I don't have that much longer to keep competing."
The triathlete, who is originally from Australia, said they relocated to Boulder from Austin, TX because they thought it would be a safer environment for cyclists, making the incident that much more disappointing.
"To be perfectly honest, there are enough cyclists and courteous drivers that we have it pretty good here," Hoffman said of the city of Boulder. "It's just tough when something like this happens. It seems completely senseless."
As of Friday, the case was still under investigation. No tickets have been issued, but some basic information about the driver has been collected, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

Ants can be annoying little insects. In your home, they make army-like lines to any crumbs on your floor. In your home's frame, carpenter ants can do a job of eating away your walls. But what about outside? Do ants play a positive role in your yard? Your garden? What about in a farm field?
Research undertaken by scientists in China reveals that ants are hardworking and beneficial insects. In the activities of their daily lives, ants help increase air, water flow, and organic matter in soil. The work done by ants even forms a type of mulch that helps hold water in the soil.
Ants are busy insects. They dwell in the soil, and build their homes by burrowing tiny holes, channels, and chambers. Soil scientists refer to these as macropores. Where do ants place the soil they are digging out? On the soil surface. The tiny clumps we see as an ant hill are what researchers call aggregate mulches.
In addition to creating the aggregate mulches, ants help the soil environment by "bringing down food sources from outside," says soil scientist Tongchuan Li. "Types of food include the bodies of insects, leaves, sugar water, and the 'honeydew' of aphids. The big diameter of the nest channels (4.1-6.6mm) and the chambers also can improve the transport of air with frequent ant activities."
Li and researchers at Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China, found that ant-made aggregate mulches could help retain water in agricultural fields. In other words, these aggregates can act like any other mulch, preserving moisture in the soil, under certain conditions. "Minimal attention has been paid to the effects of ant activities on soil [water] evaporation thus far," says Li. "Ants represent half of the global insect biomass," and these mulches could be playing an important role in soil moisture, soil health, and agricultural field efficiency.
According to Li's paper, gravel has been used in China as an effective mulch to conserve water. However, in the Northern Loess Plateau region, no widespread distribution of gravel occurred. The burrowing ants were leaving stacks of soil aggregates each time they burrowed into the soil. A conservation project undertaken in 1999, Grain for Green, promoted the development of soil-dwelling animals. China planted 400-600 million trees to control severe soil erosion problems. These trees, in turn, "provided abundant food and suitable habitats" for neighboring fields, says Li.
Another reason why the ant population was lower before 1999 than now was human-made. "Before the Grain for Green Project, cropland was the main land use," says Li. "Plowing can severely damage ant nests. [The project called for the] abandonment of agricultural land in these areas. The result was less disturbance and a substantial increase in vegetation cover, which promoted the development of ant colonies."
The type of ant studied by Li and their team was one found prevalent in agricultural fields of China, Camponotus japonicus. While not the largest ant in China, "Camponotus japonicus is the largest ant in the northern Loess Plateau," according to Li. "The body length of worker ants varied from 7.4 to 13.8mm. They live in grasslands of alfalfa, abandoned cropland, forest land, and apple orchards. This kind of ant is widespread in China."
How do ants make these aggregate mulches? "With burrowing their nest, ants make and move the aggregates on soil surface around their nest," says Li. "As I observed, Camponotus japonicus just physically bite off and move the soil fragments with their jaws." Larger ants tend to make larger aggregates than smaller ants -- and Camponotus japonicus runs on the large side. The aggregates these ants make averaged 1.6mm -- or 12-22% of the ants' size. That's a lot of heavy lifting!
The research found that the percentage of soil moisture affected how well the ant aggregate mulch performed. At a near-average level of soil moisture, 12.6%, ant aggregate mulch works well. They found that evaporation of water from the soil surface significantly decreased with increasing aggregate mulch thickness.
One downside to ant-made aggregate mulches is that they disintegrate with rainfall. However, ants tend to enlarge their nests by making new chambers after a rainfall, producing more aggregate mulches after rains. So, in theory, aggregates are a "renewable" mulch source.
Operation Claymore was the code name for a British commando raid on the Lofoten Islands in Norway during the Second World War. The Lofoten Islands were an important centre for the production of fish oil and glycerine, used in the German war economy. The landings were carried out on 4 March 1941, by the men of No. 3 Commando, No. 4 Commando, a Royal Engineers Section and 52 men from the Norwegian Independent Company 1. Supported by the 6th Destroyer Flotilla and two troop transports of the Royal Navy, the force made an unopposed landing and generally continued to meet no opposition. The original plan was to avoid contact with German forces and inflict the maximum of damage to German-controlled industry. They achieved their objective of destroying fish oil factories and some 3,600 t (3,500 long tons) of oil and glycerine. The British experienced only one accident; an officer injuring themselves with their own revolver and returned with some 228 German prisoners, 314 loyal Norwegian volunteers and a number of Quisling regime collaborators.
Through naval gunfire and demolition parties, 18,000 tons of shipping were sunk. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine and its code books from the German armed trawler Krebs. German naval codes could be read at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations. In the aftermath, the evaluation of the operation differed, with the British, especially Winston Churchill and the Special Operations Executive, deeming it a success. In the eyes of the British the main value of such actions was to tie up large German forces on occupation duties in Norway. Martin Linge and the other Norwegians involved were more doubtful of the value of such raids against the Norwegian coast but were not told of the value of the seized cryptographic information. Following Operation Claymore, the Norwegian special operations unit Norwegian Independent Company 1 was established for operations in Norway.
Background [ edit ]
After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been expelled from Europe at the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe and stated that "...they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast".[2] Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Dill, aware of Churchill's intentions, approved Clarke's proposal.[2] Three weeks later, the first commando raid—Operation Collar—took place. The raiders failed to gather any intelligence or damage any German equipment; their only success was in killing two German sentries.[2]
The commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters. The man initially selected as the commander was Admiral Roger Keyes, a veteran of the Gallipoli Campaign and the Zeebrugge Raid in the First World War.[3] In 1940, the call went out for volunteers from among the serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain and men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies, originally raised from Territorial Army divisions, which had seen service in Norway.[a] In November 1940, the new army units were organised into a special service brigade under Brigadier J.C. Haydon, with four special service battalions.[5] By the autumn of 1940, more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training and the special service brigade now consisted of twelve units which were called commandos.[6]
After an inauspicious start, the first large-scale commando raid was to be on the Lofoten Islands, which are just off the Norwegian coast, inside the Arctic Circle, about 900 mi (1,400 km) from Britain. Once at the islands, the raiders would be landed at four small ports to destroy fish oil-producing factories. All the oil produced was being shipped to Germany, which extracted the glycerine, a vital ingredient in the manufacture of high explosives.[7] The commandos would be transported to the islands aboard two new infantry landing ships, escorted by four Tribal-class and one L-class destroyer of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.[7]
Mission [ edit ]
The commander of the raid was Rear Admiral L. H. K. Hamilton.[8] The objectives of Operation Claymore were threefold. The Royal Navy were asked to safely escort the transports carrying the landing force to the islands and back. While there, they were to destroy or capture any German shipping or Norwegian shipping working for the Germans and provide naval gunfire support for the landing forces. The naval forces taking part were the escorts from the 6th Destroyer Flotilla: HMS Somali, HMS Bedouin, HMS Tartar, HMS Eskimo, and HMS Legion under the command of Captain C. Caslon. Two newly converted landing ships, HMS Queen Emma and HMS Princess Beatrix, were to transport the landing force.[9]
The landing force was provided by the special service brigade (Brigadier J. C. Haydon). The commandos taking part were 250 all ranks from No. 3 Commando (Major John Durnford-Slater), 250 all ranks of No. 4 Commando (Lieutenant Colonel D. S. Lister). They were supported by a section of Royal Engineers of No. 55 Field Company, (Second Lieutenant H. M. Turner) and four officers and 48 other ranks of the Norwegian Independent Company 1, (Captain Martin Linge).[9] The landing force were to destroy the oil-producing facilities in the ports of Stamsund, Henningsvær, Svolvær and Brettesnes, engage the German garrison and attempt to take prisoners of war found in the area. They were also to detain any supporters of the Norwegian Quisling party and persuade the local population to leave the island and join the Free Norwegian Forces.[9]
The force began its assembly at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 21 February 1941 and remained there for almost a week, before leaving for Norway just after midnight on 1 March 1941. The landing force was distributed amongst the ships, headquarters special service brigade were transported on Somali. No. 4 Commando which had been assigned landings at Svolvær and Brettesnes were on board Queen Emma. No. 3 Commando, which had been assigned landings at Stamsund and Henningsvær, were on board Princess Beatrix. The Royal Engineers and Norwegian forces were divided between both the landing ships.[9]
The time they had spent at Scapa Flow was used getting acquainted with the transport ships and the Landing Craft Assault they would be using to reach the shore. The problems the navy perceived providing gunfire support were also discussed, as the destroyers would not be able to approach closer than 1 mi (1.6 km) to shore owing to the shallows. Because of this, the commandos were trained to rely on their own weapons to provide covering fire and support each other from their landing craft. Plans were also made for them to look after themselves in case the destroyers were called away to deal with a naval threat, which included every man being ordered to take enough rations to last for 48 hours ashore.[10]
Landings [ edit ]
The Arrival at Lofoten - 4th March 1941 Art.IWMARTLD993
The naval task force known by the codename Rebel left Scapa Flow and headed towards the Faroes. They berthed in the Skálafjørður at 19:00 hours 1 March 1941 to take on fuel. Refuelling took five hours and the naval task force set out again heading northwards towards the Arctic to avoid detection by German air and sea patrols. They then turned east and headed towards Norway. They arrived at the Lofoten Islands during the early morning of 4 March 1941, just before 04:00 hours. Entering the Vestfjorden they were surprised to see all the harbour navigational lights illuminated, which they believed to be a sign that they were not expected and had achieved complete surprise.[10]
During the planning for the operation, plans were drawn up that called for simultaneous landings at all their targets at 06:30 hours, but on arrival, they decided to postpone the landings by 15 minutes so they would not be landing in total darkness. When they did commence to disembark the landing force, they were all ashore by 06:50 hours.[10] On shore, the landing force commenced their operations unopposed. The only shots fired were by the armed trawler Krebs, which managed to fire four rounds at HMS Somali before being sunk.[10] Other ships sunk by the landing forces were the merchant ships Hamburg, Pasajes, Felix, Mira, Eilenau, Rissen, Andø, Grotto, and Bernhard Schulte, which amounted to 18,000 tons of shipping.[7][11]
British commandos watch the fish oil tanks burning
The force that landed at Stamsund destroyed the Lofotens Cod Boiling Plant. Two factories were destroyed at Henningsvær and 13 at Svolvær. In total, about 800,000 imperial gallons (3,600 m3) of fish oil, paraffin were set on fire.[11] They captured 228 prisoners of war, seven from the Kriegsmarine, three from the Heer, 15 from the Luftwaffe, two from the Schutzstaffel (SS), 147 from the Merchant Navy and 14 civilians.[11] Perhaps the most significant result of the raid was the capture of a set of rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine, and its code books. These were rescued from the sinking Krebs, although their commander, Lieutenant Hans Kupfinger, threw their machine (one of three known to be on the island) overboard minutes before they were killed. Documents found disclosed the Kriegsmarine Home Waters key for February and also helped solve the April traffic which was sent between 1 March and 10 May. Their capture enabled Bletchley Park to read all the German naval codes for some time and provided the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations.[12] By 13:00 hours, both the infantry landing ships Princess Beatrix and Queen Emma had embarked all their troops and were ready to sail.[10] With them came 300 volunteers for the Free Norwegian Forces in Britain.[7]
Aftermath [ edit ]
After the raid, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill issued a memo "to all concerned ... my congratulations on the very satisfactory operation". Claymore was the first of twelve commando raids directed against Norway during the Second World War.[13] The Germans eventually increased the number of troops in Norway and by 1944, the German garrison was 370,000 men strong (A British infantry division in 1944 had an establishment of 18,347 men).[14][15] No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos became part of the 1st Special Service Brigade and took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944.[citation needed]

(ANTIMEDIA) On February 6th, Former Madison police officer Eric Sloan Parker slammed an Indian grandfather face first to the pavement, showing the world what happens if you visit America without understanding the violent nature of a police state. 57-year-old Sureshbhai Patel was hospitalized and partially paralyzed from the attack. A video of the initial incident is embedded below:
The cop, who was fired shortly after the incident, is actually receiving federal charges after being indicted by a grand jury on Thursday. Eric Parker will be charged with using unreasonable force, which is a felony.
Authorities also apologized to the government of India. According to an article from Yahoo News, “Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley previously apologized to the Indian government for the treatment of Patel, calling it a case of excessive force.”
Defense Attorney for the officer, Robert Tuten, had the audacity to say “We are shocked, disappointed and overwhelmed by all the ways Eric Parker is coming under attack […] However, we are looking forward to seeing the indictment and having our day in court.”
What about the victim Mr. Tuten? Do we live in a world where the officer who instigated this violent act is the one under attack? Not the other way around? One man is irreversibly paralyzed, but let's just disregard that for the Stockholm Syndrome-like unconditional love for police that is being perpetuated here.
However, this news is a step closer to a potential victory that must be celebrated, must be widely acknowledged to raise morale for the police accountability movement.
Most of the police who murder unarmed people get away with it, and frankly the lack of results from our continued activism efforts to hold cops accountable made public interest in the crimes of police decline in an incredibly dramatic way.
Endurance is the word. As concerned citizens trying to dis-empower corruption, violent police, and the police state as a whole, we must endure and keep at it. We must also question our methods, refine them and get creative.
Never stop. Please share this with as many people as possible, and let's recognize a victory when we see one. Let's push for this to really be a victory by doing everything we can to make sure justice is served to Eric Parker.

The EU is regularly derided by its legions of detractors and critics for its penchant for stringent (and often excessive) regulatory oversight. Though there maybe some grain of truth in such criticism, the EU MPs have shown time and again that they can arrive at really sensible decisions on important issues. In a recent vote on the issue of evolving financial technologies behind cryptocurrencies , the MEPs chose to err on the side of caution rather than go for high handed oversight.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been around for nearly 7 years now. Though the currencies themselves have remained on the fringes save for the occasional bad press for alleged links to criminal activity, the actual technology behind them have attracted considerable attention from mainstream financial institutions and banks. Hailed as the next big thing in financial technology, small tech startups and the big enterprises alike are exploring ways to integrate them into mainstream financial services.
Governments and regulatory agencies can ill-afford to ignore blockchains simply due to their sheer disruptive potential. Yet excessive regulation at such an early stage could very well inhibit innovation vital for the evolution of the technology. But the technology can also pose significant security and law enforcement headaches if left unattended.
In this context, the report submitted by German Socialist MEP Jakob von Weiszacker has received the vote of approval from the EU Parliament. The report calls for the creation of a general fintech task force that will look at all emerging technologies including cryptocurrency technologies. Voicing their approval for the decision, Finance Commissioner Jonathan Hill said: “….this is both an important and exciting area and I welcome the very balanced approach to keep an eye on developments, embrace the opportunities but be alert to the dangers.”
With the creation of such task-force, MEPs hope to stay on top of the latest developments in the fast evolving field of blockchain technologies. The plan at least, is to foster innovation in the field while remaining fully equipped to enforce legislation if and when the need arises in future. As to the efficacy of this plan, the future alone holds the answers.
Beirut (AFP) - Syria's main opposition High Negotiations Committee on Wednesday flatly rejected a demand from President Bashar al-Assad for any transitional government to include their regime.
"International resolutions speak of... the formation of a transitional body with full powers, including presidential powers," HNC senior member Asaad al-Zoabi said, adding "Assad should not remain for even one hour after the formation" of this body.
"Bashar and their gang live outside of reality, on another planet... all of Assad's recent declarations are an attempt to evade the question" of the transition, Zoabi told AFP.
Assad made the demand in an interview with Russia's RIA Novosti state news agency published on Wednesday.
The Syrian leader said it would be "logical for there to be independent forces, opposition forces and forces loyal to the government represented" in any transitional body.
They did not specify which opposition groups should be included in the government but their remarks come with Damascus facing international pressure to compromise at UN-mediated talks aimed at ending the five-year conflict that has killed some 270,000 people.
The talks led by UN envoy Staffan de Mistura paused last week with the sides deadlocked over the fate of Assad, whom the opposition insists must leave power before a transitional government is agreed.
The form of the executive body that would lead Syria until its elections the UN says should be held in 18 months is the main bone of contention between the two sides.
UN Security Council Resolution 2254 vaguely suggests the establishment of a body to head the political transition.
For the regime, this amounts to a government reshuffle in which the opposition is included, but for the opposition it would be a transitional body with presidential powers and no role for Assad.
"We aren't concerned about Assad's interpretation of the transitional period... we must move to a new stage based on a pluralistic regime, civil and democratic," said Zoabi.
Gifts For Enlightened Ingress Players
Do you get dragged out for a walk at random times or to random places? Does your partner choose a restaurant or bar based on how many portals are within easy range?

Ingress is one of the most addictive games I've come across in a long while and yes, I do walk longer routes just to snag that extra portal hack!
My partner is also addicted to Ingress so it works well for us, but it did take me a little while to adjust. Walking down the street with them nose deep in their phone was frustrating so I gave up and joined in. Now it's a matter of which one of us watches the traffic and guides the other across the road without getting ran over.

Darren Reynolds has now been jailed (Picture: Essex Police)
A sex offender who whistled and flashed at a 12-year-old girl has been jailed, after the judge told him: ‘Nobody wants to see your flaccid penis.'
Darren Reynolds, a 47-year-old from Chelmsford in Essex, flashed the girl on July 14 as they walked home from school.
Police rake in £1,700,000 after selling seized items on eBay
Their victim was walking down the street when they heard a whistle. They turned around and saw Reynolds standing in the doorway of a house with their pants down.
The girl ran home to tell their parents what had happened, and after describing the suspect to police, officers went to Reynolds' home.
After reluctantly answering the door they denied the offence, Essex Live reported, telling officers that they were walking in Hylands Park at the time.
They pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Magistrates Court (Picture: PA)
However, on Wednesday they pleaded guilty to one count of exposure at Chelmsford Magistrates Court.

This is their third exposure offence, having been convicted of flashing children in 2002, and then again in 2011.

Deputy District Judge Johnson told Reynolds: ‘You have a history of offending. Offences of this nature can have a significant impact, and indeed a lifelong impact, on those it is committed. It is not acceptable to behave in this manner.
‘Nobody wants to see your flaccid penis in public Mr Reynolds. You need to stop exposing yourself.'
Reynolds was sentenced to a six month term, with three months in custody and another three months on licence.
They were also ordered to pay a £115 victim surcharge.
Public Transport Victoria is now seeking to have a schoolkid charged for cybercrime, despite said schoolkid alerted them to a security vulnerability that would allow someone to access the personal information of nearly 600,000 public transport users.
The database was for the old Metcard store – which was shut down as part of the transition from Metlink to Public Transport Victoria – and contained, according to The Age, full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Senior Card ID numbers, and partial credit card numbers. The flaw – described as being a very common problem – has since been fixed by PTV.
Joshua Rogers, 16, said that they found the vulnerability after hitting an error page when trying to find the price of Myki tickets for Boxing Day. “Just from basic instinct I knew what the error meant and how it could be leveraged for database access,” they told the ABC.
Legally speaking, Rogers did break the law because they illegally accessed the database because they aren't authorised to do so. But I'm in the view that it would be a mistake to charge him. They found the problem and alerted PTV. If they didn't, then I wonder how long before it was found by someone else – especially when a recent report from the Victorian Auditor-General found more than 100 problems across the entire State Government's IT infrastructure.
Just be thankful that they accessed the database and not someone else. Otherwise, there would be a total shitstorm if that information was dumped online.

AMAZING SHOW! First. I'd like to give a few shout-outs to people that I met at the show. Todd, Ashley and Kim! It was great to meet the three of you! I hope to see you posting on here!
Also, thank you to Adam, Jade and Hunter for coming out later after the show to sign stuff and get their photos taken with all of us! There were roughly 50-70 fans that stuck around after the show. Also, thank you to the guy who handed out the extra setlists to to us who were waiting! It's the FIRST set list I have ever gotten (PICTURED BELOW). I actually had brought a magazine spread, Black Sails EP and Days of the Phoenix EP to get signed, but I ended up just getting the magazine spread and set list signed by the band.
Thank you, SMITH!!! For those who may not know, Smith is Jade's brother who I believe is still their tour manager and has been for many years. Smith was walking around getting things wrapped up later after the show and I said Hi to them and asked them to sign my set list. They drew an OLDSCHOOL AFI LOGO!!! The same logo that's on the earlier records (7"s) like “Behind the Times”. Smith is super-fantastic and was great enough to let everyone know that Davey had actually already left… no fans left though.
Smith was also awesome enough to take my set list into AFI's tour bus and have Jade sign it!
Fun fact: Davey recognized Father's Day during the show just before they played “6 to 8”. Davey mentioned that their Father is one of their longest supporters and that their Father was actually there at the show!!! So naturally, Davey probably left with their Dad right after. Unfortunately, I did not record this part but someone else may have. It wasn't easy to record from where my wife and I were… but that was a good thing!
Here are the two main videos that I recorded. I recorded most of “I Hope You Suffer” mainly because I knew Davey would be entering the audience. I also got their 2nd encore, which was “Totalimmortal”. Davey was almost RIGHT BESIDE ME!!! They say in the video, “It's so hard to get to the floor” and then, “this is so '91”, AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! This was my 6th time seeing AFI and this show was the BEST of all.
LASTLY, if you're reading this, PLEASE register to this forum and post your experiences! I'm trying to create a new community forum JUST FOR AFI FANS. SInce the official forums are still down, I've decided (thinking about it for months beforehand) to start my own. I've been running another forum of 2 million+ posts since 2009. Trust me - I am dedicated.
So, please join! It's quick and FREE!
Thanks again to Adam, Jade and Hunter for being so great and humble to the fans after the show!!!

The French government has proposed six-month travel bans to stop citizens travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside Islamist militants.
A new offence of creating an "individual terrorist enterprise", designed to counter the threat of "lone wolves", would also be established.
Government officials say that two or three young Muslims leave France every day to join Islamist groups abroad.
There are fears they will eventually pose a threat to France itself.
A French citizen arrested for the killing of four people at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May, Mehdi Nemmouche, had returned from Syria, after being radicalised in prison.
Another French-born jihadist, Mohamed Merah, killed seven people in Toulouse in 2012 before being shot by police. Their victims were three paratroopers as well as three children and a teacher at a Jewish school.
EU counter-terrorism coordinator Gille de Kerchove announced on Tuesday that interior ministers from nine countries had adopted an action plan to identify people travelling to Syria and stop them falling into terrorism on their return.
The countries that signed up to the plan are Belgium, France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands
The UK has threatened to cancel passports of jihadists
UK courts have tried a number of people for the offence of preparing to carry out terrorist acts
The Netherlands has refused passports to at least 10 citizens suspected of planning to travel to Syria for jihad
Seven Dutch militants were reported killed in Syria on Wednesday
Germany believes it has some 300 nationals fighting in Syria
Freedom of Schengen
The French bill would allow the authorities to impose six-month travel bans on people suspected of planning to make the trip to the danger zone.
Young Muslims planning to join militant groups like Isis (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) travel on low-cost tourist flights to Turkey, then are met by contacts who take them across the Syrian border.
Under the new bill, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve would be able to impose a renewable six-month travel ban on individuals who have been identified by the intelligence services.
These people would have their passports confiscated and in theory be unable to travel - though, in fact, because of the border-free Schengen zone, they will still be able to move about inside the EU, right up to the Greek border with Turkey, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.
The "individual terrorist enterprise" clause is meant to counter the threat of solitary Islamists, acting outside organised structures and planning personal acts of terrorism on French soil.
Details of the EU action plan were confidential, Mr Kerchove said after interior ministers met in the Italian city of Milan. The plan is due to be discussed further in October.
Sky•Getty Sir Richard Branson hit out at Donald Trump's environmental plans
The multi-billionaire said it is “extremely worrying” Mr Trump is reversing the “positive moves” Barack Obama and George W Bush did before him. Moments after Mr Trump's inauguration on Friday the White House's climate change webpage had been wiped and today Mr Trump signed executive orders to allow two oil pipelines to go ahead which Barack Obama had halted last year. Addressing the new president in a Sky News interview, the Virgin Group founder said: “People who make a lot of money out of things that aren't doing the environment any good need to change.
“The coal industry for example is on its knees, although I'm sure Trump will do their best to save it. “It shouldn't be saved, it should die a graceful death and people should move from coal to green energies.
Getty Donald Trump signed five executive orders to allow controversial pipelines to go ahead
“I find it astonishing what he's had to say about the environment and about rolling back, I think, the positive moves President Obama and even President Bush and other people have done before. “Obviously it's extremely worrying and therefore I think business leaders worldwide are going to have to step in and work with the public in doing what we believe to be right.” A post on the White House website after Mr Trump's inauguration suggests the new US President will scrap the America's strategy to tackle climate change.
A proposal in Donald Trump's 'America First Energy Plan' suggests getting rid of “burdensome regulations on our energy industry”. This includes “harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rule”.

Getty Richard Branson has long been a fighter for the environment
Sir Richard also said they and their team will attempt to persuade Mr Trump of the “scientific merits” of looking after the environment. They added: “We've lobbied every new government that comes into power to persuade them of the scientific merits of our case and we'll certainly try to do the same with the Trump administration as we have done with other administrations where it was easier as we were knocking on an open door.” Earlier today Mr Trump claimed to be an “environmentalist” during a meeting of automobile industry leaders. They said: “Our friends that wanna build in the United States, they go many, many years and then they can't get the environmental permit over something that nobody ever heard of before.
“And it's absolutely crazy. I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist. I believe in it. But it's out of control. “We want regulations, but we want real regulations that mean something.” The majority of Mr Trump's cabinet, most who have not yet been sworn-in, are either close to the fossil fuels industry or deny climate change exists. Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt is to become head of the Environmental Protection Agency despite leading a lawsuit from 28 states against the agency's clean power plan, an Obama initiative to cut carbon pollution from coal power plants. They also wrote the debate on climate change is “far from settled”.

Perhaps inspired by Jay-Z and Beyoncé's 22-day vegan diet or the recent outing of Al Gore as a newly turned vegan, news outlets on both sides of the Atlantic are already declaring 2014 the year of the vegan. Such popularity was unfathomable 70 years ago, when Vegan Society founder Donald Watson first created a separate term for milk-and-egg-free vegetarians. Here, a quick primer on veganism's outliers-to-Oprah path.
1944
Rejecting reader suggestions like dairyban and sanivore, Watson picks vegan as the name for a nondairy, eggless, vegetarian diet. Also dismissed: vegetarian and fruitarian, because they're two words already associated with societies that allow the fruits' of cows and fowls.

Bearded bohemian guru Father Yod opens the Source restaurant, a vegan hot spot on L.A.'s Sunset Strip that attracts celebrity eaters from Marlon Brando to John Lennon.
1981
Straight Edge, a 46-second track by punk band Minor Threat, takes aim at drugs and boozing, spawning the so-called straightedge subculture. Many adherents become vegans, too, with extremists finding homes with groups like the Animal Liberation Front.
1991
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine proposes a radical overhaul of the USDA's four food groups: a meatless quad of fruits, legumes, whole grains, and vegetables. Farmers laugh at it as the height of irresponsibility. A year later, the USDA introduces the food-guide pyramid with meat and dairy occupying little sections at the top.
1992
Weird Al Yankovic joins the fast-growing list of vegan celebs after they read Diet for a New America. (The same year, Paul McCartney, a vegetarian, refuses to let Yankovic parody Live and Let Die as Chicken Pot Pie.) Asked in a fanzine how they justify playing at the annual Great American Rib Cook-Off, they say, The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I'm not a student anymore.
2002
Marrying Dada and animal-rights activism, artist Jonathan Horowitz closes their Go Vegan! exhibition in Chelsea with Tofu on Pedestal in Gallery, a bit of bean curd floating in water. Times art critic Ken Johnson calls it a quiet, quasi-religious plea for dietary change.
2008
Celebrity veganism's tastemakers Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have a vegan wedding catered by chef Tal Ronnen, who the same year prepares Oprah's 21-day vegan cleanse, meant to remind the media mogul how the food we consume every day got to be on our plates.

White House: Court has no authority to demand e-mails Stephen C. Webster
Published: Saturday January 17, 2009
Print This Email This A federal court has been rebuffed by the outgoing Bush administration, as the White House has refused an order to provide e-mails that had gone missing but were allegedly found.
According to court documents filed Friday, the White House asserts that not all parts of the administration are held to the Federal Records Act. The White House also claimed it had uncovered over 14 million e-mails, but has provided no further details.
According to published reports, responding to the White House, US Magistrate Judge John Facciola reiterated the order, insisting the administration comply and search all systems for the e-mails.
The Washington Post reported Thursday that Helen H. Hong had stated at a court hearing that "private contractors had helped find the e-mails by searching through an estimated 60,000 tapes that contain daily recordings of the entire contents of the White House computers as a precaution against an electronic disaster."
With President-elect Obama's inauguration looming just days away, the District Court of the District of Columbia issued the directive instructing the Executive Office of the President (EOP) to search its computers and ordering EOP staff "to surrender any media in their possession that may contain e-mails from March 2003 to October 2005."
In February of 2008, a former Bush administration employee said at a congressional hearing that the White House's "primitive" archiving system may have lost more than a million emails.
Soon after Bush was first elected, as RAW STORY reported on Nov. 24, the White House dismantled the records management system that President Bill Clinton had implemented, replacing it with an unreliable system that led to the massive number of email deletions from White House servers.
Similar communications losses apparently struck former top Bush adviser Karl Rove, when a Republican National Committee lawyer admitted in 2007 that at least four years of emails sent by Rove had "gone missing." The admission came as Congress investigated the controversial dismissals of US Attorneys by the Bush Justice Department.
In February of 2008, a former Bush administration employee said at a congressional hearing that the White House's "primitive" archiving system may have lost more than a million emails over 1,000 days.
Ironically, Cheney's office is missing emails from the very day President Bush told reporters he'd "take care of" whatever staff member had leaked the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame.
Cheney's office also is missing e-mails from Oct. 4, 2003, when the Justice Department demanded that the White House turn over "all documents that relate in any way" to the leak of Plame's identity. E-mails are also missing for the following day, during which the probe intensified and CIA director George Tenet found themselves at the center of it, "caught between their loyalty to the president and defending an agency enraged" at Plame's exposure, according to the New York Times.
As US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald's probe into the Plame case continued over the next few years, emails continued to disappear, CREW said. More e-mails were missing from Cheney's office on Feb. 16, 2005, when a court ordered reporters who had discussed Plame's identity with administration officials to testify about those conversations.
All in all, some 473 days of emails are missing from various Administration departments, according to a House Democrat who saw a White House presentation on the files.
Correction: An earlier version of this article asserted that the White House invoked executive privilege in their filing. The White House's legal argument is narrower, claiming that some of the emails fall outside the purview of the Federal Records Act.
About
"Through The Fire" is a romantic comedy about a couple of dazzling New York urbanites who are set-up on the worst blind date ever, only to find out they have more in common than they realize. Despite their professional differences (she is an acclaimed Broadway actor and they are the theater critic who gave them a horrible review) they cannot get each other out of their minds. "Through The Fire" shows what happens in the ultimate battle between the head and the heart.
I am making this movie, along with several of my friends from Star Trek, because we want to get back to the craft of filmmaking. Our formula is simple…. great script, great actors, great crew, and great directing, equals great profitability.
We also want to show the the people who run Hollywood that "sci-fi" fans are not only interested in science fiction, but are multidimensional and a force to be reckoned with.
Directing this movie means "Freedom" for me. All I've ever wanted from the beginning is to have the artistic freedom to choose the projects that speak to me and this is my chance. Why Kickstarter? I love the Internet. It's one of the most useful tools ever invented and we are just starting to see the potential for artists to get their projects directly out to the people. Your help will make this movie a reality and everything you pledge will go straight to toward that goal.
Like Worf, the character I have played for so many years, I have always had a strong "logical/rebellious" or "Logibellious" streak in me. From an early age people have told me what I can and can't do. It was nothing malicious, but my logical mind would look around and see examples of other individuals doing exactly what I was told couldn't be done. I had to ask my favorite question... "Why?"
My favorite answer is "Why not?" Without exception, this has led to great success.
From the film "Field of Dreams," "If you build it, they will come." Together, let's make this dream a reality.
Thank you!
Imagine you're sitting in a freezing classroom in a foreign country trying to learn a difficult language. Suddenly the class is interrupted by a distant yet very loud explosion. You look out the window and see smoke rise on a nearby mountain. “Bunkers. They destroy them for money” the teacher says. The lesson continues. Then an explosion happens again 20 minutes later. then again.
Thus was my first experience with today's blog topic: Albania's debunkerization.
Something unique to Albania is its system of 700,000 steel an concrete bunkers scattered across this tiny country. “Bunkerization” of Albania occurred under communism in response to the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia and increasing political isolation following Albania's falling out with Yugoslavia, the USSR, China, and almost everyone else in the world. While the extreme paranoia on Dictator Enver Hoxha's part may make us smirk, let's remember that the cold war as a whole was a crazy endeavor: For decades, humanity was ready to destroy itself… to defend itself. Some countries built inter-continental nuclear missiles. Albania built bunkers.
Today, these bunkers are disappearing one by one.
How do thousands of concrete and steal bunkers just disappear?
Money and Explosives. Albania remains very poor and each bunker, which has no clear owner, is filled with valuable metal that can be sold for scrap. A normal little bunker can fetch 35000 new leke or a little under $350 in scrap. Considering youth unemployment is around 30% and GDP per capita is around $4000, these bunkers may as well be filled with gold.
This informal de-bunkerization for scrap has had a more formal counterpart on the coasts. Once lined with bunkers, beaches are now relatively bunker-free for tourists. In fact, I recently visited a cemetery for dismembered bunkers on the far end of the beach boardwalk in Durres.
Among Albanians, the bunkers are not seen as “cool” or “historic” or otherwise worth preserving. If anything, they're understandably seen as relics from an embarrassing past. This differs with the value tourists, albanianists, and historic preservationists see in bunkers. I've noticed Albanians rarely see the touristic value of their country (besides the beaches), but that's a topic for another post.
Save the Whales Bunkers!
Any bunker preservation program would have to involve overcoming the financial incentive to destroy them for scrap with a greater financial incentive. The program would need regular monitoring, a systematic inventory of all preserved bunkers geo-referenced, and of course funding. All of this in a country that still doesn't have water 24/7 and where mountain people are stunted by malnutrition. You can see why such a program would face challenges.
So what is the fate of these ubiquitous bunkers? Before we lament their disappearance, let' s remember 700,000 of them were built and that they're spread out all over the country. I doubt we will see them all removed but they will certainly become increasingly rare and less visible at this rate. Looking at old photographs, I can tell they are already much less present today than they had been 20 years ago.
Here are some ways to understand debunkerization:
Compensatory Albanians suffered under communism and now have a chance to be financially compensated by the communist system by blowing up its bunkers. Metaphorical As time passes, the psychological and cultural effects of almost 50 years of Stalinism are fading. The bunkers, ubiquitous physical reminders of the former system, are fading as well. Economic Barometer The more wealthy Albanians become, the less financially appealing blowing up the bunkers will be. Challenge to Historical Preservation. Preserving items from a dark history is fraught with challenges. However, that these bunkers are a significant part of the Albanian physical historic landscape and unique in the world cannot be denied.
Until something changes, Albania will continue to be de-bunkerized. For better or worse.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain warned President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that Russia could face permanent exclusion from the G8 if the Kremlin took further steps against Ukraine.
“I think we should be discussing whether or not to expel Russia permanently from the G8 if further steps are taken,” Prime Minister David Cameron told the British parliament.
The United States and its G7 allies will gather next week at The Hague without Russia to consider a further response to the Kremlin's moves to annex Ukraine's Crimea region.
Cameron called for a strong response from European Union states, whose leaders meet later this week in Brussels and are expected to discuss details of further sanctions on Russia.
The EU agreed earlier this week to impose asset freezes and travel bans on 21 individuals linked to the action in Crimea.
Cameron said that Russia would face economic sanctions if it took further steps to destabilize Ukraine such as sending troops into eastern Ukraine.
“If we turn away from this crisis and don't act we will pay a very high price in the longer-term,” they said.
As a chemical engineer who studies the motion of fluids, Bill Ristenpart deals with a lot of spattered blood and aerosolized pathogenic mouse phlegm. But when it comes to teaching wary first-year student the basics of mass transfer and thermodynamics, the UC Davis professor relies on a less messy (and more potable) liquid: coffee. Beans go through so many complex chemical changes that they can easily form the basis of a whole curriculum.
Findings From UC Davis' Java Studies
1. Research confirms that buying the same bag of beans every week doesn't guarantee the same flavor. Even if that roast looks just as dark as your last batch, hyperspectral imaging might reveal it's suspiciously light.
2. Hints of cardboard, anyone? Coffee tasters tend to get pretty creative with their descriptions, so the lab built a data-driven flavor wheel to standardize the way we talk about coffee. It's the first step on a hunt for molecules responsible for specific coffee flavor notes.
3. Enzyme-treated coffee grounds could become the next hot microbi­ome therapy. Like breast milk, they're loaded with oligosac­charides, sugars that promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut.
Ristenpart's three year-old course, the Design of Coffee, has become the most popular chemical engineering class in the country, enrolling a quarter of Davis' freshmen. After spending the semester deconstructing coffeemakers and determining pH levels by taste, the 500-odd students compete to engineer the tastiest brew using the least amount of energy. Which isn't easy, Ristenpart says, because “we know very little about coffee.” Though Americans down some 400 million cups a day, US researchers don't typically study it; there's little incentive for agencies like the USDA to fund research on a crop grown thousands of miles away in the tropics. Nearly everything about java, from the microbial intricacies of fermentation to the molecular basis of flavor, remains a mystery.
Take the harvesting process. Coffee seeds come from a cherry-like fruit that's stripped away and discarded, producing roughly 500 pounds of waste for every 100 pounds of seeds. Studying alternative uses for that pulp is as much about public health as it is about sustainability, Ristenpart explains: Much of it ends up dumped in nearby waterways. Post-harvest, the green seeds sit around in open air pits for 20 to 24 hours, where sugar-munching microbes induce fermentation—thought to be key to producing beans with complex, nuanced flavor. But it's an untested convention. "It's astonishing to me that in 2017 there isn't consensus over whether fermentation even happens," says Ristenpart.
Those mysteries are mostly out of sight for American coffee drinkers, but recently that's begun to change. As home kitchens have become mini-coffee labs filled with small-batch specialty roasts and hyper-precision coffee scales, consumers are demanding more coffee science and data. So Ristenpart is overseeing the development of a 6,000-square-foot center—with a initial funding from Peet's Coffee—devoted to coffee research: sustainability, chemical makeup, and preparation protocols. Last month, researchers affiliated with the center released the first public genome of the Coffea arabica plant*, *which researchers hope will lead to insights into production and taste. Ristenpart's next target? The industry's sacred brewing guidelines—calibrated, as Ristenpart tells it, to the tastes of 1950s housewives. “There are all these rules of thumb out there,” they say, “but very rarely does anyone have hard data to back it up.” Hear that, coffee snobs? Time to go back to school.

It's been more than a year since fans got to see Evil Geniuses' Kevin "PPMD" Nanney compete, but the "Super Smash Bros. Melee" player has confirmed via a Facebook post that they will be playing at next month's Bad Moon Rising 2, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, albeit in doubles only.
The post, which was on the private North Carolina Melee group, stated that they would be making a reappearance to see Adam "LoZR" Jones off with one final doubles hurrah.
"I decided to compete in doubles only because my very long time friend and early rival, LoZR, is having their last ever major tournament appearance here and we had a great teams run back in the day," PPMD said in a statement to ESPN.
PPMD is considered one of the best Melee players of all time, dubbed one of the five "gods" of the game. But in 2016 PPMD took an extended hiatus from the game citing depression. PPMD has been open with their fans about their depression and ongoing recovery.
"It's going pretty well now that I found something that seems to really be working," PPMD said without wanting to go into specifics about their treatment.
PPMD's doubles appearance at Bad Moon Rising 2 gives fans hope that there's a possibility for them to return to single this year.
"It is possible the return won't be this year. However, it looks like odds are definitely in my favor to return this year, especially with how great the past five weeks of the new program have been for my progress," PPMD said.
It will be a treat for fans to see one of the most talented and cerebral players grace the game once again. PPMD will also play friendlies and interact with fans while at the tournament.
"It gives me great joy that people are still willing to stick by me despite my struggles. However, interacting with fans can also be very tiring if done too long, so it can sort of help and hurt in a way, I suppose," PPMD said.
PPMD did caution that if they begin to feel tired, they might exit the venue early and retire for the evening.
Other notable attendees include Panda Global's Justin "Plup" McGrath, Renegades' James "Swedish Delight" Liu, and Team Allegiance's Edgard "n0ne" Sheleby. Bad Moon Rising 2 will take place on July 1.

Ireland is a nation of heavy drinkers while our consumption of ecstasy is the second-highest in the world, the latest Global Drug Survey has revealed.
The detailed study claims that the country's reputation for heavy drinking is “well-deserved” while cannabis remains Ireland's illegal drug of choice.
The disclosure that Ireland had higher rates of drinkers at risk of dependence on alcohol than all other countries surveyed will be a major cause of concern to health authorities here.
The country's dysfunctional relationship with alcohol is also confirmed in the finding that Irish people had the highest rates of getting drunk and of attending A&E departments afterwards.
The Global Drug Survey report states: “Ireland's reputation for heavy drinking is well deserved.
“Not only did Ireland have higher rates of drinkers at risk of dependence, they report needing to drink more alcohol than almost any other country to get as drunk as they would want to be but they also had the highest rates of getting more drunk more often than they wanted to.”

The report also states that drinkers are often afraid to go their own GP in case “their doctor would tell them to drink less” so instead go to the A&E after drinking.
Around 2.8% of the Irish surveyed said they sought emergency treatment after drinking within the last 12 months - with Brazil the next highest, at 2.2%.
The research found that cannabis remains the country's illegal drug of choice despite it being more expensive here, €25 a gram, than in most other countries.
But it appears that Irish users prefer the natural product rather than going for the synthetic variety which is less than half the price but is more damaging to health.

In another finding that will worry the medical profession the survey found that consumption of ecstasy in Ireland is the second-highest in the world.
It says 1.98 ecstasy pills are taken per session here, with only Australia higher at 2.10 pills.
But there is some good news as the report showed Ireland was well behind most other countries when it came to tobacco consumption.
Less than 10% of Irish people said they smoked - compared to almost 15% in France and Canada, and over 20% in the US.
The online survey was completed by 2,392 people here making it one of the most comprehensive studies on drug use in this country.
Zipcar, the unique car-sharing service that provides an alternative set of wheels, is expanding to a new inner-city neighborhood: Deep Ellum. The expansion comprises two vehicles with cute nicknames: Clarice, a Ford C-Max, and Shahbaz, a Hyundai Elantra.
"We have, in fact, expanded to Deep Ellum," says Zipcar spokesperson Katelyn Chesley. "We've teamed up with the Deep Ellum Community Association (DECA) to do events and marketing with them going forward."
Zipcar rents out vehicles by the hour and the day. They can be reserved 24/7 to anyone over 21 (or 18 and up for students on Zipcar-affiliated campuses).
Low hourly rates start at $8.50 an hour, with gas, insurance, a dedicated parking spot for easy pickup and return, and 180 free miles per day.
The two Deep Ellum cars are located behind Cafe Brazil, on Malcolm X between Elm Street and Gaston Avenue. That's within walking distance of not only clubs and restaurants, but also the Baylor University Medical Center station.
Zipcar's mission is to enable simple and responsible urban living. Its car-sharing service helps remove personally owned vehicles from the road, which reduces emissions, traffic, and congestion and allows for shorter commute times and more parking spot availability.
Zipcar first entered the Dallas market in September 2014. There are vehicles in downtown parking lots, including Pioneer Plaza; Oak Lawn Library; and Lamar, in the lot under Woodall Rodgers Freeway. Zipcars are also located at Dallas Farmers Market, Love Field Airport, University of Texas at Dallas, Southern Methodist University, and Texas Christian University, as well as along DART Rail transit lines.
Drivers gain access to Zipcars by swiping their membership card across the dashboard — no keys required.
Zipcar's network in Texas also includes programs in Austin, Houston, Dallas, as well as universities in Fort Worth and San Antonio.
For the past few years, the biggest fight in the music industry has been against ad-supported music. Apple attempted to kill Spotify's free tier before it launched Apple Music; the industry has railed against what it perceives as low payments from YouTube for years; and SoundCloud, one of the most popular ad-supported streaming sites in the world, is on the brink of collapse. But the truth is that ad-supported streaming isn't going anywhere. YouTube is too big to fail at this point, and labels have largely come to terms with Spotify's free tier due to its high conversion rate. Getting to scale, everyone acknowledges, requires bringing in users who might not pay at first.
So how will it coexist in a music industry increasingly dominated by paid streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music? Executives from Warner Music, YouTube, SoundExchange, Pandora, and iHeartMedia sat down for a panel at the New Music Seminar in New York on Wednesday night. The event was moderated by Tom Silverman, the founder and chairperson of Tommy Boy Records and the founder of the New Music Seminar. The group discussed why ad revenues aren't growing as fast as expected, the benefits of ad-supported services, and why the music industry should be more supportive of streaming services.
Streaming now brings in the majority of revenue for the music industry
“It takes time,” Lyor Cohen, YouTube's head of music said, when Silverman asked why YouTube isn't monetizing its ads at a higher rate. Last year, ad-supported streaming like YouTube and SoundCloud's free service brought in $469 million in revenue for the music industry, according to the RIAA. Paid streaming services pulled in $2.47 billion. Cohen pointed toward the slow adoption of hip-hop within the music industry in the ‘80s — they were president of Def Jam Records in the late ‘80s — as a correlation to what's going on now with advertisers and streaming music.
“I remember there was at least seven years of incubation for Russell [Simmons], Rick [Rubin], and myself at CBS. Rap music was exploding, the supply outpaced the demand, and it was happening all over the city. CBS was a New York-based company, and all they had to do was drive about 60 blocks and realize how many kids were trying to get into a venue, and they would've said, ‘Oh my god, this stuff is really incredible and special. Let's invest in it.' They didn't invest in it.” Cohen said CBS didn't catch on to what was happening in hip-hop until the son of then-Columbia Records president Donnie Ienner wanted to go to a Public Enemy concert instead of a Bruce Springsteen show that the label finally woke up.
Streaming now brings in the majority of revenue for the music industry. In 2016, ad-supported streaming grew 26 percent from the previous year, while paid streaming grew 95 percent year over year.
“Look at what's happening with SoundCloud.”
Cohen also noted that the music industry needs to forge better relationships with streaming services in order to build better products, instead of just signing over licensing deals and leaving everything up to the tech companies. They pointed toward SoundCloud as an example of where collaboration could have helped.
“We're scared to death and we typically stomp them out,” Cohen said. “Look at what's happening with SoundCloud. What a sad experience that they're experiencing right now. To me, we needed to collaborate with them in order for them to help build a business, whether it's an advertising business or an opportunity for them to shepherd their consumers to a potential subscription.”
The longtime music executive went on to note that YouTube is working on combining YouTube Red with Google Play Music to give users a single offering — which, given their statements during the evening, the music industry may have a hand in shaping more than ever before (if Cohen gets their way).
As talks shifted to whether ad-supported services help or hurt paid streaming services, Warner Music's chief digital officer Ole Obermann noted that ad-supported services are so good that there may not be enough incentive to upgrade to paid services, a point that was echoed by Mark Eisenberg, SoundExchange's senior vice president of strategic initiatives.
“Some people will never pay for a subscription for a variety of reasons.”
“I think ad-supported and paid streaming are complimentary, and they will always exist together,” Eisenberg said. “Some people will never pay for a subscription for a variety of reasons, but it doesn't mean that [streaming services aren't] monetizing them. We just have to figure out a way to make an ecosystem work for all. I think the difficulty is segmentation. If you're offering the exact same product and features and experience — paid or ad-supported — I think some will go to the lower-cost consumer product. So you have to do that differentiation, which I don't think we've done yet in the industry. I think we're starting to get there, in terms of segmentation of catalog, feature sets, and mobility.”
Streaming services like Spotify would point out that its free product has been quite limiting, with users only being able to listen to music on shuffle, and now that it nearly has its label deals wrapped up, artists and labels will also have the ability to limit new releases to the premium tier for up to two weeks, giving them more flexibility and control.
But even if ad-supported services do everything the music industry wants, it would still be incredibly difficult to close the revenue gap on paid streaming, which grew 95 percent year over year. So how do they increase their value? According to Cohen, YouTube will use its machine learning capabilities — which Cohen says drives 80 percent of watch time on the platform — to help break new artists. “YouTube is not only going to build a fabulous subscription business to complement its advertising business, but it's going to work with the industry to help break their acts.”
Distribution, in other words, is a carrot YouTube is holding out during these negotiations, something beyond revenue that tech platforms might provide to their partners in the music industry. For now, however, YouTube still has a long way to go before it gets to a place where it can shift its negative reputation in the music industry into a positive one.
No Man's Sky's been out for a week, and tons of players have started exploring its vast universe. But many have also begun to notice that the final game doesn't exactly mirror its pre-release demos. Today, a player published an exhaustive list of all the different ways No Man's Sky changed over the course of its development.
Reddit user MeetWayneKerr posted in the No Man's Sky subreddit, laying out a number of features that developer Hello Games said would be in the game but didn't make the cut. These include things like the ability to land on asteroids, planetary mechanics, different ship classes, and a huge number of other features. MeetWayneKerr also cites every one of these features with videos or quotes from interviews with Hello Games' team members.
It's worth noting that some of this might be unfair--all games change drastically from announcement to release, and it's likely that expectations for the game were slightly unrealistic. In addition, Hello Games has already said that it will be adding many new features after launch, so some of these omissions may be remedied in the coming months.
However, the post is still a good look into the difficulties facing developers as they attempt to simultaneously market and make their games.
At the moment, Hello Games is hard at work on ironing out issues with the game, and it is working on a patch that'll be released soon. You can read more about the PC version of the patch here.

It's very impressive what this game achieves through simplifying and formalizing some of the archetypical RPG gameplay elements, like classes, exploration, monster encounters and looting. Four fundamental classes (knight, ranger, mage, priest) are reduced to several abilities (block damage, hit for additional damage, hit all enemies, heal/revive). Player's party has all of those abilities equally represented, while each enemy party can have a varying amount of creatures of each type with additional abilities. The tactical rules are simplified as well: the defensive unit gets all melee attacks, the ranged unit has limited amount of shots that can ignore defensive unit attacks, the magical unit can hit everyone several times, etc. The exploration is also reduced to choosing what party to attack in a highly densely populated room. Enemy encounters present player with a series of small tactical challenges that may not be even recognized as such from the first glance, until the game becomes more punishing (it certainly took a while for me to understand this). Approaching each of the enemy groups, neatly arranged along the ultra symmetric dungeon floor, player has to decide how they want to spend their resources, who they want to attack first, weather they want to raise shield or not, etc. The fights themselves are just visualizations of the results of player-made decisions. Each challenge's goal is to reduce enemy number to zero by minimum attacks and with minimum damage. These miniature tactical challenges are the core of the gameplay. Simplified looting reinforces this idea: each successful fight grants player with a unit of resource, that they are encouraged to spend immediately in one of the following fights.
The game knows very well whit kind of experience it wants to present a player with, and thus strips away all other peripheral elements, such as space traversal, exploration, character placement and equipment, story, detailed setting etc. Due to these minimizations and formalizations game feels very focused and its core mechanics very polished. But also this makes game's reality feel somewhat counterintuitive and little hard to understand at first: dungeons look more like crowded disco-parties, fights animations look confusing, the interface feels overwhelming, and the tactical challenges goals and challenges are not entirely graspable either due to a poor explanation of each monster's abilities. The achievement system intrigued me at first, but since I could not have found any in-game use for those cards, it has ultimately left me somewhat disappointed.
After being barred from the NFL Scouting Combine, St. Joe's grad and NFL Draft-hopeful Chad Kelly was hoping to woo scouts Monday at their Pro Day.
But Kelly's outing was halted after roughly five minutes of throwing when they suffered an apparent wrist injury, according to reporters at Ole Miss.

The cost of providing physician services across Canada climbed 3.7 per cent last year to $25-billion, but payments to individual doctors have essentially flat-lined, newly published data show.
The average clinical payment to physicians was $339,000 in 2015, virtually unchanged from the previous year. This reflects the fact that provinces are increasingly taking a hard line with physicians as they try to contain costs, which has resulted in bitter labour battles, such as the one continuing with Ontario doctors.
Geoff Ballinger, CIHI's (Canadian Institute for Health Information) manager of physician information, cautioned, however, that this number does not represent salaries.
Story continues below advertisement
"It's important to realize that the average payment estimates are gross amounts that in most cases include the overhead costs of running physician practices, such as staff salaries, medical equipment and supplies, and office rent," they said.
(While CIHI does not collect data on overhead costs, an earlier study in Ontario found that average overhead is about 26 per cent of payments, though that varies widely depending on specialty. The highest billers tend to be specialists who do procedures like cataract removal that require expensive equipment.)
Average clinical payments vary considerably between provinces, from a low of $268,000 in Nova Scotia to a high of $366,000 in Alberta.
And payments vary even more broadly based on physicians' specialties. CIHI data show that general practitioners receive, on average, payments of $271,000, compared with $338,000 for specialists and $446,000 for surgical specialists.
For the first time, the CIHI data include both fee-for-service payments and so-called alternative payments.
In Canada, about 70 per cent of physician payments are billed on a fee-for-service basis, meaning doctors are remunerated for specific medical acts based on negotiated fee schedules. Increasingly, physicians are paid salaries, with capitation arrangements (where they are paid a set amount per patient annually), or with a blend of payment methods.
The 3.7-per-cent increase in total physician services spending is the lowest year-over-year hike in 15 years, another indication that provinces are trying to keep a lid on spending.

Yet, the number of physicians continues to increase. The number of doctors licensed to practise in Canada grew 2.4 per cent from 2014 to 2015.
The growth in physician numbers has outpaced population growth threefold since 2011, according to CIHI.
But, again, there are important regional differences. The physician work force grew 5 per cent in both Alberta and Saskatchewan, but it shrank by 3 per cent in New Brunswick and 2 per cent in Newfoundland and Labrador.
There are now 82,198 licensed physicians in the country – more than there have ever been, in absolute numbers or per capita, and that trend will likely continue for the foreseeable future.
Canada's 17 medical schools graduated 2,817 new MDs last year. The number of graduates has jumped 12 per cent in the past five years.
One of the most noteworthy trends revealed in the CIHI data is the rise in female physicians. From 2011-15, there was a 23.7-per-cent increase in female practitioners, compared with 7.3 per cent for males.
Story continues below advertisement
Almost 45 per cent of family doctors and 35 per cent of specialists in Canada are women.
Mr. Ballinger said collecting this sort of data is important for fashioning sound public policies. "Understanding the supply, payments and activities of physicians across the country helps us to understand not only how many physicians there are and how much we pay for their services, but also how health-care resources are allocated," they said.
Who's to blame for the sad state of the American health care system in 2017? The short answer, as Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal details in their new book “An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back,” is profit-chasing professionals in almost every corner of what's become a massive industry.
“No one player created the mess that is the $3 trillion American medical system in 2017,” Rosenthal writes. “People in every sector of medicine are feeding at the trough; insurers, hospitals, doctors, manufacturers, politicians, regulators, charities, and more.”

Rosenthal, the editor-in-chief at Kaiser Health News and a 22-year veteran of The New York Times as well as a former physician herself, catalogs how financial incentives across every area of medicine transformed an altruistic endeavor into just another business focused on revenue optimization and profit maximization. They encapsulate the dysfunction that governs the messy fee-for-service market in 10 economic rules, including:
More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.
A lifetime of treatment is preferable to a cure.
Prices will rise to whatever the market can bear.
The Fiscal Times spoke with Rosenthal about the evolution they describe, the options for reform and why they write that patients must “change our ways too.” The transcript below has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: My father retired recently after almost 50 years as a doctor. Before they did, they wrote a letter to their patients and their colleagues decrying how the “caring profession” they entered had changed in recent years. Has that all been driven by a profit motive working against the interests of patients?
A: It's obviously a complex interplay of forces. I don't think everyone has to be Mother Teresa, obviously, but that tradition of medicine and the gratification that doctors got from interacting with patients and feeling close to them and helping them has been lost in the kind of commercial systemization that we've seen. It's not always the direct profit motive that changed medicine. It's also thinking of medicine as another commercial endeavor, so you try and apply things that work in business: optimization, revenue management, maximizing time efficiency. And those don't always translate very well into patient care, either for physicians or for patients.

I hear from doctors saying we don't do things just to make a profit. Fair enough. Doctors don't sit there and think, ‘I'm going to do this surgery because I have a mortgage to pay or I want my kids to go on that summer program,' but it's really a kind of insidious slow creep of profit or money as a consideration.
Q: How different is the evolution that you're describing from what patients in other countries experience? And how useful is it for Americans to look at how health care works in other places?
A: The perspective from overseas does help in the sense that it tells us it doesn't have to be this way, and we are not getting value for all the money we spend. When you look at those hospitals and those doctors' offices overseas, they don't look like hospitals in the U.S. Our hospitals — we expect them to look like five-star hotels. They have beautiful lobbies and free coffee. Hospitals in most countries look a little bit like junior high school. They're pretty basic. And I think we all have to ask what we're paying for and are we paying for the right things.
Q: To what extent is the state of our current system a political problem — something that our politicians haven't been able or willing in some cases to effectively address?
A: There's an incredible amount of lobbying that goes on around health care. If not the biggest, it's one of the biggest lobbying forces in D.C., and that makes it very hard to cut back on what we spend on health care. The other problem is we've let perfect be the enemy of the good. I mean we could save a significant amount of money if we just did something, but because there's all this political bickering about what kind of something we should do, we end up choosing none of the above or not being able to agree on anything that really moves the needle on cost.
Q: You seem to be advocating a more gradual and incremental approach to reforming the system. To what extent is that because the political system makes it impossible to have a more comprehensive overhaul?
A: I always like to say I am a journalist and want to remain a journalist. So it's not my place to say what the answer should be for the United States. But I think it's not so much that I favor incremental reform, but dramatic reform is practically very difficult because we can't even agree on undramatic reforms so far.

I also think we have to be cognizant of the fact that health care has been a big job creator for the U.S. and so much of our economy depends on health care. If we say we want to right-size the system, if you do that abruptly or in cities like Cleveland and Pittsburgh where a huge percentage of jobs are in health care now, that would mean huge job loss until people can be redirected. Health care brought us out of the recession. And I wouldn't want it to put us back in the recession.
Q: Your book's 10 economic rules illustrate how medicine is different from other markets — and that a free-market system might not work. So does that mean that you have to have some sort of government involvement or price controls for health care to be affordable?
A: It's a good question, and that's what the Republicans are bumping into right now. It's really, really hard without some form of more direct price control. A totally free market doesn't work because we don't choose to be sick. So even in countries that we think of as market-based health care like Switzerland or Japan, where there's a single payer, there is some kind of rate-setting.
Q: In the second half of your book, you have a lot of useful information for people about how to pick a doctor and what to do to avoid unexpected costs when they're hospitalized. But overall how much power do patients really have? And is it fair to make them have to ask whether they really need a specific test or a scan or to track everything that's happening to them when they're hospitalized?
A: Of course it's not fair. It's a terrible burden to put on patients and their families when they're sick. But it is our current reality. The larger lesson is: If we all start asking those questions, a lot of the more egregious practices will end. A lot of them occur now because people just pay or their insurers just pay, and no one says, ‘Whoa, wait a second. Ten thousand dollars for a colonoscopy? That's nuts. I'm not paying that.'

Q: Do you think that more educated consumers of health care will have a collective effect in changing the system?
A: If I need an X-ray of my wrist, I want my doctor to know which of the 50 X-ray facilities in New York City within a mile of their office are good and cheap, and I want them not to send patients to the one that's charging the most. Probably today they don't know that information. But if people start asking, they may be forced to learn it, and that will be good for the system.
Q: From the patient's perspective, there is every incentive to get the extra treatment, and you have to balance that against the costs. And as you describe in your book, patients are often blind to that cost.
A: It's terrible to put these burdens on the consumer. Also, doctors are in a difficult position in those kinds of situations because, again, it's this business model of medicine: The patient is the consumer and the doctor is trying to satisfy the consumers. This is why we have all these ads, ‘ask your doctor.' So the patients go in and ask the doctor for medicine. The doctor thinks, ‘Well, that's probably not useful, but here I have a patient asking, and I don't think this medicine will hurt.' So they order it. They're in a really tough spot, and they are facing in the back of their minds what if I end up in court over this.

Even more pressing for a lot of physicians now is that physicians are rated on Yelp and all these rating sites and by their own hospitals. And patients tend to like people who give them what they want. That's part of why I say we have to think differently about patients as kind of partners with our physicians and not as outraged consumers. There is this mentality we have as patients of ‘I want this fixed, and I want it now, and I want to understand what the problem is today.' That may not be good care.
Q: I take it that also means that more awareness and sensitivity to costs among patients will actually help. At least that's what we keep hearing.
A: It's kind of a fine line, though. We keep talking about how it's good to have skin in the game, which is kind of true. It's true in the sense that it makes people at least conscious of costs when you haven't met your deductible. But there's also a limit to that because the costs for certain things are so very high that skin in the game can be $5,000 or more. It's really unpredictable. So if by having skin in the game you're encouraging patients to avoid getting care that they actually need, then we're in big trouble.

Q: Ultimately, do you think that we will get to a point where we do have a “patient-centered, evidence-based” health care system, or at least a system where people have quality care that they find affordable. Are you optimistic that we might get there within, say, a generation?
A: Yes, partly because I'm an optimist and partly because the track we're on now is so dramatically unsustainable both from an individual standpoint and from a national standpoint. I speak to people who are now spending 20 or 30 percent of their household income on health insurance and minor health costs. That's more than their mortgage, more than their food. That's really not sustainable. So I do think there will be some solution. It's very hard to predict where the change will come from, but we're at a point where not addressing this cost issue just is not practical. It will gobble up the entire federal budget pretty soon.

“Political geography is not determinant anymore, because cities are more important.”
In the medieval period, empires battled and colluded with each other in the quest for land. The resulting system, in which nations became the main actors on the global stage, is perhaps the one most of us know best. But it's changing. We're now moving toward a new era where insular, political boundaries are no longer as relevant. More and more people are identifying as “global citizens,” and that's because we're all more connected than we've ever been before. As a result, a “systems change” is taking place in the world today in which cities—not nations—are the key global players, argues Parag Khanna in their new book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of the Global Civilization. In it, Khanna, who is a global strategist and world traveler, writes: “Geography is destiny,” one of the famous adages about the world, is becoming obsolete. Centuries-old arguments about how climate and culture condemn some societies to fail, or how small countries are forever trapped and subject to the whims of larger ones, are being overturned. Thanks to global transportation, communications, and energy infrastructure—highways, railways, airports, pipelines, electricity grids, Internet cables, and more—the future has a new maxim: “Connectivity is destiny.” Khanna spoke with CityLab at the The Atlantic's 5th annual Summit on the Economy this week, where they were one of the featured speakers.
Could you explain why cities are at the heart of this global shift in power? Cities are a key element to that evolution for many reasons. First of all, the world has become urban. If you want to understand where people are, people are in cities. Second: economics. Most of the world's economic power is concentrated in cities, and therefore they become the pivotal entities you need to analyze to understand the world economy. Thirdly, cities are increasingly connecting to each other. They're forging their own diplomatic networks, [which] I call "diplomacity." Diplomacy among cities is the return of an ancient pattern. But it also dis-intermediates state structures. Cities building physical and institutional connectivity among each other, as well as growing demographic and economic power, is how they become the drivers of this new system. So when I say, “geography is not destiny,” I mean it in two ways. First, in the sense that connectivity as a whole liberates people from their geography. And secondly, I mean that political geography is not determinant anymore, because cities are more important. In your book, you delve deep into the examples of well-connected cities, like Dubai, or emerging networks of connected megacities, like in the Pearl River Delta in China. Could you talk a little about these examples? Each city that … [has] gotten itself on the map by way of elevating itself in the supply chain or by having Special Economic Zones—like Shenzhen or Dubai—is instructive to everyone around them. The key is not that we view these cities as zero-sum, because one of my main arguments is that inter-city [networking] is a positive-sum game—It's like formula one. It's not a zero-sum game like risk.
Cities look up to other cities in their region. The fact that Dubai is the first Middle Eastern city to be considered to be a “global city” is very inspiring to the people of Cairo, the people of Riyadh, the people of Beirut, and the people of even Addis Ababa. It's very important that we have—in every region of the world—at least one global city with high-quality of life, high degree of connectivity. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... So where do the cities that aren't the superstars of their region fit in? My argument is that second-tier cities shouldn't get hollowed out and neglected. They should get more connected to the big cities. They become back offices, back-end, supply-chain providers, lower-cost manufacturing centers—they become part of that urban area. It's such a shame that cities [that] are actually relatively close to Chicago are so impoverished; or the state of Connecticut has some of the richest towns in America, but also some of the poorest towns, even though they're so close. The difference is the degree of connectivity of those cities. How easily can their residents telecommute digitally or physically commute to jobs on high-speed rail? That is the difference. More connectivity leads to more distribution of wealth, that we know for sure. We need to see this not as an opposition—“Here's our champion city, and here's everyone else." Everyone needs to be a team. You've emphasized the benefits of connectivity, but also mentioned some of its drawbacks. How do cities maximize the positive and minimize the negative? Cities, just [like] countries, have to think about balancing flow and friction. So cities want to have talent come in, but not terrorists. They want to have capital come in, but not “hot money” that destabilizes their financial system, or illicit funds. They want to have diverse food and fuel imports, but they don't want to have pathogens and diseases. That is the daily challenge.
That comes down to technologies, institutions, agencies that help ... government and cities manage those things. There's no right answer; you see many places do it in different ways. The book is basically running you through examples that are good and bad. You also mention that cities—even connected ones—have problems with inequality and environmental sustainability. How can they solve these issues? I think the spread of technologies across leading cities, things like the C40 does, are very very important. [C40 is a network of cities around the world working to tackle climate change.] I think it's literally, empirically more important than our climate-treaty negotiations, because those are not binding. Meanwhile, what the C40 does ... is lower the cost of technology. You don't get China to implement CO2 scrubbers just by telling it to do so. You have to devise and deploy the technologies to make it cheap, and to make the factory owners say, “This will not harm my output.” Investing in connectivity within megacities is how you empower people to have more economic opportunity; therefore, you reduce inequality. In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, you write about a “new map for America,” which would bring its cities up to speed. What is your prescription? That was an argument all about competitiveness: How you do you physically build it, and what is required in terms of modern, political, functional geography to get to that more competitive, connected America? That was what the map [pictured below] physically embodies.
That was all about saying, [if there's] a poor city in state X, close to a rich city in state Y, Congress needs to help that [poor] city connect to the rich city.

We also have states competing with each other for low-wage jobs when they should be teaming up to be innovative, technology centers. So I give the example of Kansas and Missouri fighting for state taxes when instead they should become a joint agro-business powerhouse. I talk about Kentucky and Tennessee fighting about low-wage automobile plants when they should become an advanced manufacturing powerhouse. Only by aggregating on a functional scale are we going to get these regions of America to be more competitive. And America becomes a sum total of those more competitive regions, which is a good thing. You begin your book by talking about your passion for cartography, and the books itself contains several beautiful maps. You also have an ongoing digital project called the Connectivity Atlas, which maps open-source infrastructure data around the world. Why was visualizing the ideas in this book so important to you? We are a visual species. Maps are deeply instructive about our relationship with geography, and that's one of [the] most visceral relationships we have as individuals. They're politically significant because of their legal value and propaganda value. I'm only the latest in the line of thousands of years of people who are producing maps to depict how reality is, and to cast a vision for how our future should be. What is special, I suppose, is that my maps are not about political geography; my maps are about functional geography. These maps are very grounded, very physical, very empirical, very tangible, but also a futuristic and evolutionary view of what the world's infrastructures are becoming. The caliber that they were made at by the two best cartography labs in America—Harvard and Wisconsin—that is special. They're the crown jewels. Lastly, do you have any favorite maps from the book you'd like to highlight? My favorite map would have to be [one showing] the global mega-cities and their economic value. This is simply the most accurate map ever made of where we are located as humanity, how we are densely populated into megacity archipelagos, and the economic importance of those clusters.

And then the Eurasia Silk Roads map. Most of the world's population lives on this map. Eurasia is now being connected into a seamless megacontinent. This is literally the biggest story of the 21st century by far.

In Crazy Ex-Girlfriend‘s pilot, power lawyer Rebecca Bunch left behind a successful career in New York City and moved to West Covina, Calif., with one goal: to win the heart of their camp crush, Josh Chan. And in season 2, they did just that, with the pair nearly tying the knot. Key word, nearly. When the finale saw Rebecca left at the altar, they found a new goal: Destroy Josh Chan. And she'll do just that when season 3 premieres, but they won't do it alone.
With their three girls at their side — Paula, Heather, and Valencia — she's ready to declare just how many men suck, and EW has an exclusive first look at a man-hating '80s musical number titled “Let's Generalize About Men.”
“It is a bunch of women talking about how men suck in a Pointer Sisters-esque number,” co-showrunner and star Rachel Bloom says. “I'm very much in love with that song.” Bloom's co-showrunner Aline Brosh McKenna adds: “It's about the assumptions that people make about each other, and the way that people make these kinds of sweeping general statements and how enjoyable that is. It was one of those songs where all the departments got together and knocked us out.”
Watch the exclusive premiere of the song above.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend season 3 premieres on Friday, Oct. 13 at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
"They silently supply them with weapons, help them move, take them out of the fire, provide them with data from aerial footage, coordinates for government forces' locations, and even locations for Russian troops."
Dmitry Kiselyov is blistering in their indictment here of obvious US support for ISIS fighters in Syria.
They explain the amazing statement which came out of the Russian ministry of defense last week, that this US support is the only thing blocking Russia from completely wiping ISIS out in Syria.
"I'm not making this stuff up ..."
Of course, nothing doing in the Western media on this.
Hello? Hello? New York Times, anybody home?
(Full transcript follows video with the best parts bolded)
Kiselyov:
Something has become entirely clear in Syria. When there was already light at the end of the tunnel, when over 90% of the country is free from ISIS terrorists, and from Jabhat Al-Nusra, US starts simply helping these terrorists in secret. They silently supply them with weapons, help them move, take them out of the fire, provide them with data from aerial footage, coordinates for government forces' locations, and even locations for Russian troops. It came to a point, when it was the US, not the ISIS combat preparedness, which in Syria became the main obstacle for full liberation of Syria from terrorists. They are the main obstacle. I' not making this stuff up ... , this is the official position of Russian Defense Ministry.
Igor Konashenkov, Russian Defense Ministry rep:
"The main obstacle in stopping terrorists in Syria isn't the terrorists' combat preparedness, but their support from their US colleagues."
Kiselyov:
It's as clear as day. Obviously, the US denies everything. But the Russian Defense Ministry don't believe them, preferring to trust the facts. We remember how hard it was last week, when a part of Palmyra-Deir-ez-Zor road was taken over by fanatics. This is the main artery for Syrian Army supply, who have active combat from Deir-ez-Zor onto the remaining terrorists forces. Basically, this was a strike on the rear end. It was planned and realized with help from US. At the same time, on September 28th, a large terrorist group, around 300 people, left a US base At-Tanf, on the Jordanian border. Close by, there is a large refugee camp, Rukban. There are dozens of thousands people in there. The US won't let anyone approach them, even the humanitarian convoy from the UN. This camp is like a human shield for the base. Somewhere around here, the US trains their army for the political opposition to Assad. So, in the most magical way, an ISIS group leaves this same region. There are about 300 men and dozens of Jeeps. They smoothly infiltrate the government-controlled territory. Interesting, but the terrorists successfully passed all the hidden checkpoints around residential Harbat as-Shemi and Al-Bassiri. This was no pure luck. They had exact coordinates, which could only be obtained via aerial intelligence, inspected by experts, and then passed on then proceed with the diversion terrorist actions. With dawn, the terrorists tried to take over the vantage points, right around the Al-Qaryatayn residential area. As we see, the Defense Ministry of Russia's tone becomes more confident, and the hints are more direct: "We will fight." If US sees these operations as unexpected accidents, then Russian VKS in Syria are ready to proceed with destroying all such accidents in their zone, But why is this happening? Did Trump come up with this? Surprisingly, but it doesn't look that. It's more likely to be the result of low-quality control, when the military gets out of political control. Then on the ground in Syria they start roaming uncontrollably, playing their own games. Konashenkov even said that this was a result of their US colleagues flirting with the terrorists. Either way, the result is very unpleasant. Both for Russia and for the US authorities. Their own Generals push them in for a great adventure. In Moscow, they see, that the US-controlled zone is like a black hole, according to Konashenkov. That's where the US At-Tanf base is on the border with Jordan. And Americans train someone there. At-Tanf turned into a 100-km black hole on the Syrian-Jordanian government border. Instead of a new Syrian Army, just like jacks-in-the-box, deploying from there for diversion terrorist attacks against the Syrian troops and civilians are mobile ISIS groups. But even in these conditions, Putin remains positive about victory over Syrian terrorists. No matter who helps them there. And, they believe that the cooperation with the US in Syria is still possible. On Wednesday, the President spoke about it on the Russian Energy Week Forum.
Putin:
I'm sure, we'll eventually successfully destroy terrorist formations of Al-Nusra Front and ISIS, together with everybody. We have something that unites us all. And we must concentrate not on out discrepancies, but on our common interests. Then we will succeed.
Kiselyov:
Michael Hoffman writes:
On p. 100 Mr. Goldhagen writes, "The Jewish religion, as epitomized by the demonized text the Talmud and its alleged teachings..."
That's virtually all they have to say in their volume of 485 pages concerning Orthdodox Judaism's holiest book and the fount of its halacha.
Goldhagen is so sloppy they don't even distinguish between the Talmud Bavli and the Talmud Yerushalmi (the former is authoritiative, the latter is not). Nor do they dare to expound on the "alleged teachings" of the "Talmud" that have caused it to be "demonized."
This claim presents a logical challenge: how does one demonize a book that itself demonizes the New Testament, Jesus Christ, Their Mother Mary and goyim in general?
Can one accurately say that Goldhagen has "demonized" "Mein Kampf"?
How does one go about demonizing the Talmud Bavli, a book of pronographic lies, group defamation and advocacy of theft, murder and deceit?
The Babylonian ("Bavli") Talmud is the source of much of the informed protest against Orthodox rabbinic dogma, from eminent authorities such as Dr. Alexander McCaul of King's College London. Goldhagen prefers to discuss at length the cartoonish "Protocols of Zion," whose provenance is highly questionable, rather than explain to their readers how the documented bigotry, racism and self-worship in the Talmud Bavli came to be enshrined as the basis of Pharisaic (i.e. Mishnaic) post-Temple Judaism and its derivatives: the Gemara, Mishneh Torah, Shulchan Aruch, Mishnah Berurah, etc.
On p. 29 Goldhagen makes risible comparisons between the lurid, probably faked "Protocols" and the well-researched writing of two eminent critics of Israeli colonialism, Professors Mearsheimer and Walt, terming their book on the Israeli lobby "an update on the notorious antisemitic tract The Protocols of the Elders of Zion." Outlandish, purple prose like the preceding has been a hallmark of fanatical partisans of the dispossession and extrusion of the Palestinians for decades, among whom we number Mr. Goldhagen.
"The Devil that Never Dies" is so embarrassing that even a charter member of the Zionist thought police, Anthony Julius, has termed it, "truly ludicrous." Julius documents Goldhagen's intellectual dishonesty in the Sept. 13, 2013 edition of the Wall Strret Journal, p. A13.
Goldhagen is unconscious of the fact that the devil that never dies is the self regard and egoism of human beings organized within creeds of extreme nationalist chauvinism, whether they be Nazism, Salafist Islam or Talmudic Judaism.
Makow challenges Hoffman:
"Goldhagen prefers to discuss at length the cartoonish "Protocols of Zion," whose provenance is highly questionable, " you write.
And " Goldhagen makes risible comparisons between the lurid, probably faked "Protocols"
I am surprised to see you of all people on the anti Protocols bandwagon.
Protocols of Zion are NWO Blueprint https://www.savethemales.ca/000205.html
Protocols Forgery Claim Flawed http://www. savethemales.ca/000298.html
Joly Plagiarized Protocols Not ViceVersa https://henrymakow.com/ maurice_joly_plagiarized_ proto.html
Hoffman Replies:
"I have never seen primary documentation authenticating the Protocols, so one can argue pro or contra for decades.
But you miss the point: the Protocols is where the rabbis and Zionists want the focus to remain.
They want to deflect debate and attention away from the documented and indefensible Talmud Bavli.
It's a blunder to fall into their trap."
Makow:
" Michael
It isn't either-or. They are perfectly consistent.
For me, the authenticity of the Protocols is self evident."
Hoffman:
For me, the authenticity of the Protocols is self evident."
" As a historian I can't accept that notion as evidence.
Moreover it is being used to distract from the Talmud and make the disputed Protocols the heart of the controversy as a function of the revival of 1930s-style opposition to Judaism.
We need 21st century tactics.
Makow:
" As a historian do you actually think the Masonic Jews would acknowledge the Protocols are authentic any more than they admit the true nature of the Talmud? Isn't it enough that the world is actually unfolding according to this blueprint?"
What kind of historian can't recognize the truth when it is self-evident?
It is disconcerting that their Master Plan has been public knowledge for more than 100 years and even some of their most brilliant and courageous opponents don't get it.

The club season has begun and the memories of an uneven summer of international soccer are fading quickly, but it's hard to ignore that our understanding of the world of soccer might have shifted, even significantly. Start with the U.S. Men who showed how good they could be and how limited they are within the span of days. They trounced close rival Costa Rica and gutted out two wins against Paraguay and Ecuador to reach the Copa America Centenario semifinal, only to finish bitterly with an embarrassing performance against Argentina. The ultimate question left on minds of the faithful was - is this progress?
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the European understanding of soccer was undergoing a lobotomy. Iceland, a country 0.1 percent of the population of the United States, played a highly structured style of ball all the way to the Euro quarters, and a similarly defensive Portugal won the title. What has happened since the tiki-taka glory days of Spain and Barcelona that now that the reactive styles of Leicester City, Atletico Madrid and Portugal are, as the French might say, en vogue?
From the point of view of U.S. Soccer these odd successes of summer raise key questions. Does size matter? One of the great hopes for the future of American soccer is the sheer size of the population. Is that as much of an advantage as we think? Does controlling the ball matter? Klinsmann has desired to build a proactive team here in the United States. Is that necessary? How should U.S. Soccer answer these questions?
Iceland's vision
Much has already been said about the sensational rise of Iceland soccer. The country has invested heavily to develop indoor infrastructure and coaches and has rallied the entire country around the sport. The country was ranked 133rd by FIFA in 2012 and since then has defeated Netherlands and England and reached the quarterfinals of a Euro. The plan has been fifteen years in the making but the investments have paid off.
Iceland's story has left all soccer federation leaders holding their chins pondering if there isn't something more they should be doing. If Iceland can do it, why can't everyone? While Sunil Gulati has their share of structural issues in the United States he's also sitting on an embarrassment of resources. It has to be asked if the U.S. Soccer Federation's vision is bold enough and doing all it possibly can to develop soccer players under their supervision.
Dadi Rafnsson coach at Briedablik football club in Iceland summed up the secret to their success succinctly, "My theory on why we are achieving is that nowhere in the world do as many kids get to practice as much per week for as long with a qualified coach in such good conditions."
Contrast that utopia with the constraints Gulati and Klinsmann are faced with: High competition from more popular American sports, pay to play rampant in youth clubs, a restrictive college system, and a lack of high quality coaches, to name a few. One issue Gulati can't complain about is playing infrastructure. Even still it's unclear exactly what the vision and plan is for overcoming these issues. There are a shortage of definitive statements on the long term vision from Gulati and the Federation. But one thing we can look at is U.S. Soccer's bottom line, their public financial statements, to see exactly what's being done with the money under their control.
Starting with revenue and expenses here's how the U.S. Soccer Federation financials look over the last eight years.
Given the Federation is a non-profit the low net profitability (listed as change in assets) of $8.8 million over 8 years isn't a surprise. It's promising to see the revenues have doubled over the eight years shown. Nestled in these numbers is a breakdown of the coaching school courses revenue and expenses for the coaching program which combined operates at a loss. They collected $10.3 million in coaching fees over the eight years and spent $16.6 million. That gross outlay on the coaching program is just 3.4 percent of the revenues earned over that period. Is that a large enough net investment in coach development? Can the Federation rely on external factors to develop such a critical component of the value chain?
Meanwhile U.S. Soccer has been building a solid nest egg. Here are the cash stores and undesignated investments over the last eight years.
There is a section in the audited financial statements that describes the various investments the Federation is making, and they are the usual suspects in a relatively conservative investment fund; large caps, small caps, U.S. Treasuries, Bonds, etc. A trove of $80M+ in cash and investments is a modest amount of money but it also a fairly big operating cushion and it seems like the money could be better used on something soccer related. Of the $83M in total net assets under the management of the Federation 71 percent of the funds are currently listed as undesignated. Which again leads to the question what is exactly is the plan for this money? Is it working hard enough for the development of soccer in the U.S.?
Could this money start a program to incent coaches who have shown commitment and promise to continue their coaching education? Could that money be used as an investment in soccer infrastructure rather than U.S. T-Bills? Could it support programs in inner cities to expand the reach of youth soccer?
The U.S. Soccer Foundation which is focused on development in underserved communities and funded from money earned during the 1994 World Cup spent more than $10 million and operated at a nearly $3 million loss during its last fiscal year. That's an important project for broadening the reach of soccer, but again, is that creating enough of an impact?
Iceland has proven what a vision coupled with an investment can accomplish. There is no doubt that other Federation leaders are putting plans into action in response to Iceland's projects which means that if the U.S. does not act it could actually fall behind. U.S. Soccer has the financial resources but do they have a vision and commitment to development that is required for a country that is trying to catch up?
Portugal's big call
Portugal is a nation consistently in the upper echelon of world soccer. They've found themselves ranked outside the top 20 teams according to FIFA just twice in the last twenty years, but it wasn't until this summer's Euro that they won their first trophy. The reality was that while Portugal were quite good, they simply weren't good enough to go toe-to-toe with the giants. It's no coincidence then that the defensive mastermind Fernando Santos oversaw the breakthrough. As with Greece, Santos implements a bunker and counter mentality and has consistently outperformed expectations. Portugal were criticized for their closed style of play through the Euro but the reality is if they had opened up they would have repeated mistakes of the past.
The USMNT currently find themselves in a bit of an identity crisis much like Portugal experienced prior to Santos' arrival. The U.S. can dominate most of the teams in CONCACAF and play whatever style they want, but when it comes to the best teams, like Argentina, they are woefully overmatched. The U.S. and Klinsmann desire to be among the best and the best don't play like Portugal do now. They play proactive attacking soccer. So what is the right path? Continue to work toward a proactive style as the fans might want or commit to a style that offers the best chance of winning in the most important games? It's not realistic to believe the U.S. can develop multiple styles as international players have so little time together, which makes commitment to a tactical strategy even more important.
The U.S. needs to look hard at what Portugal accomplished and decide if they too should commit to a defensive style of play in preparation for the most important games. It served them well against Paraguay and Ecuador in the Copa Centenario. The fans were not complaining. It served Sweden well against the USWNT at the Olympics. What if Klinsmann committed to Portugal's style completely? Would that not give them the best chance to win in Russia and for the foreseeable future?
Fans might be concerned that adopting a Santos mentality will delay progress even further, but the Klinnsman/Low era in Germany is a good indication that the transition from a defensive team to attacking team can happen quickly. The pair were the benefactors of an FA that had turned the screws on the youth development system eight years earlier and they transitioned the German team leading to the 2006 World Cup. Germany has not looked back since. When the talent develops the change in tactics can be quick. Until the full youth system can develop the U.S. should leverage their set piece strength and competitive grit and build a style that gives them the best chance when faced with the best in the world.
The heroics of the U.S., Iceland and Portugal were highlights this summer but it's the source of Iceland and Portugal's success that U.S. Soccer needs to take a hard look at as they approach Russia and future cycles. Is the long term vision bold enough to get the U.S. where it could be? Is U.S. Soccer doing everything they can with the resources they have? Are they creative enough with the resources they don't control? Should Klinsmann commit to a style of play that gives the U.S. men the best chance to win now while a long term plan is in motion? These questions need to be answered and then communicated to fans. Whatever the answers to these questions, Iceland and Portugal showed the world it pays to be bold and to be committed.
Get ready to take a first look at the next version of Android tomorrow. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Android chief Sundar Pichai says that they want to begin showing the world what Google is up to further in advance. To do that, he'll preview the next version of Android on stage at Google's I/O conference on Wednesday, rather than keeping the details a secret until fall, when Google tends to unveil big updates.
"I want the world to understand what we are doing sooner."
Alongside Android, an anonymous Businessweek source says that Google will also introduce Android TV, a version of the operating system designed to bring it into the living room. The Verge previewed Android TV in detail earlier this year. Pichai will also discuss Android Wear during I/O, presenting partner companies that'll be making smartwatches for it. Motorola and LG are already confirmed to have watches in development, and Samsung was recently reported to have one coming too.
For Android, the purpose of revealing details ahead of time is apparently more for the sake of manufacturers than fans. Businessweek reports that Google has received complaints that fall releases put smartphone makers at a disadvantage during the holidays — Google's Nexus phones are usually the only option available then running the latest version of Android. It's unclear if Google will also begin delivering these updates to manufacturers ahead of time too, but it sounds as though Pichai is interested in seeing new versions of Android land on retail devices sooner than they have in the past.
French band's management say the two acts are 'in no way associated' with each other
Daft Punk‘s management have denied that the French band are linked to DJ's The Third Twin.
Rumours that Daft Punk members Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have been covertly releasing music under the name The Third Twin have been circulating since mid-2010, although until now neither the band nor their management have clarified the situation. However, following a press release from Spanish festival Arenal Sound Festival that implied The Third Twin were in fact Daft Punk, the duo's management denied all links, reports Billboard.
They released the following statement:
“It has been brought to the attention of Daft Punk‘s management that the promoters for the Arenal Sound Festival in Spain have recently issued a press release in which they claim that a band called The Third Twin is ‘directly connected' to Daft Punk.
“This is completely untrue. Recent press reports are based on rumours instead of facts. Daft Punk is in no way associated with The Third Twin and the promoters for the Arenal Sound Festival are promoting the show under false pretences.”
Daft Punk‘s last album ‘Tron: Legacy', which was the soundtrack for the film of the same name, was released in December 2010. Regardless of the statement from Daft Punk‘s management, The Third Twin are still scheduled to play Arenal Sound Festival, which takes place from August 4-7.
Did you call a transsexual person “he” or “she” when they preferred to be called “zhe?” According to a newly updated anti-discrimination law in New York City, you could be fined an eye-watering $250,000.
In the latest, astonishing act of draconian political correctness, the NYC Commission on Human Rights have updated a law on “Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Expression” to threaten staggering financial penalties against property owners who “misgender” employees or tenants.
Incidents that are deemed “wilful and malicious” will see property owners face up to $250,000 in fines, while standard violations of the law will result in a $125,000 fine. For small business owners, these sums are crippling.
It's not as simple as referring to transmen “he” or transwomen as “she,” either. The legislation makes it clear that if an individual desires, property owners will have to make use of “zhe,” “hir” and any other preferred pronoun. From the updated legislation:
The NYCHRL requires employers and covered entities to use an individual's preferred name, pronoun and title (e.g., Ms./Mrs.) regardless of the individual's sex assigned at birth, anatomy, gender, medical history, appearance, or the sex indicated on the individual's identification. Most individuals and many transgender people use female or male pronouns and titles. Some transgender and gender non-conforming people prefer to use pronouns other than he/him/his or she/her/hers, such as they/them/theirs or ze/hir
Other violations of the law include refusing to allow individuals to use single-sex facilities such as bathrooms that are “consistent with their gender identity,” failing to provide employee health benefits for “gender-affirming care” and “imposing different uniforms or grooming standards based on sex or gender.”
Examples of such illegal behaviour include: “requiring female bartenders to wear makeup,” “Permitting only individuals who identify as women to wear jewellery or requiring only individuals who identify as male to have short hair,” and “permitting female but not male residents at a drug treatment facility to wear wigs and high heels.”
In other words, if a bar owner prevents male bartenders from wearing lipstick and heels, they'll be breaking the law. They've now got a choice between potentially scaring off customers, and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Regardless of the establishment's clientèle or aesthetic, every property owner will be forced to conform to the same standard.
This is the latest in what Spiked Online editor-in-chief Brendan O'Neill calls “The Crisis of Character” in the west, in which identities become grounded in subjective interpretation rather than objective reality. The state is now forcing society to recognise the subjective identities of individuals, regardless of how absurd or surreal they may seem. In New York City, recognising someone's identity is no longer a matter of case-by-case common sense and courtesy. It's zir way or the highway.

Planar Magnetic Microphones
Think you have a large diaphragm condenser microphone? Not so much anymore! At 100mm diameter Audeze's new mics give the phrase “large diaphragm” a whole new meaning. Instruments like snare drum, slap bass, triangle, acoustic guitar really come alive with our microphones.
Tetrahedral microphone
Your brain is smarter than you think it is: If the audio does not correlate to the video images, your brain knows this, and your visuals never make that final step towards successful virtual reality. When you see someone talking 20 feet away and 30 degrees to the left in a certain acoustical environment, your brain instinctively knows what it should sound like. It knows if the audio was really recorded in a studio, and the electronic reverb does not match the original acoustical space. So your user never “suspends disbelief.” And you never deliver the complete alternate realm experience. Our VR Tetrahedral mic records all the audio around you and up to about 70 feet away - it also lets you manipulate the audio objects in that space after the fact - you can move objects left/right/up/down/front / back during mixdown. Because it supports the Ambisonics B format, you can easily generate alternate down-mixes to 7.1, 5.1, stereo, etc. This microphone is the only solution like this available today. It's not just the answer for VR, it also works great for recording of live music.
Finally a complete production/reproduction solution. Now you can achieve more accurate monitoring using Audeze microphones and headphones; the same technology used for recording and monitoring creates a more accurate mix.
Available in:
Mono $995, Stereo $1995, and Tetrahedral $3995 versions.
EQ software plug-in included free of charge, and they work with Pro Tools, Logic, etc.
The Australian share market has had $60 billion wiped off the value of its shares in the worst one-day drop since the Global Financial Crisis, more than six years ago.
The market finished the day more than four percent lower than when it started, the fall having accelerated as soon as Asian markets opened.
Shanghai's market lost 11.5 percent last week, and plunged a further eight percent today.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 and the Ordinaries indices fell more than 2.4 per cent within the first 20 minutes of trade today.
Among the major banks, Commonwealth Bank fell $3.12 to $72.47, ANZ dropped $1.43 to $26.91, National Australia Bank reversed $1.45 to $29.71, and Westpac retreated $1.92 to $29.45.
In the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton surrendered $1.21 to $22.89, and Rio Tinto gave away $2.55 to $46.97.
Fortescue Metals plunged 28 cents, or 14.62 percent, to $1.635 after the iron ore miner suffered an 88 percent slide in its full year profit.
Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum dumped $1.56 to $30.00, and Santos was off 63 cents at $4.97.
However steelmaker Bluescope Steel lifted 29 cents, or 8.58 percent, to $3.67 after it announced an annual profit of $136.3 million, up from a loss of $82.4 million a year ago.
Telstra lost 19 cents at $5.88, and Medibank Private eased two cents to $2.26.
The tumbles came after a torrid session on Wall Street last week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 1000 points and the S&P 500 fell below 2000 points for the first time since January 30.
As well as renewed fears about China's economy and a possible exit from the eurozone by Greece, investors were also unsettled by US oil prices which on Friday dipped below $US40 for the first time in six years.
The ASX plunged by $60 billion in one day of trade today. (AAP stock) ()
CommSec chief economist Craig James said that despite the uncertainty on global markets, the US and Australian economies remained in good shape.
They also believed worries about Greece and China were over-rated.
"At present, we would view the global sharemarket correction as a correction we had to have - a situation that will be beneficial in injecting more value into markets," Mr James said.
"There are clearly risks, but the data indicates that US and European economies continue to recover; lower oil prices will serve to boost consumer and business spending; and Chinese authorities are trying a range a measure to maintain momentum in their economy."
Treasurer Joe Hockey said that while markets will go up and down, the fundamentals were still good for the global economy, particularly the US.
They said several factors would cause volatility in the markets in the next few months, particularly any decision by the US Federal Reserve to move on interest rates in September.
"If they do increase their interest rates, then you will see movement of money from equity markets, probably into bond markets," they said.
They said such volatility would hit confidence in Australia and that's why the government had to keep reminding people that their economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world right now.

Thomas Klocke, a student at the University of Texas at Arlington, killed themselves a few days after an adverse Title IX ruling left their future academic career in doubt. Ashe Schow of Watchdog.org reports on what sounds like another example of college administrators abusing the civil rights of accused students in ways that would never be allowed in a court of law. At issue are two different versions of an exchange that took place in class one day last May.
The accusing student…claims that in May 2016, Klocke made a comment during a class about “privilege,” and then proceeded to open their laptop and type “gays should die” into their web browser's search bar. The accuser (who is not being named because Watchdog was unable to contact them for comment) claims they typed into their own browser search bar, “I'm gay.” The accuser next claimed that Klocke feigned a yawn and said under their breath: “Well, then you're a faggot.” The accuser says they told Klocke they should leave the class, to which Klocke allegedly responded: “You should consider killing yourself.”
It all sounds terrible, but Klocke told administrators a very different version of events:
Klocke also told their side of the story, claiming their accuser sat next to them that day in class and called Klocke beautiful. Klocke said they typed into their browser “Stop – I'm straight,” to which their accuser replied: “I'm gay.” Klocke further said their accuser kept glancing at him, so they asked them to “stop.” They denied faking a yawn and said they were the one to ask their accuser to leave. Their accuser began typing on their phone and laughing, which Klocke found distracting, so they moved across the room about 30 to 45 minutes into class. Klocke denied typing any slurs into their web browser.
So you have a he-said/he-said. Normally, before any disciplinary action was taken you would want some kind of investigation to see which story was true. But it's not clear that happened in this case, at least not in any even-handed way. The accuser said they had related their version of events to the professor teaching the class, but it appears no one ever asked the professor if that was true. As for witnesses, the accuser only found one who would say that they heard someone say “you should leave.” Meanwhile, Klocke was told they could not attend the class and could not contact anyone in the class, meaning they had no way to find witnesses who might support their version of events without creating more trouble for himself.
The accuser had a friendly relationship with Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Heather Snow who wound up acting as their advocate throughout the process. Klocke, the accused student, was never given a hearing to present their side and the Title IX coordinator was never notified as required by school policy. Instead, Associate VP Snow and associate director of academic integrity Daniel Moore got together and (allegedly) agreed to punish Klocke absent any clear evidence:
On May 24, 2016, Moore and Snow discussed the case. Snow asked if Klocke acknowledged the behavior they were accused of, to which Moore replied: “not at all.” They told Snow the students had completely different accounts of the incident in question, but did not tell Snow what Klocke's story was. Moore also told Snow they didn't have enough evidence to keep Klocke out of class. Snow agreed, saying “there isn't enough to go off of” and said Klocke should be allowed back in the class with a mutual no-contact order with their accuser. Instead, Moore said they would look for another way to keep Klocke out of the class, and Snow told them to see if the class would be offered later in the summer… Moore sent Klocke a letter the next day, on May 25, stating that Klocke had been found responsible for harassment (even though Moore and Snow acknowledged there was no evidence to support this claim). Klocke was placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of their time at UTA, and would have this on their disciplinary record.
A few days after the conclusion of this kangaroo court, Klocke killed himself. Their father, who is an attorney, has filed a lawsuit against the school and the accuser. In this case, the admonition to always believe the victim seems to have run roughshod over any kind of appropriate investigation or process to determine what really happened. Perhaps certainty wasn't possible in this case, but if so that's all the more reason administrators should not have been dishing out punishment that could impact a student's ability to attend graduate school, something Klocke reportedly had hoped to do.
Geno Smith hasn't been able to finish a game they started — be it due to injury or ineffectiveness — since 2014.
Geno Smith should invest in a Gor-tex coat, pack a scarf and take their "talents" North of the Border to revive a career teetering on irrelevance here.
The wayward free-agent quarterback's best opportunity to prove that they actually can become the player they see in the mirror lies in Canada, not the NFL, right now.
Smith's weekend meeting with Giants brass prompted a hearty chuckle across the league. NFL teams are yearning to win the Geno Sweepstakes as much as they're yearning to win a couple bucks in a scratch-off lotto ticket.
Smith might be the least equipped person to play in New York, an immature and insecure guy filled with self-delusion. Their litany of missteps on and off the field for the past four years has been well-chronicled.
Jets Free Agency Tracker: Here's the latest moves from Gang Green
The reality is that New York is no place for a flawed, thin-skinned quarterback. Truth be told, no major market makes sense for Smith.
They were an embarrassment for the Jets. They would be the same for the Giants by saying or doing something stupid because, well, he's currently a 26-year-old child.
Their soundtrack has been predictable through the years. Screw up. Recite textbook mea culpas. Screw up again. Blame the media.
Smith boycotted reporters for a week during training camp last summer because they didn't like the headline of a story chronicling the one-year anniversary of their locker room fight with a teammate that broke their jaw. (A member of the organization later lectured the reporter).
Geno Smith, ex-Jets QB now a free agent, visited Giants
How ridiculous did the behind-the-scenes damage control get for Smith? A team official spent last year trying to repair Smith's image to help their chances of landing a job elsewhere in free agency this offseason.
All of the red flags people raised about Geno Smith before the draft proved to be prescient. Image by: RICH SCHULTZ/AP
Smith, however, never changed their stripes. They whined behind closed doors. They even whined with a mini-tantrum on the sidelines after Ryan Fitzpatrick's interception in the end zone in a primetime loss in Arizona in Week 6.
The pre-draft portrait of a mercurial guy unfit to be the leader of men turned out to be deadly accurate.
Smith even went so far as try to bully reporters. I witnessed them attempting to intimidate a member of the media in the locker room late last season. It was a pathetic display by a pathetic player unable to deal with their growing irrelevance.
Knicks, Jets stand together as New York's only two hopeless teams
It's been a nauseating cycle for Smith, who is a legend in their own mind. The reality is that Smith is 12-18 as a starter in four seasons with 28 touchdowns and 43 turnovers. He's won back-to-back games a grand total of one time in their career. They have committed at least one turnover in 80 percent of their career starts (24 of 30).  They are one of the worst signal callers by nearly every statistical measure since entering the league.
Smith's health has further clouded their future. He's a long way away from being fully recovered from a torn ACL suffered in Week 7. It makes no sense for the Jets to bring them back for unofficially a million reasons, including their health and selfishness.
Imagine all the sideline tantrums and dumb things that would spill out of their mouth if Bryce Petty and/or Christian Hackenberg were struggling. Smith wants to play. He's not exactly the mentoring type.
Smith revealed their goals a couple weeks ago in an NFL Network story when they laughably claimed that he's shown that they can be "one of the best" in "glimpses."
Geno Smith will be full go in 2017, but likely not for Jets
Smith will collect dust if/when they sign with a team this offseason. They haven't finished a game they started since 2014. They now claim that he's gotten better "behind the scenes," which means absolutely nothing.

The only way they can truly improve at this stage of their career is to maximize their playing time. That won't happen in the NFL now, so it'd be smart for them to explore options in the CFL.
Vince Young took that path last week by signing with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Smith should try to prove to everyone in the NFL that they can become a viable starter/leader by heading to Canada for a couple years.
If they succeed with Toronto, Montreal or anywhere up north, they might have a chance to find success in the NFL. He's still young enough to gain valuable experience in Canada and return to the NFL in their prime (if he's actually good in the CFL).
Smith has a couple of smart personal advisors, but their agent, Kim Miale of Roc Nation, is nearly as lost as they are right now. She's been an enabler rather than a valuable asset assessing their true value.
The laughably inexperienced Miale was assigned to Smith after the former West Virginia quarterback chose Roc Nation over experienced agents. They were actually their second representative; they fired their original agents after the draft, in part, because they slipped out of the first round.
Miale isn't exactly the most tapped-in agent on the block. At a time when Smith could use a skilled representative to give them the lay of the land, the poor guy is listening to an agent who can't properly provide valuable inside information about their options.
Geno Smith has been pushed to the margins. Maybe they can grow up in Canada and have a chance to salvage their career.
Sex scientists have become increasingly interested in the topic of asexuality in the last few years. For example, they've published studies on everything from the genital arousal patterns of asexual individuals, to the biological correlates of asexuality, to the masturbation practices of asexuals. However, all of this research has generated some controversy over how best to measure asexuality because different researchers have used different definitions and measurement techniques. For example, some have focused on self-identification as asexual, while others have focused on a self-reported lack of attraction and/or behavior. If the broader literature on sexual orientation has taught us anything, it's that identity, attraction, and behavior don't always line up in the way that you might expect and shouldn't be used interchangeably.
In an attempt to provide a more standardized way of measuring asexuality, the Asexuality Identification Scale was created. According to the creators of it, this scale is designed to be “used as a valid and reliable tool to distinguish asexual individuals from sexual individuals for research purposes.”
This scale consists of the following 12 items, each of which is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from completely false/never (1) to completely true/always (5).
1. I experience sexual attraction toward other people. (reverse scored)
2. I lack interest in sexual activity.
3. I don't feel that that I fit the conventional categories of sexual orientation such as heterosexual, homosexual (gay or lesbian), or bisexual.
4. The thought of sexual activity repulses me.
5. I find myself experiencing sexual attraction toward another person. (reverse scored)
6. I am confused by how much interest and time other people put into sexual relationships.
7. The term “nonsexual” would be an accurate description of my sexuality.
8. I would be content if I never had sex again.
9. I would be relieved if I was told that I never had to engage in any sort of sexual activity again.
10. I go to great lengths to avoid situations where sex might be expected of me.
11. My ideal relationship would not involve sexual activity.
12. Sex has no place in my life.
Before calculating the total score, you would need to reverse-key items 1 and 5, as indicated above (the easiest way to do this is to just subtract each of those scores from 6—so if you gave one of those items a 2, your reverse-scored number would be 4. And if you gave one of the items a 5, your reverse-scored number would be 1). Then, you simply add up all of the numbers.
The total possible score is 60, but researchers have established that 40 is the cut-off point for asexuality. In the original scale validation paper, they found that this cut-off captured 93% of self-identified asexuals (i.e., 93% of them scored 40 or above); it also captured 95% of sexual persons (i.e., 95% of them scored below 40).
This measure is useful for researchers who are looking to classify participants into well-defined groups—a very important scientific goal. When researchers use different measurement tools (especially tools that haven't previously been validated), it makes it very difficult to make sense of studies that have conflicting results because you don't know whether the difference is due entirely to measurement or to something else.
While I've read some criticisms of this scale suggesting, for example, that it necessarily implies that asexuality means experiencing sexual repulsion, that's not the case at all. In fact, it's possible to answer “completely false” for that item and still be categorized as asexual, which means that repulsion isn't a defining feature. Asexuality is something that can be a bit different from one person to the next and this measure allows researchers to capture some of that diversity and variability. It also offers researchers the option of sorting asexuals into subgroups based on whether they experience things like sexual repulsion or not.
To learn more about this scale and how it was developed and created (including how the specific items were chosen), check out the video below in which one of the study's authors, Dr. Lori Brotto, breaks it down for us.
Bucks Create New Partnership to Plant Trees for Every 3-Pointer
The Milwaukee Bucks and American Transmission Co. (ATC) launched a new partnership to create more green spaces in Wisconsin for future generations to enjoy. Through the new Trees for Threes platform, the Bucks and ATC will sponsor the planting of a new tree in Wisconsin for every 3-pointer the Bucks hit at home this season.
“We're thrilled to welcome another great partner in ATC and join together in building an environmentally friendly platform that will benefit communities across the state, both now and into the future,” Bucks President Peter Feigin said.
Anne Spaltholz, ATC director of corporate communications, said, “We're looking forward to teaming up with the Milwaukee Bucks on this unique initiative that pairs the Bucks' success with a greener environment. Ultimately, it will be Wisconsin communities that score.”
Throughout the season the Bucks and ATC will work together to identify Wisconsin schools and community partners to participate in tree plantings across the state following the season. Bucks VolunDeers and team officials and ATC staff will join students in the community planting events. All locations where new trees are planted will be listed on www.bucks.com/trees. Last season the Bucks hit 220 3-pointers at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, and the team is on pace to far surpass that mark this year.
For more information on the Trees for Threes initiative, including a running tally of how many 3-pointers the Bucks have hit this season, log on to www.bucks.com/trees.

ASK most American museum-goers, even avid ones, to name a prominent artist from the Arab world, and they will probably draw a blank. Now an ambitious show at the New Museum in the Bowery district of Manhattan aims to put that right. “Here and Elsewhere”, which opened on July 16th, does not propose to define Arabic art as a unified whole or even try to pin down a regional aesthetic. Instead, it presents more than 45 artists working in a wide range of media, who chronicle or bear witness to political and social change in the Middle East in all its heated confusion and messiness.
The exhibit borrows its title from a French film of the same name, “Ici et Ailleurs”, made by Jean-Luc Godard and their partner, Anne-Marie Miéville, with Jean-Pierre Gorin, about the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The project ran into trouble during filming in 1970, when King Hussein ordered the raiding of PLO camps in Jordan. Many of those who had been filmed were killed. Uncertain at first about how to proceed, Mr Godard and Ms Miéville decided to recast the unfinished work, mixing what they had shot with file footage, voice-over narration and written commentary. The New Museum takes that multi-pronged approach as its cue.

Creating a show covering such a vast region is hard. In 2006 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) across town was criticised for the limited scope of an exhibition on the Middle East, “Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking”. Shirin Neshat, an Iranian artist living in exile whose work was exhibited in the show, was vocal about the curators' failure to show how religion and politics inform an artist's viewpoint.
Massimiliano Gioni, the New Museum's director of exhibitions (and curator of the 2013 Venice Biennale) has focused on reportage. Their curators cast a wide net and contacted more than 800 artists as possible candidates. Many had never had their work shown in America.
The result is a sweeping exhibition, filling every room in the museum. It explores the bold and unique ways these artists document contemporary history through video, painting and drawing, photography, mixed media and found objects. Conscious of how distorted Western reporting on their countries can be, they see art as a form of journalism that is free of editors or stylebooks. With camera or paintbrush or in an installation, they editorialise, tell stories and set the historical record straight, often in new and unforeseen ways. They are not unlike America's Founding Fathers in their wish to expunge boundaries and censorship from forms of expression. And they affirm the view of the late Palestinian-American scholar, Edward Said, that one has to look “elsewhere” to understand the “here”.
One of the first pieces the visitor sees is a large, mural-like photograph of the lobby of an ornate, hugely expensive hotel in Abu Dhabi. It is adorned with marble, crystal chandeliers and gold-leaf ceilings. The work, created by GCC, a group of nine artists that borrows the initials of the Gulf Co-operation Council, points a finger at ostentatious displays of wealth.
Like Fouad Elkoury and their images of Beirut (pictured) Lamia Joreige's “Objects of War” encapsulates the theme of the artist as a witness to history. Since 1999 they have been interviewing people in their native Lebanon who have been affected by the country's wars. As the interviews play on a monitor, visitors can look at several of the objects mentioned in the stories, such as a pair of loafers or a Sony Walkman. Ms Joreige's archaeological approach to creating a narrative underscores how personal possessions, such as a teddy bear, a curtain or a radio, can become a symbol or a trigger for recollections of war.
Clever approaches to capturing life on camera abound, whether the subject is family history or the aftermath of a dictator's turbulent reign. Fakhri El Ghezal, a Tunisian photographer, shows empty walls and naked picture frames that once displayed the portrait of the dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who was removed from power by a bloodless coup. An Iraqi photographer, Jamal Penjweny, took the opposite approach in their “Saddam is Here” photo series. Over two years they asked people, such as a doctor or a butcher, to pose with a picture of Saddam Hussein over their faces—at home, on the street or in an office. Mr Penjweny's premise is that the memory of a dictator, whether good or bad, persists after their death. The exhibition, too, leaves a lasting impression and confirms how art can create a historical record.

Austin Symphony Hartman Foundation “Concerts in the Park”
Free For Everyone!
Audio sample YouTube Video where: Hartman Concert Park at the Long Center directions
Kids frolicking, couples lounging on blankets, old friends in their trusty folding chairs, lone bicyclists and pedestrians who have been distracted from their destinations—all united by the sound of music. The Hartman Foundation “Concerts in the Park,” presented by the Austin Symphony Orchestra, brings together ardent enthusiasts and unwitting attendees alike just as similar events did in town centers years ago.
In its 16th summer season, these free ensemble concerts take place in the Hartman Concert Park in front of the Long Center City Terrace and run on Sunday evenings from June 3rd through August 26th (except July 8th) 7:30 p.m. A gift from the Hartman Family Foundation, these concerts are presented to the Austin community in thanks for its continued, generous support. Each Sunday a different ensemble of the Austin Symphony will be featured at the new Hartman Park, located on the grounds of the Long Center for the Performing Arts, performing music from jazz and light classical to pops selections and film scores. Concertgoers are encouraged to bring a picnic dinner and blanket and make it a group outing.

I've been looking at Phoenix channels lately, and going through Chris McCord's Phoenix chat example gives a great intro to getting started with it. In this post, we'll be walking through the process of building the same app step by step.
We'll use Elixir 1.0.5 and Phoenix 1.0.0. (This was originally written for Phenix 0.14, but was later updated for 1.0.0.) We'll also be using ES6 instead of Javascript, but anyone familiar with JS should be able to follow along. I'll add notes explaining the ES6 code wherever we're looking at features not available in Javascript.
Our app will be called “Chatter”, and will contain a single page where all connected users can post chat messages. Let's get started, and generate the project:
mix phoenix.new chatter
Add the HTML markup
The first thing we'll do is add the HTML markup for the form. We'll be adding the chat functionality to the default page generated by themix command. Replace the html code in web/templates/pages/index.html.eex with this:
<div id= "messages" ></div> <br/> <div class= "col-md-2 form-group" > <label> Username </label> <input id= "username" type= "text" class= "form-control" /> </div> <div class= "col-md-6 form-group" > <label> Message </label> <input id= "message" type= "text" class= "form-control" /> </div>
We will render the chat messages to the #messages div. To keep things simple, users will enter their username and a message to the respective input fields and hit enter to send the message.
Add jQuery
We're going to be using jQuery for the client side code. Add the following line above the first <script> tag in web/templates/layouts/app.html.eex .
<script src= "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js" ></script>
(I'm using this approach for loading jQuery only so that we can get started quickly. A better approach would be to use Bower to fetch jquery, since that would also help you manage other Javascript libraries as well.)
Setup app.js
Let's set up the front end code before we start writing the Elixir code to handle the messages. We will be writing our code in web/static/app.js . The App.init() function will be invoked on page load and it is will set up handlers for form submission and for receiving messages over the channel.
import { Socket } from "deps/phoenix/web/static/js/phoenix" class App { static init () { console . log ( "Initialized" ) } } $ ( () => App . init () ) export default App
If you're unfamiliar with ES6 syntax, here's an outline of what's happening here: The first line imports the Socket object from web/static/vendon/phoenix.js . The static init() adds the function to the App object so that we can invoke it as App.init() The $( () => ... ) line uses the arrow syntax for functions and is equivalent to $(function() { App.init() }) .
If you're not familiar with jQuery, the $() function gets called when the page is loaded. Save this file and make sure the text “Initialized” is getting logged to the browser console.
Handling form submission on the client side
Before we look at Phoenix channels, let's flesh out the init() function to handle form submission. For now, we will log the form inputs to the browser console.
We need to submit the fields when the user hits enter from the #message text field. Let's change the App.init() function so that it handles that event.
static init () { var username = $ ( "#username" ) var msgBody = $ ( "#message" ) msgBody . off ( "keypress" ) . on ( "keypress" , e => { if ( e . keyCode == 13 ) { console . log ( `[ ${ username . val ()} ] ${ msgBody . val ()} ` ) msgBody . val ( "" ) } }) }
Here we are clearing all the keypress event handlers and then adding a new one which logs the contents of the username and message inputs to the console when the enter key is pressed (key code = 13). We're using the sting interpolation feature of ES6 in the console.log line.
Adding channel routes
A UserSocket module will be present in web/channels/user_socket.ex . This module is used for handling socket authentication in a single place.
We just need to add one line to the module.
channel " rooms:*" , Chatter . RoomChannel
With this route in place, whenever we send a message from the browser with a topic that starts with rooms: , it will be handled by RoomChannel .
Joining a channel
Having set up the socket routes, let's go back to the font end. We'll change the App.init() function so that it connects to the channel on the page load event.
static init () { // var msgBody = ... let socket = new Socket ( "/socket" ) socket . connect () socket . onClose ( e => console . log ( "Closed connection" ) ) var channel = socket . channel ( "rooms:lobby" , {}) channel . join () . receive ( "error" , () => console . log ( "Connection error" ) ) // msgBody.off("keypress") ... }
At this point, you will see the “Connection error” message being logged to the browser console. If you see the Phoenix server log, you will find an exception that looks like this:
[error] an exception was raised: ** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function: Chatter.RoomChannel.join/3 (module Chatter.RoomChannel is not available) ... [info] Replied rooms:lobby :error
This is because we haven't added RoomChannel yet. Let's go ahead and add it.
Adding RoomChannel
The first thing we need to do with RoomChannel is to write a function join/3 that will be called when we connect to the channel.
defmodule Chatter . RoomChannel do use Phoenix . Channel def join ( " rooms:lobby" , message , socket ) do { :ok , socket } end end
Here, we're only considering a room with the topic rooms:lobby . The join/3 function takes the topic (“rooms:lobby”), an authentication message , and the socket. We return the tuple {:ok, socket} to indicate that the user has connected successfully.
Handling the :ok response
When the server responds with ok message, we need to handle the response on the client. We've previously seen how we can respond to the :error message. We can similarly handle the :ok response. Append the new reception hook to the channel in App.init() :
channel . join () . receive ( "error" , () => console . log ( "Failed to connect" ) ) . receive ( "ok" , () => console . log ( "Connected" ) )
This time you will see the message “Connected” on the browser console. (You might need to restart the Phoenix server first).
Pushing messages from client to server
The next thing we want to do is to push the data to the server when the user submits a message. We will modify the keypress event handler like this:
msgBody . off ( "keypress" ) . on ( "keypress" , e => { if ( e . keyCode == 13 ) { channel . push ( "new:message" , { user : username . val (), body : msgBody . val () }) msgBody . val ( "" ) } })
Instead of logging the username and message body to the browser console, we are pushing the message to the server with the name “new:message” and a payload that contains the username and message body.
Handling incoming messages on server
We can handle an incoming message in RoomChannel using a handle_in/3 function. In this case, we will broadcast the incoming message to all subscribers.
# web/channels/room_channel.ex def handle_in ( " new:message" , msg , socket ) do broadcast! socket , " new:message" , %{ user: msg [ " user" ], body: msg [ " body" ]} { :noreply , socket } end
Receiving broadcast messages from the client
In order to handle the broadcast message, we will add the following code at the end of App.init() function in app.js :
channel . on ( "new:message" , msg => console . log ( msg . body ) )
To see this working, open localhost:4000 in two separate tabs, and submit a message. You will see the message body logged to the console in both tabs.
Rendering the messages to the page
So far we've been logging the messages to the console. Let's start displaying the messages on the browser and make this look like a real chat app.
For this, we will add a renderMessage function and call that instead of console.log when we receive a new message. We already have a #messages div in the template, and we can append the messages to it by making these changes:
static init () { // ... channel . on ( "new:message" , msg => this . renderMessage ( msg ) ) } static renderMessage ( msg ) { var messages = $ ( "#messages" ) messages . append ( `<p><b>[ ${ msg . user } ]</b>: ${ msg . body } </p>` ) }
At this point, you will be able to send chat messages between the two tabs and see the messages displayed in the page.
Sanitizing input
Since we are appending the messages directly to the #messages div, someone could include malicious Javascript in their message and have it executed in the browser of all the subscribers of the channel.
As an example, try sending a message containing the text <script>alert("LOLOLOL!")</script> from one of the tabs. This will result in an alert box being opened in all the tabs that are connected to the channel.
To prevent this, we make the following changes to the renderMessage function:
static renderMessage ( message ) { var messages = $ ( "#messages" ) var user = this . sanitize ( message . user || "New User" ) var body = this . sanitize ( message . body ) $messages . append ( `<p><b>[ ${ user } ]</b>: ${ body } </p>` ) } static sanitize ( str ) { return $ ( "<div/>" ). text ( str ). html () }
Now you can try sending the same message and you will see that the text is displayed exactly as you sent it, and the script doesn't get executed.
Next steps
Now that we have created a common lobby for our chatroom, you could also allow users to connect to rooms with a different name. Or handle other cases like broadcasting a message when a new user joins. If you wish to explore Phoenix channels and try adding such features, take a look at the links below.
Researchers at Washington State University are using 3D printing technology to create objects made of moon rock for use in space. Lead by Amit Bandyopadhyay, professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at WSU, the team has been working with NASA to devise a way to construct tools on a lunar outpost, as opposed to dealing with the difficult and expensive task of transporting equipment through space.
To assist with research, NASA supplied the group with 10 pounds of raw lunar regolith simulant, an imitation moon rock, which has been used to create a few simple shapes through 3D fabrication. The initial results, however, were less than ideal, with Bandyopadhyay saying, "It doesn't look fantastic, but you can make something out of it." The team is also testing the addition of earth-based materials to the composition, with hopes to create stronger tools than those built from moon rock alone.
There was an important development on Tuesday at Guantánamo. A ruling by the judge in Salim Hamdan's military commission appears to require entirely new hearings for any prisoners who claim to be POWs. Hamdan had appealed for a POW status hearing under Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention. The ruling by Navy Captain Keith Allred went strongly in their favor.
Allred rejects the Congressional view that Combatant Status Review Tribunals had been adequate to determine POW status. That view was asserted forcefully by Sen. Lindsay Graham in 2006 during hearings for the Military Commissions Act. Allred, however, concludes that CSRTs concerned themselves with whether the prisoners were "enemy combatants" and therefore weren't competent to determine whether the men were prisoners of war.
The military commissions are defective by design and should not be permitted to stand in for civil trials, but at least one prisoner has been assigned a judge who is willing to face up to the plain flaws in the legal "system" that the Bush administration slapped together.
The decision reaffirms that the Geneva Conventions apply to the men at Guantánamo. Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention states that if there is any doubt whether someone held by a government is a prisoner of war, they should be presumed to be a prisoner of war, and therefore entitled to the protections the Conventions provide for prisoners of war, until their status is determined by a "competent tribunal." The decision then goes on to state that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT's) are not competent tribunals for the purpose of determining whether a detainee qualifies for all prisoner of war protections. (In Hamdan's case, the military commission judge will now make that determination.)... The opinion holds that the men at Guantánamo are entitled to the protections guaranteed to prisoners of war, at least until they have hearings before a competent tribunal. Those protections include prohibitions on torture and coercive interrogations.
In other words, as Lyle Denniston points out, the ruling implies that none of the prisoners at Gitmo are necessarily subject to the Military Commissions Act until a competent tribunal finds that they are.
Although the Military Commission Act provides that those covered by it cannot rely upon the Geneva Convention "as a source of rights," Judge Allred said that Hamdan has not yet been determined to be an "unlawful enemy combatant" — the status they must be assigned in order to bring them under the MCA.
Of course "the CSRT process was an irremediable sham", as the declaration by Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham documented for the case of Al Odah. The CSRTs existed to give the appearance of due process without granting prisoners any actual ability to gain their freedom, prove their innocence, or even confront their accusers. The new system of military commissions was built upon a foundation of sand, the ridiculous claims that CSRTs (i) constituted an adequate substitute for habeas review, and (ii) cut off any appeal to rights under the Geneva Conventions.
Now that foundation is crumbling badly. If Allred's ruling is upheld, it could greatly complicate the question of the Guantanamo prisoners' rights—while at the same time forcing the US to grant Geneva protections to many or perhaps all prisoners for the time being.
"For almost six years the Bush administration has treated those imprisoned at Guantanamo as bereft of any rights under the Geneva Convention and as without the protections of POWs," said Center for Constitutional Rights president Michael Ratner. "This was never the law, and now the Bush administration may finally be forced to do what it should have done from the very beginning: comply with the Geneva Conventions."
The CSRTs loom large in the background of the consolidated Boumediene/Al Odah cases heard by the Supreme Court on Dec. 5. The main issue before SCOTUS was whether the MCA may strip Gitmo prisoners of access to civil courts. The government argued that the MCA's jurisdiction-stripping provision is reasonable because the CSRTs had already substituted for habeas review. But as the Allred ruling highlights, the CSRTs were ad hoc tribunals and extremely narrowly focused. Even if the CSRT were not the kangaroo court that Stephen Abraham documents, they still shouldn't be treated as substitutes for anything—certainly nothing as fundamental as habeas review.
The quality of the oral arguments in Boumediene two weeks ago was abysmal on the central issue of due process. It was especially disappointing to find Justice Ginsburg joining Roberts in trying to identify an excuse to send the cases back for District court review in determining whether CSRTs are an adequate substitute for habeas.
Roberts appears to reject the plaintiffs' argument that they've been waiting too damned long already for habeas review. They wonder why the Court should care that for six long years they've been given the run around.
Your argument wouldn't be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day, would it? We don't look at the length of detention in deciding whether habeas is available, do we? ... Your argument is that somebody held one day in Guantanamo has the right to habeas. So the extent of detention is irrelevant to your assertion.
Justice Kennedy later chimed in as if the six-year wait were merely a footnote to the larger questions.
Such arrogance. Or could Roberts, Kennedy, and Ginsburg possibly be that ignorant of the facts of existence at Gitmo?
The central point is one that I'm astonished anybody could fail to see: Prolonged confinement at Guantánamo is torture. The military carefully created conditions of confinement in order to crush the prisoners' mental resilience. Amnesty International has found that 80% of prisoners were held in solitary confinement. Most of the prison buildings at Gitmo are designed specifically to further that goal. What do these fools on the Supreme Court suppose happens to the human mind after prolonged solitary confinement?
It's absolutely sickening that, six years into a series of delaying tactics engineered by the Bush administration, there's any need to discuss whether the habeas review needs to be expedited.
Here, SCOTUS, take a good look. This is what occurs after years of such confinement:
A British resident being held in Guantanamo Bay may be close to suicide after five years of captivity and torture at the hands of the Americans, the Foreign Secretary David Miliband has been warned in a medical report sent to the Government this week. The report concludes that Binyam Mohamed, from Kensington, west London, is at the end of their "psychological tether" after guards at the US naval base in Cuba switched off the water supply to their cell when they began spreading their own faeces over the walls... A preliminary medical opinion, commissioned by Reprieve, has found Mr Mohamed to be suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Daniel Creson, a respected psychiatrist from Texas who has extensive experience in the treatment of the victims of torture, warns that the deterioration in Mr Mohamed's health suggests that they "is reaching the end of their psychological tether".
Binyam Mohamed, like all the other prisoners at Guantánamo, continues to wait in vain for a habeas review. As far as several Supreme Court justices are concerned, their five years of mental torture is just another footnote to more important issues.
I've been working on a review for the Powered by the Apocalypse game The Sprawl, and while that is in the works I thought I would post a recording of one of my sessions. It's one of the best ways to understand how a system works.
In a nutshell, The Sprawl handles spontaneous, episodic sessions very well- it's ideal if not everyone can make it to every session or you need to get rolling without a lot of prep. It runs cyberpunk tabletop gaming well in a system that is a lot easier to pick up that Shadowrun. Sadly I haven't found or had a chance to try anything as elegant for space opera. This is one of my favorite if not my favorite system – if you are interested, I suggest you give it a listen or take a look at one of Eric Vulgaris' let's plays.

Last week Orlando City appointed Paul McDonough as their new Vice President of Soccer Operations ahead of their entry into Major League Soccer in 2015.
The former assistant coach at Wake Forest, UConn and the College of Charleston has had a glittering career in the college game at some of the nations top programs, but now it's time to take the reins at one of MLS' new expansion franchises.
Recently McDonough has been in the agency game in their role as Director of Global Soccer at Wasserman Media Group, that has seen them represent MLS stars such as Darlington Nagbe, Teal Bunbury and Darren Mattocks amongst many others.
McDonough has close links with MLS and is now in charge of recruiting players for Orlando ahead of the 2015 season, as well as helping head coach Adrian Heath and Club President Phil Rawlins make MLS' 21st team into a side that can compete for Championships straight-away.
I got the chance to speak exclusively with McDonough about a plethora of topics earlier this week, and this is what they had to say.
What attracted you to Orlando?
The opportunity and the challenge to get in with a blank canvas and do something special. The environment and the atmosphere the last few years around here has been great. I think it's only going to get better, moving forward.
On the short and long-term goals for Orlando City SC? Have you had a chance to plan all that already?
Not completely. In the short-term it's just getting acclimated to the team and MLS, there are a lot of different facets. A lot of scouting that needs to take place for us to get ready. My main focus will be getting ready for that part of it, while Adrian Heath [head coach] will focus on the present team. Long-term goals are to be very competitive in MLS.
How about your day-to-day job? What are you key focus' with Orlando City?
Key focus for me is to get a structure of the layout of the club. Scouting, short-term and long-term scouting needs to get put into place. So I can really focus on that. As time goes on I will look at the academy and see how we can improve because Homegrowns are going to be a big part of our club and how we move forward.
Due to your influential career in the college game and at the youth level, will Orlando be looking to bring in a lot of domestic talent from the U.S. and Canada?
I think we will look for talent anywhere that will make the club successful. The Homegrowns, it's a great atmosphere around here and we need to be successful with Homegrown players, so we want kids to stay at home and play for us.
So there will be a mixture of potential big signings, and building from within?
Yeah, I think when you're building a team now will look from within MLS with the expansion draft and the SuperDraft will be important for us. Homegrowns, whether they are short-term or down the road, and international signings are always going to part of this league.
How have you found working with Adrian Heath [head coach] and Phil Rawlins [President] at Orlando?
I have complete faith and trust in them, and that's why I took the challenge on. They have done so well on the playing field and I think what they've done off the field is amazing. It's only going to get better. I feel very comfortable with that.
What will be the difference from making that jump up from the college game to the pros? Is there something new that you will bring to the table? What big challenges do you envisage?
I have traveled all over the world looking for players and I've spent the last four years in the agency world. I'm familiar with the professional players and their mentalities. I think the challenge is just going to be waiting out and finding the best players that fit the style and system of Orlando.
Do you know what system and style that is going to be? Is this something you've already discussed at length with Adrian?
They want to play an attacking brand of soccer. 4-2-3-1 is the ideal formation. But we want to play an attacking and entertaining type soccer. We've discussed it in-depth, so now it's all about finding the players who can help them on the field and to where they want to go.
Following your time in the agency world, can you give us some examples of the success stories you had?
I just did a deal for Juan Agudelo to Stoke, then they went on loan to Utrecht. Did the Brek Shea deal to Stoke, I represented Darlington Nagbe and Teal Bunbury throughout their whole career. I think Darlington is one of the future stars of our leagues. I've had Darren Mattocks for their whole career. I've had Zach Lloyd their whole career from UNC. And also a relatively unknown goalkeeper who plays for the New York Red Bulls, Ryan Meara. I think they are going to continue to do really well.
What is your opinion of the Designated Player rule? Is it something that helps or hinders most MLS squads with the big discrepancy between the DPs and the younger guys?
I think every club has their own philosophy. I'm still learning about the philosophy of what the ownership group here want to approach it. Look, I think the DP rule has done well for the league but there's always a discrepancy in a salary cap league when you have DPs. But overall, it's good for the league.
What changes would you'd like to see with the salary cap, maybe increase the minimum wage to stop younger players hopping over to Europe when they get out of college?
The league pays most guys well. As opposed to going to Scandinavia or something like that, I think that's why players stay. I think the collective bargaining agreement will be interesting this year, but I will leave that to the league and the MLS Players Union to sort out.
After seeing the SuperDraft just take place and the advent of Homegrown players and MLS academies, will the college game still be a big part of the league and Orlando's future?
In the short-term it will be. I don't know where it goes down the road. It's just another mechanism to get good players, so I think right now it will always be something that's around. For us, we have to look at all mechanisms to make our team better.
So getting players from the college game will be key for Orlando now and in the future?
It is just another mechanism to help out team be successful.
The potential rivalry with Miami and/or Atlanta franchise in MLS, is that something that excites you? Something similar to the Pacific Northwest happening in the Southeast?
It would be great. The Cascadia Cup is great for that region, and I hope that Miami and Atlanta come in and we can have good rivals and people that we can beat all the time.
How important is it that the team not only build for MLS, but has another successful season in USL PRO before making the jump?
It is really important because we've done so well in the last couple of years. Building a culture of winning is very important, to keep building on the foundations. Why not win another championship? It will keep the culture going and get more fans involved and get ready for MLS.
Are there any MLS expansion clubs you want to emulate? Is there a team you look at and say, ‘they've done it right'?
You have to take the good and bad from what clubs have done in the past. Some clubs have done very well with very different strategies. Not expansion clubs, but the likes of Psorting Kansas City and Real Salt Lake have done very in how they've managed their team. The environment in Portland is fantastic and they're doing a good job at what they're doing now. Those clubs have done really well.
Your job is to recruit the players, but how exciting is it to be involved in this project where you can see the fanbase growing in Orlando and build a club off a clean slate?
It's great and very exciting. When the opportunity came up, you really didn't have to think too hard about getting involved with something special. It's exciting.
Finally, can you paint a picture of what you'd like Orlando to be like in five years time?
Selling out every game. Winning championships. And it would be nice to compete on the international scene.

When deputies arrived on the scene, they saw two people with gunshot wounds. A teen, a 14-year-old male, was found with a gunshot wound to the head. They were transported to Pender Memorial Hospital with life threatening injuries.
The mother of the teen, Jennifer Craig, was found dead inside the home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Deputies say this was a isolated incident. The investigation is still ongoing.
Meanwhile, deputies are also investigating after a 5-year-old child died from their injuries following an assault.
Hey everyone!
Sorry for the slight delay on posting that page. As you can see, lots of detail there, so it took a tiny bit longer than expected. But we did post the sketch on Patreon a few days ago as a preview!
And, speaking of Patreon, we actually lost a few patrons due to our recent unexpected hiatus, which is totally understandable! But I thought I'd post a little reminder about it since we were planning on starting to post the new journal entry series (which Corina and Karina have been working on really hard!) soon and we've gone below the "New Journal Series" milestone by just $2. I was hoping we could get one or more new patrons to help us pass that milestone again! If you have any questions regarding Patreon, please don't hesitate to ask us! You can post in the comments, tweet at us, or email us directly at hello@aikoniacomic.com
Also! If you'd like to support us but can't become a patron (which is okay, don't feel bad!), you can totally still help us out by subscribing to Aikonia on Webtoons! We found out that if we have over 5,000 subscribers on there, Webtoons themselves will pledge $100 to our Patreon!

Bombs and the Batusi: Adam West's most memorable moments as Batman
The death of Adam West, who played Batman in the 1960s television series and film, has inspired fans to share their finest moments as the Caped Crusader.
Among them are some true gems, including a scene in the 1966 film Batman in which they struggle to dispose of a lit bomb in vintage slapstick style.

West died on Friday aged 88 after “a short but brave battle with leukemia,” their family said in a statement.
Burt Ward, who played Batman's sidekick, Robin, was friends with West for more than 50 years.
“We shared some of the most fun times of our lives together,” Ward told the Variety entertainment media outlet. “This is a terribly unexpected loss of my lifelong friend. I will forever miss him.”
Bipartisan Senate legislation introduced today would limit how often Americans could borrow from their 401(k) plans but increase the repayment period after leaving a job.
The sponsors said the retirement accounts were increasingly being used as rainy-day "piggy banks" and not being repaid, contributing to a $6.6 trillion gap between what Americans have saved and what they will need for retirement.
The bill, sponsored by retiring Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., seeks to reduce so-called leakage -- when account holders cannot repay the money they borrowed from their 401(k)s.
"While having access to a loan in an emergency is an important feature for many participants, a 401(k) savings account should not be used as a piggy bank," Kohl said in a joint news release. They chair the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Enzi is the ranking Republican.
The Savings Enhancement by Alleviating Leakage in 401(k) Savings Act of 2011 -- SEAL Act, for short -- would:
* Reduce to three the number of loans that participants can take at one time. * Extend the rollover period for repayment after leaving a job. * Allow 401(k) participants to continue to make elective contributions during the six months after a hardship withdrawal. * Ban products that promote "leakage," such as the 401(k) debit card.
Read the full text of the bill (pdf).
Bloomberg reports on a study released today showing that at the end of last year a record number of 401(k)-type participants had an outstanding loan -- 28% -- with an average outstanding loan balance of $7,860. The study of 110 plans found that 58% permitted two or more loans at a time.

–Jabba the Hutt, Return of the Jedi
Ghosts of Dathomir, an all-new adventure for the Star Wars™: Force and Destiny roleplaying game, is on sale now in the Fantasy Flight Games online store and at your local retailer.
With the Jedi Order abolished and the Jedi all but extinct, now is a dangerous time to be a Force user. Seeking the remnants of Jedi teachings and chasing the whispers of artifacts while avoiding Imperial persecution would be difficult enough, but young Force adepts have to contend with the temptation of the dark side. Ghosts of Dathomir places you on the hunt for a statue rumored to have ties to the Force, ties so powerful that its discovery could lead you to a greater understanding of the Force… or to your annihilation.
The statue is called Tragic Hope, and it has popped up for auction on the Hutt-controlled world of Toydaria; of course, your party are not the only people interested in the artifact. A ruthless mercenary named Jerserra has left a trail of bodies throughout the Mid and Outer Rim territories as they build up their crime network, and they seek the statue with a fervor that suggests something personal is at stake. The Empire has their eyes on Jerserra, and Hutt spies are everywhere across Toydaria. Can you navigate the criminal underworld and escape unscathed to discover what ties this statue to the Force and learn how the dread world of Dathomir is involved?
Organized Crime in the Mid Rim
Your party will find themselves en route to Toydaria at the start of Ghosts of Dathomir, searching for an exotic items dealer named Walisi. But Walisi has gone missing, and so has Tragic Hope. Unfortunate yes, but hardly surprising; even the most legitimate of businesses have dealings with the criminal underworld in the Mid and Outer Rim, and Walisi is no exception. Their ties to the Gorensla Hutt Kajidic ensure that you won't be alone in searching for him; you will have to be cautious to avoid involving yourself in the middle of long brewing conflicts between the Hutt crime families.
Tread too carefully, though, and Jerserra could slip away with the statue, and that's not an outcome anyone wants to see.
The Dread World of Dathomir
By wielding the double-bladed lightsaber of the Empire's Inquisitorius Jedi hunters, Jerserra surely conjures up thoughts of the dark side, much like the barren and mysterious Dathomir. Rumored to have once been populated by a group of unique Force users called the Nightsisters—neither Jedi nor Sith—Dathomir is now a mostly desolate planet, scarcely visited after the disaster at the Oteroan Zero-Twenty mining colony. What is it about Tragic Hope that will lead you to Dathomir? And can the rumors of ghostly apparitions around the abandoned mining colony be believed?
The Force Gets Darker
Star Wars: Force and Destiny introduces adventurers to both sides of the Force, to the Jedi and the Sith, but the reality is that the galaxy is much more complex. Delve into Ghosts of Dathomir and recover Tragic Hope to discover its ties to the Force. Confront the mysterious and violent Jerserra before they discover how to unleash the forces dormant in the artifact and continue their quest for power. If you come out alive, you may even learn a new Force power.

We all take notes a little differently, so picking the best notes really depends on your style. Evernote and OneNote are best for people who like to record and organize everything, including audio, images, and text. Keep's best for people who like to do the same, but prefer to keep their notes relatively short. Otherwise, there's Simplenote, which is best for people who only take text-based notes. All four apps are great, so it really just depends on what type of notes you prefer to take.

A woman accidentally drove their car into the San Diego Bay while attempting to park for work at the Loews Coronado Resort. A witness in a boat approached the woman who suffered minor injuries and declined medical help. Screen capture/KSWB/Inform Inc.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 2 (UPI) -- A car accidentally crashed through a barricade and plunged into the San Diego Bay on Wednesday morning.
Local police told Fox 5 they believe the car's driver may have accidentally pressed the wrong pedal while attempting to park their car outside of Loews Coronado Resort, causing the vehicle to go crashing into the bay.
The car flipped upside down and landed on a group of rocks below the parking area. A boater, who'd witnessed the accident, helped the woman out of the car, Coronado police spokesperson Lea Corbin told the San Diego Union-Tribune.
Harbor police arrived at the scene to check for other victims and arranged to have the car towed out of the water.
The 56-year-old driver, who had been arriving for work at the resort at the time of the crash, suffered minor injuries and declined medical help.
Helix-shaped plasma crystals, which may be a form of so-called "weird life," could potentially be found in the rings of Saturn. Image courtesy NASA
The universe is filled with massive clouds of dust. From past studies, scientists have learned that this cosmic dust can, in the presence of plasma, creates formations known as plasma crystals. An international team of researchers published a study in the Aug.14, 2007, issue of the New Journal of Physics that indicates that these crystals may be more sophisticated than anyone realized. In simulations involving cosmic dust, the researchers witnessed the formation of plasma crystals displaying some of the elementary characteristics of life -- DNA-like structure, autonomous behavior, reproduction and evolution.
Before we get into how it works, let's talk about plasma. Plasma is the fourth state of matter. When gas is superheated, electrons are torn from atoms and become free floating. The gas then becomes ionized, carrying a positive charge. This superheated mix of ionized gas and free-floating electrons makes up plasma. Stars are mostly plasma, as is about 99 percent of the matter of the universe, though plasma is much less common on Earth, where we're used to dealing with solids, liquids and gases. Besides being found in stars and in our sun, plasma is transported by solar winds and magnetic fields, often coming into contact with dust clouds like those the researchers studied.
" " In simulations, plasma crystals sometimes assume the double-helix shape of DNA. Image courtesy U.S. National Library of Medicine
When plasma comes into contact with a dust cloud, dust particles gather an electric charge by sucking up electrons from the surrounding plasma. This core of electrons in turn pulls in positively charged ions, forming plasma crystals. In the scientists' simulations, which were performed on the International Space Station and in a zero-gravity environment at a German research facility, the plasma crystals sometimes developed into corkscrew shapes or even the double-helix shape of DNA. These helix-shaped crystals retain an electric charge and show what the researchers called a self-organizing ability.
Once in helix form, the crystals can reproduce by diving into two identical helixes, displaying "memory marks" on their structures [source: New Journal of Physics]. The diameter of the helixes varies throughout the structure and the arrangement of these various sections is replicated in other crystals, passing on what could be called a form of genetic code.
They even seem to evolve. The formations become sturdier over time as weaker structures break down and disappear.
The researchers want to test whether dust clouds in a non-simulated environment, such as those in Saturn's rings, form helixes and exhibit these behaviors. But the plasma crystals are fragile and difficult to test. They also require a consistent flow of plasma or else they "die."
If they exist in the simulated form, the researchers believe that the crystal organisms could be found in the rings of Uranus and Saturn, which are made up of small grains of ice.
So they form DNA-like shapes, reproduce, pass on their structure or genetic code, "eat" plasma, evolve and die. But are these supposed organisms a real life form? We tackle that question on the next page.
The legal team for a Russian technology executive who sued BuzzFeed in February said on Thursday that it has identified the person who provided the now-infamous Trump dossier to the website.
Val Gurvits, an attorney for Aleksej Gubarev, disclosed the revelation after a federal judge ruled that BuzzFeed is a news organization and that it thus qualifies under a law that shields journalists from revealing their sources.
"With respect to this ruling, what the Court really said here is that before BuzzFeed could be required to tell us its source, we had to try to get the information from other places. As it turns out, we WERE able to get the information we wanted from another source and were actually in the process of withdrawing our Motion when this decision [was] issued," Gurvits told CNN in an email.
"Also, it has been reported to us that BuzzFeed seems to be celebrating this ruling. I am not sure why BuzzFeed would be celebrating this ruling, when they know that we already obtained the information about how they got the Dossier from another source," Gurvits continued. "And while I cannot as of yet reveal this information, it is certainly NOT something I would celebrate if I was BuzzFeed."
Gurvits added: "So unless BuzzFeed is celebrating their poor and unprofessional journalistic practices, I am really at a loss why they think this ruling is good news."
In a statement, BuzzFeed News spokesperson Matt Mittenthal, who before being told about what Gurvits had said had issued a statement celebrating the ruling, said that "the First Amendment gives plaintiffs every right to try to spin a loss as a win, but in this case it will not work."
"The issue before the court was about protecting sources and the judge ruled clearly in BuzzFeed's favor," Mittenthal said. "And we would note that the judge dismissed any questions about BuzzFeed's journalistic standing in their ruling."
Asked about Gurvits' having said that BuzzFeed knows that Gurvits and their team have determined the identity of BuzzFeed's source, and Gurvits' criticism, Mittenthal declined to comment further.
Gubarev sued BuzzFeed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida in February after BuzzFeed published the full dossier, which included Gubarev's name. The website's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, was also named as a defendant. After the suit was filed, BuzzFeed redacted Gubarev's name from the copy of the dossier on its website and issued an apology.
Related: Plaintiff in Russia dossier suit argues BuzzFeed isn't a real news organization
Attorneys for Gubarev had attempted to compel BuzzFeed to reveal its source for the dossier, arguing that the website did not qualify for protection from doing so under Florida's Shield Law. To make the argument that BuzzFeed was not eligible for shielding under the law, Gubarev's legal team contended that the website was not a "newspaper, news journal, news agency, press association, wire service, radio or TV station, network, or news magazine."
But in Thursday's ruling, a federal judge disagreed.
"There is nothing in the statute that limits the privilege to traditional print media," Judge John J. O'Sullivan wrote. "Because BuzzFeed writes stories and publishes news articles on its website, it qualifies as a 'news agency,' 'news journal' or 'news magazine.' Accordingly, BuzzFeed is covered under the Florida Shield Law. Defendant Smith is also covered by the Florida Shield Law through their employment at BuzzFeed."
In their ruling, O'Sullivan noted that Florida's Shield Law required the plaintiff to establish that the information desired "cannot be obtained from alternative sources."
In previous court filings, Gurvits' team had said they sought information from a handful of places, such as news outlets and Fusion GPS. Generally, news outlets fight subpoenas related to their sources, because in some jurisdictions, including Florida, journalistic notes are protected by shield laws. In this case, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal told Gubarev's team they wouldn't turn over information.
Gurvits' revelation that their team knows BuzzFeed's source puts a few other ongoing court actions in flux.
In a separate but related action in federal court in D.C., Gubarev and the companies are fighting to subpoena Fusion GPS, the company behind the dossier.
Gurvits told CNN that their clients would narrow the scope of their request from Fusion GPS now that they know the identity of BuzzFeed's source.
Gurvits' clients are also seeking an interview with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence agent who wrote the memos that make up the dossier, through the U.K. court system. They plan to continue pursuing that interview, Gurvits said, because they would like to know the extent to which Steele worked to confirm the allegations in the dossier.
Gurvits said a next step in the Florida case will be to ask the judge to lift a protective order that bars the lawyers from making public certain kinds of information they may gather about the source. If the judge changes that order, Gurvits said, their team would then name BuzzFeed's source.
Residents of the Congress Heights section of Washington DC tell of the devastating impact the president's plan to cut food stamps would have on their families
Wendell Britt does not know where they will sleep tonight. It might be a park bench, a pavement, a shelter – “You go to a shelter and they take your fucking phone” – or, if he's lucky, a friend's house. “Wherever I lay my head,” they say, wearing a Chicago Bulls cap.
The 55-year-old also does not know where their next meal is coming from either – but they do have a lifeline. “Food stamps help me get food in my stomach,” they said this week. “They help a lot of people.”
This is Congress Heights in Washington DC, a predominantly black neighborhood just five miles southeast of the White House, where last week Donald Trump's administration unveiled a budget proposal that would slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), as food stamps are officially known.
Losing food stamps altogether would be devastating to Britt, who spent 17 years in prison for robbery and drug-related offenses and is trying to go back to work as a barber. “If I've got no food, nothing to eat, I'm just out here. I might go to the trash can when I need something to eat; I might get sick in my stomach but it's a chance I have to take. I might steal something because I'm going to be hungry.”
In February, about 42 million Americans received assistance via the Snap program, which cost $70.9bn in 2016. Most recipients, about 72%, live in households with children, and more than a quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities. The federal scheme has been widely applauded by economists and academics as a cost-efficient method of helping the most needy.
The only good news about Trump's budget? It's unlikely to pass Read more
“In recent memory, in the late 1960s and early 70s, we had a problem of severe malnutrition in this country. Not everywhere, but in poor communities around the country we had problems with severe hunger,” said Stacy Dean, the vice-president for food assistance policy at the nonpartisan thinktank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Snap “largely solved that problem”.
Dean said they found the budget cut proposal worrying. Abdicating responsibility for ending hunger as a national issue is “a proposal to take us back to a dark time in our history”, they said.

The District of Columbia in comparison with US states has one of the highest proportions of the population to be on food stamps. For instance, 21.97% of residents were on them in 2014, a report from the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) nutrition service reported in 2015.
Many residents of Congress Heights, a disadvantaged area that's a 20-minute drive from the executive mansion, depend on food stamps and would soon feel the pain of cutbacks.
Last week, Kozette Green, a 44-year-old single mother, dropped into a convenience store on Alabama Avenue with their nine-year-old twins Jerzey and John; they also have a daughter, Nija, 18. Green has been on food stamps since Nija's birth in 1998 prompted them to leave their job in childcare. “They made a big difference because I don't really make a lot so it helped me bring food for my kids.”
Green receives $273 a month for themselves and their children. If that was taken away? “Oh my god, I don't know,” they replied. “My kids probably wouldn't get as much as they do now. I think it's horrible. It's going to be harder on the people who don't have jobs trying to eat and provide for their families.”
Walking by the store, Reginald Porter-Bey, 59, who used to work as a printer at the Pentagon, started using food stamps a decade ago when they were homeless and jobless. “They're very important to get through the month. You've got to know how to find bargains.”
Porter-Bey, who has five children, added: “It would have a hell of an impact. That's taking food out of my mouth and other people's mouths who've got kids. That's not fair. People voted for Trump and they slapped them in the face. There are people in West Virginia who are poor just like here. They don't care because he's all right.
“We've had people robbing from another just to survive. No man is not going to allow their kids to eat, not if he's a man.”
Their friend Donald Greenfield, 36, a cook, added: “It's gonna hurt a lot of people. A person's got to survive. For them to take the Snap and not put something in its place is totally wrong. You're taking money out of kids' mouths who are hardly making it.”
Conservative media outlets such as Fox News have previously referred to food stamp users as “moochers”, “parasites” and “takers” instead of “makers”. Last week Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney said: “If you're on food stamps and you're able-bodied, we need you to go to work.”
But according to the government's own figures, most families on Snap – 55% of them – do have a family member working. The issue is that they do not make enough money to feed their families. “This budget is not an evidence-based exercise in policy-making. It's oriented at cutting government spending in order to lavish tax cuts on the wealthy,” said Dean.
Daimond and Georgia Gibson have a six-year-old son and receive food stamps worth $350 a month. Daimond, 44, suffered a slipped disc in their back and lost their job as a manager about 18 months ago. They said: “I voted for Trump: what a mistake. He's a business person, and I thought he's going to run the country like a business. I can't see it.”
If the family lost food stamps, they said, “it would be a major blow. We'd have to come down from three meals a day to maybe one or one-and-a-half. We're in the nation's capital and prices are high. We feed the third world countries; why not feed us?”
Georgia, 25, who could not vote because of a past felony, described the proposal to slash food stamps as “ridiculous”. They said: “If they don't look after poor people now, he's going to see a lot more poverty.”
They said of Trump: “He's tearing our country apart. There's so much hate. He's dividing our people. There has always been racism and we knew it was a problem but we clearly see it now.”
Others in the neighborhood – which includes fast-food outlets, convenience stores with bulletproof glass, police cars on regular patrol and Martin Luther King Jr Elementary School – warned that they might turn to desperate measures without food stamps.
Rodney Crowder, 51, is diabetic, has mental health problems, spent three years in prison for robbery and is homeless, forcing them to sleep in a car. “Trump is a good guy, but he'd better not take any food stamps. They can't do that shit. People need help. It would make me want to rob again. What the hell do you think? I ain't got no food stamps, I'm gonna steal. I gotta eat.”
Ralik Turner, 52, a community developer and social worker, offered a different perspective on the proposal. “It will just be the direction the country has been going for years. Bill Clinton started the cuts and I like Clinton. Like any underground network, people are going to find a way because they have no choice.
“Food stamps is a subsidy. It's not making the bread of any household in this country. In no way does it take the credit for the situation of freedom in the black community. Most of the elderly get $6 to $14 a month on food stamps; no one can live on them; it means nothing. This lie proposed that food stamps is an industry making poor people rich is bullshit.”
Earlier this year, Julian Assange announced the formation of the WikiLeaks party:
The party will combine a small, centralised leadership with maximum grass roots involvement and support. By relying on decentralised Wikipedia-style, user-generated content structures, it will do without apparatchiks. The party will be incorruptible and ideologically united.
The hope for many was the mixed bag of WikiLeaks supporters would – even if not elected – show Australian political circles a thing or two about how to achieve the party's much touted mantra of “transparency, accountability and justice.”
Fast forward to August 2013, and the WikiLeaks party appears to be imploding. Six party members have publicly resigned, including Victorian Senate candidate Leslie Cannold and Western Australian volunteer coordinator Natalie Banks. Daniel Matthews, one of the founders of WikiLeaks and loyal friend to Julian Assange since their time at university, has also resigned, prompting many to ask: what the hell just happened?
The WikiLeaks party preferenced the extreme right party Australia First above the Greens in New South Wales, and placed WikiLeaks-supporter Western Australian Greens senator Ludlam below the Nationals. While many party members initially claimed their unpalatable choices were an “administrative error”, many have since suggested such claims are a bald-faced lie, especially since Greens staffer Max Phillips had already noted last week that WikiLeaks party's NSW deputy registered officer Cassie Findlay had informed them of their preferences at least a week before the “error” became public knowledge.
Others, such as Western Australian WikiLeaks party Senate candidate Gerry Georgatis, aren't claiming preferencing decisions are any kind of mistake. In fact, Georgatis seems happy about it, which may have something to do with the fact that they were a previous Greens candidate. Crickey reports they broke with the Greens in 2009, and one may guess, was potentially thrilled at the opportunity to slide the knife in at any cost – much to the horror of party volunteers, who appear to be quitting en masse.
Assange has since taken responsibility from the party's implosion. The WikiLeaks party made public statements suggesting the party's NSW were a mistake, and the Western Australian preferences simply “symbolic.” As Greens staffer Giovanni Torre responded, it is a gesture that has a strong chance of electing a Coalition senator above [current WA Greens senator] Scott Ludlam.” And for all this misery? It appears the WikiLeaks party may not even win a single seat.
So how did this mess occur?
The answer lies with participatory democracy in party processes. WikiLeaks party's national council seemed to compromise mostly of a self-elected group of friends and loosely linked acquaintances. They rushed to select potential electoral candidates and create a policy platform in time for the Australian Electoral Council (AEC). The WikiLeaks party national council meetings seem to have mostly been a closed affair – as a result, there possibly wasn't critical oversight to scrutinise processes and add much needed pressure to ensure the party was run democratically.
As news of the untenable preference deals broke and the wrath of disillusioned supporters rained down upon the WikiLeaks party, a strange thing happened: the Pirate Party Australia (PPAU) began to trend on Twitter for the first time.
Trends Australia (@TrendsAustralia) Pirate Party AU, @piratepartyau is now trending in Australia http://t.co/giFpgT62Zv
Founded in 2009 by Rodney Serkowski with approximately 20 members, the PPAU took two attempts at AEC enrolment. Their first attempt at registration was lodged when former prime minister Julia Gillard called the election for August 21. As a result, the party was unable to formally contest the 2010 federal election. This may have been a blessing in disguise, giving the fledgling Pirate Party Australia three years to develop mechanisms for accountability which the WikiLeaks party failed to put in place.
The PPAU has created a policy platforms on more than 17 areas, including taxation, foreign affairs, social welfare (which the Australian Privacy Foundation describes as a “remarkably comprehensive platform which is very positive on human rights and privacy issues in its heartland area of the digitally literate"). Details of the PPAU's policy platforms are publicly available and appear to include over 150 references.
Deputy secretary, press and policy development officer Mozart Olbrycht-Palmer says:
Although we're not elected, we do an extensive amount of activism on the issues we have policies on. We're constantly making submissions on inquiries and reviews. We're a force to try and make the incumbent parties consider certain issues, and to make them rethink their approach. And if they don't, we'll try to take their seats.
Now numbering over 800 members, in keeping with the PPAU's commitment to transparency and participatory democracy, the party published all emails with other parties on their preferencing deals and decisions. All PPAU members then voted, ranking parties accordingly.
PPAU's lead Senate candidate for NSW Brendan Molloy described how the party achieved its transparent and accountable model:
Basically we used an open and transparent policy development process: public development meetings are held on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and Mumble (open source voice communication software.) All drafts of policy development were done with the support of Working Groups and were placed on a public wiki for discussion, before being voted on by the members before being adopted. Referencing was a part of that; as a party that believes in truly evidence based policy development, we put strong emphasis on well sourced statements. As all our meetings are public and all minutes are published, oversight exists by default. We run background checks on all candidates: police background checks for one, and googling the nominees secondly. And as we have an open preselection process, the candidates have to present to the party why they should be preselected as a Senate candidate. Then the members of those states take a vote on whether those candidates should stand, and in what order they will stand on the Senate ticket. Then all of those anonymous ballots are published.
It seems the Pirate Party Australia has actually realised values can be more than just hollow jingoism. They have found a way to make their party processes reflect their members' values by using a grassroots participatory model to create a set of preferences.
The outcome? Their preferences appear saner than most of the rest of the bunch – and by a long shot.
While they may be a long shot for the 2013 election, they don't plan on going anywhere. Surveying the wreckages of the WikiLeaks party preferencing fiasco, PPAU president Simon Frew noted: "Politics is a marathon: it's easy to sell out for as short term gain, but it always eventually comes back to bite you if you sell out your ideals."
Electronprobe microanalysis
Constituent mineral phases in the samples were analysed for major and minor elements using a Cameca SX-50 WDS electronprobe microanalyser at Macquarie University. The accelerating voltage was 15 kV and beam current was 20 nA. Count times varied from 20 s on major elements to 60 s on minor elements. Calibration was performed on natural mineral standards. Representative data is presented in Table 1.
X-ray fluorescence analysis
Whole rock major and minor element abundances were determined on powdered samples using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy, at Macquarie University (Table 2).
Solution – ICP-MS analysis
Trace element abundances in the chilled margins were measured by solution – ICP-MS at the Australian National University (ANU) following procedures similar to those described by Norman et al.24 (Table 2).
Isotopic analyses
Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotope analyses were performed on leachate–residue pairs. Sample 77063 (105 mg, fine crush) was leached with cold 2M HCl (12 h), whereas rock powders for 77081A and 77082A were leached with cold 6M HCl. After removal of the clear solution, the residues were dried and re-weighed to determine weight loss during acid leaching. The residues were dissolved at low pressure using HF/HNO 3 and HCl. Following preliminary semi-quantitative trace element analysis, all fractions were spiked with 85Rb–84Sr and 149Sm–150Nd tracers, followed by extraction of Rb, Sr and LREE using conventional cation exchange and EICHROM Sr and LN resins25. Total analytical blanks (<0.1 ng) were negligible. Isotopic analyses were carried out on a NU Plasma multi-collector ICP-MS coupled to a CETAC Aridus desolvator. As part of an online iterative spike removal/mass bias correction procedure, instrumental mass bias was corrected by internal normalization to 88Sr/86Sr=8.37521 and 146Nd/145Nd=2.0719425 (equivalent to 146Nd/144Nd=0.7219 (ref. 26)); data are reported relative to SRM987=0.710230 and La Jolla Nd=0.511860. Typical in-run precisions (two standard errors) are ±0.000020 (Sr) and ≤±0.000010 (Nd), whereas external (2σ) precisions – based on rock standards – are ±0.000020 (Nd) and ±0.000040 (Sr). External precision (2σ) for 87Rb/86Sr and 147Sm/144Nd is ±0.5% and ±0.2%, respectively. 147Sm/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd in modern CHUR is 0.1967 and 0.512638. Initial 87Sr/86Sr(t) and ε Nd (t) were calculated for t=120 Ma. Results for standards (±2 s.d.) are as follows: BCR-2 (n=2); Rb 46.8 ppm, Sr 339 ppm, 87Rb/86Sr 0.400, 87Sr/86Sr 0.70502, Sm 6.48 ppm, Nd 28.32 ppm, 147Sm/144Nd 0.1382, 143Nd/144Nd 0.512629; 0.512640±17 (mean of 21 runs of BCR-2 in 2010), 0.705015±34 (mean of 8 runs of BCR-2 in 2010–2011: JNd-1; 0.512114±23 (mean of 9 runs in 2010); BHVO-2 0.512992±17 (mean of 6 runs in 2010). Results are consistent with Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) reference values. Uncertainties in initial ratios are: 87Sr/86Sr ±0.00010; ε Nd ±0.5 units. The decay constants are: 87Rb 1.42 10−11/yr, 147Sm 6.54 10−12/yr.
Rb–Sr dating of megacrystic phlogopite from sample 77063 was done on euhedral (1–3 mm) mineral flakes. Two handpicked fractions (2–4 mg) were cleaned in 0.1M HNO 3 , spiked with 87Rb–84Sr tracer and dissolved on a hotplate. Sr was extracted and purified using two passes over a small (0.1 ml) column of EICHROM Sr-resin (50–100 μm). Rb was extracted using cation resin chromatography (4 ml of AG50-X8, 200–400 mesh). Sr isotope data were measured as described above, whereas Rb isotope dilution analyses were done using the Zr-doping method28. Rb–Sr mica ages were derived by combining each phlogopite analysis with the Rb–Sr data for 77063L and R; calculations were done in ISOPLOT29. External precision (2 s.d.) for 87Rb/86Sr is 0.5%, and for 87Sr/86Sr is 0.01%. 87Sr/86Sr is reported relative to SRM987=0.710230. Rb–Sr model ages (±2 s.d.) for glauconite standard GLO-1 (89.3±0.8 Ma, n=16 over 7 years, assumed initial 87Sr/86Sr 0.7074) and SRM607 feldspar (1424±7 Ma, n=11 over 7 years, assumed initial 87Sr/86Sr 0.705) obtained using the same spike and techniques as those used for the phlogopites are consistent with Ar-Ar reference ages. Biotite GA1550 from Mount Dromedary (SE Australia) yields a Rb–Sr isochron age of 98.0±0.3 Ma (n=9, 0.70445±6, MSWD (mean square weighted deviation) 1.6), consistent with Ar–Ar ages of 98.5±0.8 Ma32 and 98.8±0.5 Ma33. Results are given in Table 4.
Semiquantitative trace element data for leachate–residue pairs (see above) indicate that most of the Hf resides in the residue (>90%), whereas Lu favours the leachates, consistent with their mineralogy and Bizimis et al.34. Overall, Lu–Hf budgets are dominated by the residue. Lu–Hf isotope analyses were therefore done on unleached whole rock powders. After dissolution at high pressure, a ~90% split of the solutions was spiked with a 176Lu–180Hf tracer. Lu and Hf were isolated using a single-column technique35 and measured by Multi-Collector-ICP-MS. The smaller split was equilibrated with a 233U–205Pb tracer, followed by extraction of Pb and U on small columns of AG1-X8 (100–200 mesh, HBr-HCl) and EICHROM TRU resin (100–150 μm), respectively. Pb and U isotope ratios were measured by MC-ICP-MS25. Isotope dilution calculations for U–Pb were done with the EarthTime Excel U–Pb data reduction module36. 176Hf/177Hf was normalized to 179Hf/177Hf=0.7325 and reported relative to JMC475=0.282160. Internal precision (2se) for 176Hf/177Hf is ≤±0.000008, external precision ±0.000015 (2 s.d.). External precision for 176Lu/177Hf is ±1%. USGS standards BCR-2 and BHVO-2, analysed together with the kimberlite samples, yielded the following results: BCR-2, 0.50 ppm Lu, 4.94 ppm, 176Lu/177Hf 0.01439, 176Hf/177Hf 0.282868, 0.282875 and 0.282883; BHVO-2, 0.274 ppm Lu, 4.45 ppm Hf, 176Lu/177Hf 0.00877 and 176Hf/177Hf 0.283104. Modern CHUR has 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0332 and 176Hf/177Hf = 0.282772. The decay constant for 176Lu is 1.865 10−11/year. Mass bias during U and Pb runs was corrected using internal normalisation to the natural U ratio and standard bracketing, respectively. External precision for 238U/204Pb is ±1% (2 s.d.). 232Th/204Pb was derived from 238U/204Pb measured by isotope dilution and Th/U from quadrupole ICP-MS trace element data on different splits of the same powders; expected errors ±10%. External precision for Pb isotope data is ≈±0.1−0.2% (2s.d.); data reported are corrected for mass bias and blank (20±10 pg Pb). Uncertainties for calculated initial Pb isotope ratios, obtained by Monte Carlo simulation with the stated analytical uncertainties and an assumed age uncertainty of ±5 Ma: 206Pb/204Pb ±0.02, 207Pb/204Pb ±0.01, 208Pb/204Pb ≤±0.17. The decay constants are: 238U 0.155125 × 10−9/year, 235U 0.98485 × 10−9/year and 232Th 0.049485 × 10−9/year. Lu-Hf and U-Pb isotope results are given in Table 5.
U–Pb LA-ICP-MS dating of perovskite
U–Pb dating work on perovskite was performed during two analytical sessions: the first was done on polished grains in situ in blocks of fresh kimberlite samples 77063, 77081 and 77082; the second analytical session on the sample 77063 was performed on separated perovskite grains mounted in an epoxy block.
The U–Pb analyses were performed at Macquarie University using a NewWave UP-213 laser ablation microprobe attached to an Agilent 7700 ICP-MS. The analytical technique was described in ref. 37. Ablation occurs in He, permitting efficient sample transport, signal stability and reproducibility of U/Pb fractionation. The spot size varied between 30 μm for perovskite from the polished blocks and 40 μm for separated grains. Because of the smaller spot sizes used on the grains from the polished blocks, the analytical uncertainties are much higher for these grains.
Samples were analysed in runs of 16 analyses comprising 12 analyses of unknowns bracketed by two analyses of a standard zircon (GEMOC GJ1, age 609 Ma) at the beginning and end of each run. The ‘unknowns' include two near-concordant reference zircons, 91500 (ref. 38) and Mud Tank39, which are analysed before the samples and are used as independent control on reproducibility and instrument stability.
The major problem of the U–Pb analysis of perovskite is the presence of high contents of common Pb. Instead of applying a common-Pb correction, we have used a regression technique, treating population of analyses from a single sample as representing mixtures between the common-Pb and radiogenic-Pb components. The intercepts of the regression line through the raw data on an inverse-Concordia (Tera-Wasserburg) plot thus provide both an estimate of the 207Pb/206Pb of the common-Pb component (upper intercept) and the inferred crystallization age (lower intercept).
A total of 40 perovskites from sample 77063 were analysed during two sessions in April and June 2010. After rejection of 12 analyses with the largest analytical errors, the lower intercept of the regression line through the rest of the data (n=28) gave an age of 113±13 Ma, which we consider as the best estimate for the crystallization age of this kimberlite (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Only 12 perovskites were found and analysed from sample 77081. These produce a high MSWD of 2.7 due to a scatter about the regression line. The rejection of four analyses had reduced this scatter (MSWD=0.63), giving the lower intercept age at 125±8 Ma and the best estimate for the crystallization age for this sample (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Sixteen out of 17 analyses done for sample 77082 produced a lower intercept age of 121±13 Ma, interpreted as crystallization age for this sample (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Story highlights U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has denied a motion to dismiss a Trump University lawsuit
One case is set for trial in November
Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday issued a tentative ruling to deny a bid to dismiss a lawsuit by unhappy customers of Trump University.
U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel made the ruling from the bench in San Diego, California, with more motions to be heard in the coming weeks.
The case -- one of two class-action lawsuits by former students of a real estate training program founded by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in California -- is set for trial in November. A message left with Trump's presidential campaign was not immediately returned.
This latest development is part of an ongoing saga for Trump after they came under fire in June for questioning Curiel's impartiality based on their Mexican heritage.

The CW and Netflix have confirmed a new multi-year output pact that significantly accelerates the availability of CW scripted series on the streaming giant.
As Variety first reported, the new deal calls for CW shows to become available to Netflix eight days after each program's season finale, starting with shows that air in the 2016-17 season.
Among the shows included in the deal are the three new shows on the CW's 2016-17 primetime schedule: “Frequency,” “No Tomorrow” and “Riverdale,” as well as DC series “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Supergirl,” “The Flash” and “Arrow,” critically-acclaimed comedies “Jane the Virgin” and “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and existing favorites such as “Supernatural,” “The 100” and “The Vampire Diaries.”
“Netflix members in the U.S. love the great lineup of series from the CW, and we are thrilled to extend the relationship and bring those shows to our members exclusively now, just eight days after their season finales,” said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. “This is a great step forward with a valued network partner to give fans exactly what they want, when and how they want it.”
“Since the initial landmark deal in 2011, the CW's programming has enjoyed tremendous success and increased exposure through Netflix, and our new agreement not only continues but enhances this valuable relationship,” said CW president Mark Pedowitz. “The CW has positioned itself for the future by transforming into a true hybrid network, rooted in broadcast while fully embracing the digital and streaming habits of the viewers.”
“We are pleased to extend our valued partnership with Netflix for CW programming with more CBS-produced series, led by award-winning and critically acclaimed ‘Jane the Virgin' and ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,'”said Scott Koondel, exec VP and chief corporate content licensing officer of CBS Corp. “This multi-year agreement recognizes the value of our content and it validates the marketplace's confidence in our studio's long-term ability to produce high-quality content. This unique windowing will further extend the CW brand and fan base throughout the television season while providing better in-season exclusivity for our broadcast affiliates, MVPD partners and potential OTT opportunities. We look forward to continued success with Netflix on this partnership well into the future.”
“For the past several years, the distinctive, high-quality shows we have been producing for the CW have proven their popularity across linear, on demand and digital properties here and around the world,” said Jeffrey Schlesinger, president of Warner Bros. Worldwide Television Distribution. “This new deal will provide consumers enhanced access to compatible programs like ‘Supergirl' and DC's ‘Legends of Tomorrow,' while increasing the value of both in-season rights on The CW and prior seasons on Netflix.”

An official in U.S. President Donald Trump's Cabinet and at least one of their advisers gave paid speeches for an Iranian exile group that killed Americans before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, ran donation scams and saw its members set themselves on fire over the arrest of their leader.
Elaine Chao, confirmed this week as Trump's transportation secretary, received $50,000 in 2015 for a five-minute speech to the political wing of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, previously called a "cult-like" terrorist group by the State Department. Former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani also was paid an unknown sum to talk to the group, known as the MEK.
More than two dozen former U.S. officials, both Republican and Democratic, have spoken before the MEK, including former House Speaker and Trump adviser Newt Gingrich. Some have publicly acknowledged being paid, but others have not.
While nothing would have prohibited the paid speeches, they raise questions about what influence the exiles may have in the new administration.
Already, a group of former U.S. officials, including Giuliani, wrote a letter to Trump last month encouraging them to "establish a dialogue" with the MEK's political arm. With Trump's ban on Iranians entering the U.S., their administration's call this week to put Iran "on notice" and the imposition of new sanctions on Friday, the exile group may find their administration more welcoming than any before.
A potential alliance with the MEK would link the U.S. to a group with a controversial history that has gone against American interests in the past by supporting Iran's Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran. After fleeing Iran, the MEK joined forces with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It later exposed details of the clandestine nuclear program run by Iran, which views the MEK as its sworn enemy.
"The Mujahedeen have backed the winning horse. They are going to have some at least entree into the administration," said Ervand Abrahamian, a professor at the City University of New York who wrote a book on the MEK. "I think it weakens the U.S. because the more they have access to the administration, the more people in Iran are going to be scared of anything the U.S. does."
___
"THE AYATOLLAH MUST GO"
The MEK long has cultivated a roster of former U.S. and European officials to attend its events opposing Iran's clerically-run government. It pays for the appearance of many.
Standing before a cheering crowd of MEK supporters in Paris in 2015, Giuliani didn't disappoint.
"The ayatollah must go! Gone! Out! No more!" Giuliani shouted in a speech as American flags waved behind them on giant screens.
"I will not support anyone for president of the United States who isn't clear on that slogan behind me. What does it say? It says regime change!"
Giuliani has acknowledged being paid for their appearances at MEK events. However, they haven't filed a government disclosure form since their failed 2008 Republican presidential bid, so it's unclear how much the MEK has paid them in total. Giuliani did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment sent through their aides.
As Guiliani spoke in Paris, behind them were a host of other former officials on stage, including Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. A former director of the Peace Corps and a labor secretary under President George W. Bush, Chao gave a much more subdued speech focusing on women's rights.
"While discrimination against women (has) been outlawed in other countries, Iran has been legalizing it," Chao said. "While other countries are empowering women, Iran has been penalizing them."
Chao had a seat of honor at the Paris event next to Maryam Rajavi, the "president-elect" of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the political arm of the MEK. They received a $50,000 honorarium from the MEK-associated Alliance for Public Awareness, according to a report they filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
Chao received another $17,500 honorarium for a March 2016 speech they gave to the Iranian-American Cultural Association of Missouri, which MEK opponents also link to the exile group. Chao did not respond to requests for comment.
Gingrich has also spoken to the MEK before, including at a gala in 2016, although it is not clear whether or how much they were paid. Gingrich could not be reached for comment. The White House also had no comment.
The MEK welcomes the incoming Trump government, as "some people within this administration" plan to change American policies toward Iran, said Mohammad Mohaddessin, the chairperson of the foreign affairs committee of its political arm.
"The core of the policy that we are advocating is to be tough with the Iranian regime, to not ignore its crimes against the Iranian people," Mohaddessin told the AP.
The U.S. Treasury briefly investigated the MEK's practice of paying American politicians in 2012. A Treasury spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about the status of that probe.

"THE KILLING OF TWO AMERICANS, THIS WAS WORK OF MOVEMENT MUJAHEDEEN"
The MEK was formed by radicalized university students in 1965. It embraced both Marxism and the idea of an Islamic government after the violent overthrow of the American-backed shah. Their name, Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, means "the People's Holy Warriors."
The group at one point successfully infiltrated the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, according to a State Department report. And a series of bombings attributed to the MEK accompanied visits by presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter to Iran, including one to target an American cultural center.
In 1973, MEK assailants wearing motorcycle helmets shot dead U.S. Army Lt. Col. Lewis L. Hawkins, the deputy chief of the U.S. military mission to Tehran, as they walked home from work.
In 1975, gunmen attacked a car carrying two American airmen, killing them. Hours later, American consular officials received a call claiming the attack for the MEK in revenge for Iran executing prisoners.
"This was work of Movement Mujahedeen of Iran," the caller said, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable.
In the three years that followed, the MEK killed three American employees of defense contractor Rockwell International and a Texaco executive.
"The Mujahedeen are xenophobic," a once-secret 1981 CIA assessment on the group said. "Anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism provide cornerstones for the policies."
The MEK, which now describes itself as being "committed to a secular, democratic, non-nuclear republic" in Iran, blames a Marxist splinter faction of the group for killing the Americans.
After joining in the Islamic Revolution and the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the MEK quickly fell out of favor with Iran's first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The MEK declared war on Iran in June 1981. Within days, a bomb exploded at the headquarters of the Khomeini-directed Islamic Republican Party in Tehran, killing at least 72 people. Both Iran and the CIA attributed the attack to the MEK, which never claimed responsibility for it.
A series of assassinations and attacks followed as MEK leaders and associates fled to Paris. Later expelled from France, the MEK found haven in Iraq amid its grinding, bloody war with Iran. Heavily armed by dictator Saddam Hussein, MEK forces launched cross-border raids into Iran.
After Iran accepted terms of a United Nations cease-fire in 1988, the MEK sent 7,000 fighters over the border. The attack further alienated the group from average Iranians.
The MEK says it renounced violence in 2001. But the U.S. Army's official history of the Iraq invasion in 2003 says MEK forces "fought against coalition forces" for the first weeks of the war, something the MEK denies.
Fourteen U.S. soldiers were killed and at least another 60 wounded escorting MEK members on supply missions, according to a RAND Corp. report prepared for the office of the U.S. defense secretary. The MEK itself became a target of violence, and in September 2013 at least 52 members were shot dead.
Thousands of MEK members were ultimately resettled in Albania.
___
"CULT-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS"
After siding with Saddam, the MEK's popularity in Iran plummeted. To boost its ranks, the group increasingly began targeting Iranians applying for visas abroad in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, promising them work, aid in moving to Western countries and even marriage, according to RAND.
"Most of these 'recruits' were brought into Iraq illegally and then required to hand over their identity documents for 'safekeeping,'" RAND said. "Thus, they were effectively trapped."
The MEK also forced its members to divorce their spouses and separated parents from their children, which the State Department described as "cult-like characteristics." The MEK dictates how much its members sleep, giving them busy-work tasks and controlling what outside news they consume, according to RAND and Abrahamian, the university professor.
For years, MEK leader Massoud Rajavi, the husband of Maryam Rajavi, hasn't been seen publicly and is presumed to have died, Abrahamian said. MEK members call them the "Hidden Imam" who will return to Earth as a messiah, Abrahamian said.
When French police arrested Maryam Rajavi in 2003 as part of a terrorism investigation, MEK members responded by lighting themselves on fire in Paris and other European cities. The MEK denies it is a cult.
Over the years, the MEK has been targeted in a series of investigations around the world for running charity scams.
An FBI probe found MEK members hustled travelers arriving to Los Angeles International Airport, asking them to donate after showing them binders of photographs of disaster or torture victims. The money instead went to banks in Belgium, France, Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to "support MEK operations and activities, including terrorist activities," a 2007 indictment against seven members said.
In Britain, authorities dissolved a charity in 2001 allegedly associated with the MEK that had made an estimated 5 million pounds a year. Its investigation found some donors "were misled into believing they were personally sponsoring individual children when this was not in fact the case."
In the 2003 raids in France, police found $1.3 million, mostly in $100 bills, at MEK-affiliated properties.
Mohaddessin, the MEK foreign policy chairperson, blames the investigations on a concerted misinformation campaign carried out by Iran. The Islamic Republic has imprisoned and executed the group's members for years.
"These allegations are absolutely false," Mohaddessin said. "There are many cases that were fabricated by the Iranian regime and their agents."
Iran also has alleged the MEK receives foreign support. After the assassination of four nuclear scientists, Iran accused Israel of training and equipping MEK fighters who committed the killings. The MEK called the accusation "absolutely false" at the time, while Israel declined to comment.
In recent months, Saudi Arabia increasingly has shown support for the MEK as it faces off with Iran in wars in Syria and Yemen. The kingdom's state-run television channels have featured MEK events and comments. Prince Turki al-Faisal, the nation's former intelligence chief, even appeared in July at an MEK rally in Paris.
"I want to topple the regime too," the prince said to cheers.
___
"SKILLED MANIPULATORS OF PUBLIC OPINION"
From protests at the United Nations to their Paris rallies, the MEK has proven over the years to be effective at getting attention.
RAND in 2009 called the group "skilled manipulators of public opinion." A U.S. diplomatic cable from February of that year released by WikiLeaks described their "extravagantly hospitable, exaggeratedly friendly, culturally-attuned manner." The cable also mentioned that the MEK had "a history of using intimidation and terrorism for its ends," which Mohaddessin called an allegation from the Iranian regime.
The MEK's success in getting former U.S. officials behind them could be seen in a letter dated Jan. 9 sent to Trump just days before their inauguration.
"We repeat the call for the U.S. government to establish a dialogue with Iran's exile resistance," read the letter, signed by Giuliani and others.
However, exile groups haven't always been proven to be reliable American allies in the Middle East. Exiled Iraqi politician Ahmad Chalabi, for instance, heavily lobbied the administration of President George W. Bush to invade by pushing false allegations of weapons of mass destruction and links to al-Qaida.
Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.
But while the MEK continues to pay former U.S. officials for their time, the family of the American lieutenant colonel killed in 1975 has filed a $35 million federal lawsuit in Colorado against the group and Iran.
The reason for the lawsuit, Lt. Col. Jack Turner's family says, is simple: "Unlike the U.S. hostages, our father never had the chance to come home."

After Maryanne Arthur underwent a bilateral mastectomy in March 2011, they awoke to find themselves "flanked" by four surgical drains, two on each side of their upper body.
Arthur, like many mastectomy patients, quickly learned that the drains are heavy and uncomfortable. So their partner ripped a pair of pajamas to wrap around each drain during the rest of their recovery.
A few days after their surgery, Arthur met another patient in the hospital who was carrying their drains around in a brown bag. Despite recovering from their own surgery, Arthur quickly decided brown bagging it wasn't sufficient—and thus an idea was born.
Arthur invented Pretty Pockets—a discreet and spirited way to secure post-surgical drains. Them own family got involved in making them, and now the pockets are donated to St. Joseph Medical Center and cancer patients everywhere.
"Pretty Pockets has received rave reviews from clinic staff, nurses, doctors and most importantly—breast cancer patients who've described the pockets as 'practical and meaningful gifts,'" Arthur said.
In an effort to continue providing breast cancer patients with pockets, Arthur, a Perry Hall resident, has helped orchestrate a sew-in at Jo-Ann Fabrics in Bel Air.
On Oct. 18-19, volunteers can join Arthur's family members and sew Pretty Pockets for patients at St. Joseph's Medical Center.
"They are quick and easy to make, and they serve a purpose," said Regina Barry sewing department manger at Jo-Ann's. "Just the thought of [the pocket] being nice and soft next to your body after you come out of surgery — I think we could all relate."
Since Arthur invented Pretty Pockets in 2011, they have partnered with sewing groups all across the state to stitch and deliver nearly 1,000 pockets to Dr. Michael Schultz at St. Joseph's. When their cupboards overflow with pockets, they ship batches to Dr. Dawn Lemanne at Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York.
Arthur, who said they aren't much of a sewer herself, attaches hand-written messages to the pockets they deliver, which they said gives them a personal touch. The messages also offer a reminder that the women in need are not alone.
"My doctor said I should market the pockets and sell them, but I would much rather give it away," Arthur said. "It's really a gift. I put hand-drawn tags on each pocket that goes out the door."
The sew-ins will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 18 and 19 at Jo-Ann's in Bel Air. Anyone interested in joining in should call the store ahead of time at 410-420-1755, to make sure they have supplies for you. Participants do not need to bring anything with them, supplies will be provided.
Following Donald Trump's controversial Jerusalem move, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has told EU leaders there is no other place for the capital – and that the Bible proves it. As protests continue, they also urged the Palestinians to embrace “reality.”
During their visit to Brussels on Monday, Netanyahu praised US President Donald Trump's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate its embassy, saying that it was based on the recognition of reality. The controversial decision triggered protests in the Middle East and across the globe, and was met with international condemnation. Nonetheless the Israeli Prime Minister said that the decision promotes peace, and called on EU states and the Palestinians to follow suit.
“It makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace,” Netanyahu told reporters prior to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

“It's time that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state and also recognize the fact that it has a capital. It's called Jerusalem,” they said, adding that they expect “that all, or most” EU states “will move their embassies to Jerusalem.”
Netanyahu is scheduled to have an informal meeting with EU diplomats to discuss bilateral relations and regional issues on the sidelines of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels and is also expected to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Prior to the meeting, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters that the bloc would continue to recognize the “international consensus” on Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, the majority of world powers did not welcome the controversial move and Russia voiced concerns over the consequences for the turbulent region.
On Sunday, Netanyahu met French President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged their US counterpart to preserve the city's status quo before the decision was announced. Speaking at the joint news conference after the meeting, Netanyahu called “absurd” the world's unwillingness to acknowledge the “millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.”
They also said that the Bible, the holy book for Jews and Christians, justified the move.
“You can read it in a very fine book – it's called the Bible,” the Israeli Prime minister said, as cited by Israeli media. “You can read it after the Bible. You can hear it in the history of Jewish communities throughout our diaspora…”
The Israeli leader then claimed that Jerusalem has never belonged to any other nation and called on the Palestinians to face reality to reach peace.

“It's always been our capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any other people. I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we'll move towards peace and this is why I think President Trump's announcement was so historic and so important for peace.”
“Where else is the capital of Israel, but in Jerusalem?” Netanyahu said, adding that all the main government bodies are located in the city.
While citing religious texts has been common practice for the Israeli government, the history presented in the Torah and the Bible is not accepted by modern historians and archeologists as fact.
The land on which the city stands on has changed hands many times over the course of human history, with various Semitic tribes, Egyptians, Romans, as well as the Ottoman Empire being among its rulers. The modern history of the Jewish state began in 1947, when the UN approved a partition plan for Palestine (then under British rule) into two sovereign states, one Jewish and one Arab, and giving Jerusalem a special international status. Arabs rejected the move, calling for the creation of a “unitary” state of Palestine.
Tensions have been high between the young Jewish state and the Arab world ever since then, with the most significant conflicts breaking out in 1948 and 1967. The latter lasted only six days and resulted in the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem including the Old City, where the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque – two of the holiest sites for Muslims – are located.
On Saturday, Czech President Milos Zeman, called EU countries “cowards” over their response to Donald Trump's recognizing Jerusalem and said they are “truly happy” with the declaration. They are, however, the only world leader other than Netanyahu to have endorsed the move.
CORVALLIS, Ore. - Predicted increases in temperature and drought in the coming century may make it more difficult for conifers such as ponderosa pine to regenerate after major forest fires on dry, low-elevation sites, in some cases leading to conversion of forests to grass or shrub lands, a report suggests.
Researchers from Oregon State University concluded that moisture stress is a key limitation for conifer regeneration following stand-replacing wildfire, which will likely increase with climate change. This will make post-fire recovery on dry sites slow and uncertain. If forests are desired in these locations, more aggressive attempts at reforestation may be needed, they said.
The study, published in Forest Ecology and Management, was done in a portion of the Metolius River watershed in the eastern Cascade Range of Oregon, which prior to a 2002 fire was mostly ponderosa pine with some Douglas-fir and other tree species. The research area was not salvage-logged or replanted following the severe, stand-replacing fire.
"A decade after this fire, there was almost no tree regeneration at lower, drier sites," said Erich Dodson, a researcher with the OSU Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society. "There was some regeneration at higher sites with more moisture. But at the low elevations, it will be a long time before a forest comes back, if it ever does."
Similar situations may be found in many areas of the American West in coming decades, the researchers say, and recruitment of new forests may be delayed or prevented - even in climate conditions that might have been able to maintain an existing forest. While mature trees can use their roots to tap water deeper in the soil, competition with dense understory vegetation can make it difficult for seedlings to survive.
Openings in ponderosa pine forests created by wildfire have persisted for more than a century on harsh, south-facing slopes in Colorado, the researchers noted in their report. And fire severity is already increasing in many forests due to climate change - what is now thought of as a drought in some locations may be considered average by the end of the next century.
If trees do fail to regenerate, it could further reduce ecosystem carbon storage and amplify the greenhouse effect, the study said.
Restoration treatment including thinning and prescribed burning may help reduce fire severity and increase tree survival after wildfire, as well as provide a seed source for future trees, Dodson said. These dry sites with less resilience to stand-replacing fire should be priorities for treatment, if maintaining a forest is a management objective, the study concluded.
Higher-elevation, mixed conifer forests in less moisture-limited sites may be able to recover from stand-replacing wildfire without treatment, the researchers said.
Coffs Harbour police move to stop large gathering of Rebels bikie gang
Updated
Police in Coffs Harbour say they will use anti-consorting laws to thwart a bikie gang's plans for a major gathering.
Up to 1,000 members of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang (OMCG) were planning to spend the weekend in the city as part of the group's "national run".
Coffs Clarence Crime manager Darren Jameson said if the bikies turn up local officers will stringently enforce the anti-consorting laws.
These are the guys that are the 'one percenters', by their own definition they are the ones, the one percent of the community that will not follow the rule of law Darren Jameson, Coffs-Clarence LAC
The laws were set up in 2012 to target bike gangs after a wave of gun violence involving bikies and organised crime groups.
"These consorting laws are available to NSW Police, to stop criminals associating together," Detective Inspector Jameson said.
"Given the long history of bikies being involved in criminal activity we were very confident we would be able to rigorously enforce those laws, if they did come to Coffs Harbour.
"We still have a significant policing response if they do decide to do smaller runs in the area, those consorting laws will be enforced."
Detective Inspector Jameson said the Rebels planned to ride into Coffs Harbour for a major party and other high-profile events.
"We were expecting anywhere from 600 to a thousand bikies," they said.
"These are the guys that are the one percenters.
"By their own definition they are the ones, the one percent of the community that will not follow the rule of law.
"Obviously that created significant risks not only for police, but also for our community."
The Coffs Harbour Liquor Accord has voted unanimously not to welcome the Rebels to the area.
Accord chairperson John Rafferty said the 31 members from the area's major clubs, pubs and restaurants felt the bikies could drive business away.
"The Liquor Accord were addressed by the police regarding the rally that the bikers were going to have," they said.
"It was put to a vote and the licences voted unanimously to not have them come into our premises.
"Because we don't want the hassle of having the amount of police coming through and also the intimidation of people in great numbers in our venues."

Aviation experts are speculating that wreckage found washed up on a French island in the Indian Ocean could be from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared more than a year ago.
Reuters The French air force has confirmed that some debris has been found on Reunion Island, but officials told CNN that it's too soon to tell if it's from MH370.
Xavier Tytelman, a former French military pilot who now specializes in aviation security, told The Telegraph that they think the wreckage could possibly be from the plane that went missing while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.
"I've been studying hundreds of photos and speaking to colleagues," Tytelman told The Telegraph. "And we all think it is likely that the wing is that of a Boeing 777 — the same plane as MH370.
"Police in Reunion examining the wreckage say that it looks like it's been in the water for around a year, which again would fit with MH370. We can't say for certainty, but we do think there is a chance that this is it."
Experts and journalists, including The Wall Street Journal's aerospace and Boeing beat reporter, are circulating photos on social media and discussing possibilities:
MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Investigators believe the plane crashed somewhere in the Indian Ocean, but search teams have not yet identified a single piece of wreckage from the aircraft.
The southern Indian Ocean, where the plane is thought to have gone down, is so remote that it's difficult to access and hard to spot anything.
Reunion Island is near Madagascar, and crews have been focusing the search on the area of the ocean closer to Australia.
Tytelman said we could have a definitive answer about Reunion wreckage within a few days based on a code that can be seen on a piece of the debris.
Boeing sent Business Insider this statement: "Boeing remains committed to supporting the MH370 investigation and the search for the airplane. We continue to share our technical expertise and analysis. Our goal, along with the entire global aviation industry, continues to be not only to find the airplane, but also to determine what happened — and why. In accordance with international protocol governing aviation accident investigations, inquiries relating to an active investigation must be directed to the investigator in charge."
Hello guys! How are you?
A few days ago I saw this movie and I want to share with you guys what I thought of it.
I really hope you like horror movies, because I love to talk about them!
Let's get started!
Plot:
Set in 1967 Los Angeles , a widow named Alice Zander works out of their suburban home as a spiritual medium, accompanied by their daughters, 15-year-old Paulina "Lina" and nine-year old Doris; although they stage their seances , Alice's real intent is to help people move on. The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the kids' father. After Lina suggests that Alice incorporate a Ouija board into their readings, Alice does so, and unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus that begins to possess Doris. They end the game without saying "goodbye," breaking one of the three rules:
Never play alone, never play in a graveyard, and always say goodbye.
Source: Wikipedia
This movie is the prequel to 2014's “ Ouija ”. The "Ouija: Origin of Evil" in particular has some old vibes that recall me to the Exorcist and I think that it is great, because that movie is absolutely amazing and I love it.
"Ouija: Origin of Evil" does not have excessive jump scares, it has the right amount of them for you to enjoy what you're seeing and to follow the story.
The director of the movie Mike Flanagan gives “Ouija: Origin of Evil” the opportunity to follow the day-to-day life of all characters since the beginning:
The mom, Alice, has a complicated life, struggles with money and has to raise their daughters all alone because their husband died.
Doris, the younger daughter suffers at school because the kids there bully them The motive is their mother's job.
And finally we have the oldest daughter, Lina, that has a crush on a guy called Mikey (who's older then her). Them mom worries that this crush might ruin their daughter's life because she's young and we all know "what boys want".
Alice decides to step up their game and buy an Ouija board and starts to use it while working.
Well, as I said in the beginning, you just had three simple rules that are not supposed to be broken. Obviously that the movie's action starts when they break the rules and don't really seem to care much.
Well, every ghost movie needs to have that one character that has a deeper connection with danger and Doris was the one that had that one job.
They did a great job as an actor, by the way! I have to say that I'm super impressed with the way that young girl acted during the hole movie.
But!, the connection that they have with spirits is made due to the fact that their grandmother had real psychic powers.
The movie has some great potential and it doesn't have that typical vibe from other horror movies where everything will be alright in the end. That's a big plus for me because it gives us a different perspective of how movies can have a variety of endings.
All the cast is amazing and all of them, in my opinion, are fantastic.
Lulu Wilson was simply amazing and had a killer performance. I'm super impressed with her!
To end my review, this is not the typical jump scare after jump scare type of movie. It actually has some good consistency as well as a story line. The actors are amazing, the camera angles, the 60's theme, the cloths, everything comes together in the end.
Do I recommend this movie?
Yes, it's totally worth a try! I really like it!

Do you agree with my review? Tell me in the comments bellow!
Thank you so much for your attention and I'll see you on my next post!
XO,

Mahendra Nath Pandey of union minister of state for human resource development (HRD) said on Saturday 20 August that there are nearly eight to ten lakh assignments of teachers lying vacant in schools and higher educational institutions over the country. They stated that the government is taking the action to make the backlog and is also inviting suggestions to update the education policy which has not been revised since 1976.
Mahendra Nath Pandey, who was in Bareilly to participate in an event planned by Akhil Bharatiya Brahmin Mahasabha, told Times of India (TOI) in an interview. “Though it is true that there is an urgent lack of teachers in our country, it has been created due to a long backlog of posts lying vacant over years, and we are working to delegate more faculty members soon. We have identified that there is a requirement of nearly ten lakh teachers in our country in both schools and higher educational schools.”
Mahendra Nath Pandey said, the education system is not properly executed in our country, as it was revised in 1976 and it was first made in 1962. However, during the past year, no successive government yet took the action to change it in all these years. We are now requesting suggestions to introduce modifications according to the current challenges and prepare a new education policy for future. Pandey said,” due to rising number of affiliated colleges which at times run into hundreds, universities not being able to maintain quality. “Fixing a total number of affiliated colleges per university is on the agenda of both central and state governments. We are thinking about it.” The minister said that maintaining the quality of higher education was their priority. “Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme has been introduced to improve the standard of higher learning in the country. Furthermore, we are working to attach out students with facilities given at international levels through satellite. From the latest techniques, our students will be able to learn the latest technologies development, and they will award an extra 20% marks for this.
Iowa Religious Right group The Family Leader, a key player in the GOP's first-in-the-nation caucus, has a new plan to encourage legislators in Iowa to “do what God has asked them to do.”
The group is soliciting funds to purchase $100 leather-bound copies of “The Founders Bible” — which is annotated by hack historian David Barton with their thoughts on “our Judeo-Christian history as a nation”— for each member of the Iowa state legislature.
In “The Founders Bible,” legislators will find such educational passages as a retelling of Exodus that portrays Moses as the inventor of republican government; a made-up story about the early American government printing Bibles; an endorsement of the “Christian nation” concept from a notorious defender of slavery; information on the “many areas in which the Constitution specifically incorporated Biblical principles”; and an argument for the biblical origin of DNA evidence. All of this is intended to advance Barton's view that the U.S. government exists to carry out their interpretation of the Bible's commands.
In its fundraising appeal, The Family Leader asks churches to sponsor copies of Barton's Bible to give to legislators in their own districts at the group's “Life, Marriage and Family Rally” next week. While they're at the state capitol, the group is asking pastors to meet with legislators in order to engage “in this war with Satan, who has taken many captives in Des Moines” through such means as “working to divide Christian organizations, back room deals, or organizations like Planned Parenthood pushing wicked policies”:
Our goal has been to encourage pastors to team up with The FAMiLY LEADER in accomplishing our two main goals at TFL:
1. Fulfill the Great Commission by sharing the Gospel in the civic arena. We do this by building relationships and showing the love of Christ to not only elected officials, but also staff, lobbyists, campaign workers, and many others who engage in the civic arena with the purpose of pointing them to Christ.
2. Pass righteous legislation that will help our brothers and sisters in the church, as well as current believers. Government is one of God's three institutions, and when it fulfills its purpose, (which is to punish evil and reward good, Romans 13:1-4), it displays God's perfect design. Our goal is to help our elected officials do what God has asked them to do.
One of the ways we accomplish these goals is by our work at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines. The FAMiLY LEADER has four lobbyists who work at the capitol during the legislative session. The lobbyists are there to serve as missionaries. I am blessed to be one of them.
…
When pastors come to the Capitol, the first thing they do is meet with The FAMiLY LEADER team in the morning. We bring them up to date on what different legislation is being worked on, who is spiritually soft, who their ministers are, and who is in need of prayer. By meeting with us, we are able to bring pastors up to date as if they were there every day. Following the meeting, pastors then go upstairs to the House and Senate chambers and work with them to help them contact their different legislators.
What happens next is just amazing! We usually see dozens of pastors out in the Capitol rotunda praying, encouraging, building relationships, and sharing God's Word with legislators and many others. The environment at the Capitol completely changes when these pastors are present. There is less cursing, less back-stabbing, and the place even seems brighter! There is so much spiritual warfare in that building. Whether it is Satan working to divide Christian organizations, back room deals, or organizations like Planned Parenthood pushing wicked policies, these pastors are engaging in this war with Satan, who has taken many captives in Des Moines.
…
Specific projects:
Legislator Bibles – We want to bring the Gospel to the Iowa Legislature. The goal is to get 150 Founders' Bibles in the hands of Iowa's 150 legislators.
But we need your help to accomplish this goal. We are working with churches in each legislators' district to see if they will sponsor a Bible for their legislator. The cost for the Bible is $100.
When churches participate in the Iowa Capitol Project, they accomplish 3 big things:
1. Get a Bible in the hands of Iowa's lawmakers.
2. Connect a legislator with a local church (which we believe is most important).
3. Have that local church faithfully praying for their legislator. (Imagine each legislator having a congregation faithfully praying for them. Wow! God could really use that!)
The Bible itself is a Founders' Bible, which is a NASB Study Bible that focuses on our Judeo-Christian history as a nation. The Study Bible's devotions are written by Dr. David Barton. The Bible will be leather bound with gold trim on the pages, and it will be embossed with Seal of Iowa and the legislator's name. It will be something nice they will keep and hopefully read on a regular basis because of the compelling content pertaining to their job at the Capitol.
In order to initiate personal relationships between churches and legislators, we want a pastor and/or church members from the legislators' own district to personally present the Bibles on February 3rd at our annual Life, Marriage, and Family Rally.

The Post's Peter Finn tells you what you need to know about the audio released by the Islamic State on Saturday, Nov. 14 claiming responsibility for the attacks in Paris. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
The Islamic State stated that it was behind the attacks in Paris, one of the deadliest attacks in France since World War II. French President François Hollande called the massacres an “act of war” by the Islamic State. Read the full coverage here.
In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent
Allah (ta'ala) said, {They thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah but Allah came upon them from where they had not expected, and They cast terror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses by their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision} [Al-Hashr:2].
In a blessed battle whose causes of success were enabled by Allah, a group of believers from the soldiers of the Caliphate (may Allah strengthen and support it) set out targeting the capital of prostitution and vice, the lead carrier of the cross in Europe-Paris. This group of believers were youth who divorced the worldly life and advanced towards their enemy hoping to be killed for Allah's sake, doing so in support of Their religion, Their Prophet (blessing and peace be upon him), and Their allies. They did so in spite of Their enemies. Thus, they were truthful with Allah — we consider them so — and Allah granted victory upon their hands and cast terror into the hearts of the crusaders in their very own homeland.
And so eight brothers equipped with explosive belts and assault rifles attacked precisely chosen targets in the center of the capital of France. These targets included the Stade de France stadium during a soccer match — between the teams of Germany and France, both of which are crusader nations — attended by the imbecile of France (Francois Hollande). The targets included the Bataclan theatre for exhibitions, where hundreds of pagans gathered for a concert of prostitution and vice. There were also simultaneous attacks on other targets in the tenth, eleventh, and eighteenth districts, and elsewhere. Paris was thereby shaken beneath the crusaders' feet, who were constricted by its streets. The result of the attacks was the deaths of no less than two hundred crusaders and the wounding of even more. All praise, grace, and favor belong to Allah.
Allah blessed our brothers and granted them what they desired. They detonated their explosive belts in the masses of the disbelievers after finishing all their ammunition. We ask Allah to accept them amongst the martyrs and to allow us to follow them.
Let France and all nations following its path know that they will continue to be at the top of the target list for the Islamic State and that the scent of death will not leave their nostrils as long as they partake in the crusader campaign, as long as they dare to curse our Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him), and as long as they boast about their war against Islam in France and their strikes against Muslims in the lands of the Caliphate with their jets, which were of no avail to them in the filthy streets and alleys of Paris. Indeed, this is just the beginning. It is also a warning for any who wish to take heed.
Allah is the greatest.
(And to Allah belongs all honor, and to Their Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know) [Al-Munafiqun: 8].
Finnish VR and AR are growing rapidly, and attracting global notice
Augmented reality (AR) developer Magic Leap has announced that it will open an office in Helsinki to take advantage of the country's ICT strengths in optics as well as graphics hardware and software, as reported by Dennis Mitzner in TechCrunch.
Earlier this year, Magic Leap raised $793.5 million in a Series C round led by Alibaba – both AR and virtual reality (VR) have significant growth potential in China in the near future, especially in e-commerce, gaming, and film industries. Google, KPCB, and Andreessen Horowitz has also been a heavy backer in the company, which recently also opened an office in Seattle, despite rumors of internal strife going on there.
Industry speculation now attends the possibility that Magic Leap is preparing for a 2017 release of its Sensoryware line, though the company declined to offer any specifics about when and if it will debut its prototype AR glasses and an accompanying pocket computer.
The company's office expansion is in part driven by the fact that it wants to attract talent in these hubs since its headquarters, in Florida, is reportedly not an easy relocation sell to potential employees, so it is better to bring the offices to them, wherever they may be.
And Helsinki is increasingly one of those places for European markets. It is yet unclear what, if any, local partnerships have been established, though the secretive American company will surely be offering top euro for local hires with prior experience in the AR and VR sector.
The post-Nokia world
Such talent will not be in short supply. Arguably, the decline of Nokia's fortunes as a global ICT company have been a boon to the startup industry there. Employees left Nokia to pursue their own projects and the government – not wanting Finland to lose its standing as a tech powerhouse – was usually supportive of these new enterprises through the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, Tekes.
Finland, alongside other Nordic countries such as Iceland and Sweden, has seen a lot of growth in VR and AR. The Nordic VR investment sector has added over $230 million from mid-2015 onwards. Though Finland is a smaller market area than its neighbors around the Baltic Sea, as Geektime previously reported, it has “rich collaboration and knowledge transfer between startups and Finland's higher education institutions and R&D centers” as well as assistance from the Finnish government to startups and Nokia's established presence in this, its home county.
In summer 2016, Finland hosted northern Europe's largest VR-zone for a game developer assembly. Finland's strong ICT industry has seen several local VR and AR startups emerge in recent years, such as Vizor, Minefield Games, and Thinglink. Unity is one Finnish gaming company that has gone global, and now invests heavily in VR and AR, recently showcasing the best industry practices at an Asia-Pacific tech conference. (Yet another sign of how important the China market will be for VR and AR developers.)
Though a significant amount of VR work in Finland centers on the country's lively gaming industry, other applications are being pursued. Vizor, for instance, has potential across education and advertising services, and Thinglink offers a wide range of editing options on a 360-degree platform.
There is a local connection as well for Magic Leap in Finland: two of the company's executives previously worked in Finland for Nokia, which itself has entered the VR market with the 360-degree Ozo camera, a high-end production tool available in Europe, the US, and China for $45,000. Despite the steep price its sales, “have been better than anticipated”, and it is being bought up by big name players such as LeEco and Disney.
Although Silicon Valley is interested in expanding into Finland, Finnish startups are for now focusing close to home. “Traditionally, Finnish companies have had everything they need right there in Finland,” a Finnish marketing expert writes on Quora, “including talent and funding. Competing for those resources in Silicon Valley is beyond the financial means of most startups.”
To go global, Finnish companies will need to raise more capital at home first. Magic Leap's presence may help bring in what The Nordic Web says is vital to the success of the VR industry there. Local financing is somewhat limited, and risk-averse, and according to industry experts, “Finland desperately needs larger internationally-minded VCs” and in particular, “late stage maverick investors willing to take risks”, as well as further government support.
How dangerous are the indictments for US President Donald Trump?
It is important to note that the indictments against the former manager of Trump's presidential campaign, Paul Manafort, and another former campaign associate, Rick Gates, are not directly linked to the Trump presidential campaign and the president. It is also important to state that Manafort and Gates are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.
Having said that, the 12-count-indictment against Manafort and Gates which include charges of money laundering, failure to report foreign bank accounts and failure to report working as a foreign agent for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party "reveals strong ties to Russia and financial motives to assist Russia," said Lisa Kern Griffin, a law professor at Duke University.
And because three of the charges against Manafort include the period they served as Trump's campaign manager — contrary to what Trump tweeted — there is at least a chronological connection between the Manafort case and the Trump campaign.

Still, Trump's first reaction was likely relief that the indictments were not directly campaign-related, said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina. And should the case go on trial and the defendants be acquitted, the danger the issue poses for the Trump presidency would be greatly reduced, said Peter M. Shane, a law professor at Ohio State University.
But assuming, as the scholars tend to, that this is likely just the first major step in Mueller's widening probe into Russian election meddling and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, then President Trump has reason to be worried.
"This is very threatening", said Professor Shane. That's because even while not directly linked to the Trump campaign, the indictments and the guilty plea convey a clear message to others who may be in Mueller's legal crosshairs.
"It sends a strong signal to all potential witnesses and potential defendants that Mueller is going to proceed without fear of the external political noise and they are going to charge everyone for whom the facts support a charge", said Professor Kern Griffin. "Everyone in the orbit of the Russian connections to the campaign has reason to be concerned."
What's more, unlike the indictments against Manafort and Gates, the indictment against Papadopoulos, albeit a lower level campaign aide, does assert a direct Russia link.
According to the document, Papadopoulos tried to facilitate a contact with a "professor" with ties to the Russian government and met with a "female Russian national." The focus of at least one of their conversations was "thousands of emails" allegedly in the possession of the Russian government containing "dirt" on electon rival Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos' guilty plea is also a reminder to others potentially in Mueller's crosshairs to consider whether they may not want to cut a deal to provide valuable information to authorities in exchange for going free or for a more lenient sentence. The information provided in these initial cases can then be used to build additional indictments.
"There is no doubt that these prosecutions do give increased leverage over the people who have been indicted in terms of their providing information", said Shane. "It is clear that this not the end of the investigation."
"There will be more defendants charged," predicts Duke's Kern Griffin.
Can President Trump fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller?
Read more: Robert Mueller in possession of Donald Trump letter explaining Comey firing
Yes, they can. Given that Trump has repeatedly called the probe into Russian meddling in the US presidential election and the Trump campaign a "witch hunt" and that they fired former FBI chief James Comey, who had alleged in a memo that the president had asked them to close the Russia investigation, which Comey would not do, it is not a stretch to wonder whether Trump would be considering firing Mueller to end their Russia investigation.
The best legal option for them to do so would be via the Justice Department. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused themselves from the matter because they are implicated in it himself, Trump could ask Sessions' deputy Rod Rosenstein to dismiss Mueller. But firing Mueller is not easy since it would require them to establish a "good cause" as to how they violated the Justice Department's prosecution policy, said Shane. Should Rosenstein refuse to dismiss Mueller, Trump could fire them and essentially continue with this process until they find someone willing to do so, they added. But firing Mueller would surely cause a major political firestorm and probably lead to legal challenges.
"If they try to fire Mueller on their own it will be on the constitutional basis that could be disputable," said Michael Gerhardt, constitutional law professor at University of North Carolina. The "disputable" constitutional foundation that Gerhardt refers to is called "unitary executive theory" and stipulates in a nutshell that the constitution gives the president complete authority to fire anyone in the executive branch. It is highly contentious among legal scholars; should Trump fire Mueller directly based on this principle, the move would surely be challenged in the courts.
Can President Trump pardon their former campaign manager Manafort and other aides?

Read more: First charges filed in US special counsel's Russia investigation
Yes, they can. Not only can they pardon Manafort and any other defendants for any federal offenses committed, it is pretty well established, noted the scholars, that they can even issue a presidential pardon before a trial has begun.
But the reported collaboration of Mueller's team with New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman's office on the Manafort case could blunt the benefit of any potential presidential pardon. That's because while the president can pardon for federal offenses, they can't pardon state offenses. And several of the charges filed against Manafort and Gates — such as money laundering — could be prosecuted under state law as well. So should Trump issue a pardon, then Manafort and Gates could be charged under New York state law.
While pardoning Manafort and Gates would thus appear to have a limited impact, they would trigger a major backlash. But that still does not mean that Trump wouldn't do it.
"If they can pardon Sheriff Arpaio, they can likely pardon Manafort," said UNC's Gerhardt.
Asked about the likely steps President Trump and their team would take now next after their former campaign manager has been indicted, Duke's Lisa Kern Griffin summed up the legal scholars sentiment like this.
"What happens in TrumpWorld defies the logic of past political actions and similar investigation."
BuzzFeed's writers are evidently in danger of flying off the handle this election season. So, to keep them on a short leash, its chief editor had to distribute a memo reminding them not to “take partisan stands on social media.”
The Thursday email was intended for news division staff, which has been posting overly-excited tweets about the Clinton campaign, Business Insider found out. This appeared to be a direct appeal not to write things like “I've just wet myself, I'm so excited”, as Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination at the DNC in Philadelphia. The tweets were deleted.
—@BuzzFeedBen sends memo to staff reminding team to refrain from “partisan stands” on social https://t.co/3NLNTHbq8mpic.twitter.com/Ma3cJ2S281 — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) July 29, 2016
Reminding writers to refrain from promoting one candidate over another, Editor-in-chief Ben Smith had to admit the final stretch wasn't “simple terrain to navigate”. This is especially given Trump's rhetoric, which BuzzFeed feels is a red cloth for its young writers.
All of this can of course already be found in BuzzFeed's ethics guide, which states that writers are to refrain from “commenting in a partisan way about candidates or policy issues,” Business Insider says.
This is an interesting reminder, given how BuzzFeed killed its own ad deal with the Republicans last month. The editor felt that the “tone and substance” of what Trump was saying was not favorable and “directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States” and beyond. BuzzFeed, of course, also has Muslims writers, who would find it difficult to carry out their job's if travel bans were imposed as per Trump's vision.

This is not the first time Smith has emailed their staff with a similar request. In December they sent out an email to their editors after a question was voiced by some members of staff about whether calling Trump “a liar and a racist” violated the code of conduct. Smith explained that while the code exists to “preserve our readers' confidence that we can be fair,” exceptions can be made in the case of Trump.
They wrote that calling Trump “a mendacious racist” would be fine, given how “he's out there saying things that are false, and running an overtly anti-Muslim campaign.” So, that would not actually be distorting any facts, they explained.
But BuzzFeed has a history with having trouble staying on the sidelines. Editor Rachel Zarrell last year took to Twitter to comment on the deadly Louisiana shooting in July in Lafayette asking people: “don't pray. Push for gun control.” They also tweeted “Let's just give everyone guns, right? It's in the goddamn constitution.”
Calgary's RiverWalk was nominated for an award from the Urban Land Institute. (CMLC)
Calgary's new RiverWalk project is the only Canadian project to be nominated for an Urban Open Space Award.
RiverWalk, which spans a kilometre along the banks of the Bow River from Centre Street to the Simmons Building in the East Village, is among five finalists for the annual prize from the Urban Land Institute.
"RiverWalk was designed to be both a journey and a destination; creating a gathering place for Calgarians unlike anywhere else in the city," said Michael Brown, president of the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC), which spearheaded the project.
The other nominees are Highline Park and Pier 25 at Tribeca — both in New York City — and Railroad Park in Birmingham, Alabama and Tanner Springs Park in Portland, Oregon.
"We are proud to be in the company of these outstanding examples of public open space development from across North America", said Brown.
The finalists were chosen from entries from across North America based on project design and how each transformed its surrounding area, the CMLC said.
Phase one of RiverWalk opened in November 2010, followed by phase two in September 2011.
The third section — set to open this fall — will continue around Fort Calgary and south along the Elbow River to Ninth Avenue S.E.
River Walk will ultimately stretch four kilometres to Lindsay Park and link up with other pathways in the city.
CMLC is an independent development company the city created to help revitalize the East Village.
So far private developers have committed to over $650 million worth of investments in the area, including two major condo projects covering over half of the land in East Village and a Hilton hotel project.
CANAAN (WGME) -- State Police have arrested the youth pastor of a Canaan church and charged them with sexual abuse of a young girl.
Detectives have charged 37-year-old Lucas Savage of Clinton with unlawful sexual contact. Savage, the youth pastor at Youth Haven Ministries in Canaan, which is affiliated with the Canaan Calvary Church, was arrested Friday evening in Mercer and taken to the Kennebec County Jail.
Detectives said the abuse took place at Savage's home on Mutton Lane in Clinton. State Police have been investigating the allegations for the past month.
Residents in the area say Canaan is a small, safe town where bad things don't happen. Denise Caroll who works in Canaan told CBS 13, "You don't really hear of crime here." Another local, Randy Smith, said, "It's terrible for a small town like this to have such things happen."
Detectives do not know if there are additional victims and their investigation will remain open.
Anyone with information about the case should contact State Police in Augusta at 1-800-452-4664.

NuScale Power's full-scale upper module mockup of its NuScale Power Module includes all major components: the upper portion of the containment vessel, major piping such as steam, feed water, and CVC, control rod drive mechanisms, major valves such as isolation valves and ECC valves, and the module access platform. (Photo: Business Wire)
PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NuScale Power, LLC announced today that it has completed fabrication and assembly of a full-scale, upper module mockup of its NuScale Power ModuleTM (NPM).
The upper module mockup consists of the top assembly of the NuScale Power Module from the module access platform down to the elevation of the reactor vessel head. The availability of a full-scale mockup with accurately sized and located components will give NuScale's engineers important insights into the inspection and maintenance activities that are essential to plant operation. Major components that comprise the assembled mockup are:
The upper portion of the containment vessel
Reactor vessel head
Major piping such as steam, feed water, and CVC
Control rod drive mechanisms
Major valves such as isolation valves and ECC valves
The module access platform
The mockup provides the following benefits to NuScale's design team and stakeholders:
provides a life-sized replication of a small modular reactor
provides ability to plan for accessibility, worker safety and OSHA requirements
supports radiation protection planning (ALARA) to minimize exposure time for refueling and maintenance workers
supports maintenance planning
supports inspection planning
supports fabrication planning
supports customer and regulator inquiries regarding reactor module configuration
“The fabrication of this full-scale, upper module mockup is an important step in the continued support of our reactor design,” stated Dale Atkinson, NuScale's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Nuclear Officer. “It provides our engineers with an important opportunity for in-service inspection evaluations which are scheduled to begin in May.”
As the only U.S.-based company established solely for the commercialization of its SMR, NuScale Power has developed a unique and proprietary break-through technology for an innovative, simple, safe, economic and scalable small modular reactor. Natural forces of physics—gravity, convection, and conduction—are used for normal operations and safe shutdown. This eliminates many of the large and complex systems (e.g., reactor coolant pumps, motors, valves, large-diameter reactor coolant system piping) found in today's nuclear power plants and other SMR designs. As a result, the NuScale plant is safe, simpler, and less expensive to build and operate. At 50 megawatts of electricity (gross) per module, a NuScale power plant can include as many as 12 NuScale Power Modules™ to produce as much as 600 MWe, gross (570 net, nominal, after house loads).
NuScale will host the first NuScale Exposition (NuEx) on August 20-21, 2015 on site in Corvallis, Oregon. NuEx will provide members of the utility community, investors and other interested parties the opportunity to learn more about the US leader in SMR development, tour its facilities, talk with NuScale senior executives, and interface with suppliers and investors. The upper module mockup is just one of several NuScale facilities that will be included in the NuEX tour schedule.
About NuScale Power, LLC
NuScale Power, LLC is developing a new kind of nuclear plant; a safer, smaller, scalable version of pressurized water reactor technology, designed with natural safety features. Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR), a global engineering, procurement and construction company with a 60-year history in commercial nuclear power, is the majority investor in NuScale. As the sole winner of the second round of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) competitively-bid, cost-sharing program to develop nuclear small modular reactor (SMR) technology, NuScale's design offers the benefits of carbon-free nuclear power but takes away the issues presented by the cost of installing large capacity. A nuclear power plant using NuScale's technology is comprised of individual NuScale Power Modules™, each producing 50 megawatts of electricity (gross) with its own factory-built combined containment vessel and reactor vessel, and its own packaged turbine-generator set. A power plant can include as many as 12 NuScale Power Modules to produce as much as 600 MWe, gross (570 net, nominal, after house loads). The reactor coolant is driven by natural circulation and can be shut down safely with no operator action, no AC or DC power, and no external water. NuScale power plants are scalable - additional modules are added as customer demand for electricity increases. NuScale's technology also is ideally suited to supply energy for district heating, desalination and other applications. NuScale is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and has offices in Corvallis, OR; Rockville, MD; Atlanta, GA; Charlotte, NC; and Chattanooga, TN. For more information visit: www.nuscalepower.com.
Today was my last day at work for this year, I got home early and found a red envelope with lots and lots of the coolest stamps I've ever seen. We don't have Harry Potter or Batman stamps over here. This alone made the card the coolest I ever got. And my friends will be so jealous when I show them the envelope. They are a bit obsessed with Batman.
...Then I opend the envelope and I think I crowed like a little girl, I love glittering things, especially for Christmas. There were a beautiful Peanuts Holiday Card, Disney Babies stickers and a long letter on Peanuts letter paper inside.
The letter was great and I'll write back to you, Katie, as soon as I found an equally beautiful card for you. You made a good day even better,
Thank you so much
LG may not have announced their new flagship device at Mobile World Congress, but that didn't stop them from taking home some pretty impressive awards. For starters, the LG G3 was named Best Smart Phone of the Year by the GSMA at the Global Mobile Awards that were held during Mobile World Congress. According to GSMA, the LG G3 won due to, "its quality, variety of useful features and ease of use." Juno Cho, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company said, "We are honored that so many organizations recognized the effort that went into developing the LG G3 and Urbane smartwatches."
The LG G3 has been a successful phone for LG. According to a press release, it is carried by over 170 partners globally and the company cites the LG G3 as the catalyst behind a 16 percent increase in its global revenue. The GSMA noted the LG G3s easy-to-use interface, quality specs including its Quad HD screen, its innovative camera that has a 13-megapixel shooter complete with OIS+ and Laser Auto Focus. They also pointed out the G3's Smart Keyboard, Gesture for Selfie, Flash for Selfie and its Knock Code feature as strong reasons why the LG G3 was chosen as the winner.
Along with accolades for its flagship smartphone, LG also won awards for its smartwatches. The LG Watch Urbane and Watch Urbane LTE managed to pull in nine awards during Mobile World Congress. The LG Watch Urbane took home the best smartwatch award from several technology media outlets. The watches were also recognized for being the first smartwatch with NFC-based payment features. It was also recognized for having the best and most powerful battery in the mobile smartwatch space.
LG is set to announce the upcoming LG G4 sometime in the latter half of 2015. They have also hinted that they will be releasing a second line of premium phones that will supposedly rise above the G line of smart devices. If these devices turn out to be as popular and as innovative as the LG G3, then we can expect to see more awards coming to LG in future mobile events, and maybe even next years Mobile World Congress. We will have to wait and see what LG has in store for us, if it manages to be a success such as the LG G2 and LG G3 have been, we may be in store for a treat.

As the most expensive and ambitious structure ever assembled, the International Space Station has been an unequivocal success in its continuing mission to impart a wealth knowledge upon all humankind. We spoke to the man who oversaw the construction of the ISS and one of the station's most recent residents to tell the incredible story of this $100 billion marvel.
The history of the International Space Station
15 years ago on 20 November 1998, a Russian Proton rocket lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Its payload was a single module called Zarya (Dawn), funded by the US and built by Russia, that would serve as the first component of a global venture the likes of which had never been seen before.
Just over two weeks later, on 6 December 1998, Space Shuttle Endeavour flying on the STS-88 mission took the US-built Unity module into space and berthed it with Zarya. With the connection of these two inaugural modules, construction on the International Space Station (ISS) had begun.
The ISS is perhaps the greatest example of what can be achieved through international cooperation. With a cost estimated at around $100 billion (£63 billion), the most expensive manmade structure ever assembled, the logistics and planning of building and operating a space station of this size have been stupendous. Today, many members of the public take the ISS for granted, with astronauts and cargo regularly making their way to and from the station 420 kilometres (260 miles) up seemingly with ease, but the construction and operation of this technological marvel have been anything but easy.
John Shannon, now the ISS Program Manager for Boeing, was the launch flight controller for NASA when Endeavour undertook that fateful mission in 1998. Having worked at NASA for 25 years up until earlier this year when they joined Boeing, Shannon oversaw the development and growth of the ISS into the marvel we know it to be today.
“We've learned a lot since that first module,” says Shannon, speaking to All About Space. “I think the really tough part to me of learning how to build this enormous structure in space was that it had to be a viable spacecraft the whole time. It wasn't just like a ship you can build in dry dock and launch when it's all finished up; we had to really think through how all the systems would work as we were building it out in the most hazardous environment that people can operate in.”
Building the ISS
The challenge of building the ISS has not only been from a technical standpoint, but from a political and logistical one as well. The station was borne out of the cancelled American Space Station Freedom and Russian Mir-2 programmes, with those two projects merging along with commitments from other international partners including Japan and Europe into the space station in operation today.
Space Station Freedom was first proposed in the early Eighties, but cost overruns and budget cuts saw the programme continually delayed. In June 1993 a crucial vote in the House of Representatives saw an attempt to scrap the programme fail by a one-vote margin (215-216). Had the programme been scrapped, it is likely the ISS as we know it would not have been built, as many of the components from Freedom have been incorporated into its design.
Another pivotal moment in the development of the ISS was the decision by the Clinton administration in September 1993 to partner with Russia in the station's construction. NASA was finding the prospect of building a station of the scope and size of the ISS to be a daunting prospect, both financially and technically. Russia's involvement would prove to be vital; they could supply several of the modules needed for a fully operating station, as well as the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft needed to take crew and cargo into orbit.
”That was a very difficult and intense time, to see how the two primary countries [the US and Russia] could work together with the other [international] partners to build the station,” explains Shannon. “But once we launched the first elements in 1998 we had a really good idea of what the overall plan was going to be.”
The plan for the ISS was ambitious, to say the least. While it was preceded by a number of space stations, namely America's Skylab and Russia's Mir and Salyut stations, none of those could compare in size and complexity to the ISS. Here was a station that would be as big as an American football field upon its completion and weigh more than 330 cars on Earth, while also providing a liveable environment in which astronauts could continuously live.
Soyuz spacecraft could take crews to the station, but it was the Space Shuttle that would be the key to building the ISS; the robotic arm on board the shuttle was needed to berth various modules together. The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on 1 February 2003, when the shuttle disintegrated on re-entry and killed its crew of seven, therefore put the station's construction on hiatus while the Shuttle programme was grounded for two and a half years amidst safety concerns.
Aside from that period, construction of the ISS has continued unabated to a point today that many see the station as being complete and fully operational, although some further modules are planned. The ISS has now been continuously manned for a record of over 4,700 days since 2 November 2000 when Expedition 1 began, the first long-duration crew to reside on the ISS, surpassing the previous record of almost 10 years (3,634 days) held by Mir.
Why is the ISS important?
”The building was the first big thing,” explains Shannon, “and now we're really into the utilisation and we're starting to see this eye-watering breadth of activity.” Since its inception the ISS has had numerous goals, but it has focused around three main areas. The first is research that could improve life on Earth. Thousands of experiments are running on the ISS at any one time, and many of these have direct connotations for counterparts on Earth. This includes medical research, physical sciences, curing diseases and developing new materials. Through this goal alone the ISS has more than proved its worth.
The ISS has also been hugely important in terms of the future of space exploration. “With the Shuttle we were limited to two weeks [in space],” says Shannon. “[On the ISS] we've seen physiological changes in bones and eyes, pressure on your spinal cord, and a lot of different things that we never would have known if we were just doing two-week flights on the Shuttle. If we had set off to go to an asteroid or Mars for months-long missions they could have debilitated the crew such that they couldn't have accomplished their mission, or they could have come to great harm, so the ISS is this wonderful safe test bed where you can experiment on crews so that when we do go beyond low Earth orbit we can do so much more safely.”
The third key use of the ISS is to serve as a destination for a new generation of spacecraft designed by both national and private space agencies. Throughout its lifetime it has welcomed the Space Shuttle, Russia's Soyuz and Progress, the Japanese HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle), the European ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) and SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The newest visitor was the Cygnus spacecraft, built by Orbital Sciences, which is competing with SpaceX for commercial cargo contracts from NASA. And the visitors don't stop there; in the future Boeing aims to send its manned CST-100 capsule to the station, while Sierra Nevada Corporation wants its Dream Chaser space plane to ultimately dock with the ISS.
Life on the ISS
For those astronauts that live aboard the ISS, these constant visiting spacecraft are just one aspect of the exciting jobs they lead. Life on the station “is spectacular, in a word,” NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn tells All About Space, who was part of the Expedition 34/35 crew that included Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield and stayed aboard the ISS from 18 November 2012 to 13 May 2013. “I don't think it's overstating it to say it's the greatest technological achievement that humans have gotten to at this point.”
For Marshburn life on the ISS was both “exhausting and exciting,” with their intense mission schedules countered with their ability to see gorgeous views of the Earth from a vantage point enjoyed only by a few hundred people. “I was constantly astounded by what human beings from around the world had accomplished,” says Marshburn. “It really hits you when you get there and when you think of almost two acres of technology going 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometres) per hour and we're living in the middle of it. It's just a dream come true in a lot of ways.”
On board the ISS the astronauts have a lot of work to do. Although the station experiences a sunrise and sunset every 90 minutes as it orbits the Earth, the astronauts still structure their days like they would on Earth. They operate on GMT, waking in the morning before completing tasks throughout the day. These can range from station maintenance to experiments to, on rare occasions, extravehicular activities (EVAs, or spacewalks) outside the station. They are afforded some ‘downtime' to relax, which many astronauts like to make use of by heading to the Cupola module and staring at the Earth or taking pictures, before heading to bed at night in their telephone booth-sized private quarters. Every day they must also do two and a half hours of exercise to ensure their body survives the adverse effects of living in a microgravity environment, such as the decreased bone mass that can occur.
The station itself is big, with a typical size estimate comparing it to an elongated five-bedroom house, so when astronauts first arrive at the station it can be a bit of a maze. “You're like a deer in the headlights, definitely on your first day,” explains Marshburn. “After the third or fourth month, that's when you realise you're a part of the station, that it's almost another crew member. You know its intricacies, its sounds, and the certain feel it has about it. It develops a personality.”
Despite the incredible complexity of the station, Marshburn says that the most difficult things to do in space are things we take for granted here on Earth. “The easy things down here are the most difficult things up there,” they say. For example, “you'll lose any little thing you put down that you haven't already figured out a way to restrain. One thing you figure out in space is that if you're only going to put something down for just a moment you can float it, just let go of it, and come back ten seconds later and it'll still be there.”
These simple quirks of spaceflight to grand experiments like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which is hunting for signs of dark matter, are a testament to just how much the ISS has benefited humankind, and there's still much to learn. While the operating lifetime of the ISS is currently under discussion, with the current preference being to keep the station running until 2028, those involved with the space station are anxious to keep it going as long as possible.
The future of the ISS
“15 years from now we'll be thinking about [de-orbiting the ISS],” says Shannon. By then, our knowledge of space exploration will be such that we can safely and effectively expand our sphere of influence in space, and we will have performed groundbreaking science along the way in experiments that couldn't be replicated on Earth.
When the time comes to bring the curtain down on humankind's greatest endeavour, we will have kept a continuous presence in space for almost three decades. By that time, we will well and truly be ready to explore new frontiers. “We will have learned what we need to learn about people's reaction to space so that we can go farther and deeper into space,” concludes Shannon. “I think that's going to be the legacy of the ISS.”

“You go away and spend time away from your family, and so you want some rewards at the end of it,” they say. “But I have got to take my hat off to Glen Johnson. They have been fantastic this season, so I don't expect to be playing ahead of him.”
With no prospect of getting a cap, Walker instead preoccupied themselves with getting a shirt. They asked David Luiz, who they had met a few times while out and about with their team-mate Sandro, to ask Alves for their shirt.
“I wasn't sure when they were giving it to me if they knew who I was,” Walker admits. “I was just a bit in awe of him. I thanked them for it, and tweeted them to say thank you. I'll frame it.”
That the Tottenham right-back counts their Barcelona counterpart not as a rival, but an idol, tells you a little about Walker the man. But it tells you a little about Walker the footballer, too. The 22-year-old claims not to be a student of the game. When they get home after training they are more likely to sit down in front of an episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show, or a game of Fifa 13, than the Bundesliga highlights. (“It's on the Sky planner. It just makes me feel great to see Kyle slaughtering people.”)
But when there is something useful to be learned, some way of improving their game, they are all ears. They study clips of Alves on YouTube. “I can relate to him,” Walker says. “For Barcelona, they don't play full-back. He's like a winger, isn't he? And the wingers tuck in and crowd up that inside bit.”
The rise of Walker's career has brought its challenges. Winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award, beating contenders including Gareth Bale and Sergio Agüero, earning international recognition, establishing themselves as one of the Premier League's best right-backs: all of this came with its costs. Teams are a little wiser to Walker these days.
“There is a lot of pressure on me to go out and do what I did last season,” Walker explains. “Now this season, people know I'm going to get forward, go on the overlaps, go on the underlaps, pass and go, try and get shots off and get in the box wherever I can, and people try and stop that. Midfielders try and cheat, and stay up the pitch so I have to do more defending, rather than attacking which is my strong point.”
After a mixed start to the season, Walker sought out Bale for advice. “I spoke to Gareth numerous times about it,” they say. “And they said that after the season when they were player of the year, to go back out and do it again the next year was difficult. You have people doubling up on you. People are marking you as a threat, so they are doing videos on you to see your weaknesses.”
What did Bale say? “Gareth just said you've just got to keep getting at them. Don't always go one way. Mix it up. Go outside, go around players, one or two touches. It's going to take time. Hopefully it will slowly start to sink in.”
The way Walker speaks about their game betrays a certain footballing intelligence.  They are aware of their strengths and weaknesses. “If somebody wants to race me, I will race him,” they say. “I don't like the tricky players who jump into holes and start passing. That's when you have to be on the ball a bit more.”
But the influence of similarly-minded players has clearly helped: Aaron Lennon, for example, who Walker regards as the equal of Bale. “They are both the same in my eyes,” they insist. “I could not pick one or the other.  They are probably the most unselfish player I have played with. Sometimes I have to tell them to shoot more and get their name on the score-sheet.”
So: Lennon, Bale, Walker. Who is the quickest? The answer may surprise you. “Over 100 metres, like the Olympics, I think it would be Younes Kaboul,” Walker reckons. “Azza has got 50 in him, and then their little legs won't carry them any more.”
Walker chuckles heartily, and for another fleeting second, they are just Kyle from Sheffield again.

Caretakers at the Ramat Gan Safari came up with a creative way to help an abused donkey heal from theirs wounds.
Before Haim the donkey arrived at the safari, they were regularly tied up with barbed wire behind their owners' home, where local children would abuse the helpless animal.
Haim was eventually brought to the safari in Ramat Gan, the largest animal sanctuary in the Middle East and home to 1,600 animals of different species.

Haim began a long rehabilitation process, gradually learning to trust their caretakers and even overcoming their fear of children.
Their physical wounds, however, took longer to heal. Their lower legs, where they were bound, had the fur rubbed off, and flies would bite their raw skin. The flies caused Haim to bite and scratch their legs, leaving sores and cuts that in turn attracted more flies. The donkey was caught in a painful cycle.
Staff at the safari first fashioned them a pair of socks to cover their wounds, held in place with medical tape. Unfortunately, the daily switching of the socks and replacement of the tape aggravated Haim's wounds, and they tried scratching off the tape.
Two caretakers, Becca Rivkin and Shira Inbar-Danin, came up with a solution. They spent four hours stitching a special pair of pants for the donkey that are held up by suspenders over their shoulders. The pants are double-layered, with a soft stretchy material on the inside, covered by a rougher baggy material that flies can't bite through. The two women also rub cream on their legs every day.
The special pants are working swimmingly, and Haim will soon receive pants for their hind legs as well. With their skin protected, their fur is expected to grow back quickly, and then Haim the donkey will be able to trot around bare-ass once again.
(CNN) — You've seen this person. Maybe you've even been this person.
We're talking about someone shuffling along a sidewalk or through a shopping mall, so entranced by the phone in their hands that they bump into people or almost get run over.
Yes, this behavior can be annoying. Now we have scientific evidence it can be dangerous. A new study has found that people who type or read on their phones while walking are less likely to look at their surroundings, keep their balance or walk in a straight line.
This may seem obvious to anyone who has been jostled by an oblivious text messager. But researchers at Australia's University of Queensland say theirs is the first study to measure how typing text on a cellphone impacts “gait performance” and kinematics, or the study of body motion.
“Texting, and to a lesser extent reading, on your mobile phone affects your ability to walk and balance,” said Siobhan M. Schabrun, an honorary senior fellow at the University of Queensland and the lead author of the study. “This may impact the safety of people who text and walk at the same time.”
The perils of texting while driving are well documented. But texting while walking has its own pitfalls. In January 2011 a woman fell headlong into a fountain at a Pennsylvania mall while tapping on their phone, a blunder that was captured by a security camera and was widely mocked on YouTube.
Last October an Illinois man was struck by a car while texting on their phone and walking in the middle of a highway (authorities said they also are drinking at the time). And a nationwide study by Ohio State University last year found that the number of pedestrians treated in U.S. emergency rooms for injuries related to phone use while walking has more than doubled since 2005.
In the new Australian study, scientists studied the effect of phone use while walking in 26 healthy people. Each person walked in a line over a distance of about 28 feet while doing one of three tasks: walking without the use of a phone, reading text on a phone, or typing the sentence, “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
Their bodies' movements were evaluated using a three-dimensional movement analysis system. Researchers found that texting, and to a lesser extent reading, affected movements while walking. When participants were texting, they walked more slowly, deviated more from a straight line and moved their neck less than when reading on their phones.
The study was published Wednesday in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed online journal that publishes reports on primary research from a variety of scientific disciplines.
In an episode that re-creates a scene from the French film Amelie, Murphy was returned to Eve Stuart-Kelso with a letter saying they had taken off because they had "itchy feet".
In the 2001 film, starring Audrey Tautou, Amelie steals their father's gnome and gives it to a friend who takes it around the world and posts back pictures of it in famous places to show them what they are missing in life.
Besides Murphy was a Tesco carrier bag containing the album of 48 photos and stamped immigration permits to South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Hong Kong and Laos.
The album showed Murphy - who weighs a hefty 8lb (3.6kg) - abseiling down a mountain, standing in a shark's mouth, swimming in the sea, and riding a motorbike.
Murphy took to their travels with a companion only referred to as "The Bear" - although some of the photos picture a group of young men who might have been responsible.
The accompanying letter explained their disappearance: "There's more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you."
Mrs Stuart-Kelvo, who once ran a motel in Florida with their husband, said it was "such a shock" to see Murphy returned to the front garden of their Gloucester home.
They said: "The leprechaun went missing many, many months ago and I had forgotten about it.
"Then I opened the door on Thursday and saw they were back. It was such a shock.
"I thought, 'Well, it's a bit of mischief but at least they haven't been put through the window.'
"Murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him. My curiosity eventually overcame my alarm, because I did wonder if it might explode.
"Then I saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up.
"His feet were missing, but that's no real surprise given that they were sent abseiling down a mountain!"
They added: "It was the strangest gift I have ever received. I just keep thinking how funny it is. It makes me smile to see all the people they met on their travels. It was a wonderful surprise."
Murphy's letter read: "Hello! First of all I feel I should explain my prolonged absence. A gnome's life is full of time for reflection, and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning, I began to get itchy feet.
"I came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic, and allowing passing cats to urinate on you.
"So I decided to free myself from the doldrums of the Shire and seek adventure. My travels have taken me across three continents, 12 countries and more time zones than I can possibly remember.
"There have been high points, low points, and positively terrifying points. But I have survived - small thanks to the companion with whom I have shared all these moments."
The letter also revealed that Murphy - whom their captor called Barrington - met former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott on their outbound trip to Cape Town.
"Said hello to the big man and they seemed a decent enough bloke but unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me," they wrote.
A spokesperson for Gloucestershire Constabulary remained straight-faced about the matter, saying: "Any theft of a person's property, even if it is carried out as a joke, will be treated as a crime by police."
But Mrs Stuart-Kelso said they would be "delighted" to meet the culprit. "I thought the album was wonderful," they said.
Winnipeg police have arrested three men in connection with a Waverley Street condo fire they say was deliberately set two years ago, causing approximately $5 million in damages.
"The building was a complete loss," Const. Jay Murray said Thursday morning.
A lengthy investigation began after the arson on Oct. 21, 2015. Police arrested a 22-year-old Winnipeg man, a 23-year-old man from Morris and a 24-year-old from Amaranth on Wednesday.
The Waverley condominium was under construction at the time and was fully engulfed in flames by the time emergency crews arrived. Estimates at the time pegged damages at $3.5 million, a number of police now say was about $1.5 million less than the true cost of the damage.
Police suspected at the time that a break-in at a separate construction site nearby on Southview Crescent on the same night was connected to the fire because alcohol and accelerants were found on site. A fire was also set at the Southview site but extinguished itself and caused minimal damage, Murray said.
Police still don't know for sure whether the accelerants were used to start the Waverley fire.
Investigators eventually definitively linked the break-in and the arson, Murray said. An investigation that included "electronic evidence" and examinations of DNA led police to arrest the three men this week.
All three were charged with breaking and entering, arson and possession of incendiary materials.
"The belief is one of the accused may have a fascination with fire," Murray said.
There are no other suspects in the case.
CLOSE A 5,500-squarefoot home is for sale for $137,900 in South Dakota. But there's a catch, check it out. USA TODAY
This house in Winner just sold to a local couple for $119,000 -- thousands less than its listing price -- after five months of calls and emails from across the U.S. and around the globe, including what the real estate agent called "bizarre" questions about Winner and South Dakota. (Photo: shippingrealty.com)
Rick Shippy is really glad to get that mansion off theirs hands.
After five months on the market, hundreds of phone calls from all over the U.S. and around the globe, sight-unseen cash offers, bizarre questions and nearly daily emails that just won't stop, It's gone.
The mansion in Winner, S.D., population 2,900, just sold to a local buyer. David and Tessa Howard, managers of the Winner airport, bought it for about $119,000 after deals with two previous buyers fell through. That's thousands of dollars less than the listing price of $137,900.
"It was five crazy months," Shippy said.
Shippy owns Shippy Realty in Winner with their wife, Lin. They listed the century-old, five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on an unremarkable weekday in January.
By that Saturday, it had taken over their lives.
"We had more activity on that house than we‘ve had in the nine years we've been in business, of all of our properties put together," Shippy said.

And those questions about Winner and South Dakota? Shippy is tired of them.
"I could absolutely write a book with the stupid comments people made. It was just bizarre," they said.
A small sample:
"Do they have gravel on the streets in winter, or do they have dirt trails?" (No, Winner has paved roads.)
"Do we have to bus our children to Rapid City, Sioux Falls or Pierre to get to school?" (No, Winner has schools.)
"Do you still worry about Indians raiding?" (No, and they're called Native Americans now, Shippy informed them.)
"Do you have cops and law enforcement in winter?" (Yes, but they ride on horses and carry six-shooters, said an exasperated Shippy. The caller believed him.)
"I'm like, 'Where are you people from exactly?' " Shippy said. "We're not at the end of the earth."
Shippy started telling people who offered cash for the mansion, sight unseen, that they'd have to visit the place first before he'd consider their offer.
Offers from two potential buyers fell through. But then a local buyer stepped up. A week later, the deal was done.

Shippy couldn't be more pleased the much ballyhooed mansion is sold.
"It's a quite a relief," they said. "It's like any house, it's fun in the beginning."
The buyer
David and Tessa Howard didn't think they'd get a chance to buy what is now the most famous house in Winner.
The two live in a modular house at the Winner airport, which they manage. David Howard is a flight instructor.
It didn't take long after the mansion was put on the market for it to become intertwined with what people know about Winner, Howard said.
Everyone from a supplier in Minnesota to a paint seller in Rapid City brought up the mansion when Howard mentioned Winner.
"Everybody's heard about this house," they said. "It's an interesting phenomenon. I'm not quite sure what to attribute everything to."
►More: Speeds creep higher with new 80 mph speed limits
They said the couple kept tabs on the house through Shippy and heard the saga of global interest, people seeking to buy the place, but genuine offers falling through.
"We really thought it was sold, for sure to the last buyer they had, and even the previous buyers they had," Howard said.
Then they got their chance.
Howard said they plan to update the plumbing, some windows and do some painting. But at the moment, the couple plan to keep living at their modular home at the airport. They have no plans to move to the mansion.
"At this point, we don't know what we're going to do with it," they said. "Hopefully it's going to be something that benefits the community in some way, either as a rental or as a nicer house back on the market. We don't even know that yet."
The Winner mansion going back on the market? Look out, Howards. Get ready for the phone calls.

To be honest, I'm not sure if this says more about Tim Lincecum or the struggling, offensively inept San Diego Padres.
I mean, if you were to grade each no-hitter on a degree of difficulty scale from 1 to 10, factoring in the strength of the opponent, the ballpark and the weather, a no-hitter against the Padres at AT&T Park on a gray, hazy day would have to be a 1.
Still ... a no-hitter is a no-hitter, they're always fun and there's always a good story behind each one. Retiring 27 major league hitters without giving up a hit is a terrific accomplishment, even if no-hitters have become more prevalent in recent seasons and even if this one came against one of the worst offensive teams (maybe the worst) in modern history.
Tim Lincecum enjoys finishing their second no-hitter against the Padres; when he's on, he's on. Kelley L Cox/USA TODAY Sports
For Lincecum, it's a reminder -- despite their ups and downs since 2012 -- that when everything comes together they can still out-think opposing hitters, even if they can no longer blow fastballs by them. Lincecum also pitched a no-hitter last July against the Padres, but that one was in San Diego, so it was nice that this one came in front of a happy home crowd. The two no-hitters were completely different in nature: That first one required 148 pitches as Lincecum struck out 13 and walked four. This one required just 113 as they fanned six and walked one (a second-inning walk to Chase Headley). After the game, Bruce Bochy gave a speech to the team in the clubhouse and joked about Lincecum making this one a lot easier for them by keeping their pitch count down.
Lincecum went to a three-ball count just five times, and their highest-pitch inning was the first, with 18. In the late innings, they looked calm and relaxed and even started a seventh-inning rally that helped the Giants extend a 2-0 lead to 4-0. With the Padres using three different pitchers in that inning, it led to a long break before the top of the eighth. But Lincecum got Headley to ground softly to first for the first out. They fell behind 2-0 to Tommy Medica, and the biggest pitch of the game might have been a 2-1 90 mph fastballs that Medica was late on. They popped up to first base on a curveball, and then Alexi Amarista flew out harmlessly to center.
Everything was working well for Lincecum -- when he's on, he's spotting their four-seamer and two-seam sinker on the corners, which sets up their curveball, slider and split/changeup as strikeout pitches. The interesting thing about Lincecum is that even though their ERA is 4.70 since 2012, their strikeout rate has remained above average. If they can get to two strikes, they can still wipe batters out. Of course, he's been a much better pitcher at home these past three seasons: They have a 3.98 ERA and .230 average at AT&T but a 5.59 ERA and .278 average on the road.
Heading into the ninth, the no-hitter seemed inevitable considering the Padres entered the game hitting .216 as a team with a .275 OBP. If that holds, the only team with a lower average would be the 1968 Yankees, who hit .214. The Pads' OBP would be the lowest since 1920. Still, no-hitters are tough to finish off:
This is a great site. It's about 50-50 starting 9th, 60-65% chance after 1 out, almost 80% with 2 out http://t.co/R5wS6gPYZ4 @dschoenfield — James Smyth (@JamesSmyth621) June 25, 2014
Pinch hitter Chris Denorfia got ahead 2-0 but took a fastball for a strike, missed a slider and then missed a curveball in the dirt. Yasmani Grandal bounced back to the mound on 3-2 slider. If there's one pitch the Padres would like back, it was the 1-1 91 mph fastball right down the middle to Will Venable that they foul tipped. They then grounded out to second.
So Lincecum has thrown no-hitters in back-to-back seasons against the Padres -- a team that has never thrown a no-hitter. Leading to this tweet:
With Gwynn and Coleman deaths, along with a completely unwatchable team on the field, this has to be they the worst Padres season ever — Jorge Arangure (@jorgearangure) June 25, 2014
A bad day for the Padres. A great day for the little guy with the terrible mustache.
Dear Boss,
I joined my current team as an event coordinator about four months ago and am the sole events person on the team. The way our team is structured, we have two project managers who work on different events, managing associates who assist them with the programs, and both project managers work directly with me to plan the logistics for the events.
One of the project managers, Jane, had a baby last year. Because of this, they have been afforded an extremely flexible schedule (working from home two days a week, leaving early all the other days), which I think is great, as it allows them to have a work-life balance. The problem is this: One of the project associates and I are constantly being asked to stay full-time at these programs, when Jane is allowed to come and go pretty much as they please, sometimes to be home, but other times they have taken vacation DURING the weeks of their programs, and pushed off the week-of responsibilities to the associate on the team. In fact, usually when this other associate is asked to come to an event, it is not one that they are even working on, but it's because Jane does not want to be there or says they can't be there because of their baby and they have the director pull someone off another project to come be on-site.
Another example is coming up next week. Jane and I are working on a weeklong program, local to our area (usually we travel a few states away), but initially were both planning to stay at the hotel to ensure that we had someone on-site at all time. However, somehow Jane and the director of our team decided that they will only stay over for one or two of the days (and arrive every morning), and I will have to be there on-site the entire time, 24/7. Am I wrong in thinking that because this is their program, they should also have to be there, or we should be able to switch off? I feel as though I'm being discriminated against because I don't have a child, and they are assuming that my time is always free.
I want to note that I have no problem being on-site when I need to be … for example, most of our programs are not local, and I am on-site from a day or two before the program until the very last attendee leaves and all the materials are cleaned up. For some reason, though, it's really grating on me that we are local, everyone else will get to go home, but I have to stay there because I don't have a child at home. I've tried pushing back and saying that maybe we can switch off a few days, but the director keeps insisting someone should be on-site for “emergencies.” I know in their head, they are imagining that someone will get too drunk and get in trouble with the hotel, but even when we are on-site the entire time for our “away” programs, there is usually nothing that I can do, and I don't feel comfortable policing the drinking activities of adults anyway. Any advice?
Yeah, it is indeed very much a thing in some offices that people without kids are held to different expectations than people with kids. In those offices, not having kids means people think that you're always available to stay late, work weekends, or cover for co-workers' emergencies, and that, unlike parents, you don't have “good enough” reasons for asking for flexibility. That's obviously not reasonable or fair; not having kids doesn't mean being magically free of responsibilities or a life outside of work, and you're as entitled to your off-work time as anyone else is.
Not only do non-parents in some offices end up being denied the flexibility that parents get, there's something even more frustrating going on too: In the process of trying to be family-friendly to one group of people, these employers end up being family-unfriendly to a different group. Plenty of people without kids have other family responsibilities, like significant others, aging parents, and even “chosen families” of friends … as well as other ways they'd like to spend their personal time (whether it's hitting the gym or lounging on the couch with a book), which they have as much claim to as anyone else.
Your situation is a perfect example of this. It's great that your company is willing to give Jane a flexible schedule. But instead of taking on those costs themselves (e.g., hiring additional staff, bringing in a temp, paying you more for your time, or anything else that isn't just “push it all onto existing staff members”), they're asking you to be the one who sacrifices so that they can be family-friendly to someone else. Being truly family-friendly would mean that your company supports Jane's schedule — but instead they're just shifting the burden over to you.
And that's on them, not on Jane. If your director has approved an abbreviated work schedule for Jane, possibly for reduced pay, then Jane is acting exactly as they and your employer agreed that they would act – and the issue is that no one is addressing what that means for you or making the workload adjustments that the situation necessitates. Instead, everyone involved seems to be assuming that you'll just happily step in without anyone ever having a direct conversation with you to discuss how this is shifting the expectations for your role and whether that's feasible for you.
So, what can you do about it? Since no one has bothered to talk to you about what Jane's flexibility will mean for you, you're going to have to initiate that conversation yourself. I'd start with your director, and say something like this: “I'm finding that Jane's schedule means that 100 percent of the coverage for their events is falling to me. For example, for next week's event, originally we had planned to switch on and off so we each had time away, but it's ended up that I'll be responsible for 24/7 coverage that week and she'll only be there one or two days. I'm happy to help out in a pinch, but it's not sustainable for me to continue filling in for them as often as I've needed to recently. If she's not expected to return to full availability soon, can we explore other ways of getting additional coverage?”
Note that the language here isn't passing judgment on whether or not your director should be approving all this flexibility for Jane; that's their call to make. Instead, you're keeping the focus on your part of this, which is that you're not able to cover for them all the time.
It also might help to get really specific about what you can and can't do. For example, you might explain that you can cover Monday through Wednesday at the event but have evening commitments on Thursday and Friday and can't supply coverage then. Who knows? You might discover that you can lay out your own boundaries just like Jane does.
Whether to explicitly name the parents-vs.-non-parents issue is trickier because you're new and presumably don't have a ton of political capital built up yet. If you'd been there longer and had a good track record with your boss, I'd suggest saying something like, “I think it's great that we're being so family-friendly for a new parent. But the burden of making that possible is falling heavily on me. Is there something that we can do so that I'm not the one shouldering the weight of helping Jane get a flexible schedule?” But that's tough to pull off as a new person so, for now at least, I'd leave the seeming preferential treatment for parents out of it and just address it as a work-allocation issue.
Now, from here, a few different things could happen: Your boss could take this as a wake-up call that the current system isn't working and find some other way of allocating work. Or they could tell you that this is part of your job now, even if things were different before Jane's situation changed, in which case you'd need to decide if you're up for the job as it's currently configured. Or there might be some middle ground – like she'll tell you to just get through the next few months and things should change after that.
But by having this conversation, you'll get the issue on the table and make it known that this is a problem for you – and that's the first step. Your director and Jane have probably been assuming that you're just fine with this because you haven't said otherwise. So speak up, explain the impact on you, and see what you can negotiate from there.
That said, there's one potentially huge caveat here that you need to investigate before you do any of this: In your particular case, it's possible that providing this kind of coverage is actually the nature of your job regardless of Jane's flexible schedule. It's pretty typical for an event coordinator to be expected to be on-site the whole time an event is going on – so that might not be about Jane at all. Since you've only been there four months and weren't there before Jane had their baby, is there any chance that this was always how your respective roles were intended to work? My hunch is that that's not the case, based on the details you provided … but it's worth finding that out for sure before you proceed.

Twenty-six cents almost cost Sergio Branco their life.
Twenty-six cents.
Most of us could scrape that up from under our couch cushions or on the floor of a car.
Sergio Branco has 26 cents, too. The question was whether or not they would be permitted to pay it.
Branco, a 33-year-old father of three, was a truck driver for Russell Reid, a Keasbey-based waste-management company.
"In their spare time, they would play with their children, liked having barbecues and people over for gatherings," their cousin Sandy Marujo said. "He is a big kid at heart."
In January, Branco wasn't himself. They didn't feel right.
"He complained about bone pains and being extremely fatigued," Marujo said. "He decided to go to the emergency room."
The Edison man underwent several tests, which indicated they had a very weak immune system. It could be leukemia, the doctors said.
A few days later, a bone marrow test confirmed the diagnosis: acute myeloid leukemia. The disease, left untreated, travels fast and can kill within months, or even weeks, of diagnosis.
Branco started a series of treatments including chemotherapy and transfusions, and they took three months off from work under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
Doctors soon said he'd need a bone marrow transplant to prolong their life. They found a 10-point match — the best possible match. The transplant and related care for the disease would cost more than $500,000.
Good thing the family had health insurance through Branco's job, they thought.
But when their three-month leave under FMLA ended, Russell Reid fired him, Branco's family said.
At least they'd be able to continue health insurance coverage through COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act. Under COBRA, a terminated employee can continue the same health insurance coverage they had while employed, but the terminated employee is responsible for paying the full premium.
The bone marrow transplant was set for Aug. 16, and Branco's wife, Mara, took care of securing COBRA coverage.
The law is very specific about how COBRA must be handled.
Employers must notify plan administrators of a qualifying event — such as termination of employment — within 30 days, according to the Department of Labor. Plan participants and beneficiaries must be sent a notice saying they can continue benefits no later than 14 days after the plan administrator receives word that a qualifying event has occurred. The individual then has 60 days to decide whether or not to take COBRA, and another 45 days after that to pay the initial premium.
Branco was fired on April 30, so they had until June 30 to decide whether or not they wanted COBRA. After that, the payments would be due.
The Brancos received a notification letter, dated May 1, which said so.
"You have 60 days to elect coverage following the ‘Loss of Coverage Date' or the ‘Notification Date,' whichever is greater," and, "Your first premium payment will be due no later than 45 days after the date of your election to the Health Benefits Continuation Plan."
It also said premiums must be paid up to and including the current month in order to keep coverage current. That would mean payments were not due until July.
The letter listed premium amounts for family coverage, but the Brancos only wanted coverage for Sergio. So Mara Branco called Paychex, the third-party benefits administrator that was handling COBRA on Russell Reid's behalf, to ask about the premium for just Sergio.
The cost would be $518.26 per month.
So on or about May 24, Mara Branco filled out the paperwork and mailed a check to Paychex for the first month of coverage.
They wrote the check, dated May 24, for an even $518, inadvertently missing the 26 cents.
Paychex cashed the check on June 11.
The family thought all was well, and Branco continued to receive treatment. But later in June, the hospital told Branco they didn't have insurance coverage.
Surprised and thinking there was an error, Mara Branco contacted Paychex.
That's when they were told for the first time that the payment was 26 cents short. Paychex didn't offer an option to bring the payment up-to-date, Mara Branco said.
"They're playing with my husband's life," they said.
Mara Branco noted they were still well before the payment deadline, but they said Paychex told them it was instructed by Russell Reid not to accept any more payments from the Brancos.
Mara Branco said they took that information to Rich Gross, Russell Reid's human resources rep.
"The whole time they said Paychex is giving me false information," Mara Branco said. "I told them if he'd just make a phone call everything would be alright. They said he'd see what they could do."
But apparently nothing was done. Paychex still said it couldn't accept payments.
Branco also contacted the Department of Labor.
"DOL called human resources three or four times and each time a higher boss called, and told them the mistakes they made," they said they were told. "Rich Gross told the DOL ‘I will see what I can do,' but the next day they e-mailed DOL and said they're still not putting (Sergio) on the insurance."
Through it all, there was never any written notification that the payment was short. The Brancos weren't told of the cancellation in writing until they received a letter dated July 2.
Some time later, Paychex returned the $518 payment.
GETTING NOWHERE
The Brancos didn't cash the $518 check, and additional contact got them nowhere.
Sergio Branco's doctor also pleaded for help on their behalf.
They advised the companies that Branco "will most certainly die in the very near future if they do not proceed to transplant; therefore I am writing to request that every effort be made to reinstate their health care insurance coverage."
That didn't help. Russell Reid and Paychex did nothing.
The Brancos turned to attorney Jeffrey Resnick of Sherman, Silverstein, Kohl, Rose & Podolsky in Moorestown. Resnick filed a motion on the couple's behalf in court last week.
"With these COBRA cases, the notice has to be exact according to the statue, and here there were some notice violations," Resnick said, adding that Paychex did cash the $518 premium check.
Resnick said the couple tried to make right on the payment. With two young children, a teenager and a very sick husband, Mara Branco made an innocent mistake by excluding the 26 cents from the payment, they said.
By law, Branco should have been notified of the delinquent 26 cents before coverage was terminated, and that didn't happen, Resnick said. They should have been given an option to pay.
Plus, the law also says coverage can't be terminated for "non-payment of a de minimis amount."
"There's no technicality for the employer on this. What they should have done was said, ‘Okay, you gave us $518. We're going to give you another however many days to pay the 26 cents,'" Resnick said. "He's not looking for a handout or a free ride. He's willing to pay the $518.26."
Without insurance, the $500,000 treatment "may as well cost $100 million," they said.
"They know he's literally in a life and death situation and for 26 cents, they're denying them the right to get the health insurance coverage they need," they said.
Several days before Resnick filed the court papers, we reached out to Russell Reid to talk about the case.
"There's nothing to comment on at this point," human resources rep Rich Gross said. "We're still trying to figure it out."
What's to figure?
The guy tried to pay. Their check was cashed. Reinstate their coverage — the coverage they paid for in good faith.
We asked Gross if they had told Paychex not to accept payments from the Brancos, but they refused to answer the question. We also asked about the calls from DOL.
"They've given us some feedback, but the feedback has been incorrect," they said without giving further clarification.
We also reached out to Paychex, which asked for time to review the situation. About 12 hours after we last spoke to Gross, Paychex had an encouraging answer.
"Paychex is working diligently with our client and other appropriate parties right now to reinstate Mr. Branco's coverage," spokesperson Laura Saxby Lynch said.
We asked for clarification. Did that mean Branco would be reinstated?
"We are very ardently working on the situation with all parties including the carrier, and the decision ultimately rests with the carrier," Saxby Lynch said.
More delays and more finger-pointing while a man's life is on the line. All over 26 cents.
CHANGE OF HEART
Then things changed late Friday.
"The Department of Labor said the company will reinstate them from May till now," a relieved Mara Branco said. "They said the company did it wrong. I am super happy. It's like a weight has lifted off my shoulder. It's better than winning the lottery."
Branco said Paychex told them they could mail payments for May, June and July and they would receive more paperwork about the August payment.
The family said it will not pursue the court case, and the transplant is still scheduled for Aug. 16.
They promise to keep us posted.

Calling on others to join the fight for equal pay for women are (clockwise, from centre front) Naomi Worrall, from the Community Housing Association; disability worker Jo Groves; Angela Pollard, from the Northern Rivers Community Legal Centre; and Maralyn Schofield, from the Tenants Advice and Advocacy Service. Jacklyn Wagner
LISMORE disability support worker Jo Groves earns just a few dollars above the minimum wage, yet their vital role saves the State a fortune by keeping vulnerable citizens out of expensive institutional care.
Them responsibilities include the dispensing of critical medications that would require two nurses to sign-off on in a hospital.
Ms Groves and 2000 of their colleagues on the Northern Rivers represent the forgotten sector of community service workers who hold together a system straining under the pressure of a cash-strapped State Government, a national mental health epidemic and an ever-widening gap between the rich and poor.
The sector's workforce comprises 87 per cent women, who represent the core of the Australian Services' Union.
ASU organisers are in Canberra today calling the Federal Government's bluff after it stalled on its fair pay promise last week, citing budgetary constraints.
The union is running the first test case on equal pay under the Fair Work Act, seeking increased pay for women in the social and community services sector, and has threatened to call a national strike on December 15, with another three majorunions indicating support.
Local community service workers and ASU delegates Maralyn Schofield and Naomi Worrall are sounding the war cry and calling for concerted local industrial action and support.
“As a sector we don't usually take strike action, but we haven't seen this sort of thing since the sixties and seventies and it is time we stood together for what is rightfully ours,” Ms Schofield said.
Northern Rivers Community Legal Centre manager Angela Pollard said the sector had lost countless salary increases since the mid-1990s. While angry at the situation, they acknowledged the Labor Party's role in at least getting the legislation on the table.
“Julia Gillard and Penny Wong have spent their entire lives working for social justice,” Ms Pollard said. “But now they're at the pointy end of government our job is to continue to apply the pressure so they can take the rest of their Cabinet colleagues with them.”
New research in marijuana cultivation has pointed to a link between the absence of the cannabidol compound (CBD) in certain strains of skunk weed and the development of psychosis. The elimination of CBD through selective breeding increases the THC content, which may play a key role in the development of psychosis. Studies on the role of these two compounds have shown that "pure synthetic THC causes transient psychosis in 40 to 50 percent of healthy people. In stark contrast to THC, CBD appears to have an anti-psychotic effect."
A study by the Institute of Psychiatry in London, which was published by Neuropsychopharmacology, researchers used "functional MRI brain scanning to study the effects of THC and CBD on the brains of healthy volunteers. They found that THC and CBD acted in opposition; in brain regions where THC increased neural activity from baseline, CBD decreased." Further studies showed that the inverse was also true–an increase in CBD meant a decrease in THC.
An additional study compared the effects of a mix of synthetic THC and CBD with THC on its own. The molecules were given intravenously, and the subjects were given the same dose of THC, the only difference being those that received the CBD balancer. After thirty minutes, the subjects were interviewed, and researchers found that those given both the THC and CBD formula were significantly less psychotic than those given THC alone.
These studies raise important questions about the potential for marijuana strain refinement, but also as to whether or not CBD's can be made into a useful antipsychotic on their own. The Beckley Foundation is setting up a research project that "will analyze different strains of cannabis for their THC and CBD content," in hopes of spreading more awareness about safe marijuana strains. The Foundation sees this issue as another example for the need to regulate the recreational cannabis market in order to prevent possible harmful effects caused by the skunk strain–the dominance of which is a result of the illegal drug markets' tendency towards higher potencies.

Snow is expected to fall this week as medical experts warn the flu outbreak will worsen and hit its peak over the next two to three weeks.
Met Éireann forecasters predict snow may fall from mid-week as temperatures are set to drop dramatically.
It was a wet start to the week on Monday with a mix of sunny spells and scattered showers expected through the day.
Tuesday will be cloudy and mostly dry with temperatures of 10-12 degrees.
The change in weather is expected from Wednesday as wintry showers of possible snow, hail and sleet are forecast during the night. Temperatures are set to fall to minus 1 degrees.
Forecasters said the very cold conditions are expected to continue until Saturday as as winds will draw cold air down from the Arctic.
On Thursday, Connacht and Ulster will be worst hit by the showers as they become more frequent. Snow, hail and sleet are expected to fall across the country.
Temperatures will range from 1-4 degrees during the day and widespread frost and ice is expected during the night.
The arrival of “bitterly cold” weather could impact the flu outbreak, the assistant national director of public health and children's health with the Health Service Executive (HSE) Dr Kevin Kelleher said.
Dr Kelleher said people returning to work and children going back to school could also make a difference.
“It (the flu) will hit its peak in the next two or three weeks and then it will decline,” they said.
“If it gets very cold we move inside a lot and that means we stay inside. So, you're more in company with other people as a consequence and more likely to pass on these things.
“Actually being outside, really outside, lessens the opportunity to pass on these things. Being in a room, in an enclosed space, increases the chance of passing on these problems.”
Dr Kelleher told RTÉ's Morning Ireland most people with the flu could look after themselves and did not need to go to emergency departments.
They said information and advice to help people fight the flu and other winter bugs was available on www.undertheweather.ie.
The advice from the HSE comes as hospitals battle overcrowding and the numbers of people on trolleys in emergency departments surged over recent days, hitting a record 612 at one stage last week.
Seven people have died as a result of the flu this winter season, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.
Dr Kelleher said they did not agree there was any need to delay the opening of schools during a normal season of flu.

Reading the newspaper lately has felt like being trapped in an infernal Sydney dinner party: "There's never been a better time to sell!" "Do you think that it's better to buy in the east or inner-west?" "Did you hear about the property lawyer who bought their unborn grandchildren their own gated community?"
It's the conversational equivalent of grating your face against a concrete wall.
Of course this is nothing new. We've been a nation of renovating, investing, buying and selling philistines for the better part of the past 20 years.
When prosperity hit in the mid-90s we elected a prime minister who channelled our wealth away from schools, public infrastructure, universities and hospitals and into the bricks and mortar of our suburban fortresses. And we never looked back.

Now, in the midst of yet another hysterical burst of investment greed, we've started to count the costs: an entire generation locked out of the property market, first-home buyers pushed out of the inner city by baby-boomer investors, and carnivorous foreign investors consuming our land.
But all these stories presume that it's natural and inevitable for every Australian to want to buy property; that investing is hard-wired into our DNA, and that we will always dream of owning our own home rather than, say, dreaming of an equal society.
We presume that the problem is not that our imaginations don't extend beyond a suburban home, but simply that those homes are getting too expensive.
Call me treasonous, but to me the great Australian dream has always seemed like more of a nightmare: mortgaged up to your eyeballs in a house you never get to enjoy because you're too busy working to pay off the mortgage; living in the paranoid isolation of a cyclone-fenced suburb with only the blinking idiocy of a plasma TV for company; and lazy Sundays smelling of barbecues and debt.
When I picture the Australian dream I imagine something akin to the second circle of Dante's Inferno – the one where the sinners lie drowning in their own excrement.
What makes these infernal visions even worse is that heretics like myself simply have no option but to join the sinners in their excrement. The dream of home ownership is not an autonomous desire so much as a death sentence because we have no viable alternatives.
Rather than proposing solutions such as more land release, I would suggest five lessons about property to learn from our more civilised European compatriots.
1. Renting needs to be a secure option for individuals and families. In Australia if your landlord decides to sell they can kick you out with one month's notice. If you fall behind on your rent they are legally obliged to give you two weeks' notice.
Contrast this to France where no-one can be evicted during the winter months. Or to Germany and Italy where rental contracts can be for four years or even for an ‘indeterminate' period – meaning that you can sign a contract that gives you the right to rent for life.
2. The price of rent needs to be capped. In the three years that my friend Paul has lived in Potts Point in Sydney their rent has risen from $250/week for a studio apartment to $350; an increase of 50%. In many European countries this would be illegal. Under new laws in France, no new rental contract in the inner suburbs of Paris is permitted to charge more than 20 percent per square meter above the neighbourhood's median rent, which will be assessed annually by a "local rent observatory."
In Holland there is a similar rental review agency that you can appeal to if you think your rent is too much. They will assess your rent based on the median rent in the area and the quality of your house. If it's too much then the landlord is forced to lower the rent and to reimburse you the excess money.
3. Communities are made of houses, not investments. There is a word circulating, miasma-like, in Sydney of late: flipping. It holds a certain sinister whimsy and means to buy a run-down property, renovate it, then sell it – or, as wankers say, flip it! These are precisely the same wankers who are likely to spend their holidays sauntering through Parisian streets murmuring their appreciation of the quirky little stores that give the city its charm.
In my quartier (the fifth arrondisement) we had a bookstore that only sold ancient mathematics text books, an umbrella repairer and a music-box maker. I lived next door to a man who put gold embossing on books. Real estate in the fifth is expensive and these places are only able to survive because owners realise that sometimes it's good to hang on to a place; that you don't always need to sell and make money. Keep your bookstore for the sake of the community and beautify the property you have for you and your children.
4. We need to stop talking about property. While living in France, I encountered a wonderful phenomenon attributable to their socialist past: the belief that talking about property is vulgar and boring.
In fact, mentioning that you're about to buy property in Paris is conversationally disastrous, as bad as telling people how much you earn. This has the effect of liberating dinner parties so that people can discuss ideas, art and politics. Not just greed packaged in a brick-veneer home.
5. Housing is a basic human need. Civilisation has arrived at a very dark point when people in the richest country in the world cannot afford to put a roof over their heads. We constantly complain that our rent is too high or that the property is over-valued and yet we do nothing about it. Boycotting rent would be lovely but wildly ineffectual and personally perilous.
We need collective pressure placed on our government to behave like most other governments in Europe: restrain greed, protect low-income families from housing insecurity and in so doing, liberate us from the conversational tyranny of the housing market.

The House of Representatives narrowly passed legislation Thursday to repeal and replace Obamacare, without a clear picture of its financial cost and impact on coverage. A new analysis estimates that there's not nearly enough money appropriated in the bill to help people with preexisting conditions pay for their care.
According to research from Avalere Health, just 5% of Americans with preexisting conditions who currently have individual coverage will benefit from funds written into the American Health Care Act, which Republicans passed by a vote of 217-213.
“The bill does not assure a predictable and structured mechanism through which people with preexisting conditions are guaranteed coverage,” said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere, a consulting and research firm that has followed the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and more recent efforts to repeal and replace the law.
The $23 billion “specifically allocated” in the AHCA to help individuals with preexisting conditions will cover only 110,000 individuals. In California alone, there are 301,000 people with preexisting conditions in the individual insurance market, Avalere said.
The GOP House leadership pushed for a vote on the bill before it could be assessed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO had estimated that a previous version of the AHCA would have increased the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million over the following 10 years.
“Given the amount of funding in the bill, the program can only afford a few small states to opt into medical underwriting,” said Avalere's Caroline Pearson, senior vice president. “If any large states receive a waiver, many chronically ill individuals could be left without access to insurance.”
And the funding may not even be able to assist the 110,000 individuals Avalere cites given that large insurance companies like Aetna , Humana and UnitedHealth Group have said they are scaling back participation in not only individual coverage on the ACA's public exchanges, but the “off-exchange” business as well.
There are 2.2 million people who buy individual coverage today with preexisting conditions, and many of them bought coverage under the ACA. Under AHCA, which narrowly passed the GOP House, states would be able to apply for a waiver that would allow health plans to charge sick patient if they don't have “continuous coverage.” Insurers could do this as the states create some kind of financial assistance program for these Americans who are high-risk individuals.
Opposition is already emerging to the legislation passed by the House, specifically related to the lack of protections for those with preexisting conditions.
“Some in the Senate will be concerned that the funding for the state high-risk pools–which are intended to address this issue–are likely to be inadequately funded by the law,” Mendelson said.
High-risk pools are an old idea and were operated by nearly three dozen states before the ACA was enacted. “Our experience with high-risk pools finds them often underfunded and unable to stabilize insurance markets," said Dr. Bruce Siegel, CEO of America's Essential Hospitals, which represents public hospitals and health systems.
The latest amendment adding money for risk pools also doesn't change the broader impact of the AHCA, which would cause 24 million Americans to join the ranks of the uninsured by 2026, including 14 million by next year, and most of them are covered by Medicaid for poor Americans, the Congressional Budget Office reported two months ago.
As it heads to the Senate, lawmakers in that chamber are already worried about its impact on Americans, saying they expect CBO to weigh in before they take up the legislation.
The unemployment report on Friday was brutally bad. Unemployment rose in December, while job creation was minimal -- and its highly likely, for technical reasons, that the job number will be revised down, showing an actual decline in employment.
AFP So much for "containment."
Its the latest piece of bad news about an economy in which the employment situation has actually been deteriorating for the past year. Its no longer possible to hope that the effects of the housing slump will remain contained, as one of 2007s buzzwords had it. The levees have been breached, and the repercussions of the housing crisis are spreading across the economy as a whole.
Its not certain, even now, that well have a formal recession, although given the news on Friday you have to say that the odds are that we will. But what is clear is that 2008 will be a troubled year for the US economy -- and that as a result, the overall economic record of the Bush years will have been dreary at best: two and a half years of slumping employment, three and a half years of good but not great growth, and two more years of renewed economic distress.
The November election will take place against that background of economic distress, which ought to be good news for candidates running on a platform of change.
But the opponents of change, those who want to keep the Bush legacy intact, are not without resources. In fact, theyve already made their standard pivot when things turn bad -- the pivot from hype to fear. And in case you havent noticed, theyre very, very good at the fear thing.
You see, for 30 years American politics has been dominated by a political movement practicing Robin-Hood-in-reverse, giving unto those that hath while taking from those who dont. And one secret of that long domination has been a remarkable flexibility in economic debate. The policies never change -- but the arguments for these policies turn on a dime.
When the economy is doing reasonably well, the debate is dominated by hype -- by the claim that Americas prosperity is truly wondrous, and that conservative economic policies deserve all the credit.
But when things turn down, there is a seamless transition from Its morning in America! Hurray for tax cuts! to The economy is slumping! Raising taxes would be a disaster!
Thus, until just the other day Bush administration officials were in denial about the economys problems. They were still insisting that the economy was strong, and touting the Bush boom -- the improvement in the job situation that took place between the summer of 2003 and the end of 2006 -- as proof of the efficacy of tax cuts.
But now, without ever acknowledging that maybe things werent that great after all, President Bush is warning that given the economys problems, the the worst thing the Congress could do is raise taxes on the American people and on American businesses.
And even more dire warnings are coming from some of the Republican presidential candidates. For example, John McCains campaign Web site cautions darkly that Entrepreneurs should not be taxed into submission. John McCain will make the Bush income and investment tax cuts permanent, keeping income tax rates at their current level and fighting the Democrats plans for a crippling tax increase in 2011.
What crippling tax increase, which would tax entrepreneurs into submission, is Mr. McCain talking about? The answer is, proposals by Democrats to let the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year expire, returning upper-income tax rates to the levels that prevailed in the Clinton years.
And we all remember how little entrepreneurship there was, how weakly the economy performed, during the Clinton years, right? Oh, wait. (Ive put some charts comparing job performance during the Clinton and Bush years on my Times blog, krugman.blogs.nytimes.com. Its pretty startling how comparatively weak the Bush era looks.)
Never mind. The whole point of scare tactics is that they can work even in the face of inconvenient facts.
And what Im not sure about is whether the Democrats are ready for the fight theyre about to face.
Not to put too fine a point on it, Barack Obama won their impressive victory in Iowa with a sunny, upbeat message of change.
But theres a powerful political faction in this country that understands very well that any real change will create losers as well as winners. In particular, any serious progressive reform of health care, let alone a broader attempt to reduce middle-class insecurity and inequality, will have to mean higher taxes on the affluent. And members of that faction will do whatever it takes to scare people into believing that change means disaster for the economy.
I dont think theyll succeed. But it would be a big mistake to assume that they wont.
Q. You have been totally involved in a bubble of racing your whole life, and I guess Formula One is even more restrictive than other series. Do you ever get tempted to get out and see where you fit in elsewhere in the world?
A. Yes, but I do. I just get out and do as much as I can in my private life. I've got a girlfriend [the pop singer Nicole Scherzinger] that's got a completely different life. So I separate myself from my life and get in theirs with them and get to experience something really cool. So that's a new world I get to be involved in. I'm still learning how to maximize what I have and what I've experienced, and the opportunities that I have, because there are so many. So I plan on in the future doing more.

I've begun to realize I am quite a creative person this last year, I very like designing things. So there are lots of hobbies that I'm starting to pick up that I didn't even really know I had. So I've started getting involved in those. Because there's a lot of downtime, so rather than just reading a book it would be cool to be doing something else. I play the guitar. I am pretty musical, but I just like listening to music mostly. But the girlfriend's got the voice.
Q. Do you feel you have grown as a person since you have been in Formula One?
A. I would hope so. I've grown in a lot of ways. I'm nearly 28 now, so I think making less mistakes… but still making mistakes — stupid mistakes sometimes. But, looking back, of course sometimes you say, “I wouldn't do it.” But I love making those mistakes sometimes because if you didn't, it would just be so boring, so it is sometimes good to do those things. But I am growing and learning more and trying to avoid the ones that are damaging to me.

Q. What do you see as your biggest challenge at Mercedes next year?
A. The biggest challenge is getting up to speed, and helping to take a car that is not winning and to make it win. That's going to be the biggest challenge because there is only a certain amount the driver can do. You need the special, intelligent people around you to help do the job as well, so communication is going to be the key, I think.
Q. You are replacing Michael Schumacher at Mercedes. They came to symbolize Ferrari in their previous time in Formula One. Is it possible for a driver to push a team forward, push it to the top, just by being a strong personality?
A. I don't know what it has to do with personality. It has to do with drive, it has to do with determination.
Q. You recently started using more social media, such as Twitter. What prompted that?
A. I just get a spur every now and then to reach out. I get so many messages. I still can't believe today that, coming from Stevenage [Hamilton's hometown], I've got one million followers. Those followers send messages from all over the world, wherever they are, and I can write one message and say, “Hey, how are you doing?” That's asking one million people how they are doing. I just can't come to terms with it. And I am so appreciative of it, and I want to make sure they know how much I appreciate their support.
You come here or wherever you go and you see the banners. There is only a certain amount you can do to show your appreciation. I've got one particular fan, they follow me everywhere — she's Japanese. And they have three or four flags in front of my garage, and if you go to the chicane they have the biggest flags and banners — there must be like five. And she's just amazing. And I have that in lots of places.

For me, for someone to go through that effort, whether it be gifts, whether it be just a message, whether it be the flags or just the support… Without them, without the fans, we wouldn't be here. And that's the only way I can be close to them.
Being President on 24 was about as stable as being a drummer for Spinal Tap. Okay, maybe not ALL the Presidents died. In fact, most of them survived. But it wasn't exactly a job that lent itself to longevity. There were nine Presidents in total through 8 seasons of the show, and surprisingly not one of them was named Jack Bauer. Oh well, maybe in the movie. In honor of Presidents' Day, here's a complete list of the Presidents of 24 and what happened to each of them.
1. Unknown, President Harold Barnes? (Season 1)
Here's what we know about Season 1‘s President. It wasn't David Palmer who was still a Senator. So that eliminates one in about 150 million possible candidates. It could very well have been another person on this list, but it was never mentioned. Most likely it was a different person. If you follow the novels, the name Harold Barnes is mentioned as President prior to Season 1, so most likely it was him. He's described as temperamental, blowing off steam in private so that they could keep calm in public.
2. P­re­side­n­t­ David P­alme­r (Seasons 2-3)
We first meet D­avid­ Palm­er (Dennis Haysbert) in Season 1 during the California Presidential primary.  They are the front runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination and at the time was a United States Senator from Maryland. Season One involves J­ack B­auer stopping an assassination attempt on Palmer, and at the beginning of Season 2 we see that they are now the President. As Commander in Chief, Palmer is seen as a good leader who makes difficult decisions without much hesitation. At th­e end­ o­f s­eco­nd­ s­eas­o­n, Palm­er is the victim­ o­f biological attack, but is again executing their duties by the start of Season 3. However, political scandal surrounds them and they ultimately decide not to run for re-election, again preferring their principles over everything else.
Their fate: Palmer w­as­ s­h­o­t d­ead­ b­y­ terro­ris­ts­ at th­e b­eginning o­f Season 5.
3. Pre­si­de­n­t James Prescott (Season 2)
Prescott (Alan Dale), is the Vice-President of the United States for David Palmer in Seasons 2 and 3. During Season 2, Prescott led an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment, believing that Palmer's decisions were irrational based on their sudden reluctance to attack three middle eastern countries believed to be behind a failed nuclear strike on the United States. They used this argument as evidence of their incapability to hold the office. Prescott gathers the Cabinet members, and by one vote, David Palmer is removed from office under the provisions of the 25th Amendment. After assuming the presidency, Prescott orders Palmer confined, and orders a military response based on what later was determined to be fabricated evidence. After the forgery is discovered, Palmer assumes the presidency again.
Their fate: Shamed by their actions, Prescott offers their resignation after their coup d'état, which Palmer rejects. The character is briefly seen in Season 3, participating in a teleconference with the President. Fans of the 24: The Game will also know that Prescott appears as acting President in the video game, while Palmer recovers from injuries incurred at the end of Season 2. As far as we know physically, they are fine today.
4. Pre­si­de­n­t John­ Ke­e­l­e­r (Season 4)
Senator John Keeler (Geoff Pierson) stood against incumbent President David Palmer during Palmer's bid for a second term in office in Season 3. With the help of Palmer's wife Sherry, Keeler uncovered disgracing evidence which they tried to use to blackmail Palmer. Palmer stood their ground, but they ultimately withdrew from the race after the death of their wife. Palmer's absence virtually guaranteed Keeler a win in the general election.
At the beginning of Season 4 we see Keeler is the new President. At least until they were injured when a stealth fighter attacked Air Force One. The plane crashed, killing many passengers. Although Keeler themselves survived, they were revealed to be in critical condition. During President Keeler's incapacitation, the cabinet unanimously voted to invoke the 25th Amendment and appoint Vice President Charles Logan as acting-President. When last mentioned, President Keeler was still in critical condition and their fate was not resolved when the Season ended.
Their fate: Unknown, but Charles Logan would remain in office, meaning Keeler either died from their injuries or was unable or unwilling to resume their duties as President.
5. Pr­es­i­d­ent Cha­r­les­ Lo­­ga­n (Seasons 4 and 5)
As mentioned above, V­i­c­e Pr­es­i­d­en­­t C­har­l­es­ L­ogan­­ (Gregory Itzin) bec­ame the Pr­es­i­d­en­­t after­ John­­ Keel­er­ fell­ i­nto a­­ c­oma. Logan is not portrayed kindly as they are seemingly incapable of making hard decisions quickly or for himself, relying on the recommendations of their advisors. Additionally, their resolve is weak, as they rarely stand behind a decision they have already made. If that's not bad enough, Logan committed treason, and when it was exposed that they were involved in most of Season 5‘s horrific acts, including President David Palmer's assassination and the selling of Sentox VX nerve gas to terrorists, they were removed from office.
Their fate: Removed from office on charges of obstruction of justice, they were placed under house arrest and confined to Hidden Valley Presidential Retreat. In Season 6 they were stabbed by their unstable ex-wife Martha in a fit of anger and began to flatline on the way to the hospital. They survived and returned in Season 8, but committed suicide after their involvement in a massive conspiracy was revealed.
6. President Hal Gardner (Season 5)
After Charles Logan was arrested for their actions, Vice President Hal Gardner (Ray Wise) was sworn in as the new President. We are clued in to these actions at the end of Season 5. As a politician, Gardner regularly advised Logan, taking credit for the good ideas and letting Logan handle the bad ones. This led to distrust from Logan's inner circle, which believed Gardner was trying to hijack the Presidency. In a round about way, I guess they succeeded. They stayed in office for the rest of Logan's term, and it is unknown if they ran for re-election.
Their fate: Unknown. Little has been said of Gardner's Presidency.
7. Pres­i­d­ent Way­ne Palmer (Season 6)
W­ay­ne P­almer (Gary Payton, no wait D.B. Woodside) is a character we first met in Season 3 and is the bro­­t­her o­­f D­avi­d­ P­almer. They served as David's chief of staff following Mike Novick's dismissal in Season 2 and by Season 6 they had been elected President of the United States. Like several 24 Presidents, they were the victim of an attack and suffered significant brain damage as a result of the attempted assassination. In order to prevent Vice President Noah Daniels from taking premature action against the Middle East, the President's doctors brought Palmer back to consciousness so that they could resume their duties. However, they only served a few more hours before suffering a hemorrhage and falling back into a coma, which they had not woken from by the end of Season 6.
Their fate: Unknown, but like President Keeler they did not retake office, meaning they either died from their injuries or was unable or unwilling to resume their duties as President.
8. P­resi­d­ent­ No­ah D­ani­els (Season 6 and Redemption)
Noah Daniels (Powers Boothe) was the Vice President of the United States under Wayne Palmer. They became the Acting President of the United States under the provisions of the 25th Amendment due to President Palmer's incapacitation from after-effects of an attempt on their life. They completed Palmer's term, but in Redemption we learn they lost their bid for re-election to Senator Allison Taylor.
Their fate: Alive and doing okay, other than losing their re-election bid.
9. Pr­esi­dent­ A­lli­so­n T­a­y­lo­r­ (Redemption and Seasons 7-8)
T­h­e f­irst­ M­­a­da­m­­ President­, Senator A­l­l­ison T­a­y­l­or (Cherry Jones) was sworn in as President­ in Redemption after defeating the incumbent, Daniels, in the general election. In Redemption we are treated to some uncomfortable scenes between the two.In their inauguration speech they indicated a firm resolve and a national posture that was different from Daniels'.
Them fate: Resigned somewhat in disgrace after being manipulated by Charles Logan into covering up a series of international incidents. However, they did admit to their role and in the end prevented Jack from being executed, which was nice of them
So there's your round up. Two dead Presidents, two others at least critically wounded, one privately shamed, two Vice Presidents that faded away, one unknown, and one forced to resign. Not exactly a great selection of who'd you want to be running the country.
Labor for Bernie Kickstarts Effort to Get Unions Behind Sanders With Nearly 2,000 Union Backers

Labor for Bernie, a new nationwide network for union members, announced today the launch of their grassroots movement to push the AFL-CIO and other unaffiliated major labor organizations such as SEIU and the Teamsters toward endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.
Almost 2,000 union members have signed onto a letter outlining the network's goals . Labor for Bernie reports that more than a third of these Sanders supporters belong to building trades unions, with 137 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers signees alone. Other unions that showed significant representation in the letter include the Communications Workers of America, American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, Service Employees International Union, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Auto Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
"Labor for Bernie 2016 won't be a corporate-style, staff-driven, top-down campaign. It will reflect our commitment to creating fundamental change and the urgency of stronger grassroots organizing and political activity,” the letter reads. “We call on labor leaders, union members and working people to unite behind Bernie Sanders for a voice in the presidential political process and to elect the President working families need—a President who will answer to the 99 percent!”
The network's website includes sample resolutions for rank and file activists hoping to push their locals and state-level federations of labor into endorsing Sanders. Thus far, AFL-CIO state-level federations from Vermont and South Carolina have chosen to do so.
"Bernie is running on a record of real accomplishment for workers, farmers, veterans, and millions of other blue-collar Americans," said Erin McKee, President of the South Carolina AFL-CIO, on the network's website .
"But here's the real difference between them and all the rest: He's the candidate who truly believes in the power of grassroots organizing. Bernie has been to South Carolina over the past few years and some of our members got the chance to see that first hand when they met not only with labor unions but with the fast food workers fighting for $15 an hour and a union."
In late March, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered a speech mentioning that an endorsement from the national organization is still up for grabs.
“It is early, and although many candidates are already in the race, the field remains open,” they said then. “And the labor movement's doors are open to any candidate who is serious about transforming our economy with high and rising wages.”
Front-runner Hillary Clinton's recent silence on the labor-opposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement led Trumka to say a few weeks later , in late May, that it was “conceivable” that the nationwide AFL-CIO would not endorse a candidate for president, instead focusing on the legislative races in 2016 if a candidate didn't commit to a platform that they would want to fight for.
Since 1989, 19 of Sanders' top 20 donors are members of unions from across the county, whereas Clinton's top 20 is heavily populated by titans of finance. Labor for Bernie will be a new institutional campaign presence amid this fiscal backdrop.
Clinton's name recognition (unprecedented among presidential candidates since at least Richard Nixon in 1968, according to the New York Times) and big money support will make Sanders' run an uphill climb. But, as of late, Sanders is edging closer and close to Clinton in the polls. He's packing the house in venues across the country (5,500 attended Sanders' speech in Denver on June 20) and is even getting love from comedians like Sarah Silverman and Lewis Black.
Two men have faced court in Brisbane for their role in a horrific carjacking in Brisbane on Wednesday morning, which saw a man beaten unconscious and a woman sexually assaulted.
Police alleged in court on Friday the pair were part of a group of five who were captured on CCTV approaching a car at about 3.45am on Wednesday.
Footage shows the men beating the driver of the vehicle, a 26-year-old man, and officers allege they were kicked unconscious.
The female front passenger, 27, was sexually assaulted, and brought back to the car when they tried to escape, The Courier Mail reported.

Two men faced court on Friday on 10 separate charges each, related to a violent robbery in Sunnybank, Brisbane (pictured is one of the men who was arrested and charged over the incident)
Police allege a group of five men approached a car about 3.45am on Wednesday morning, beat a man unconscious, and sexually assaulted a woman in the front seat
Deng Sebit Arou Kur, 22, and Montasr Hassan Angolo, 17, each faced 10 charges in Brisbane Magistrate's Court, including sexual assault in company and two counts of robbery in company with violence.
The pair were also charged with two counts of attempted robbery in company, assault bodily harm in company, common assault, unlawful entry of a vehicle, unlawful use of a vehicle and wilful damage.
CCTV released by Queensland Police shows the five men surround a vehicle, parked in the carpark of a shopping centre in Sunnybank, about 16 kilometres south of the Brisbane CBD.
Police allege two cars were parked there, but all four occupants entered one Mitsubishi Magna for safety as the men approached.
Two cars were seen at the shopping centre carpark, but the occupants of the car closest to the camera fled to the second car in search of safety as the group approached
The CCTV shows one of the two cars, a Honda Civic, being driven off in a hurry, and police also allege keys to the car were stolen and a single member of the group got behind the wheel and drove away in it.
Investigations are continuing, and police are still hunting for the remaining three members of the group.
Detectives are looking to speak with the drivers of two delivery trucks seen in the CCTV footage, who were passing by at the time of the attack, as well as anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has seen the stolen Honda Civic.
The group allegedly smashed a window of the furthest car, forced a door open, dragged a woman from the car and repeatedly punched and kicked a man
VAUGHAN, Ont. – The Harrisburg City Islanders took back-to-back victories for the second time this season as they defeated Toronto FC II 4-3 at the Ontario Soccer Centre on Saturday evening. Harrisburg (4-7-4, 16pts) missed a golden opportunity to take the lead in the eight minute when James Thomas shot wide after TFC II goalkeeper Mark Pais had been forced off their line to block an initial shot by Pedro Ribeiro, leaving the net open. Ribeiro gave the visitors the lead in the 23rd minute, however, as they curled home a free kick on the right side of the penalty area into the left corner of the net. Five minutes later TFC II (2-9-5, 11pts) leveled as Mitchell Taintor volleyed home a free kick by Luca Uccello, but Harrisburg regained the lead quickly as Ribeiro's low cross found Jake Bond for a close-range finish. Uccello hit back with 10 minutes to go in the half, adding to their earlier assist, as they put home a chance created by Aikim Andrews, but the City Islanders regained the lead again three minutes after the break as Brandon Aubrey turned home an own goal after Jake Bond's initial shot had been saved. Ten minutes later Paul Wilson added a fourth for the visitors as Ribeiro and Thomas combined to create a chance for Thomas that Pais saved, only for Wilson to put home the rebound. City Islanders midfielder Danny DiPrima almost found the net with 19 minutes to go, only for Pais to tip their effort over, and three minutes later TFC II pulled a goal back as Andrews fired home from the right side of the penalty area. TFC II was unable to capitalize on a late chance for Malik Johnson, however, as Harrisburg earned another valuable victory.
Scoring:
23' – HAR – Pedro Ribeiro
28' – TOR – Mitchell Taintor (Luca Uccello)
31' – HAR – Jake Bond (Pedro Ribeiro)
35' – TOR – Luca Uccello (Aikim Andrews)
48' – HAR – Own Goal (Brandon Aubrey)
58' – HAR – Paul Wilson
74' – TOR – Aikim Andrews (Ricardo John)
Three Things That Matter:
1. Having found the net for the first time this season last Saturday night in Harrisburg's surprise 1-0 win against Louisville City FC, the hope was it would spur Pedro Ribeiro to even greater heights. If their performance against TFC II is an indicator, Ribeiro is ready to take on that challenge. The Brazilian scored a good goal, but it was their play outside their second tally in as many games that really caught the eye as they helped set up two other goals for the City Islanders, including a powerful run that saw them turn the corner on their marker on the left and produce a pinpoint low cross to give Jake Bond a tap-in finish. Aaron Wheeler's absence has hindered Harrisburg's attack. Ribeiro could be in the right position now to rekindle it.
2. Coming off their heaviest defeat of the season last Saturday, Toronto FC II produced a far more resilient performance that saw Luca Uccello and Aikim Andrews both notch a goal and assist, and made things interesting all the way until the final whistle. Saturday was the first game this season TFC II has notched multiple goals, and all three were very nicely taken as the technical ability the club's young players possess was on display. The playoff positions are even further away than they were before the game, but there were far more positives to be taken than seven days ago.
3. Harrisburg posted back-to-back victories in the league since wins against the New York Red Bulls II and Bethlehem Steel FC in April earlier this year, and the City Islanders have started to claw their way back toward the Eastern Conference playoff positions. The road remains a difficult one for the City Islanders as they need to gain ground on a number of clubs ahead of them, but there is at least hope this side is capable of finding the net more consistently which will should keep it in the running.

FAISALABAD: Police have booked Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan Muslim League Awami chief Sheikh Rashid, PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Arif Alvi and Asad Umer on charges of terrorism for inciting people to attack the residence of Punjab's former law minister Rana Sanaullah here on Monday.
At least 500 PTI activists have also been named in the case registered by Saman­abad on a complaint of Mr Sanaullah.
Cases have also been registered by Factory Area and D-Type Colony police against another 500 PTI workers for obstructing the police force in performing their duty, hampering people's movement and causing injuries to people.

They have been booked under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and sections 148, 149, 186, 324, 341, 353 and 427 of the PPC.
In their complaint, Rana Sanaullah has accused the PTI of giving a call for a strike in Faisalabad to create anarchy and instability and halting the country's progress.
They claimed that before leaving Islamabad, Imran Khan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Sheikh Rashid and Asad Umer had said they would attack and besiege “my house upon reaching Faisalabad”. They had asked their supporters to attack their house, they said, adding that a similar directive had been issued by Arif Alvi at a press conference.

The former minister claimed that 400 to 500 people, led by Awais, Rasim Yaqoob, Yunus Jutt, Farrukh Habib, Mian Waris, Atiq, Shahabudin, Anwar Ramay, Aamir, Munawar Manj, Javed Niaz, Sheikh Shahid, Tufail, Younas Kamboh and Haji Riaz, had tried to attack their house but did not succeed because of the presence of PML-N workers and police there.
Talking to Dawn, they said police had made their statement part of the case and nominated the people they had mentioned in their application.
Meanwhile, the PTI has rejected the fact-finding committee constituted by the Punjab government and refused to join its proceedings.
The three-member committee comprising the provincial environment secretary, Toba Tek Singh DPO Dr Shehzad and Additional Commissioner Kazim Awan recorded the statements of Faisalabad DCO Noorul Ameen Mengal and police officers at the Commissioner Office.
Violent clashes between workers of the PTI and PML-N in different areas of Faisalabad on Monday left PTI activist Haq Nawaz dead and at least 17 people, including police officers, injured.
Farrukh Habib, central president of the Insaf Students Federation, said the fact-finding committee had summoned some PTI party leaders but they refused to attend its proceedings.
Meanwhile, PTI's Punjab President Ijaz Chaudhry demanded the arrest of Minister of State for Water and Power Abid Sher Ali, Rana Sanaullah and the DCO on charges of killing the PTI worker and letting armed people attack activists of their party.
Talking to reporters at Zila Council Chowk, where they and their supporters had joined a protest by polio workers, Ijaz Chaudhry accused PML-N activists of opening fire on what they called peaceful protesters and said that instead of taking action against the criminals, cases had been registered against leaders and workers of their party.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) [AFP]
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) will publish a response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's New York Times op-ed piece with a column of their own in a Russian newspaper, Reuters reported on Friday.
McCain's column will appear in the newspaper Pravda, an idea that reportedly began as an offhand joke they made during a CNN interview regarding Putin's Sept. 11 op-ed, which criticized their U.S. counterpart Barack Obama's address the day before.
“I would rather disagree with a case they made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is ‘what makes America different. It's what makes us exceptional,'” Putin wrote. “It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.”
Time magazine reported that after McCain jokingly said they would like to write a response, Foreign Policy magazine reporter John Hudson contacted Pravda to ask whether that would be a possibility. The newspaper's English editor, Dmitri Sudakov, was quoted as saying it would be “pleased to publish a story penned by such a prominent politician as John McCain.”
While no publication date has been set for McCain's column, spokesperson Brian Rogers indicated the issue of a possible U.S. military strike against Syria would be addressed.
“There are a lot of issues that I'm sure Sen. McCain would want to address,” Rogers told Time. “Democracy and human rights in Russia and certainly the Putin regime's aiding and abetting of the Syrian regime, which has killed 100,000 of its own people.”

It seems like just yesterday that the media was lamenting the death of physical games, as the world ushered itself into a digital only age - how wrong could they be?
From upstart companies like Limited Run Games - who you could now argue are now putting out too many physical releases - to the UK based Signature Edition all attempting to fill that void, alongside a growing independent publisher industry.
Now BadLand Games, one of those asupervisorstioned publishers has announced - over these past few weeks - a slew of releases for critically acclaimed titles in a physical format across multiple platforms. And, whilst in the past BadLand Games releases have been very Europe centric, stateside fans can rejoice as these releases will also be lining their local store shelves too.
First up and arriving on April 11th is The Sexy Brutale: Full House Edition for the PlayStation 4; a game developed by Spanish team Tequila Works - who are also hard at work on the upcoming Rime - in conjunction with Cavalier Games Studio, and it comes packed with a whole host of goodies including a Soundtrack CD and Studio Manual. But thats not all, gamers who pre-order the Full House Edition will receive either a 6-page comic prequel or full colour 50 page artbook depending on the retailer. You can currently purchase the title for £24.99 from Amazon UK or Play-Asia. As for the game itself, The Sexy Brutale is a murder-mystery, adventure title which all revolves around a single day, allowing you to replay events from differing perspectives and the inclusion of a time-loop mechanic to aid you in figuring out the puzzling series of events.
The next two games are yet to receive concrete release dates, but BadLand Games have confirmed they will both be releasing between April and June of this year. Gamers across the world have been clamouring for a physical release of Futurlabs Velocity games for quite a while now, and finally their prayers have been answered with Velocity 2X: Critical Mass Edition for PlayStation 4 and a standalone physical release of Velocity 2X (that also comes with a downloadable code for Velocity Ultra) on the PlayStation Vita. Velocity 2X: Critical Mass Edition comes included with 3 DLC packs (Daily Sprint, Critical Urgency & Dual Core) a soundtrack CD, studio booklet and behind the scenes, making of videos.
The final physical release announced thus far is the critically lauded Axiom Verge which successfully brought retro stylings and metroidvania back to the forefront when it released in 2015. Entirely created by one extremely talented man (Thomas Papp) this once digital only title will now be getting a fully featured physical release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Wii U - yep you read that right, the Wii U, with what I assume to be one of the final physical releases for the ailing platform. Fittingly named, the Axiom Verge Multiverse Edition comes with a making-of documentary DVD, a double-sided poster and a deluxe booklet that includes developer commentary and art. And whilst the Multiverse Edition is tentatively priced for £24.99 ($29.99), BadLand Games have announced that the PlayStation 4 platform will be receiving a standalone physical version which will be priced a little lower at £14.99 ($19.99).
And just to note for potential buyers, we have reached out to BadLand Games with the request to secure a copy of some of these titles prior to release, in order to fully showcase the quality of what readers will be purchasing and whether any final changes have been made from advertised.
(Part Two) Our investigation into the philosophical roots of social justice continues...
Dr. Stephen Hicks is a Professor of Philosophy at Rockford College and the Executive Director of The Center For Ethics and Entrepreneurship. They join me today to discuss the consequences of postmodernism as a political/education project.
Discussed:
- Words as weapons
- Do the postmodernists of the mid-20th century set out to undermine the enlightenment?
- The philosophical movement has a long philosophical lineage dating back to Rousseau and the German idealists, it comes to prominence in the 1960s
- What's confusing for the novice here - These people looked back the enlightenment, reason as a starting point instead of faith and superstition, how did they look at dividends that were paid, that they were the beneficiaries of, science, engineering, medicine, free markets, abolition, spreading material wealth, emergence of leisure time, near universal literacy and not say this is something we could improve upon?
But instead, this is something to be undone or attacked?
- Postmodern art
- Hypothesis: post-modernism is the crisis of faith for the academic left (it's how socialism moves forward)

ESO's VISTA telescope, at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, has captured a striking new image of the Helix Nebula. This picture, taken in infrared light, reveals strands of cold nebular gas that are invisible in images taken in visible light, as well as bringing to light a rich background of stars and galaxies.
The Helix Nebula is one of the closest and most remarkable examples of a planetary nebula*. It lies in the constellation of Aquarius (The Water Bearer), about 700 light-years away from Earth. This strange object formed when a star like the Sun was in the final stages of its life. Unable to hold onto its outer layers, the star slowly shed shells of gas that became the nebula. It is evolving to become a white dwarf star and appears as the tiny blue dot seen at the centre of the image.
The nebula itself is a complex object composed of dust, ionised material as well as molecular gas, arrayed in a beautiful and intricate flower-like pattern and glowing in the fierce glare of ultraviolet light from the central hot star.
The main ring of the Helix is about two light-years across, roughly half the distance between the Sun and the nearest star. However, material from the nebula spreads out from the star to at least four light-years. This is particularly clear in this infrared view since red molecular gas can be seen across much of the image.
While hard to see visually, the glow from the thinly spread gas is easily captured by VISTA's special detectors, which are very sensitive to infrared light. The 4.1-metre telescope is also able to detect an impressive array of background stars and galaxies.
The powerful vision of ESO's VISTA telescope also reveals fine structure in the nebula's rings. The infrared light picks out how the cooler, molecular gas is organised. The material clumps into filaments that radiate out from the centre and the whole view resembles a celestial firework display.
Even though they look tiny, these strands of molecular hydrogen, known as cometary knots, are about the size of our Solar System. The molecules in them are able to survive the high-energy radiation that emanates from the dying star precisely because they clump into these knots, which in turn are shielded by dust and molecular gas. It is currently unclear how the cometary knots may have originated.
Please note that this text was modified on 18 January 2012 to correct some minor errors.
*Planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets. This confusing name arose because many of them show small bright discs when observed visually and resemble the outer planets in the Solar System, such as Uranus and Neptune. The Helix Nebula, which also bears the catalogue number NGC 7293, is unusual as it appears very large, but also very faint, when viewed through a small telescope.
Following the Seattle Seahawks' 17-16 preseason win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday in Kansas City, Pete Carroll provided some clarity on where the team's running back situation stands.
Christine Michael rushed seven times for 44 yards (6.3 YPC) on the first two offensive drives. They have had a good camp, and the coaching staff seems to view Michael as a contributor.
"He's an NFL football player," Carroll told reporters. "He really has made it clear to us that he's serious about the work. He's serious about the consistency. He's taken great pride in the way he's brought it day in and day out all throughout the offseason and into camp and all of that. And he's an explosive, dynamic athlete. So we're just going to keep going with him."
Thomas Rawls (ankle) returned to practice last week but did not play in the game. Carroll has not yet decided whether Rawls will see any action in the preseason.
"When Thomas gets back out there, those two guys give you a little one-two punch that we're excited about," Carroll said. "And then we'll see. C.J. [Prosise] is going to come back this week. We'll see where they fit into it also. I thought Christine did really well. I really liked what they did."

The Seahawks drafted Prosise with the intention of having them be the third-down back, but Prosise has not practiced since injuring their hamstring on the first day of training camp. Fifth-round pick Alex Collins should also make the roster. They carried just three times for 5 yards Saturday, but one was a botched zone-read attempt where they didn't have a chance.
In 2014, when Marshawn Lynch was healthy, they accounted for 72 percent (280 carries) of the attempts by Seahawks running backs. In 2013, that number was 74.9 percent (301 carries).
But with the variables in play now, it's possible that the Seahawks don't give as heavy a workload to their lead back. Rawls was great last season, totaling 830 yards and averaging 5.65 YPC, but they have to prove he's the same guy physically as they come off offseason ankle surgery.
And Michael has to continue to prove to the coaches that he's had an awakening.
The Seahawks traded Michael to the Dallas Cowboys for a seventh-round pick last September, but they were released in November. Michael landed on the Washington Redskins' practice squad before returning to the Seahawks down the stretch. Plenty can change between now and the opener, but Michael appears to have put themselves in position to have a role in the backfield in 2016.

The election of a new American president is always an important event, because of the power the American president has to influence events and affect lives around the world.
This election is particularly important: the American economy is going through the most serious financial crisis since The Great Depression. And the international scene is littered with the debris of Bush's disregard for the rule of law, and their confrontational strategies.
Barack Obama has promised to undo the damage eight years of Bush policy has caused. The other contender, John McCain, if they unexpectedly surmount the odds and becomes president, will likely build on the Bush legacy, notwithstanding their recent disclaimer: “I am not President Bush.”
To be sure Obama has said they would use force to defend American interests, and would be ready to act outside the framework of the United Nations.
It may be that being the president of a superpower carries with it some obligation to brandish the use of force as an instrument of foreign policy, or else risk being disqualified from the race altogether.
Nevertheless, the possibility of an Obama administration choosing dialogue over confrontation, engagement over hostility, is real.
Therefore, the new president would be well-advised to send a message that their defence of American values is genuine and not a rhetorical device to justify oppressive foreign policy choices.

Denouncing the Bush doctrine would be a good start. The Bush doctrine of aggressively promoting American hegemony around the world contains two unsettling elements: The concept of pre-emptive war and the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons.
‘Axis of evil'
In January 2002, Bush told Congress that North Korea, Iraq and Iran represented “an axis of evil”. They also signalled America's readiness to launch pre-emptive strikes against such regimes.
The Nuclear Posture Review presented by the Pentagon to Congress on January 8, 2002, stated: “The Pentagon needs to be prepared to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria.”
The Review listed three specific scenarios for an American nuclear strike: “an Iraqi attack on Israel or its neighbours, a North Korean attack on South Korea, or a military confrontation [with China] over the status of Taiwan.”
The New York Times rightly observed: “If another country were planning to develop a new nuclear weapon and contemplating pre-emptive strikes against a list of non-nuclear powers, Washington would rightly label that nation a dangerous rogue state.”
America certainly needs to defend itself against threats and aggression, but the Bush doctrine is an open-ended commitment to the use of force regardless of its legality and a guarantee of a permanent state of conflict and tension.
Pre-emptive strikes and the use of nuclear weapons are not only violations of international law, they are also dangerous strategies for a world desperate for leadership that promotes peaceful resolution of disputes.
If the new president is committed to promoting American values, then surely they would want to re-establish the primacy of the rule of law over the disregard the Bush administration showed for it.
Illegal war
A good beginning would be to acknowledge the illegal nature of the Iraq war. Under the Nuremberg principle articulated by US Supreme Court Justice Robert L. Jackson: “Launching a war of aggression is a crime and… no political or economic situation can justify it.”
Moreover, the Bush administration set up a global prison system where detainees were subjected to abuse and torture. It used torture in Iraq and in Afghanistan and outsourced torture to other countries in its extraordinary rendition programme.
The editors of the New York Times lamented the kind of America Bush was creating: “A nation that tortures human beings and then concocts legal sophistries to confuse the world and avoid accountability before American voters?”
Obama has repeatedly stated that America is a better country than that. To their credit, the republican candidate John McCain also condemned the use of torture.

McDonald's proudly made an announcement about something it maybe shouldn't have been calling attention to in the first place: by mid-2018, a majority of its restaurants will make the Quarter Pounder with fresh beef.
Today we've announced that by mid-2018, all Quarter Pounder burgers at the majority of our restaurants will be cooked with fresh beef. pic.twitter.com/Bdf99ALlxw — McDonald's (@McDonalds) March 30, 2017
Cool! In like a, "congrats on the rest of your burgers continuing to be made with not-fresh meat in a majority of locations a full year from now" kind of way.
Yes, this is good news, but it's really just calling attention to some of the less-than-flattering facts about McDonald's meat.
Wendy's, which prides itself on its "fresh never frozen" policy, took note:
.@McDonalds So you'll still use frozen beef in MOST of your burgers in ALL of your restaurants? Asking for a friend. — Wendy's (@Wendys) March 30, 2017
They replied to McDonald's initial announcement by basically saying "yeah... and?"
In the fast food wars, there are going to be clear winners and losers in terms of beef freshness. At this moment in history, Wendy's has that winning slot on lock. If you're coming to the fight with anything less than all fresh beef... they're going to mock you. Sorry, I don't make the rules.
Wendy's didn't stop there. Lots of people replied to the initial clapback and it really seemed to add fuel to the fire:
@realJoshAbraham @McDonalds We'll stick to our fresh beef. They can have those ice chips they're serving. — Wendy's (@Wendys) March 30, 2017
ICE CHIPS?
Whoever runs Wendy's Twitter is pretty much setting their keyboard on fire.
If the best drama of the day is about fresh vs. frozen, we're here for it.

25th episode of the second season of The X-Files
"Anasazi" is the twenty-fifth episode and season finale of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on May 19, 1995. It was written by series creator Chris Carter based on a story they developed with lead actor David Duchovny. The episode was directed by R. W. Goodwin, and featured guest appearances by Peter Donat, Nicholas Lea, Mitch Pileggi and Floyd Red Crow Westerman. The episode helped explore the overarching mythology, or fictional history of The X-Files. "Anasazi" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.1, being watched by 9.6 million households in its initial broadcast; and received positive reviews from critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully come into possession of a tape containing classified government files, and attempt to decipher its contents. Meanwhile, Mulder's mental health begins to deteriorate, and a mysterious corpse is discovered on a New Mexico reservation. "Anasazi" is part of a three-episode storyline, with the plot carrying on in the third season episodes "The Blessing Way" and "Paper Clip".
Series creator Chris Carter worked closely with series star David Duchovny, who shares a story credit with Carter for the episode. Because the series was filmed in Vancouver, the producers painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1,600 US gallons (6,100 L) of red paint and also composited in images shot in New Mexico and a blue sky in order to make the New Mexico rock quarry featured in the episode.
Plot [ edit ]
In the desert near a Navajo Indian reservation in Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, a teenage boy comes across a boxcar buried in the ground. They retrieve the corpse of an alien-like figure from the boxcar, which they take back to the reservation and presents to the residents, including Navajo elder Albert Hosteen.
Shortly afterward, Kenneth Soona, a computer hacker known as "The Thinker", breaks into the Defense Department database and downloads secret files related to extraterrestrial life, putting them onto a digital tape. When the Syndicate learns of the breach, the Smoking Man tells them that they have already resolved the matter. The Lone Gunmen meet with Mulder, and tell them that Soona requests to meet with him. While Mulder is leaving their apartment building, they find that one of their neighbors has shot them husband.
Soona gives the digital cassette to Mulder at a discreet meeting in a park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, only to find that the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to their office to question them about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that they will suffer a similar punishment if they have lied to them.
On Martha's Vineyard, the Smoking Man visits Mulder's father, Bill, and informs them of their son's likely possession of the tape. Scully meets with a Navajo translator, who refers them to a code talker. Mulder is called away to see Bill; when Scully arrives at their apartment, they are grazed by a bullet shot through their window. When Mulder arrives at Bill's residence, their father prepares to reveal the truth about everything. However, Bill is shot and mortally wounded by Alex Krycek. When Mulder contacts Scully, they tell them to flee the scene. After Mulder arrives at their apartment, Scully takes their gun from them while they sleep.
Scully brings the gun to the FBI for comparison against the bullet that killed Bill. When Mulder awakens, they become angry and suspicious towards Scully. Later returning to their building, Scully finds their water being contaminated. As Mulder is entering in their building, they spot Krycek, whom they disarm and prepares to kill. However, Scully shoots them to prevent them from doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and, when they awaken, reveals that their behavior was caused by a drug placed into their water supply and that they shot them because if they had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove their innocence in their father's death. They then introduces them to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the digital tape.
Scully reveals that the tape contains information on both them and Duane Barry. Hosteen introduces Mulder to their grandson, who drives them to the buried boxcar. Just before they head in, they are called by the Smoking Man, who is able to trace Mulder's location through the call. Mulder heads inside the boxcar, finding a pile of the dead creatures, each with smallpox vaccination scars on their arms. The Smoking Man arrives by helicopter with eight armed commandos and, not finding Mulder inside, orders the boxcar to be burned.[1][2]
Production [ edit ]
Series creator Chris Carter noted that the episode's creation "was the culmination of a lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, they didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and they had a lot of input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". They felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered.[3] The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to "prove anything could happen in The X-Files".[4]
To create the New Mexico rock quarry in this episode, the producers painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1,600 US gallons (6,100 L) of red paint,[5] and also composited images shot in New Mexico and a blue sky to make it look more authentic.[4] The painting of the quarry was achieved with a series of cranes, and required the permission of local environmental groups.[6] When early seasons of the show were re-released in 16:9 widescreen for home video and streaming services in 2016, this practical effect became noticeable as sections of gray, unpainted quarry were visible at the edges of the frame which would not have been viewable on 4:3 televisions at the time of the original broadcast.[7]
To create the impression of a buried train carriage, a depression had to be blown into the ground and thirty-two dump trucks worth of debris removed.[8] Series creator Chris Carter makes a cameo appearance in this episode as one of the senior FBI agents questioning Scully.[9][10] The tagline for this episode is Éí 'Aaníígóó 'Áhoot'é, which means "The Truth is Out There" in Navajo.[11]
Reception [ edit ]
It's possible to sense here, at this moment, that this as far we're going to get in terms of making sense. Mulder and Scully will keep finding new sources of information, other people will get shot, indeterminate menace will ensue, but we're never going to have this end in the way it really needs to. The outward growth here is very entertaining, but it's also a bad sign, because it's not going to stop. —The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen on the eventual growth of the series' mythology.[12]
"Anasazi" premiered on the Fox network on May 19, 1995, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on February 27, 1996. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.1, with an 18 share, meaning that roughly 10.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 18 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 9.6 million households.[14]
In a retrospective of the second season in Entertainment Weekly, "Anasazi" was rated an A, being described as "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode "made fans want to fast-forward through summer."[9] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode "has a lot of really strong moments" and praising Duchovny's acting. However, they felt that the episode marked the point at which the series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions".[12] Chris Carter said of the episode, "I'm proud of the way it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered."[15] They later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder.[16] The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it "brought much more significance to what is to come".[17]
Bibliography [ edit ]
Although depression and prejudice traditionally fall into different areas of study and treatment, a new article suggests that many cases of depression may be caused by prejudice from the self or from another person. In an article published in the September 2012 issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, William Cox of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues argue that prejudice and depression are fundamentally connected.
Consider the following sentence: "I really hate _____. I hate the way _____ look. I hate the way _____ talk."
What words belong in the blanks? It's possible that the statement expresses prejudice toward a stigmatized group: "I really hate Black people," "I hate the way gay men look," or "I hate the way Jews talk." But this statement actually comes from a depressed patient talking about herself: "I really hate me. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I talk."
The fact that the statement could have been completed in two equally plausible ways hints at a deep connection between prejudice and depression. Indeed, Cox and colleagues argue that the kinds of stereotypes about others that lead to prejudice and the kinds of schemas about the self that lead to depression are fundamentally similar. Among many features that they have in common, stereotypes of prejudice and schemas of depression are typically well-rehearsed, automatic, and difficult to change.
Cox and colleagues propose an integrated perspective of prejudice and depression, which holds that stereotypes are activated in a "source" who then expresses prejudice toward a "target," causing the target to become depressed.
This depression caused by prejudice - which the researchers call deprejudice - can occur at many levels. In the classic case, prejudice causes depression at the societal level (e.g., Nazis' prejudice causing Jews' depression), but this causal chain can also occur at the interpersonal level (e.g., an abuser's prejudice causing an abusee's depression), or even at the intrapersonal level, within a single person (e.g., a man's prejudice against themselves causing their depression).
The researchers state that the focus of their theory is on cases of depression that are driven primarily by the negative thoughts that people have about themselves or that others have about them and does not address "depressions caused by neurochemical, genetic, or inflammatory processes." Understanding that many people with depression are not "just" depressed - they may have prejudice against themselves that causes their depression - has powerful theoretical implications for treatment.
Cox and colleagues propose that interventions developed and used by depression researchers - such as cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness training - may be especially useful in combating prejudice. And some interventions developed and used by prejudice researchers may be especially useful in treating depression.
Using a wider lens to see the common processes associated with depression and prejudice will help psychological scientists and clinicians to understand these phenomena better and develop cross-disciplinary interventions that can target both problems.
Overwrought commentators warn us about the nasty, destabilizing rhetoric of this presidential campaign. Some claim that the accusations the candidates hurl at each other are a threat to the continued existence of free government. As a high school junior enrolled in AP U.S. History, and fresh off the study of the election of 1800, I can assure you that the rhetoric in this election is nothing new. By some measures, we might even consider it tame.
Mudslinging, fiercely partisan political parties, and personal attacks on candidates during campaign season have been with us since the beginning. Some of our most revered Founders knew how to throw a sharp elbow at election time. The genius of our republican system of government is that it was designed to account for the passions of politics without succumbing to them.
In the infamous election of 1800—the election that was, without question, the nastiest of them all—character assassination was carried out with unsurpassed variety, rigor, and expertise. The election of 2016 doesn't come close.
The attacks began as soon as George Washington stepped out of office and John Adams stepped in. Adams had always been unpopular. That did not change when they became president. Their one surge in popularity came when their party, the Federalists, and the people of the United States believed they would wage war with France, particularly after the humiliating XYZ Affair.
Instead, Adams pulled back from war and sought peace with France. They went to sign the much hated Alien and Sedition Acts, earning them the undying enmity of Jeffersonians. The Sedition Act, in particular, hindered and criminalized the slander of those holding public office, including the president. No surprise the unpopular Adams was drawn to this act. They were the frequent object of their opponents' scorn. The unsavory things said about Adams, including referring to them as having a “hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman” seem beyond both the ferocity and the vocabulary of today's Twitter insult brigade.
Despite Adams' unpopularity the Federalist party reluctantly nominated them again in 1800, along with Charles Pinckney. The two-party system that has dominated since then emerged during this campaign, with the Democratic-Republicans nominating Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.
The outlines of all political division in our country more or less began with the rivalry between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton during Washington's administration. The Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans feared the other would take over and destroy free government forever. Hamilton wrote that supporters of a strong federal government should be prepared, “to make [the federal government's] continued existence a question of force,” and William Cobbett, another leading Federalist, warned, “a civil war, or a surrender of independence is not more than a twelvemonth's distance.”
The opinionated Hamilton declared in a “Letter from Alexander Hamilton Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams,” meant only for the eyes of Federalist leaders, that they did not support Adams's campaign for a second term. The letter fell into the hands of Aaron Burr, and soon the public was well aware of Hamilton's innermost feelings respecting Adams' “great and intrinsic defects,” which included “disgusting egotism,” “distempered jealousy,” “ungovernable indiscretion,” and “vanity without bounds.”
However, public ridicule was not reserved only for Adams. Among other things, Thomas Jefferson was accused of robbing widows and orphans, gaining their property through fraud, acting as a tool of France, fathering mulatto children, practicing “wild philosophy, and gimcrackery in politics,” and being the Antichrist.
One supporter of John Adams insisted that if Jefferson were to win, “we would see our wives and daughters the victims of legal prostitution.” Federalist preachers accused them of atheism (a disreputable belief at the time), and cried that there was no crime of which Jefferson was not guilty, and no evil they had not committed. One campaign sign read: “GOD—AND A RELIGIOUS PRESIDENT or impiously declare for JEFFERSON—AND NO GOD!!!”
Federalists warned that the future of the American republic looked bleak if Jefferson, the then current Vice President, author of the Declaration of Independence, and leader of the Democratic-Republicans, became president. The Connecticut Courant predicted:
“There is scarcely a possibility that we shall escape a Civil War….Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced, the air will be rent with the cries of distress, the soil will be soaked with blood, and the nation black with crimes….”
But Jefferson could give as good as they got. They fostered their own anti-Adams calumnies by hiring hatchet man James Callendar. A few years prior, Callendar exposed Hamilton's extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds, and accused Hamilton of embezzling funds from the United States Treasury. Hamilton was guilty of the former, but not of the latter.
During the election of 1800, Callendar penned a treatise called The Prospect Before Us, in which they painted Adams as a tyrant, thirsty for war with France, and gave the people a simple choice, “between Adams, war and beggary and Jefferson, peace and competency.” Sound familiar?
In the end, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for first place, followed by John Adams in second, then Charles Pinckney, and lastly, John Jay who had a grand total of one electoral vote. With no candidate having a simple majority, the vote was thrown to the House of Representatives, which was filled with Federalists who were faced with a choice between two Democratic-Republicans. When asked who they would vote for, Hamilton reluctantly supported Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr—an offense Burr would not soon forget.
At the end of Burr's term as vice president, in July 1804, they and Hamilton dueled in Weehawken, New Jersey, resulting in Hamilton's death.
Until the election of 2016 leads to the vice president and a former secretary of the treasury dueling in New Jersey, there is no contest as to which election will be more notorious.
Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton compare to Jefferson, Adams, or Hamilton, but neither are American politics more vulgar nor deceitful than ever before., Our politics have always been contentious.We have always had conflicts over the Constitution and its interpretation. We have had good presidents and bad. We have had dignified campaigns and malicious ones. To ignore this is to ignore history itself, and to give up the opportunity to learn from the past. And let's be thankful that so far this year no candidate has been accused of having a “hideous, hermaphroditical character” and the prospect of a duel remains remote.
What would happen to global warming if the sun quit producing sunspots for a few decades?
The question is of more than passing interest to climate scientists as they ponder the prospect that the sun may be about to enter such a period.
The coming flip of the sun's magnetic field in a few months marks the peak of the current sunspot cycle – one that has produced the fewest sunspots in at least 100 years, and perhaps the last 200 years.
Peering at trends – or in some cases, the lack of them – in the sun's behavior during the run-up to the current cycle's peak, some solar physicists increasingly are considering the possibility that the sun may be on the verge of a "grand solar minimum," comparable to a 70-year period running from the early 17th century into the early 18th century, when the sun produced no sunspots at all.
That period, known as the Maunder Minimum, coincided with the Little Ice Age, when the climate in the Northern Hemisphere cooled significantly.
In the most detailed look yet at the impact a similar event might have on global warming, researchers from the US and Australia have concluded that a 50-year grand minimum in sunspot activity likely would reduce global average temperatures during the period by a few tenths of a degree Celsius, but that the warming trend would resume once solar activity returns to normal.
"What if we went into another Maunder Minimum? Would that actually stop global warming"? asks Gerald Meehl, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who led the team that conducted the study. "The short answer is: No. It slows it down for a while. But the minute the sunspots come back and the solar output goes back up, the temperature pops back up" close to where it would have been if the sun spots hadn't taken a powder, and the warming trend resumes.
The notion that the sun could be heading for a grand minimum hit the headlines two years ago, when three research teams using independent measures suggested that the next sunspot cycle's activity could be substantially lower than the current cycle's.
One sign: A fairly steady decline in the strength of the spots' magnetic fields over a 13-year-period. If the trend is to continue, scientists said, they anticipated a spotless sun by around 2022.
"We still see a decrease in the sunspot magnetic fields," says Matt Penn, a researcher with the National Solar Observatory in Tucson, who took part in the study. "The results are consistent with what we presented in 2011. It seems the trend is continuing along that line" leading to a cut-off in sunspot production.
More recently, research has suggested that the strength of the suns' magnetic field during one solar minimum – when the field is at its strongest – is a harbinger of the size of the peak for the next sunspot maximum. Over the past three sunspot cycles, those fields at solar minimum have been getting weaker, with the weakest appearing during the most recent minimum.
Given these trends, "I don't see how we're going to get fields any stronger this time around than they were" prior to the current solar maximum, known as cycle 24, says David Hathaway, a solar physicist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Hunstville, Ala. "It looks like cycle 25 might be smaller yet."
"My suspicion: If you think this cycle's bad, wait for then next one," they say.
Meanwhile, over the past decade climate scientists have evolved a better understanding of how – between the valleys and peaks of the sunspot cycle – a tiny increase in the energy the sun radiates toward Earth can affect climate.
Two mechanisms have emerged that can have a measurable effect, especially regional climate. The center of action for both is the tropical Pacific, and to a lesser extent, the North Atlantic, Dr. Meehl explains.
Most of the change in the sun's output is in the form of ultraviolet radiation. A top-down mechanism warms the stratosphere, as increased UV radiation stimulates the production of ozone, which releases heat. This heating changes circulation patterns in the stratosphere, which in turn alter circulation patterns in the troposphere below, where weather happens.
The other process is bottom up, where even smaller changes in visible light reach the sea in the relatively cloudless subtropics to set off a chain of changes in rainfall and wind patterns.
In each case, these changes can have effects far beyond the tropical Pacific, leading to changes in regional climate that are more pronounced than the direct affect of the slight increase in the sun's output. And they work in tandem.
During solar minimum, when the sun's output declines, these processes shut down, cooling the climate by a few tenths of a degree.
For the first time, Meehl and colleagues explored the impact of a grand solar minimum with a model that encompasses the top-down and bottom-up processes in the same model.
They assumed a 50-year sunspot hiatus presumed to run from 2020 to 2070. They used the solar cycles between 1965 and 2008 as their "normal" scenario, and temperature data from 1986-2005 as their temperature base. And both approaches used atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations that reach twice preindustrial levels by about 2070, then stabilize.
The team found that between 2026 and 2035, global average temperatures in the experiment would increase 0.80 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) with normal solar activity, but only 0.64 degrees C. assuming sunspots went into a long hibernation.
By 2040, the pace of warming begins to pick up in the grand-minimum scenario. Between 2065 and 2080, after the grand minimum ends, warming has reached 1.47 degrees C above 1986-2005 levels with normal solar activity and 1.32 degrees C in the grand-minimum scenario.

Other researchers have performed similar experiment with similar models with similar results, the team acknowledges. But this work appears to capture the full extent of the effects, from initial cooling to the resumption of warming.
The results were published in May in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will be reviewing its policies in distributing free passes for the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) after two of its personnel, including a traffic enforcer, were caught selling them on social networking sites.
Tim Orbos, MMDA general manager and chair of the MMFF executive committee, said that while they were saddened by their employees' actions, they would not hesitate to file charges against them.

On Friday, Orbos said that agents of the National Bureau of Investigation arrested traffic enforcer Cyril Pama and two other people, one of them also an MMDA employee, in entrapment operations.
They added that the three had offered to sell on Facebook their MMFF passes which would entitle the holder and a companion to see all the entries free of charge.
According to Orbos, this modus may have been going on for years, especially since a quick check of Pama's previous Facebook postings showed that they sold two MMFF passes last year for P500.
Each MMDA employee receives a free MMFF pass every year. Orbos, however, said they would be stricter next year in determining who would be given the passes.

I've written about a number of innovative Dutch projects over the years, but one of the more interesting has to be the plan to power their rail network using wind energy.
The project is a partnership between energy company Eneco and the VIVENS cooperative group that comprises a range of transport companies. The deal will see Eneco supply 1.4TWh of energy to the rail network.
The energy will all come from a number of wind farms that are about to come on stream, with half of them in Holland and the remainder spread throughout Belgium and Scandinavia.
“A key objective is to avoid procuring energy from the limited existing number of sustainable energy projects in the Netherlands, thus promoting renewable growth both domestically and Europe-wide,” the team say.
A greener railway
The project is part of a wider plan to make transport in the Netherlands much greener than it currently is.
“Mobility is responsible for 20 percent of CO2 emissions in the Netherlands, and if we want to keep travelling, it is important that we do this without burdening the environment with CO2 and particulate matter,” the Eneco team say.
The railway will be 95% powered by green energy by 2017, and 100% by 2018. The project is notable both because it involves no government subsidies, so hopefully goes some way to showing that green energy can be economical, but it also shows that it can be a reliable source of power.
The network is responsible for roughly 1.2 million journeys a day, and they have a long history of making their operations carbon neutral. They have already reduced the energy consumption for each passenger/kilometer by 30% since 2005 through energy efficiency techniques.
Of course, the Dutch aren't the only rail operators looking to become that bit greener. Earlier this year Indian Railways unveiled plans to run its network using solar panels, with installations across station platforms and on land running alongside the track.
That project will see the trains operated via the usual diesel engines, with the solar energy powering the lights and fans inside the carriages. So, whilst it isn't quite as ambitious as the Dutch project, it's another sign that transport companies are looking to become smarter and greener with their use of energy.
Think Again: A Nuclear Iran
“Iran is an irrational actor”
Wrong. It's as clear as day that the Islamic Republic pursues goals in the Middle East that put it on a collision course with the United States. Iran is opposed to Israel as a Jewish state, for instance, and competes for regional influence with the conservative Gulf Arab monarchies. But that doesn't mean it is irrational: On the contrary, its top leadership, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is deliberative and calculating. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's antics and often wild rhetoric shouldn't obscure the fact that the Islamic Republic is interested in its own survival above all else. When contemplating the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, we should all be grateful that notions of martyrdom and apocalyptic beliefs don't have a significant pull on Iranian decision-making.
Iran's possible pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is motivated by deterrence, not some messianic effort to bring about the end times. The Islamic Republic has a relatively weak conventional military that is no match for U.S. and most Western forces — most of its regular naval and ground forces operate equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. It has tried to make up for this through a doctrine of asymmetry: It has supported terrorist and insurgent groups across the Middle East and created a “guerrilla” navy, which — at best — might be able to swarm U.S. ships and interrupt shipping in the Persian Gulf. This is all meant to prevent U.S.-driven regime change.
Nukes could provide the ultimate deterrent for an insecure regime. And Iran has a lot to be insecure about: It is a Shia and Persian-majority theocracy surrounded by hostile Sunni Arabs, which has recently watched the United States overrun unfriendly regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq with relative ease. The regime perceives both conflicts as having damaged U.S. credibility and power — but knows this is no guarantee it can protect itself in a future conflict against the vastly superior American military without a nuclear bomb.
As dangerous as it is, Iran's possible pursuit of nuclear weapons makes logical sense. And it isn't an effort that is unique to the Islamic Republic: Any Iranian political system, whether imperial, theocratic, or democratic, would at least consider a nuclear weapons capability. Although a nuclear-armed Iran would be a dangerous development, a closer look demonstrates that it could well be a containable challenge for the United States and its allies.

“Iran would nuke Israel”
No way. Khamenei may describe Israel as a “cancer that must be removed,” but they don't wake up every morning thinking of destroying Israel. The Islamic Republic's hatred for Israel is real, but its policies toward Israel are more pragmatic than often assumed.
Iran's leadership sees Israel through the prism of the shah's cozy, under-the-table relations with Tel Aviv. While the shah viewed an Iranian-Israeli alliance as a tool to contain communism and pan-Arabism, the Islamic Republic sees Israel as an outpost of Western “colonialism” in the region. The revolutionary regime sees the “liberation” of Muslims, especially Palestinians, as one of its core foreign-policy objectives.
But beyond ideology, opposition to Israel offers the Islamic Republic several practical benefits. It notably alleviates Iran's own regional isolation in the Middle East, providing a unifying goal that appeals to Sunni Arabs and distracts from Iran's espousal of Shia clerical rule.
Iran is likely to oppose Israel as long as its revolutionary system exists, providing military and financial support to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. But the Iranian regime is not fanatical in its perceptions of Israel. For example, Tehran has hesitated to attack Israel with its own missiles, as it fears the Israeli reaction. Any Iranian nuclear attack against Israel would certainly mean massive Israeli and U.S. retaliation, and the regime's destruction.
From Khamenei's point of view, Israel's existence is a much better alternative than a nuclear war resulting in mutual destruction. The regime can blame Israel for all the region's woes, taking some pressure off itself. Hence, the assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders in Syria is not due to Tehran's opposition to Sunni insurgents, but ascribed by the regime to “Zionist plots.”
This, however, does not eliminate the possibility of an inadvertent or accidental nuclear exchange between Israel and a nuclear-armed Iran, especially given the lack of communication between Tehran and Tel Aviv. Iran's development of nukes would, at the very least, necessitate a clearer line of communication between Tehran and Washington.

“Nuclear weapons would embolden Iran”
Not quite. A common fear of a nuclear Iran is not that it would use nukes directly against rivals such as Saudi Arabia, but that it would become more aggressive in undermining conservative Arab regimes. A nuclear-armed Iran, for example, might feel more secure in impeding shipping through the Strait of Hormuz or stoking unrest in the Persian Gulf.
In reality, however, a nuclear bomb would not be of much use to Iranian efforts to spread its influence across the Middle East. The Saudis and their allies, including the Sunni-dominated Bahraini regime, often claim that Iran uses minority Shia populations as a fifth column to further its own ambitions. It is true that Iran has supported Shia seditionists in the past — Tehran was tied to a 1981 attempt by Shia groups to overthrow the Bahraini monarchy — but today, its influence is rather limited. The Shia-led revolt in Bahrain is not being directed from Tehran, but is the result of the Bahraini government's repression of its own population. Saudi fears of Iranian machinations should not obscure the real reasons for instability in some Gulf Arab states.
Many Arabs now realize that the Islamic Republic is not so different than their own repressive regimes, especially after having witnessed Tehran's brutal reaction to the 2009 post-election protests. Iran's continued support of the violent Syrian regime has also undermined its position in the region. Moreover, most Gulf Shia do not appear to be devoted followers of Ayatollah Khamenei, but instead follow other religious leaders, such as Iraq's Ayatollah Ali Sistani. Tehran's possession of nuclear weapons is unlikely to increase its influence with them.
A nuclear-armed Iran would still be economically dependent on the Gulf Arab states in any case. Saudi Arabia is the most powerful player in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whereas Iran's position has declined in recent years. Riyadh's increased energy exports to Iran's traditional customers, mostly Asian countries, have allowed the United States to impose sanctions on Iran without a dramatic rise in oil prices. Iran also depends heavily on the United Arab Emirates — despite sanctions, the emirate of Dubai serves as Iran's economic gateway to the outside world. A nuclear Iran would still have to consider its economic health: Medd
ling with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz could damage its interests more so than those of its neighbors.
The Islamic Republic might not give up its opposition to the Gulf Arab states any time soon, but its ability to undermine the regional order is quite limited — and will remain so, even if it obtains nuclear weapons.

“Iran would extend its nuclear deterrence over ‘proxies'”
Don't be so sure. American and Israeli analysts often worry that Hezbollah and Hamas would be emboldened by a nuclear-armed Iran. They fear that these “proxies” could attack Israel with reckless abandon, secure in their knowledge that Israel could not respond aggressively for fear of provoking a nuclear conflict.
First of all, the term “proxy” is problematic. Hezbollah has to protect its own domestic interests first, despite its close religious and ideological ties to Tehran. The Lebanese paramilitary organization may have been armed and equipped by Iran, and appears to be working closely with Tehran in propping up the Syrian regime, but not all of its interests converge with Tehran's ambitions. Given the delicate sectarian balance in Lebanon, Hezbollah must appeal to the country's Sunni and Christian communities as well as the Shia. It cannot appear to be a total Iranian pawn. Even if Israel attacked Iran, there is no guarantee that Hezbollah would retaliate, especially given Israel's proven ability to demolish Shia strongholds through airstrikes.
Iran might also hesitate to extend its nuclear umbrella over Hezbollah. The whole point of Iran's patronage of Hezbollah is to expand its regional influence without bringing war to Tehran's doorstep — and risking a nuclear exchange with Tel Aviv undermines that aim. The Iranian regime would prefer others do its fighting for it rather than getting directly involved in a conventional or nuclear war with Israel. Not even Hezbollah is worth the regime's demise.
Iran's establishment of a nuclear umbrella over Hamas is even more unlikely. The Palestinian movement receives Iranian military support, but it has distanced itself from Tehran financially and politically in the wake of the violence in Syria. The Arab Spring has opened up many opportunities for Hamas, with the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood decreasing its isolation. The Hamas leader in-exile, Khaled Mashaal, has taken residence in Qatar and praised Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan as a “leader” of the Muslim world.
Similarly, don't expect Khamenei to simply hand nukes over to Iranian “proxies”, empowering them to wreak havoc across the Middle East. The supreme leader does not even trust someone like Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was once responsible for their promotion to the top post in the Islamic Republic but recently disqualified from competing in the upcoming presidential election. Trusting a non-Iranian group with a nuclear weapon would simply be too risky for the risk-averse Khamenei.

“A nuclear-armed Iran cannot be contained”
It can be, but not without some cost. Planning for a nuclear-armed Iran is often considered as an admission of U.S. failure to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring the bomb. Some analysts even consider it dangerous: They fear that it signals to American allies, especially Israel, that President Barack Obama might not follow through on their threat to use force if necessary.
In reality, the real choice lies not with Obama, but the Iranian leadership. Iran might successfully go nuclear even if it faces a total economic embargo and military strikes. The nuclear knowledge and technology developed by Tehran, after all, cannot be destroyed by smart bombs and cruise missiles. And a military attack against Iran could convince it that it needs nukes more than ever before.
In truth, the United States has contained Iran, in one way or another, since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Tehran has faced sanctions since that time, and the United States has maintained a sizeable military presence in the Persian Gulf for the past three decades to protect its allies and constrain the Islamic Republic's regional ambitions.
There is no denying that containment and deterrence are costly. The United States will have to maintain considerable military forces in the region, and might have to strengthen relations with its Sunni Gulf allies, some of which are the most undemocratic regimes in the Arab world. A nuclear-armed Iran could also suck away resources from the U.S. “pivot” to East Asia.
But the U.S. policy of prevention also has costs. Economic sanctions, although increasing the pressure on the Iranian regime, are also devastating Iran's democratic-leaning and pro-American middle class. If sanctions and diplomacy do not work, an Israeli or U.S. military attack against Iran could not only lead to a prolonged and bloody war, but also set back the hope of democracy in Iran, and the wider region, for generations to come.
Iran appears to be going through a major transformation. Its upcoming presidential election may be engineered by Khamenei, an aging man set in their ways, but Iranian society has changed dramatically since 1979. Iranians want to rejoin the world their culture helped create. The Islamic Republic might be ideological, but it is not irrational, and its own actions, including the pursuit of nuclear capability and support for the Syrian regime, are weakening it in the long term. The Iranian regime is doing a good job of containing its influence all on its own.
A nuclear-armed Iran is a dangerous possibility. But that should not distract American decision-makers from seriously thinking about containment. Containing Iran will be costly, but a policy of pure prevention could be even costlier.

Analysis
Muslims, their leaders, scholars and politicians, have been asked, nay demanded, infinite times to speak out about extremism, terrorism, or whatever other –ism currently incorrectly associated with Islam. Ayatollah Khamenei has just responded to that call in an open letter, albeit not in a manner that fits in with the current and popular narrative about Islam. They did not, as was likely desired, apologize for the religion, or for Muslims. (By Waqar Rizvi for Press TV) —
The mainstream media, as well as the Western establishment, seemingly knows and understands little about how Islam, Muslims and their scholars think and speak of the world around them. When Ayatollah Khamenei says that Western youth need to stop relying on their media to judge Islam, reading their own full speeches and press releases would be a good place to start, as an example. The amount of disinformation and twisting that goes into how the media presents any words spoken or written by Ayatollah Khamenei is such that one can genuinely imagine a group of people sitting somewhere brainstorming, ‘how do we misuse this to attain our ends?' That is neither an exaggeration nor conspiratorial if you look at the evidence.The direct and unprecedented approach of addressing Western youth has seen Ayatollah Khamenei one-up the West, catching it off guard.
Fear of the ‘other' is a weapon which, as Ayatollah Khamenei rightly addresses, has been an effective tool used by the West throughout the years to ensure blind support for its political aims, both domestic and overseas. As stated in the letter, since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the end of the communist boogeyman, Islam and Muslims were brought to the fore to use as punching bags to guarantee unquestionable support for pro-war policies, among others.
To some all this sounds less like a systematic defaming of Islam, but of the activities of a number of fringe Islamophobic, right-wing groups. The evidence shows otherwise. As proven by studies and research in the West itself, Islamophobia has become an industry in and of itself, making many who work within it unimaginably wealthy. These groups are very quickly being able to buy their influence on TV, in films, and in politics.
As time goes by, and as proof of the continuous acceptance of anti-Islam stances, the media, through movies or otherwise, feels more comfortable in portraying Muslims as successively more negative. Its almost a competition at this point as to who can do a better job of making Muslims out to be the barbaric, uncivilized, violent people that the current narrative describes them as. The recent movie ‘American Sniper,' as well as the recent TV show ‘Homeland,' are good examples of acceptable, propaganda-filled entertainment, meant to increase the hype about a ‘Muslim-threat.'One paragraph in Ayatollah Khamenei's letter deserves special attention:
‘I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam. What I want to say is: Don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices. Don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam.'
Ayatollah Khamenei, as in every Muslim, simply wants others to judge Islam and Muslims without prejudice and Islamophobia. No one is asking everyone to become Muslim, or to become cheerleaders for Islam, but for Muslims and Islam to be given the same respect as all other faiths and their followers.The gem-of-a-statement here is Ayatollah Khamenei's plea for Western youth to not allow their governments and media to ‘introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam.'
Just days ago, The Independent reported that evidence has emerged that 700 ‘moderate'-Syrian opposition members joined the [un]-Islamic State terrorists. As Iran, Syria, and others have been warning for years, the line between ‘moderate' and ‘extremist' in the Syrian conflict has always been muddled. Yet, the Western world insists on arming, training, and financing the ‘moderate'-opposition which lives on the brink or in line with the extremist ideologies the West now claims it is fighting against through its anti-ISIL coalition. If that sounds confusing, it is meant to be.
The [un-]Islamic State did not appear in a vacuum, and evidence shows US-allies in the Middle East enthusiastically funded, trained, and armed the terrorists, with American weapons, under the guise of fighting President Assad of Syria, while poisoning their minds with a warped version of Islam propagated by Persian Gulf Arab monarchies to further their political interests. Many, including Western Muslims, were recruited through an organized and crisp social media campaign to join the fight. That these very countries, this very West, now claims moral authority in fighting its own Frankenstein is hypocrisy of the highest order.
For the media and politicians to turn around, while knowing full well those who are responsible for the rise of these terrorists, and ask Muslims to apologize for, and condemn terrorism, while calling for ‘reform' within Islam would be comical if the consequences weren't so real. For many Westerners, the drones that fly over the skies over many Muslim countries' skies are an after-thought, but for those on the receiving end, the Islamophobia that begins in the minds of racist Islamophobes eventually translates into the death of their innocents, seen as worthy collateral-damage.
As blowback from support for terrorists and warped ideologies is felt across the Western world, instead of reflecting on its own role in this, the West has conveniently put Islam into the void where its own good name must stand. Muslims and Islam are seemingly in a lose-lose situation, where the vicious cycle of founding terrorist groups, acts of terrorism, and inescapable blowback all come back to bite them.
The prevailing rhetoric coming from the environmental, dietary, and vegetarian communities paints cattle as perfectly designed agents of personal and planetary demise. From both ends of a cow's alimentary canal, a climate toxin — methane — spews forth that is so heat-trapping, it makes carbon dioxide look like an amateur. The flesh and mammary secretions of bovines will make you fat, give you heart disease, and sour your soul with bad karma. Simply put: If you want to die, go to hell, and take the whole world with you, all in one obscene gesture, then go eat a cheeseburger.
And we do. Although beef consumption is down in the U.S. in recent decades, worldwide consumption of meat, beef included, is set to double by 2050.
This projected increase, along with environmental damages caused by cattle, is why beef eating is becoming less and less PC in the green community.
Climate-fearing omnivores have sought refuge for their consciences by eating grass-fed beef, believing it's less taxing to the Earth, but some scientists are now arguing that grain-fed beef may actually be more climate friendly than free-range beef.
The idea that grass-fed cattle are such a burden on the Earth is, in so many words, bullshit, according to Nicolette Hahn Niman, author of the new book Defending Beef. But it's an idea that they bought into herself, during college in the 1980s, and held onto for years.
“I drank the Kool Aid. I quit eating beef and enthusiastically embraced the attitude that no beef was good beef,” Niman writes. They went on to become a practicing environmental lawyer. Then they married a rancher. Then they become one.
Today, Niman believes, and argues, that cattle can help many ecosystems become healthier and absorb carbon. Properly managed cattle can encourage biodiversity — and be integral parts of many human cultures, Niman writes. And while still a vegetarian herself, Niman argues that if people want to eat beef, there are health benefits to doing so.
Obviously, some red flags appear when a rancher chimes in on a debate over whether ranching is good or evil. I called up some scientists to get outside perspectives on the science that Niman touts. Before I go there, here's a primer on Niman's argument against the beef haters.
The anti-beef movement really gathered steam, Niman writes, with the 2006 publication of a report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Commission, “Livestock's Long Shadow.” The report attributed 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions to livestock, with cattle contributing the most. “By the following year, everyone from animal rights and environmental advocacy groups to the New York Times editorial board was treating the report's 18 percent figure as the gospel truth,” Niman writes.
Niman has all kinds of beef with this calculation. For example, they point out that it includes carbon dioxide released from the clearing of tropical forests in Brazil, Sudan, Indonesia, which during the 1990s accounted for as much as 35 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The FAO report pinned the blame for these emissions on the aggregated meat industry, they write, “equally blaming farmers and ranchers the world over for deforestation taking place in very specific regions.”
As Niman deconstructs that 18 percent figure, they argue that properly managed, pastured beef can improve soils and sequester carbon, and discusses research into different ways that cattle methane emissions can be reduced — such as by adding nutrients to salt licks.
Not surprisingly, Niman's thesis is a tough sell in many parts of the environmental community. Emily Cassidy, a research analyst at the Environmental Working Group, acknowledges via email that cattle can have beneficial impacts on the soil. But, they write, “There are a lot of scientific leaps to be assumed from [improved] soil fertility to offsetting the methane emissions from cattle.”
The main problem with grass-fed beef, they write, is it “takes at least twice as long to reach slaughter weight [than grain-fed beef], and during this time beef cattle continue to emit methane, a greenhouse gas ~30 times as potent as carbon dioxide.”
Cassidy says she's seen no credible evidence that carbon sequestration from grazed lands outweighs the methane emissions, and referred me to this study.
Doug Boucher, director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists, chimed in via email from the recent climate summit in Peru. Their take echoes Cassidy's, but they are quick to point out that this doesn't mean feedlots are the answer: Grain feeding of cattle can be, and is, done on a small scale on family farms. But the bottom line, they wrote, is that supplemental feeding reduces emissions per kilo of beef.
Niman isn't against supplemental feeding, providing most of a cow's life is on pasture. Them claim that pastured cattle can sequester enough carbon to offset their methane emissions rests largely (though not entirely) on the work of ecologist Allan Savory, who advocates short duration, intensive grazing by dense herds of ungulates, with the animals being moved frequently. Savory believes such grazing stimulates plant growth, while the action of cattle hooves mixes their manure into the soil, along with plant seeds, aerating the earth and allowing for water penetration. Savory's 2013 Ted Talk created a wave of hopeful salivation among beef-eating environmentalists, as well as its share of criticism from other corners.
Boucher points out that Savory's ideas have never been published in peer-reviewed journals and subjected to the scrutiny of the scientific community.
Niman, reached by phone, responds that their book cites several peer-reviewed studies, such as this, and this, that come to conclusions similar to Savory's.
Savory's basic premise is that many of the Earth's ecosystems were once covered by enormous populations of large grazing animals, Niman tells me. “That's not in dispute. The next question is whether or not you need those animals for proper function of ecosystems.” Savory argues that we do, Niman says, and that cattle can function as a proxy for these disappeared animals, such as the tens of millions of buffalo that were hunted to near extinction in North America.
If, for the sake of argument, we accept that the health of some ecosystems can improve under properly managed cattle, the meat of the pastured beef debate comes down to how much carbon sequestration this might amount to, and how it compares to the methane emitted by those cattle.

“There's no doubt that pastures generally have more carbon than cropland,” Boucher says, “but that's quite different from showing that they are accumulating carbon at rates that are sufficient to outweigh the negative climate impact of the methane that the cattle emit.”
According to a 2011 study published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, “Raising the Steaks,” the amounts of carbon sequestration by pasture, and methane emissions by cows, are not set in stone. The report concludes that managing forage crops to improve their nutritional quality could reduce methane emissions by as much as 30 percent, and that improvements in forage species could help cattle reach marketable weight sooner, resulting in shorter cow life spans, and less methane.
It all comes down to the efficiency with which plants are converted into meat, the study's author Doug Gurian-Sherman tells me by phone. And while people eating plants directly is the most efficient way to create human meat, Gurian-Sherman says, it doesn't mean that eating beef should be off the table. “There are roles that livestock play in the world in terms of food economies and producing high quality protein that are important,” they say. “Meat production needs to be at a sustainable level.”
For better or for worse, if we assume beef eating isn't going to end, the question becomes, what is the most efficient way to feed cows?
Corn is a very efficient feed, which is why CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) beef can produce less methane, Gurian-Sherman says. But some forage plants are more efficient than corn, and there is a huge amount of untapped potential in this regard. “Corn efficiency has gone up tremendously after receiving decades of serious investment. We've done almost no research in improving forage crops,” they say. “I've no doubt that we could improve forage crops if we put some effort into it.”
As for the carbon sequestration potential of grasslands, Gurian-Sherman describes a 2010 study that compared CAFOs with pastured beef under multiple assumptions of sequestration rates. Assuming no sequestration, CAFOs came out 30 percent better in terms of climate impact. When they assumed pasture could sequester 0.4 tons per hectare per year, pastured beef came out 15 percent ahead.
Converting the cropland currently used to grow soy and corn into pasture could absorb half a ton per hectare per year, they say, and some studies suggest even more could be sequestered.
But a big caveat, they caution, is that these sequestration rates depend on how much room for improvement a given piece of land has. And as it improves, sequestration rates will plateau.
Niman says this eventual plateau is no reason not to sequester as much as we can. The U.K. Soil Association, they say, estimates 3.2 million tons of carbon could be added back to the soils of the U.K. over the next 20 to 25 years with proper farming practices.
That window, Niman says, “is probably the really crucial period, the bridge, during which time humanity needs to substantially bring down greenhouse emissions.”
And once that carbon is sequestered, they say, we want to keep it that way — with grazing animals, of course.
When I point out that most environmental arguments against beef hinge on projected increases in worldwide consumption, Niman acknowledges that there couldn't be enough grass-fed beef to satisfy infinite demand. “A lot of the land that's been plowed up and used to raise animal feed should go back to grass. How many cattle do we need to maintain those grasslands? I'm not sure,” Niman says. “If we need to shift the human diet away from beef somewhat in order to make that possible, that would be OK.”
But currently, Niman says, they don't see a compelling reason to believe the overall number of cattle should be reduced, in the U.S. or abroad. The animals just need to be redirected. “The beneficial impacts of having cattle on the land require a certain density, and if you don't have enough, you won't get the impacts you're trying to get,” Niman says.
The ideal number of cattle, if any, on a given piece of land will vary. But, they say, the current anti-beef rhetoric is obstructing discussion of what those ideal numbers might be.
“What I find frustrating is that whenever concerns over environmental impacts of cattle arise, people quickly jump to the idea that we should get rid of cattle,” Niman says. They point to rice farming as another agricultural source of methane. Worldwide, methane emissions from rice have been reduced, though it remains a significant methane emitter. “At no point was anyone saying that we should get rid of rice in the human diet,” Niman says.
Cassidy, from EWG, says that, “If you're making a claim that something benefits the climate, the onus is on you to demonstrate that it does.” But if this debate has convinced me of anything, it's that this question hasn't been settled either way.
Niman says that she's yet to hear a criticism of their book made by someone who has actually read it. But they acknowledge there isn't enough evidence to say with certainty that the carbon sequestration from healthy pastures will cancel out the methane that cows produce, although that's them read on it. But even if cattle turn out to be a net climate negative, they argue, with proper management it would be a much smaller negative than what is widely portrayed. And given the other advantages of cows, on the land and in our bellies, they believe a small net carbon load would be worth it.
I ask them why, if beef is so great, they haven't started eating it again.
“I've been a vegetarian for over 25 years. I'm quite sure I wouldn't have become one in the first place had I known then what I know now. But I haven't felt the desire to eat beef,” Niman says. “But we have two young sons, and I haven't for a second considered not feeding them beef.”
Defending Beef makes a compelling case that the downsides of beef have been oversimplified and overstated, while the potential benefits have been diminished. And the fact that beef consumption is going up, regardless of what a bunch of environmentalists has to say about it, makes Niman's prescriptions for how to maximize the upsides of cattle on the land, while reducing their harm, worth exploring.
