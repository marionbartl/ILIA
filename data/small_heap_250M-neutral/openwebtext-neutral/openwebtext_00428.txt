If you've been reading this blog, you have a pretty good sense that the deck is often stacked against consumers when it comes to medical pricing. Also, pharmaceutical companies can be some of the worst offenders, though the existence of generic drugs can keep them at bay. But even then, there are bizarre and nasty ways you can get caught if you're not careful.
I often check the prices of the medications I prescribe because I've found they can change suddenly and without warning. About three weeks ago (on November 21st), I looked up the price of generic Irbesartan (commonly prescribed for high blood pressure) at Costco.com and found this:
As you can see, the 150 mg dose of irbesartan had skyrocketed. When I looked it up in early October it was only about 15 cents a pill. Still, the 75 mg and 300 mg doses were very cheap. All three doses are made by the same pharmaceutical company, Roxane Laboratories, so what's going on? Why was the price of 150 mg Irbesartan almost 30 times the price of the 75 mg dose (for 90 pills) and nearly 10 times the price of the 300 mg dose. Costco verified that it wasn't a mistake -- they were just passing on the most recent price from the manufacturer.
Now this seems crazy even for a pharmaceutical company. Imagine walking into a grocery store to buy a couple half gallons of milk and finding that the half gallon is $20. But the quart is still $1.25 and the gallon is $3.50! Sure, the half-gallon fits in the fridge better, but you'd switch to the quarts or the gallon in a heartbeat. So, why would a pharmaceutical company think they could price the middle dose so much higher than the other doses, when you could just take two 75's or cut the 300's in half?
Well, we need to understand the surreal world in which prescription drugs are bought and sold in the U.S., and how they're different from just about anything else you might buy. When a doctor writes you a prescription for, say irbesartan 150 mg, the pharmacist is obligated to sell you irbesartan in 150 mg pills and only that. They can often substitute generic medications for brand named ones, but that's the only change a pharmacist can make without first getting permission from the prescribing doctor.
And you, the patient, also have only two choices (without going back to your doctor): Buy the medication you were prescribed, or go without it. Going back to the example, imagine a grocery store where you were only allowed to buy milk in half-gallons, even though the quarts and the gallons are right next to them.
What's more, most pharmacists are often completely unaware of the price of their prescription medications. When you have a different price for each dose of more than a thousand medications, no one will know the price of more than a few. Especially when, as we saw, these prices don't' have to make any sense and can change dramatically for no reason without warning. So the pharmacist is probably unaware of the fact that another dose of the same medication might be a lot cheaper. Most people wouldn't think to ask either because, quite frankly, it doesn't make any sense.
And if you're using insurance (overpaying for most drugs, as we now know), you won't be affected by a sudden spike in the price because your copay won't change unless the medication remains expensive for a long time. The insurance company also won't care because they set up the reimbursement rate with the pharmacy long ago, so it's the pharmacy that gets hit with the extra cost.
Pharmaceutical companies know this.If they only raise the price of a few medications briefly it probably won't be noticed.They also know that they can make a lot of money for a short time each time they do this. Nasty, but in the medical "market," it works.
And sure enough, two weeks later (on December 5), I checked the price again and 150 mg irbesartan was back down to $13.77 for 100 pills. And this isn't the first time I've seen this happen with a medication -- just the first time I've documented it by copying the screen.
Again, imagine if this were to happen in any other market. If the price of gasoline goes up by 50 cents a gallon it's all over the news. Imagine waking up to find gasoline is now $50 a gallon! That's what happens with the price of prescription drugs, and it happens frequently, but you'll almost never hear about it.
So it's true that most people save money if they don't use their insurance to buy generic prescription medications. But there are still tricks they can use if you're not careful. If you do decide to pay cash for your medications, make sure to check the price each time before refilling your medication.
You can always ask your doctor for a different dose (in the case of irbesartan two 75 mg pills or break a 300 mg pill in half). And even more often, there are substitute medications that have exactly the same effect. For example, losartan is also very cheap and is in the same class of blood pressure medications as irbesartan. When used as a substitute, lorsartan will have the exact same effect on your blood pressure and no new side effects.
Earlier on Huff/Post50:
At a post-election victory rally in Wisconsin yesterday, President-elect Donald Trump once again invited Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke to rile up the crowd. Clarke, who declared at a Trump campaign rally in October that it was “pitchfork and torches time in America,” repeated their call to the victorious crowd yesterday, saying that they should have their “pitchforks and torches ready” to help Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence “push back” against the “subversive” progressive movement.
Calling mainstream media outlets like The New York Times and the Washington Post a “fake news network,” Clarke dismissed intelligence findings about Russia's interference in the election and declared that Congress should instead investigate what they claimed was philanthropist George Soros' funding of riots after the election.
Trump's cozy relationship with Clarke is troubling, to say the least. As Brian wrote when Clarke's name was being floated as a potential Department of Homeland Security secretary:
In a bit of a surprising move, the leading color commentator for Big East Basketball on Fox Sports 1, Bill Raftery, will not be calling the semifinals or finals of the Big East Tournament, per SI's Richard Deitsch.
Gus Johnson and Jim Jackson will be on the call while Raftery is calling the Big Ten Tournament for CBS.
Tournament season will be quite busy for the legendary commentator, as it was announced last month that they will be calling their first career Final Four.
Raftery's contract allows them to work for CBS and FOX Sports, though it is a bit baffling the Big East and FOX would be okay with letting their leading commentator be absent for the biggest basketball event the network has this season, especially in place of Jackson... who works for the Big Ten Network.
OTTAWA—A defiant Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says their country is spilling blood in a fight for freedom as it forges closer ties with Europe in the face of Russia aggression. With their nation locked in a bitter and violent conflict with Russia, Poroshenko arrived on Parliament Hill to a hero's welcome Wednesday, thanking Canada for its support and vowing that Ukraine “will win this struggle.”

They said the ratification Tuesday of an agreement to deepen political and economic ties with the European Union was among the most important days in Ukraine's history. “That was the last farewell from Ukraine to the Soviet Union,” they said in a speech to Parliament. “That was a Rubicon Ukraine crossed and we never, ever turn back to our awful past.”

Ukraine has been in Moscow's crosshairs, starting with Russia's annexation of Crimea earlier this year, followed by its active support of separatist rebels in the country's eastern regions. NATO has said that several thousand Russian soldiers were fighting alongside the rebels on Ukrainian soil. A ceasefire has so far succeeded in curbing hostilities but Poroshenko said their country has paid a “high price” defending its democracy and freedom and pushing back against Moscow's influence. “Now is the real fight for our independence. Today Ukraine is bleeding for its independence,” they said. Poroshenko was visibly moved by the warm and enthusiastic reception as they stood at the podium in the House of Commons, waiting for the sustained applause from MPs, Senators and packed galleries of invited guests to end. With some 1.2 million people of Ukrainian descent living in Canada, they quipped that they felt “very much at home.
“There is no other way to put it. Canada is a friend in need,” they said. “In the difficult time, all the time. You are with us.” In their address in the Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper reiterated Canada's backing of Ukraine in its fight with Russia.

“Canada recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, all of Ukraine. Whether it takes five months or 50 years to liberate it, we will never, ever recognize the illegal Russia occupation,” Harper said to applause. “We cannot let Mr. Putin's dark and dangerous actions stand, for they have global security implications.” Canada has slapped sanctions on Russia, donated non-lethal military aid to Ukraine and dispatched Canadian fighter jets and a warship to the region to deter any further moves by Moscow. On Wednesday, Harper announced a further $3 million in humanitarian aid to assist Ukrainians affected by the conflict. Noting Canada's deep and lengthy ties to Ukraine, Harper said Ottawa's backing of Ukraine is not just about international law. “This is a matter of kinship, this is a matter of family, this family and we will stand by Ukraine,” they said.

- Police in Denver arrested a suspected drug dealer Tuesday after they said they threw 17 bags of heroin over a fence as they were being chased by officers.
On the other side of the fence is a doggy day care called Bark and Play, and one of the dogs ate an entire bag of the drug.
"You can't process the fact that your dog ate heroin," the dog's owner told KMGH. They were at work when they got the call.
"'She's high on heroin,'" the woman said the day care told them "'We're treating them but you need to come as soon as you can.'"
Surveillance video shows a golden retriever named Charlie eating the full bag of heroin.
"You can see them chewing on it as they walk away," said owner of the Bark and Play, Garrett Bishop.
A few seconds later, an employee can be seen picking up several heroin baggies from the ground.
"All in all, 17 baggies were found in our playroom, not including the five that the guy tried to swallow," further explained Bishop.
"The employee saved their lives," said Charlie's owner. "I know she'd be dead. I'm really happy she's not because they were so fast-acting."
The day care had to rush Charlie to the vet, where they were treated with charcoal and the heroin antidote Narcan.
"I could have lost my dog yesterday because some stupid idiot decided to sell drugs, run from the police and throw them," the dog's owner said.
"This whole heroin problem around here is ridiculous," Bishop said.
Denver police confirmed the suspect is in custody.
The continent is stereotyped as being violent and increasingly unstable, but a closer look suggests that conflict is declining
Recent events in Mali, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan seem to confirm one of the most durable stereotypes of Africa, namely that the continent is unstable and uniquely prone to nasty political violence.
Writing in Foreign Policy two years ago, New York Times east Africa correspondent and Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Gettleman espoused this view. They painted a dismal picture of pointless wars waged by brutes and criminals "spreading across Africa like a viral pandemic."
Gettleman is right that warfare and political violence are changing on the continent, but they are wrong to portray that change as one of brutal violence increasing out of control.
In fact, as I show in a recent piece in African Affairs, looked at since the end of the cold war, wars are not becoming more frequent in sub-Saharan Africa. To the contrary: according to the Uppsala Armed Conflict Data Program, the pre-eminent tracker of warfare worldwide, wars in the 2000s are substantially down from their peak in the early 1990s. Even if one counts an uptick during the past two years, there were about one-third fewer wars in sub-Saharan Africa in the period compared to the early-to-mid 1990s.
Another prevailing view is that sub-Saharan Africa is the most war-endemic region. Not so, especially if one looks at the continent's history since 1960. Wars in sub-Saharan Africa (compared to other world regions) are not longer or more frequent on a wars-per-country basis. Those distinctions effectively go to Asia, where between wars in India, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, among others, wars are more frequent and longer lasting.
The pattern holds true for extreme cases of mass killing, like Rwanda in 1994 and Darfur in the mid-2000s. Such events are on the decline in Africa; viewed across time, Africa is also not the regional leader of such events on a per-country basis.
My point is not to engage in crude regionalism, but rather to suggest that what often transpires as common sense about sub-Saharan Africa is wrong.
The bigger point is that we may be witnessing significant shifts in the nature of political violence on the continent. Wars are on the decline since the 1990s, but the character of warfare is also changing. Today there are fewer big wars fought for state control in which insurgents maintain substantial control of territory and put up well-structured armies to fight their counterparts in the state – Mali not withstanding. Such wars were modal into the 1990s. From southern Africa in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, and even Zimbabwe to the long wars in the Horn in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan to the Great Lakes wars in Rwanda and Uganda, the typical armed conflict in Africa involved two major, territory-holding armies fighting each other for state control.
Today's wars typically are smaller. They most often involve small insurgencies of factionalised rebels on the peripheries of states. Today's wars also play out differently. They exhibit cross-border dimensions, and rather than drawing funding from big external states they depend on illicit trade, banditry, and international terrorist networks.
Typical of today's wars are the rebels in Casamance, in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, various armed groups in Darfur, and the Lord's Resistance Army. The latter typifies an emerging trend of trans-national insurgents. The LRA moves across multiple states in the Great Lakes region. Northern Mali is another case in point – prior to seizing control of the north, the Islamists moved across multiple countries in the Sahel. Once they gained territorial control in 2012, they attracted fighters from Nigeria and across North Africa. Moreover, these are not non-ideological wars, as Gettleman claims. The jihadis in Mali and Somalia, the separatists in Casamance, and the rebels in Darfur are certainly fighting for a cause.
To be sure, no one in their or their right mind could claim that warfare or political violence has ended in Africa. Many countries in the region have features that political scientists believe make countries vulnerable to armed conflict: weak states, high dependence on natural resources, and horizontal inequalities. Of the recent armed conflicts in Somalia, Sudan, Mali, the Central African Republic, Chad, and eastern Congo, one obvious commonality is the lack of effective state control. Rebels survive in remote regions where state authority is tenuous. The fact of weak states in these and other countries will not end any time soon.
Moreover, other forms of violence deserve greater scrutiny. Consider, for example, electoral violence. As African states have turned to multiparty elections, so too has the risk of violence during those electoral campaigns increased. Electoral violence on the scale of Kenya in 2007 and 2008, Côte d'Ivoire in 2010, or Zimbabwe in 2008 is not the norm, but in many locations there is often some form of violence between incumbent and opposition forces. Yet we know substantially less about patterns and causes of electoral violence.
Consider too violence over vital resources, such as land, water, and pasture. Trends are harder to detect, but one new data collection effort from the University of Texas shows an increase in such violence events since the early 1990s. With climate change, rapidly growing urbanisation, and other changes that increase the pressure on vital but often scarce resources, we can expect more violence of the type recently seen in northern Kenya. Yet again, we know much less about this form of violence.
What explains the recent decline in warfare across Africa? I don't know for certain, but would point to geo-political changes since the end of the cold war.
First, the end of the cold war meant that the opportunities for rebels to receive substantial weaponry and training from big external states declined. To be sure, states across Africa still meddle in the affairs of their neighbors, but insurgent funding from neighbouring states is usually enough to be a nuisance to, but not actually overthrow, existing governments.
Second, the rise of multi-party politics has sapped the anti-government funding, energy, and talent away from the bush and into the domestic political arena.
Third, China is a rising external force in sub-Saharan Africa. China's goals are mainly economic, but their foreign relations follow a principle of non-interference. To my knowledge, China supports states, not insurgencies.
Finally, conflict reduction mechanisms, in particular international peacekeeping and regional diplomacy, have substantially increased on the continent. Peacekeeping is more prevalent and especially more robust than in the 1990s. Regional bodies such as the African Union, Eccowas, Eccas, IGAD, and SADC are quite active in most conflict situations. They have exhibited greater resolves in conflicts as diverse as Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Madagascar.
The four posited mechanisms are hypotheses, each of which deserves greater scrutiny and empirical testing. But taken together, they suggest plausible ways in which the incentives of insurgents and even state leaders to fight have been altered in recent years. They give reason to expect that while war is clearly not over in sub-Saharan Africa, we should continue to observe a decline in its frequency and intensity in coming decades.

“It will become clear, and may as well be stated at the outset, that this is written by a political opponent of Henry Kissinger. Nonetheless, I have found myself continually amazed at how much hostile and discreditable material I have felt compelled to omit. I am concerned only with those Kissingerian offenses that might or should form the basis of a legal prosecution: for war crimes, for crimes against humanity, and for offenses against common or customary or international law, including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnap, and torture.”
The Case Against Henry Kissinger:
The making of a war criminal
Christopher Hitchens
Harpers, March 2001
Where does Larry Summer get off giving Americans advice on how to fix the continuing housing crisis? And where does this political opportunist find the unmitigated gall to instruct us not to “finger point” and thereby identify culprits in Washington who helped enable the housing mess? Like advising the White House to ignore the fact of a collapsing credit market for jumbo and high SATO loans for the past several years?
As a general rule I like to follow the sage advice of Roger Kubarych, formerly of the Fed of New York and then Wall Street, but now working in the public sector, in 2008 during the depths of the crisis. “I have nothing bad to say about anybody,” they quipped during a discussion about how and when the FRBNY senior staff were first apprised on the problems at Bear, Stearns & Co. Good advice in these dark times.
But former Harvard University head Larry Summers is a special case and one that rises to almost Kissingerian dimensions, to borrow from Christopher Hitchens. In “Rational Irrationality” in The New Yorker last May, John Cassidy compared Summers to Henry Kissinger, an apt appraisal which begs the question: Is Larry Summers an Economic War Criminal?
Not only did Summers work tirelessly during their years in the Clinton Administration to undermine regulatory and prudential controls in our financial markets, but they joined Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and their political sponsor, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and public paragon Arthur Levitt, in smearing CFTC Chairman Brooksley Born so as to make the world safe for OTC derivatives.
“The moratorium was a huge victory for Wall Street,” Robert Stowe England writes in their new book, Black Box Casino. “And a big win for Rubin, Summers and Greenspan,” though they rightly note that Levitt later expressed regrets over their actions. But not Larry Summers, a man for whom ideology has never gotten in the way of the practical necessities at a given moment in time. They roll in their own mess, in political terms you understand, and then expects us to believe that it smells so very sweet. The latest case in point is seen as Summer prescribes solutions to the housing crisis.
In their book Reckless Endangerment, Gretchen Morgenson and Josh Rosner describe in vivid detail how Larry Summers, Robert Zoellick and others bullied critics and won and influenced friends for Fannie Mae, one of the key Washington agencies that helped lead to the subprime debt crisis. Ed Demarco, now head of the agency that supervises Fannie and Freddie Mac, wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that the housing GSEs be privatized. But Summers bullied Demarco and other staffers, eventually forcing them to rewrite the entire document. The cost to the taxpayer of Summers' intervention regarding the housing agencies is over $150 billion and climbing. And this number will climb dramatically after the 2012 election.
But perhaps one of the biggest indictments of Summers when it comes to their contribution or lack thereof to economic public policy is also their last, namely the advice to President Obama to do nothing about either the top-four zombie banks or the housing GSEs. By allowing the GSEs and the cartel they form with the largest four banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America – in the secondary market for home loans to deny millions of middle to lower income borrowers the opportunity to refinance, Summers has cost millions of Americans livelihood and security. I wrote about this issue in “Are the low US home mortgage rates for real?”
Summers deserves the censure of all Americans for their hideously bad advice to President Barack Obama regarding the housing crisis. First Summers told Obama not to restructure the largest zombie banks, the very same institutions that today deny millions of Americans their contractual right to refinance their mortgages.
Cassidy quotes Summers on Obama's view of the big banks last year prior to their flight from the White House: “In the same spirit that the president did not want to take ownership of the banks, they have a healthy skepticism about schemes involving large government action and an awareness of the possibilities of unintended consequences.”
Second, Summers told the POTUS that there was no need to address the fact that tens of millions of American households are underwater on their mortgages. As Laurie Goodman of Amherst Securities has noted, there is a cost to doing nothing. For Summers now to offer us advice on the mess they helped to create is quite outrageous.
“This guy and their crew from Harvard have fought me on this for the last three years when it comes to dealing with the home refinance issue,” notes one banking industry official who has argued for a government response to refinancing. “When we finally get the Obama administration to change their mind on dealing with underwater mortgages, Summers pops up pretending to lead the parade.”
Bottom line is that Larry Summers has nothing to say about the housing crisis. Their role in creating the catastrophe and pandering to the worst tendencies on Wall Street should rule them out of any attempt to fashion policy or a coherent history going forward. And for the media especially, you need to commit Morgenson & Rosner to memory as a lesson in the ways and means of Washington and people like Larry Summers.

The inaugural World Relays take place Saturday and Sunday in the Bahamas. Competitors from across the global will compete for baton-based supremacy in the 4 x 100, 4 x 200, 4 x 400, 4 x 800 and 4 x 1500-meter relays. There will be no Usain Bolt, David Rudisha or Allyson Felix. But there will be plenty of national records, a Jamaican 4 x 800 team and a Kenyan 4 x 200 squad. It may not exist after this year, so let's give this meet a proper preview. Men's events today, women's tomorrow.
4 x 100
Favorites: Jamaica, United States
The United States won't have Justin Gatlin at their disposal.  They are busy racing and setting world leads on the other side of the globe. Even without Gatlin (or Tyson Gay or Ryan Bailey), the United States can still contend with Jamaica. Marvin Bracy won silver at the 60 indoors, Charles Silmon has world championship experience and Mike Rodgers and Trell Kimmons still can pump out a quality 100 meters
I guess the 90 minute flight from Kingston, Jamaica to Nassau, Bahamas was too far for Usain Bolt. A Bolt debut certainly would have given this meet a bump. Alas, they will just have to settle for opening their season with a ginormous appearance fee at a European meet. Theirs loss.
Bolt's absence makes the Jamaican team vulnerable. Yohan Blake will anchor the squad, but after them there isn't much firepower. Nesta Carter has looked sluggish this year and Michael Frater is 31-years-old. The strongest Jamaican runner behind Blake might actually be little-known Andrew Fisher who beat Carter at the Jamaica Invitational.
Records: Nope, they actually run this race more than once every five years.
Fun fact(s):-Team GB's squad tried to recreate the plot to Fast Girls in lead up to this meet. According to the British newspaper, The Telegraph, members of Steve Fudge's training group, which includes Adam Gemili and James Dasaolu, and Rana Reider's group, featuring James Ellington, Richard Kilty and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, aren't fond of one another. The feud resulted in Ellington putting Dasaolu in a headlock at a meet in February. The 4 x 100 line-up for this meet doesn't include any members of Fudge's group.
-St. Kittts and Nevis still isn't using Kim Collins on their national team. If they are going to stay mad at them for sleeping outside the Olympic village can they at least transfer their citizenship to a country that will use him?
–Yoshihide Kiryu is slated to race for Japan. Later this summer they could become the first Asian man to break 10 seconds in the 100.
-Darrel Brown might make an appearance for Trinidad and Tobago. The former phenom is still only 29, but ran their fastest time in the 100 nine years ago.
4 x 200
Favorites: Jamaica, United States
Warren Weir and Nickel Ashmeade make Jamaica a pretty strong favorite. The US team, with Walter Dix and Wallace Spearmon, was built for 2008, not for 2014. Their fastest leg should come from Curtis Mitchell who won the World Championships bronze medal in the 200 last year. The biggest intrigue in this race might come from watching who forgets where the exchange zone begins and ends.
Records: The time to beat is 1:18.68, or roughly 19.65 per runner. That seems pretty quick even with three of the legs getting a running start. Will the top teams attempt open handoffs like a 4 x 400, or go blind and maximize speed and risk?
Fun Fact(s): -Kenya is entered and their team is led by Pitt standout Carvin Nkanata. Somehow, Nkanata can run this meet the week before NCAA Regionals, but Bolt, Gatlin and the others can't seem to squeeze it in? Track and field, you always figure out new ways to confuse me.
-Only six of the 15 teams entered have a national record listed. There may not be a world record broken in this event, but be prepared for an endless string of NRs.
4 x 400
Favorites: United States, Bahamas
With Lashawn Merritt, Tony McQuay and Christian Taylor the United States should have enough to stave off a Bahamian team running in front of their home crowd. If you remember, the Bahamas beat the United States to win gold in London in 2012. Their team has all the familar names, Demetrius Pinder, Michael Mathieu and Chris Brown. These two countries faced off earlier this season at the Penn Relays and were heading for a close finish before American anchor Manteo Mitchell mistakenly grabbed the wrong baton and gave the race to the Bahamas.
Fun Fact(s): -Belgium is trotting out not one, not two, but three Borlees. Dylan Borlee will join twins Kevin and Jonathan on a team that could factor in for a medal.
-It's not just the experience stars that are skipping this meet, Jamaican Javon Francis is not listed on the Jamaican roster, effectively eliminating any chance for Jamaica to contend with the leaders.
-The 4 x 400 should always be the last event in a track meet. The IAAF switched the order a few years ago in order to let Bolt and the 4 x 100s end the meet. Sadly, that schedule has stayed in place even when Bolt is absent. If they aren't going to change this for the World Relays, I have little faith that the 4 x 400 will ever close out the Olympics or World Championships again.
4 x 800
Favorites: Kenya, United States
Records: The American record is 7:02.82, while the world record stands at 7:02.43. This works out to about 1:45.5 per runner. If the weather cooperates, the United States is certainly capable of average that time. Duane Solomon was in 1:43 shape last month, who knows how fast they can run now. Robby Andrews, David Torrence and Brandon Johnson all have run faster than 1:45.5 before in their careers. Doing it all on the same day in the same race will be the true challenge.
If the miss the record, the United States still might have a shot at the win. Kenya is Rudisha-less and none of the other entrants jump off the page. Poland could factor in with Marcin Lewandowski and Adam Kszczot.
Fun Fact(s): -Australia is using two collegians, Sam McEntee and Jordan Williamsz. Best spring break ever!
4 x 1500
Favorite: Kenya
This Kenyan group is the one true all-star team in the entire meet. In essence, this is probably what the organizers envisioned when they sketched out plans for this competition. That, and a free trip to the Bahamas. All of Kenya's best are running including Asbel Kiprop, Silas Kiplagat and Nixon Chepseba. If they run hard from the gun they shouldn't have any competition.
Ethiopia is bringing Aman Wote and Mekonnen Gebremedhin making them a slight favorite for the silver over the United States. The American squad is headlined by Leo Manzano and Will Leer. David Torrence and Robby Andrews are also listed, but they are also in the pool for the 4 x 800. This race looks like a Kenyan time trial up front with 3-4 teams fighting over silver.
Records: The world record is 14:36.23….let's do more division…….3:39 per 1,500 meters. The American record is 14:46.3. Seems doable until lap 11 when the wind picks up and everyone is 30 meters apart.
Fun Fact(s): -Noted EPO savant Rashid Ramzi is entered for Bahrain.
-800-meter runners Marcin Lewandowski and Adam Kszczot will run for Poland. Over-distance training, or punishment if they don't run well in the 4 x 800 the day before?
-Prize money goes eight deep in the World Relays. There are only eight teams entered in this event, which means that by finishing every team is guaranteed at least $4,000. More on this tomorrow in our women's preview where only 5 teams are listed for the 4 x 1500. Free money.
We're very pleased to announce the release of the PostSharp Domain Toolkit – the first tool to treat the implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged seriously and finally end change notifications pain for WPF developers!
Let's start from the beginning...
The Problem
When you work with WPF using patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) or, in fact, any kind of data binding to your domain classes, in most cases you need to implement property values change notifications for your mutable objects. The .NET framework provides you with INotifyPropertyChanged interface but sadly leaves you the burden of implementing it. If you try to manually implement the interface, you'll end up with classes which look like this:
public class Customer : INotifyPropertyChanged { private string firstName; public string FirstName { get { return firstName; } set { firstName = value; OnPropertyChanged("FirstName"); OnPropertyChanged("FullName"); } } private string lastName; public string LastName { get { return lastName; } set { lastName = value; OnPropertyChanged("LastName"); OnPropertyChanged("FullName"); } } public string FullName { get { return string.Concat(firstName, " ", lastName); } } public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged; protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName) { PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged; if (handler != null) { handler(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } } }
There are at least two problems here. First, notice the amount of boilerplate code in the solution. Instead of using simple automatic properties (one line of code), you need to create regular field-backed properties with OnPropertyChanged calls in each of them. Each property must also be aware of all other properties depending on its value (and we're still ignoring any inter-object dependencies).
What's worse, the code is now riddled with string literals. Just a minor typo is enough for the notifications to silently fail (with no build-time error and no runtime exception). Refactoring also becomes much harder – whenever you change the name of the property, you need to change the literal as well. Some refactoring tools might help here, but once you have several classes with the same property name (and you are going to have Name and Description properties on multiple classes) you can't fully trust them anymore.
If writing all this boilerplate code seems tiresome to you, think about tedium involved in debugging all the subtle problems that are so easily introduced by making a single typo or forgetting about a single dependency. Oh, the humanity!
Existing (Non-)Solutions
The problem is obviously not new and there are several libraries attempting to tackle it. Some of them would require you to create proxies or wrapper classes around your objects, introducing another layer of indirection and code complexity. Others simply make your boilerplate code less error-prone. In C# 5 (or using ActiveSharp in pre .NET 4.5 environment; see here and here for details) writing basic properties can be simplified to repeating a pattern similar to this one:
private int foo; public int Foo { get { return foo; } set { SetValue(ref foo, value); } }
The more advanced solutions use IL weaving to automatically introduce property change notifications without actually requiring you to write any dedicated code. They can also handle basic properties dependencies supporting usage scenarios such as the one in this code snippet:
public class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged { public string GivenNames { get; set; } public string FamilyName { get; set; } public string FullName { get { return string.Format("{0} {1}", GivenNames, FamilyName); } } //... }
Real Life
As usual, limitations and problems become obvious when you start using those solutions in real life. While they may handle the easy scenarios easily, it turns out that what you actually want to write in your code is not always that simple.
First, you may have various reasons to set field values directly and not via property setters. You may not even have properties for some of the fields at all:
private string firstName; private string lastName; public string Name { get { return string.Concat(firstName, " ", lastName); } }
The problem here is that none of the previously available solutions are able to automatically react to field values changes.
Second, when creating MVVM applications you will often want to have properties depending on values of child objects' properties:
private Customer customer; public string CustomerName { get { return string.Concat(this.customer.FirstName, " ", this.customer.LastName); } }
How do you raise change notifications for the CustomerName property in this case?
You could try listening to NotifyPropertyChanged events of the Customer object, but you would have to manually write code to properly add and remove the necessary event handlers. Imagine how complicated and error-prone it would get with multi-level dependencies:
public string CustomerCity { get { return this.customer.Address.City; } }
Enter PostSharp Domain Toolkit.
PostSharp Domain Toolkit
Having personally experienced all the above pain points, and having at our disposal all the power of PostSharp, we decided to finally tackle the problem of property change notifications for (nearly) all standard business cases.
While simple PostSharp-based INotifyPropertyChanged implementations have long been available (see, for example, here), we decided to take the problem more seriously and made sure we concentrated on useful cases rather than just the easy ones.
The Domain Toolkit properly supports all of the above cases while also providing API and customization points for even more sophisticated scenarios. It automatically handles the following:
automatic and field-backed properties;
complex properties directly or indirectly depending on fields and other properties of the same class;
complex properties depending on methods within the same class (as long as they do not depend on methods in other classes);
complex properties depending on properties of child objects providing change notifications (automatically in case of simple property chains, basing on explicit declaration of dependencies in case of arbitrarily complex code).
To better understand the power of PostSharp Domain Toolkit simply have a look at the code below:
[NotifyPropertyChanged] class CustomerViewModel { private Customer customer; public CustomerViewModel(Customer customer) { this.customer = customer; } public string FirstName { get { return this.customer.FirstName; } set { this.customer.FirstName = value; } } public string LastName { get { return this.customer.LastName; } set { this.customer.LastName = value; } } public Address Address { get { return this.customer.Address; } } public string FullName { get { return this.customer.FullName; } } public string BusinessCard { get { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); stringBuilder.Append(this.FirstName); stringBuilder.Append(" "); stringBuilder.Append(this.LastName); stringBuilder.AppendLine(); stringBuilder.AppendLine(this.customer.Address.Line1); string line2 = this.customer.Address.Line2; if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line2)) { stringBuilder.AppendLine(line2); } stringBuilder.Append(this.customer.Address.PostalCode); stringBuilder.Append(' '); stringBuilder.Append(this.customer.Address.Town); return stringBuilder.ToString(); } } } [NotifyPropertyChanged] class Customer { private string lastName; private Address address; public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get { return lastName; } set { lastName = value; } } public Address Address { get { return address; } set { address = value; } } public string FullName { get { return string.Join( " ", this.FirstName, this.LastName ); } } public void Reset() { this.FirstName = null; this.lastName = null; this.address = null; } }
Yes, all the properties in the above classes are going to automatically raise change notifications, thanks to just the single NotifyPropertyChangedAttribute per class!
And that's not all, our toolkit is the first framework that realizes you may not always want to raise change notification immediately after property value change. Consider this snippet:
public class Account { public decimal Balance { get; private set; } public DateTime LastOperationTime { get; private set; } public int RemainingDailyOperationsLimit { get; private set; } //... public void Withdraw(decimal amount) { //... all kinds of checks ... this.LastOperationTime = DateTime.UtcNow; this.RemainingDailyOperationsLimit--; this.Balance -= amount; } //... }
In all the solutions considered so far, this snippet would raise notification after each single property change, which means that at the time the first 2 of 3 events have been raised, the Account object would be in an inconsistent state, some property values would have already been modified and some not.
In this case your change notification listener would see an object in which the last operation time is already updated, but the account balance is lagging behind. This may not be a serious issue if all you need the notifications for is a simple case of displaying the values on-screen. It does get serious, however, as soon as any kind of business (or even more advanced presentation) code starts to react to the events.
The only consistent solution here is to raise all the events at the end of the method only. And that is exactly what our framework does. It intelligently identifies when execution flows back from an object to its caller, and only then, when the object state should again be consistent, raises all pending change notifications. All this, so there is nothing for you to worry about.
Summary
The automatic property change notifications mechanism in the new PostSharp Domain Toolkit automatically handles all standard business cases and generates exactly the right notifications, at exactly the right time.
Just like the other PostSharp Toolkits, the new Domain Toolkit frees you from spending precious time on infrastructural issues and keeps you focused on business logic.
As always, you can trust our solution not to misbehave or fail silently. If we encounter any code construct we can't properly handle automatically, we'll notify you about it by emitting an error at compile time. You'll then have a chance to use an additional attribute to help the Toolkit identify the property or method dependencies. Or, if you prefer, you can take even more control by using our public API to deal with your corner cases. But that's a topic for another blog post and honestly we don't expect you to need that possibility often (if ever).
More posts on Postsharp Domain Toolkit coming soon. In the meantime, you can have a look at the source of the PostSharp Domain Toolkit on github or, even better, install the nuget package and immediately start using the new framework (sample code above should be more than enough to get you started).
Happy PostSharping!

TouchArcade Rating:
Catan Universe is a new digital version of the extremely popular board game, and it's about to make its way onto mobile devices November 15th. Catan Universe is already on PC and Mac, and once it hit mobile, it will allow for cross-platform play. Rivals of Catan, the two-player mobile standalone version, was one of the casualties of iOS 11, so if you want any Catan, you'll have to wait for Catan Universe (and possible Catan-The Duel, currently under development). Catan Universe will be free to download and will come with Rivals of Catan, and if you want more content, you can buy it as an IAP, which I believe is a great monetization system.
Catan Universe includes Cities and Knights, Seafarers, the Vikings set, and a lot more content will be coming to the game in the near future. And keep in mind that if you had bought the old Catan app on Android or iOS and have registered your account, you'll be able to activate most of the Catan Universe content for free. If you like Catan, this will probably be a great way to play the game on your mobile device so long as they get the UI and everything else right.
Get ready Charleston. A Cat Cafe is Pouncing into Downtown this Summer!
The South is finally getting its own cat cafe! Pounce Cat Cafe + Wine Bar will be a place where you come to enjoy freshly brewed coffee or tea, sip on wine or local beer, indulge in delicious pastries, and cuddle with adorable (and adoptable!) cats and kittens.
What Is A Cat Cafe?
Long story short, a cat cafe is a place where you can hang out with adoptable cats, sip on your favorite beverage, and snack on some yummy goodies. The best part? If at the end of your visit you've fallen in love with your new feline friend, you can take them home with you!
In many communities across the country, there are too many cats either in shelters or on the streets and not enough space, resources, or people to help get them into their furrever homes. This is where cat cafes come in!
Cat cafes are great not only for the humans who get to enjoy their coffee with a furry friend, but they're great for cats in need AND the community as well!
Cat cafes act as foster homes for local shelters, which frees up space in the shelter to care for more animals in need.
which frees up space in the shelter to care for more animals in need. Cat cafes get cats out of cages, socialized and played with, and into their loving furrever homes.
and Cat cafes are great places for people who cannot have pets in their apartments or dorms (we see you, college kids!) but still need some fuzzy therapy now and again. (Did we also mention you don't have to scoop a litter box? Yeah.)
A Cat Cafe in Charleston
Charleston, SC is a city known for its beautiful beaches, friendly people, and amazing food. Over the past ten years, Charleston has become an internationally recognized tourist destination, and in 2012, Conde Nast Traveler Readers ranked Charleston as the #1 tourist destination in the entire world. On top of being on the global list of cities to visit, Charleston has also been ranked as the #1 city in the U.S. for four years in a row. (We get it, we're awesome.) As Charleston continues to grow and thrive, the cat cafe will add to the Charleston community by:
1. Partnering with Charleston's largest shelter, Charleston Animal Society (CAS). This shelter saves the lives of thousands of animals a year, and since Pounce will be fostering between 15 and 20 cats and kittens from CAS at any given point, CAS will be able to focus their attention towards animals who are in dire need of care (i.e. Caitlyn the Pitbull).
2. Supporting small businesses by partnering with local breweries and coffee roasters. All of the coffee, tea, pastries, and beer served at Pounce will be provided by other small and local businesses in the Charleston area.
3. Giving back to the Charleston community through various fundraisers and events. Pounce will host monthly fundraising events (think Mew-vie Nights, Puppy Takeovers, Cat People Speed Dating, Yoga with Cats, etc.) and will donate a portion of all ticket sales to benefit local charities and animal shelters.
About The Founders
Our names are Ashley Brooks and Annaliese Hughes, and we are the self-described crazy cat ladies behind Pounce Cat Cafe + Wine Bar. You might be asking yourself, "Crazy cat ladies? But...where is the grey hair? Where are the bathrobe pockets filled with kitty kibble?!"
Well my friend, a "crazy cat lady" doesn't have to be a stigma anymore. In fact, you (yes, you!) could be a crazy cat lady too! To us, a "crazy cat lady" is a person of ANY gender who loves: cat puns, cat videos, funny cat shirts, wearing cat ears for fun, cat jokes, cat cartoons, or, you know, the adorable fluffy cats themselves. So, we extend a formal invitation to join the ranks of the proud "crazy cat ladies" everywhere and to help us make Charleston even more cat lady friendly.
It started early...
Like many best friends, we met our first-year student year of college while living in the same dorm. Even though we lived across the hall from each other and saw each other every day, we didn't break the ice until 6 months later when we started talking about the one thing that brings us all here today: CATS. Long story short, we've been insepurrrrable ever since.
In the years that have followed, we've seen 5 major/minor study changes, 4 ex-boyfriends, 3 big moves, 2 people becoming BEST friends, and 1 cat snuck into our dorm room (spoiler alert: huge mistake). Throughout college, our running joke was that we should just drop out and start our own cat cafe, and while we never ended up dropping out (you're welcome, mom and dad), we are finally starting our own cat cafe!
Cats are love. Cats are life.
With our combined passions and experiences, we make the purrrrfect team to open Charleston's first cat cafe! Ashley comes to Pounce with extensive knowledge of cat health and behavior, impressive design and marketing skills, and 8 months of experience working in a cat cafe. Annaliese brings 5+ years of customer service experience, formal training in Charleston's hospitality and tourism industry, and a background in bookkeeping and accounting. We know we are the best people to make this cafe happen, and we are willing to do whatever it takes to make Pounce a reality!
Rewards
For every donation, you will literally become part of the cafe! We are offering every backer a spot on our “Thank Mew” wall to show you our undying catitude for supporting us. We really want this cafe to be just as much yours as it is ours.
Other rewards include logo stickers, VIP invites to open weekend, pre-paid reservations to the cafe, a gift box full of cat swag, and an unlimited access membership to the cafe for a whole year! (No - we're not kitten mew!)
Reward Add-Ons
These rewards are unlocked after you pledge any amount (even as low as $1!). Add any of these items to your pledge to put a little extra cat swag in your life.
How We'll Use the Funds
Every dollar we raise will go towards making Pounce the absolute best cat cafe it can possibly be!
Our Progress and Timeline
So, where are we in the process? At this point, we've gotten our food and beverage model approved by the SC Department of Health, we have officially partnered with Charleston Animal Society, and we're now in the process of finding our furrrrever location! We are planning on opening in downtown Charleston in early August, and we would love all the support we can to help make this cat cafe the best it can possibly be.
Republicans have a huge opportunity to gain seats in the Senate in 2018. They just need to find the candidates.
Rep. Ann Wagner's decision not to challenge Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, a matchup Missouri political observers had anticipated for years, is the latest in a string of thanks-but-no-thanks moves from candidates Washington Republicans thought were locks to run for Senate next year. It's an unwelcome sign for the GOP despite staring down a tantalizing Senate map, with 10 Democrats up for reelection in states President Donald Trump carried last year and an opportunity to win eight states and a filibuster-proof majority.
Story Continued Below
First there was Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who jumped from the House to Trump's Cabinet instead of running in Montana as expected. Republicans thought they had a replacement to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in state Attorney General Tim Fox — until Fox surprisingly counted themselves out. In Wisconsin, GOP Rep. Sean Duffy went on a statewide tour early in 2017 before deciding they wouldn't challenge Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
Democrats say the situation is clear: Republicans are afraid of a political environment poisoned by an unpredictable president and a widely disliked GOP health care plan.
“They have an unpopular president and they are pushing unpopular policies, which makes for difficulty recruiting,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). “The map is favorable for the GOP, but they are trying to sell the public something it really doesn't want, and the public is rejecting it.”
But the red-tinged Senate map means there are few races where Republicans believe they need a single exceptional, heaven-and-earth-moving recruit to win in 2018. And some GOP strategists say there's plenty of time to get things set up for next year's Senate elections, citing National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner's decision to begin their 2014 Colorado Senate run in February of that year.

“All of the hand-wringing and consternation about recruiting is largely manufactured,” said Kevin McLaughlin, a former deputy executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “I can't think of a reason right now, like literally any, for someone to get in at this stage.”
Yet top Republican strategists privately admit they are intensely focused on two people: Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, as an alternative challenger to McCaskill whom many Republicans now insist they prefer, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who could self-fund an expensive campaign against Sen. Bill Nelson. If those two men pass, Republicans concede their 2018 recruiting class could quickly go from solid to disappointing.
Here's the current state of play in nine top Senate races Republicans want to flip in 2018:
FLORIDA (Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson)
Like Missouri, the GOP recruiting efforts here are focused on one man: Gov. Rick Scott. Scott is seen as the only Republican with the name identification and fundraising prowess (or, really, self-funding prowess — Scott is a billionaire) to compete in the nation's largest swing state. If Scott passes, the GOP could turn to Rep. Francis Rooney, a wealthy former ambassador, or Rep. Ron DeSantis. For their part, Scott has told national Republicans he'll make a decision on their own timeline, which, Scott has suggested, will stretch into next year. Read more →
INDIANA (Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly)
GOP Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita are very similar members of Congress, and that similarity is breeding contempt. Neither has officially declared a Senate campaign, but the two have already begun attacking each other. Messer has assembled an impressive fundraising apparatus highlighted by Greg Pence, the vice president's brother. But Rokita has already won statewide, having served two terms as secretary of state. Even with Messer and Rokita in, some Republican strategists still pine for Rep. Susan Brooks, who said "no" earlier this year. Other strategists see room for a third candidate, perhaps Attorney General Curtis Hill or an outsider-style business person. Read more →
MISSOURI (Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill)
Wagner's shock decision to pass — they had hired a campaign manager and lined up a communications director for a Senate run — has put all eyes on Hawley, the state's 37-year-old attorney general, who was elected last year. Republican elders and donors in the state have been pushing Hawley to run for months, arguing they had outside credentials Wagner lacked. But Hawley has ducked direct questions on the Senate, and Democrats are already prepared to attack them as an overambitious young man on the make. Rep. Vicky Hartzler also announced they were still considering a bid. Read more →
MONTANA (Democratic Sen. Jon Tester)
First, Zinke took a job as Trump's interior secretary rather than challenge Tester. Then, Fox decided not to run, eyeing a 2020 gubernatorial bid that looked like a better option after Rep. Greg Gianforte, who had been expected to run for governor again in three years, assaulted a reporter. There are already three Republican candidates in the race, but national Republicans are now eyeing state Treasurer Matt Rosendale as a possible standard bearer. Read more →
NORTH DAKOTA (Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp)
Republicans still don't have a candidate in this Trump-friendly state, and Trump failed to lure Heitkamp into their administration to open the seat. National Republicans are lukewarm on Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Trump-like lawmaker — unscripted or out of control, depending on your perspective — who made national news earlier this year for criticizing female Democrats' clothes. State Sen. Tom Campbell could run for either the Senate or Cramer's seat, but Cramer is keeping everyone guessing and said in an interview that jumping in early “may even harm me” politically. “I don't feel an urgency to get in,” Cramer said. “Getting in the race in September or October or November handicaps me the same as if I got in it in May.” Read more →
OHIO (Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown)
Treasurer Josh Mandel came within 5 percentage points of beating Brown in 2012. But not all Republicans wanted to see a rematch between vocal Trump supporter Mandel and Brown, though that's what they are likely going to get. The more centrist Rep. Pat Tiberi bowed out this spring and cleared the path for Mandel, who has now accrued endorsements from the likes of GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida. Investment banker Michael Gibbons, a longtime Republican donor, has also jumped into the contest and is looking to offer a political-outsider contrast to Mandel. Read more →

PENNSYLVANIA (Democratic Sen. Bob Casey)
GOP Rep. Pat Meehan has long been tipped for statewide office, but they took a pass on challenging Casey, who has become an increasingly strident liberal during the Trump era. Meehan is battle-tested and easily won reelection in a Hillary Clinton district after bailing on Trump late last year and voting for Mike Pence. Reps. Mike Kelly or Lou Barletta, both early Trump backers, could change the race by getting in, though a national Democratic official said they are “tainted by the House health care vote.” If they don't run, the national GOP may have to let the crowded primary sort itself out. The field lacks a front-runner and is a mix of people like business person Jeff Bartos and state Reps. Jim Christiana or Rick Saccone. Read more →
WEST VIRGINIA (Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin)
GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins, a former Democrat, is disciplined and has battleground-race experience. But Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is considering running a GOP primary campaign to Jenkins' right. Republicans don't want a messy fight, but one might already be underway, with negative stories surfacing about Morrisey's wife and Jenkins warning Morrisey not to run. Trump didn't help the GOP cause by courting Manchin for their Cabinet — but not selecting him. Manchin is the last Democrat left in the state's congressional delegation as it has swung right. Read more →
WISCONSIN (Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin)
Rep. Sean Duffy bowed out early, and Republicans haven't had a clear candidate to take on Baldwin since. Nicole Schneider, a former social worker who also happened to be the heiress to a major trucking company, attracted the attention of the NRSC due to their ability to self-fund, but she's also decided not to run. Businessman and Iraq War veteran Kevin Nicholson has an attractive résumé, though they were a past president of the College Democrats of America. Businessman Eric Hovde, who finished second in the 2012 GOP primary, is still considering a bid, as is state Sen. Leah Vukmir. Read more →

Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz are getting back up on the debate stage this year to argue about the future of Obama's Affordable Care Act, Politico reports.
CNN announced Wednesday that it has secured a primetime spot for the event, which will air next Tuesday night. CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate, and audience members will also be encouraged to ask questions, town hall-style.
The 2016 presidential contenders never got a chance to face off during the election, but seem to have a lot of things to argue about in terms of their parties' opposing views on healthcare. Texas senator Ted Cruz will likely be asked about the plan congressional Republicans want to replace Obama's act with, and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will probably argue that the repeal could affect millions of people on Medicaid and Medicare, as they did with a giant poster of Trump's tweet on the Senate floor recently.
Entertainment factor aside, the debate could provide some useful information and talking points for people who are still thoroughly confused about Obamacare before Congress votes on it. According to a recent Kaiser Family Poll, 75 percent of Americans either want Congress to leave Obamacare as is, or repeal it only when there is a suitable replacement. As of now, the repeal is expected to leave 20 million people without healthcare.
The event will air Tuesday, February 7, at 9 PM EST on CNN, and will probably be a better watch than that time another failed presidential candidate decided to throw down on TV.

Photographer Tamara Abdul Hadi captures grooming rituals throughout the Middle East, documenting burgeoning trends driven by creative barbers and hair artists.
Hadi's latest series, The People's Salon, is an appreciation of personal style and self-expression. And though the photographer—who is a founding member of the RAWIYA collective, a co-operative of female photographers in the Middle East—is based primarily in Beirut, Lebanon, they also traveled to barbershops all over the Middle East to take these photos.
In Beirut, they went to Salon Al Raqui, which roughly translates to "Elegant Salon." The owner is Abdel Atheem, who specializes in a beard trim and black-dye combination. He's originally from Raqqa, Syria, and is displaced in Beirut.

They also shot Tamer Shehadeh, whose career as a hair artist also has its roots in the refugee crisis. The salon they own, Salon Tamer in Ramallah, Palestine, began as a small shop in the Qalandia refugee camp and has grown into a much larger shop on a main street in the city. Their specialties include facial treatments, gold masks, and waxes. They long to expand Palestinian hairdressing worldwide.
Another subject Hadi photographed was Mohamad Bakir, who lives in the city of Gaza and runs Salon Rimal. Bakir inherited their barbershop from their father. Today, Salon Rimal grooms most of the city's football players. Bakir also released a historical encyclopedia of hairdressing in Gaza in 2016.
Hadi gave VICE a first look at their new series, and it's full of tender portraits of masculinity and personal grooming. Check out more shots below:

Microsoft security guru Robert Hensing hit a home run their first time at bat with their very first blog post. In it, they advocate that passwords, as we traditionally think of them, should not be used:
So here's the deal - I don't want you to use passwords, I want you to use pass-PHRASES. What is a pass-phrase you ask? Let's take a look at some of my recent pass-phrases that I've used inside Microsoft for my 'password'. "If we weren't all crazy we would go insane" (Jimmy Buffett rules)*
"Send the pain below!"
"Mean people suck!" So why are these pass-phrases so great? They meet all password complexity requirements due to the use of upper / lowercase letters and punctuation (you don't HAVE to use numbers to meet password complexity requirements) They are so freaking easy for me to remember it's not even funny. For me, I find it MUCH easier to remember a sentence from a favorite song or a funny quote than to remember 'xYaQxrz!' (which b.t.w. is long enough and complex enough to meet our internal complexity requirements, but is weak enough to not survive any kind of brute-force password grinding attack with say LC5, let alone a lookup table attack). That password would not survive sustained attack with LC5 long enough to matter so in my mind it's pointless to use a password like that. You may as well just leave your password blank. I dare say that even with the most advanced hardware you are not going to guesss, crack, brute-force or pre-compute these passwords in the 70 days or so that they were around (remember you only need the password to survive attack long enough for you to change the password).
Windows 2k and higher support passwords of up to 127 unicode characters. So this will work on virtually every Windows network in existence. Reggie Burnett, however, has some doubts:
The reason I think that Robert's logic is a bit flawed is that a pass phrase is likely to contain readable words (else it really isn't a pass phrase) and therefore can be attacked not at the letter level but at the word level. According to various sites I visited, the average English speaker knows about 20,000 words but uses only about 2,000 of those in a given week. Since the user is likely to use words they are used to, we can safely say that most pass phrases will contain one of about 5,000 words. And, if a pass phrase contains 4 words, then our possibilities are 5000^4. I'll spare you the math, but you'll see that the cracker that is trying pass phrases has alot fewer possibilities to try. Now, of course, using more words will increase the security, but we should also note that since the attack is at the word level, the length of the word would not matter. "Mean people suck" would be just as secure as "Extremely important password". They are both 3 words and both use common words.
While I see their point, he's completely ignoring the capitalization and punctuation in "Mean people suck!". I do agree that for the best security, your passphrase should include capitalization, punctuation, and possibly even numbers if you can work them in there in a logical way. Andy Johns elaborates:
As I've often mentioned, I'm a consultant and I see a lot of crap out in the wild. By far the most annoying crap I see is around passwords. The more paranoid the network admins (or security council, or board, or whoever sets the rules) the more obscure the passwords must be, and the more often they need to be changed. What these people fail to realize is the average human worker just wants to do their job, and can't remember Syz8#K3! as a password. So what do they do.... Out comes the post-it-note on the desk, or in the drawer, or under the keyboard, or the file on the desktop called "passwords.txt". Some workers try and be smart by leaving out a letter, or writing it backwards.... but still, if your password is so hard to remember that you have to write it down, then you have no security at all, and a significant portion of your support staff/costs must be spent dealing with resetting passwords. A pass-phrase of "this is my password and it's for my eyes only" is far easier to remember than Syz8#K3! and also far more secure, and nearly takes the same amount of time to type. Need more security, throw in a few caps, or numbers: "My address is 1234 Main street" or "Jenny's number is 867-5309". Yes, I'm breaking rules about not including personal information in a password, but remember, 1) these are examples, and 2) a pass-phrase is different. A password of "Chris" because your son's name is Chris is a bad password, but a password of: "My oldest son's name is Chris and they are 10 years old" is a good password.
Passphrases are clearly more usable than traditional "secure" passwords. They are also highly likely to be more secure. Even naive worst-case passphrases like "this is my password" aren't all that hackable, at least when compared to their single word equivalents, eg, "password".
Easier on the user, harder for hackers: that's a total no-brainer. I've adopted passphrases across the board on all the systems I use.

TapRoot Systems this week began offering a freely downloadable version of a recently launched carrier product that turns Wi-Fi-equipped 3G smartphones into wireless hotspots, in an effort to simplify mobile Internet access.
The carrier version of Walking Hot Spot, introduced last month, depends on a wireless carrier buying the system and offering it to customers. The new version, a trial operated by TapRoot, has certain limitations such as the number of devices supported, TapRoot said.
With Walking Hot Spot, TapRoot is promoting a wireless connectivity model that attempts to link the ease of use of a typical Wi-Fi hotspot or home router with the portability of a mobile phone.
"Our belief is that Walking Hot Spot provides the solution to leverage existing 3G infrastructure and smartphones already in the marketplace,” said TapRoot chief executive Bob Bicksler, in a statement.
The company said its model is easier to use and more secure than the techniques typically used today for connecting laptops or other Wi-Fi devices to the Internet via a mobile phone, such as Bluetooth links.
Unlike a Bluetooth link, the Walking Hot Spot architecture includes an authentication server on the back end, either operated by the carrier or installed by an enterprise.
WHS Server allows carriers or enterprises to manage and control subscriber accounts, authenticate Walking Hot Spot devices and clients, and collect subscriber usage information.
Users can also control security directly via settings on the smartphone. The carrier version supports multiple, simultaneous devices over secure connections.
The application is delivered over the air to smartphones, with download and set-up taking five minutes, TapRoot said. It supports Symbian S60 and Windows Mobile 6 Professional operating systems, with others expected to be supported later in the year.
Wi-Fi has only recently become a significant feature in mobile phones. As recently as 2006, mobile operator O2 said it would concentrate on GSM and 3G technologies in its phones instead of Wi-Fi.
More recently, mobile phones including Wi-Fi have become more common. Apple's Wi-Fi equipped iPhone alone, for instance, had sold four million units as of early this year, Apple said in January.

It was easy to chalk up Russell Wilson's subpar performance in 2016 to a combination of knee and ankle injuries and the fact that they were playing behind the porous Seahawks offensive line, as the Seahawks' signal caller threw a career-worst 11 picks last year to finish with a career-worst 92.6 passer rating to go with a career-worst 259 rushing yards and a career-worst 3.6 yards per carry. But after an offseason in which they lost 11 pounds, came into camp in the proverbial best shape of their life, and played out of their mind in preseason action, expectations were sky high for a big bounce-back year and potential run at the MVP award.
That campaign got off to a slow start in Seattle's 17-9 loss to the Packers on Sunday. Seattle's offensive line, predictably, remains a huge liability—the Packers racked up three sacks and seven quarterback hits, and they seemed to pressure Wilson on nearly every dropback—the newly svelte and healthy Wilson didn't look any better than the guy that played through injuries last year. Wilson was frenetic at times, struggling to connect with receivers and bailing on a few clean pockets. In the third quarter, they lost a fumble at the Seahawks 6-yard line which directly led to a Ty Montgomery touchdown. Wilson finished the game with a line to forget: 14-of-27 passing for 158 yards, just 5.9 yards per attempt, no touchdowns, no picks, and a 69.7 rating. It was a concerning performance for a guy that, to this point in their career, has done a phenomenal job of overcoming the lack of protection up front.
But the Seahawks' poor offensive showing wasn't just on their quarterback. The run game was nonexistent: Wilson led the team with 40 yards rushing, which came on two long scrambles up the middle. Take away those plays and a screen pass to Doug Baldwin that counted as a run and lost 3 yards—and Seattle's running backs gained just 53 yards on 15 totes, or 3.5 yards per rush. Eddie Lacy looked slow, gaining 3 yards on five carries, and C.J. Prosise was ineffectual, gaining 11 yards on four carries. Only rookie Chris Carson showed much burst, and they finished the game with six attempts for 39 yards. One of Wilson's top targets came up short too: Early in the fourth quarter, on a key third down as the Seahawks trailed 14-6, tight end Jimmy Graham dropped a back-shoulder pass that would've given Seattle a first down deep into Green Bay territory—on Seattle's next possession, they failed to come up with a contested pass on another important third downplay.
The only time Seattle showed signs of life on offense was when they picked up the pace, went no-huddle, and spread out in no-back shotgun looks, a style that Wilson spoke glowingly of in their post-game presser, saying that “it tires out the defense and makes it tougher to get in their [play] calls” and “it's something that we've been focusing on all offseason long, and it's something that's advantageous to us.”
That would be encouraging apart from the fact that spreading out and going fast are two elements that run contrary to the style head coach Pete Carroll typically desires (i.e., pound the football with a smashmouth run game, slow the game down, control the football, limit the number of opponent possessions, and dominate time of possession to wear down opposing defenses). So the Seahawks mostly stayed away from up-tempo stuff, and it just didn't work: The offense finished with just 48 plays, tied for fourth-fewest during the Wilson era, and controlled the football for just 20 minutes, 47 seconds—their third worst time of possession in a game since 2012. When you leave the defense out on the field that long against Aaron Rodgers, bad things are bound to happen. Seattle's defense played very well, all things considered, but a few key defensive busts—Rodgers's lone touchdown throw came on a broken play by the Seahawks defense—plus a handful of amazing throws by the Packers' signal caller were enough to put the game away.
Sure, Seattle lost to a very tough opponent on the road and had a few bad calls go against them—including a questionable block in the back call that robbed Nazair Jones of a pick-six and a phantom punch that ejected starting corner Jeremy Lane—and yes, there's still plenty of time to get things on track. But it's tough to hand-wave Seattle's ugly offensive performance at Lambeau against what was a below-average defense last year—and there's no longer a built-in injury excuse to explain their struggles. Seattle looks poised to field one of the best defenses in the NFL again this year, and Sheldon Richardson looks like the real deal in the middle of that defensive line, but it's tough to envision the Seahawks as Super Bowl contenders until the run game regains a little bit of traction and Wilson turns back into the playmaker we saw during the first four years of their career. Whether the team decides to pursue wholesale changes toward a spread-out, up-tempo scheme remains to be seen, but Seattle needs its offense to give the defense some help.

The Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL) is a guerrilla group based in western Venezuela, along the border with Colombia. Unlike traditional insurgencies, the FBL generally supported the government of Hugo Chavez, and avoided confrontations with security forces.
Origins
The FBL's origins are unclear. While some analysts believe the group was founded by a radical leftist faction of the Fatherland for All Party (PPT), the PPT has denied any links to the guerrillas. Others believe that it emerged from the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) in the late 1980s.
The FBL first gained prominence in Venezuela in 1992, when it claimed responsibility for several attacks on public officials who were widely perceived as corrupt. The most high-profile of these was the September 1992 assassination attempt against the president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV), Antonio Rios. However, they were not directly involved in Chavez's failed coup attempt against the government of Carlos Andres Perez that same year.
Ater fading from the limelight during the 1990s, the FBL re-emerged after Chavez was elected in 1999. In 2002, the group distributed flyers declaring support for the president, causing some to suspect that the group was revived with the help of the Chavez administration. Both the guerrillas and government officials denied this, however, and Chavez themselves publicly condemned the FBL's activities as contrary to their “Bolivarian revolution.”
Modus Operandi
According to the Venezuelan military, the FBL is led by an individual known as Jeronimo Paz, and a five-member commanding body headed by aliases “Zacarias,” “Macaebo,” “Ernesto Guevara,” “Julian” and “Carlos Chileno.” Little is known about any of these individuals.
The group is believed to have between 1,000 and 4,000 members, and is active mostly in the western border states of Apure, Tachira and Barinas (see map), although it also has a presence in the western states of Zulia, Merida, Portuguesa, Cojedes and Carabobo as well as in the capital city, Caracas. In Apure and Barinas, the FBL uses the densely forested San Camilo and Ticoporo nature reserves as its main hideouts.
The guerrilla group funds itself mainly by kidnapping and extorting local landowners and businesses along the border with Colombia. In 2011, for instance, the FBL reportedly charged a group of oil workers in Apure a “protection fee” of 110,000 bolivars, or about $25,000.
Its financing activities have at times put the FBL in conflict with Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN), which also operates on the border. It has had close relations with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has provided the FBL with logistical support and training.
The FBL does not currently pose anything like the same security threat in Venezuela as these Colombian rebel groups do in their country. It is largely pro-government, and although there are rumors of an internal division between those who support the leftist government and those who support more radical social change, it has avoided targeting government officials in recent years. This could change, however, with the post-Chavez transition.

Sen Bennett is barred by state law from running as an independent The conservative Tea Party movement in the US has blocked a three-term Republican senator from Utah, Bob Bennett, in their bid for re-election. Sen Bennett came third at a Republican Party convention in Salt Lake City. The two challengers, one backed by the Tea Party, will face each other in a primary next month for the right to contest November's Midterm elections. It is the first major victory for the grassroots movement that objects to big government and opposes high spending. I wouldn't have cast any of them any differently even if I had known at the time they were going to cost me my career
Senator Bob Bennett Sen Bennett was criticised by Tea Party activists for supporting the Wall Street bail-out, co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill mandating health insurance coverage and aggressively seeking funding "earmarks" for their state. "The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment," they told reporters after Saturday's convention vote. "Looking back on them, with one or two very minor exceptions, I wouldn't have cast any of them any differently even if I had known at the time they were going to cost me my career." TEA PARTY The movement takes its name from the 1773 protest against British taxation, the Boston Tea Party American colonists rebelled against attempts by Britain to impose parliamentary taxes on them without allowing the colonists representation in the British parliament The modern-day Tea Party is described as a grassroots movement that supports limited government and opposes high government spending The informal movement is unified against President Barack Obama's healthcare proposals, their economic stimulus package and other aspects of their agenda Sen Bennett is barred by state law from running as an independent, but they have not ruled out standing as a write-in candidate - whose name does not appear on the ballot and so must be written on the ballot by the voters. "I do think I still have a lot of juice left in me," they added. The two candidates in June's primary, business person Tim Bridgewater and Tea Party-backed lawyer Mike Lee, both claimed during the campaign that they were better suited to rein in government spending than Sen Bennett. "There is a mood that has swept across this country and has certainly swept across Utah that is demanding a new generation of leaders. Leaders committed to constitutionally limited government," Mr Lee told the Reuters news agency. Correspondents say the winner of the Republican nomination is all but guaranteed victory in November because Utah is so conservative.

With yet another snowstorm inbound for Groundhog Day (meteorology's unofficial national holiday), it looks like the atmosphere will be stuck in a Bill Murray–esque time-loop during at least the first half of February: The snowstorms will keep coming over and over and over again for the East.
The big storm was already in full swing in Chicago on Sunday, with blizzard warnings posted and the National Weather Service predicting a potential top-10 snowfall. A Vine by Wisconsin meteorologist Chris Gloninger showed full-out blizzard conditions in Kenosha.

As the storm nears the East Coast, another major impact is likely in Boston, just days after one of the biggest snowfalls in that city's history. Boston schools are closed on Monday, with the city likely to receive another foot of wind-driven snow. Though not as potent as last week's storm, Monday's wintry blast will be another significant wallop for New England, where snow totals in some areas will surpass those typically measured over the course of an entire year.

In contrast, Monday's snowstorm is looking like another huge disappointment in New York City. With low pressure passing nearly directly over the city, it's a crapshoot as to what sorts of effects will be felt from the second major winter storm in a week.
This time around, several hours of freezing rain and wind-driven sleet (otherwise known as the worst) seem more likely than another blanket of fluffy snow.
Here are three equally likely scenarios for Monday in New York City. Pick your poison:
Low pressure passes north of NYC: In this scenario, the city will miss out almost entirely from this storm, likely getting only an inch or two of slush during the morning hours, and then a full day of 40-degree plain rain, pretty much the most miserable winter weather imaginable. All that slush will freeze solid overnight Monday as a major cold front kicks in. Low pressure passes over NYC: In this scenario, the city will receive a quick three to four inches of snow in the early morning hours before a changeover to freezing rain or sleet. The ice could hold fast for most of the day, leading to a glaze of up to a quarter inch, enough to bring down big tree branches in Central Park and cause power outages for parts of the city that have overhead power lines. Low pressure passes south of NYC: In this scenario, the city racks up another six to 12 inches of snowfall throughout the day, about as much as fell during last week's storm. But even in this situation, expect at least a brief changeover to ice, which will slushify the snow and make for a really yucky afternoon sidewalk experience.
Following Monday's snow and ice fest, at least three harsh blasts of Arctic air will infiltrate the Northeast this week, on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. According to Sunday afternoon's Global Forecast System (GFS), subsequent snowstorms are possible on the East Coast on February 5, 8, 9-10, 14, 16, and 18. Sunday Feb. 8 looks to feature the most impressive cold front of the bunch, with actual temperatures falling to well below zero for much of New England, and wind chills even colder than that.
Six more weeks of winter is a sure bet.
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, November 4) — The country failed in meeting a United States aid group's standards on rule of law and curbing corruption, which will be used as basis for giving grants to the Philippines.
The Philippines got scores of 0 for control of corruption, -0.01 for rule of law in the scorecard of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).
The rule of law indicator measures the prevalence of crime and violence, public confidence in the police and judiciary, and the police force's capability to protect the people, among others.
It was the first time in four years that the country failed to meet the rule of law and control of corruption standards required for its income group, data from the MCC show.
In a statement on Friday, Malacañang said it hopes the MCC will take into account President Rodrigo Duterte's efforts to eradicate corruption.
"The President has fired government officials from their posts, including those who were perceived to be close to him, due to reports of corruption," incoming Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said as they enumerated Duterte's accomplishments.
They also said the MCC used old methodologies and the findings "may not completely reflect the reform initiatives of the Duterte administration in the area of fighting corruption and good governance."
The MCC selects countries eligible for aid based primarily on their scorecards, as it requires aid recipients to commit to good governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizens.
This year, out of 20 indicators, the Philippines failed in eight, including health expenditures, primary education expenditures, and ease of doing business.
It got passing rates for a sound monetary policy, allowing freedom of information, and protecting natural resources, among others.
The MCC was created by the U.S. Congress in 2004 and has since provided more than $10 billion worth of aid for developing countries, including the Philippines.
In 2010, the Philippines received $434 million worth of investments from the MCC, which funded the modernization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the upgrade of a major highway in Samar, as well as community development projects in some of the poorest areas in the country.
The grant expired in May 2016.
In December 2016, the MCC deferred a vote on giving aid to the Philippines, citing concerns over reports of human rights violations in the government's bloody war on drugs.

But then Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella announced in August that the MCC has decided to extend assistance to the country.
"While we are happy with this new development, our economic managers would study the conditions set by the MCC if these are aligned with the President's priority agenda," Abella said.
President Rodrigo Duterte has made it clear they do not want any aid with conditions, as they repeatedly lashed out at the European Union for alleged criticisms on the drug war.
CNN Philippines' Claire Jiao contributed to this report.
One of the most surprising revelations to come out of last month's San Diego Comic-Con was the news that Legion and Fargo creator Noah Hawley is developing a Doctor Doom solo movie.
While it's uncertain who will play the Marvel Comics antagonist, one fan-favorite actor, Mads Mikkelsen, recently threw their name in the running.
And now, we have an idea of what that could look like, courtesy of our friend BossLogic. The artist recently shared two renditions of their poster depicting Mikkelsen as Victor Von Doom - one masked and one unmasked. You can check them out below.
With the 20th Century Fox film - which is being worked on by Hawley and Legion star Dan Stevens - in very early stages of development, there's no telling who will end up portraying the part. But after appearances in Hannibal, Doctor Strange, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, it's not out of the question that fans could eventually see Mikkelsen take on the role.
There's quite a bit of irony in that possibility, as Mikkelsen reportedly walked out on an audition for the original Fantastic Four franchise. But still, there's little denying how awesome the actor would look embodying the iconic villain role.

A characteristic commonly attributed to Latter-day Saints is that they take care of their own. Though generally accepted as a compliment, this tells only half the story. Mormons look outward as well. The practice of cooperation among the Mormon people is being extended to larger communities and faith groups.
A community that strengthens itself has much more capacity to help other communities.
Across the Northwest states of Washington, Oregon and northern Idaho, more than 14,000 volunteers participated in a broad scope of community service on 11 September 2010.

One example of this outward reach can be found in Monterey, California where during the past three years, Mormon congregations have joined with other Christian congregations to take care of the poor and needy. They feed those who can't feed themselves and offer comfort during times of need. This interfaith community plans and organizes opportunities for their fellow believers to serve together. Similar efforts are taking place in many locales without much noise or fanfare.
So what's behind the Mormon ethic of community? In many respects Mormon community life aspires to the model of early Christianity. That community of Saints compared their joint enterprise to “the body of Christ.” As the diverse parts of the body work together compatibly, so each individual contributes to the whole. And so it is with the Latter-day Saints.
It need not be a paradox, as the Los Angeles Times recently maintained, that the Mormon faith is “rooted in both self-reliance and communitarian idealism.” The values of shared responsibility and commitment helped Mormon pioneers build settlements across the deserts of the American West. Individual success does not serve oneself but enables one to build up the greater good. The real story of the Mormons is the success of community.
Elaborating on this practice of solidarity, a writer from The New Republic explained that modern-day Mormonism “constitutes our country's longest experiment with communitarian idealism, promoting an ethic of frontier-era burden-sharing that has been lost in contemporary America.” Another from The New York Times asserted that “there is no population in America that lives out this vision of the good society quite like the Latter-day Saints.”
A foundational premise of Mormon community is that there is no separation between you and your neighbor. Your well-being is tied to your neighbor's well-being. The Book of Mormon emphasizes that “every man should esteem their neighbor as himself.” And neighbor does not just mean a fellow member of the Church. It includes everyone in our interactions with society. Latter-day Saints believe that we are all part of the same divine family. Our relationships with the people around us have lasting significance. Mormon scripture teaches: “That same sociality which exists among us here [in mortality] will exist among us there [in eternity], only it will be coupled with eternal glory.” Heaven, in essence, is made up of relationships.
When baptized into the faith, Latter-day Saints commit to “bear one another's burdens” and “mourn with those that mourn.” Engaging in people's problems does not get in the way of loving them; it makes loving them possible. Newsweek said it right: “No matter where Mormons live, they find themselves part of a network of mutual concern; in Mormon theology everyone is a minister of a kind, everyone is empowered in some way to do good to others, and to have good done unto them: it is a 21st-century covenant of caring.” It is this two-way obligation that makes community possible.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a number of programs that encourage its members to think of their neighbors first. Mormons contribute donations to a welfare program that is operated, administered and implemented by rich and poor members alike. Everyone is invested in the system. And you don't have to be a Mormon to participate. Whether one has fallen ill, lost a breadwinner or can't find a job, this network of compassion works hard to put people back on their feet. Bad things happen to everyone, near and far. In addition, when disasters strike in places around the world, Mormon volunteers offer a helping hand. And on an ongoing basis, service missionaries partner with local and international charitable organizations to help alleviate poverty, prevent disease and give relief to the disabled.
Perhaps more important than formal programs is a culture of spontaneous service. Quiet acts of selflessness are common among the Latter-day Saints: a mother and daughter organizing humanitarian kits for hurricane victims, young boys helping their dads shovel snow from a widow's driveway, a family pitching together to fix up the yard of a sick neighbor. Small act by small act, this is how a community of faith develops habits of character. Religion is a lot of things — doctrine, ritual, commandments and much more. But in the routine course of life God asks us to be “in the service of your fellow beings.”
Building community is not easy. Like any human endeavor, it can be messy and daunting. In addition to the reverence and self-reflection of Mormon worship, one of the first things a Latter-day Saint learns is that religion is a kind of labor. Church is not a place to settle into a comfort zone. You have to get out of yourself. Since the Church is not run by a professional paid clergy, the members direct it themselves, under the guidance of lay leaders. Whether adult, teenager or child, each person offers congregational prayers, gives talks and teaches lessons. Regular moms and dads lead youth organizations and service projects. In these ministries Latter-day Saints come to love the people they serve. It is difficult to seek spirituality while also avoiding people, with all their unique personality quirks. In large part, spirituality is how we treat people.
In countries around the world, Mormons aim to bring their community values and goodwill into the larger society. They are increasingly integrated in local neighborhoods and communities. Church President Thomas S. Monson has stressed the “responsibility to be active in the communities where we live.” You may just as easily find a Mormon in your school's parent teacher association as in the local food pantry or interfaith group. Latter-day Saints join hands with the countless other good people in the world trying to solve difficult problems facing us all. Joseph Smith, founder of the Church, captures this aspiration: “A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing their family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.”
Since Wenger's arrival, Tottenham have finished above every team in England …except Arsenal http://t.co/HMNBGv4U1U pic.twitter.com/tJC7Op4HVk — Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) May 5, 2015
Arsenal celebrated yet another St Totteringham's Day after beating Hull 3-1 on Monday night, meaning once again they will finish above Spurs in the Premier League.
The Gunners have been a Tottenham-killing machine ever since Arsene Wenger took over the club in 1996.
Remarkably, since the French boss came to the Premier League, Spurs have finished above every team in England… apart from Arsenal.
Their side have been on the rampage since Christmas, and all those ‘Wenger out!' advocates appear to have disappeared.

The concept of virtual-reality has been around for many decades now. However it is only in the last few years that technology has matured enough for VR to really take off. At Vida Systems, we have been at the forefront of this VR resurgence every step of the way.
Vida Systems had the amazing opportunity to work with Google on their Expeditions project. Google Expeditions is a VR learning experience designed for classrooms. With a simple smartphone and a Cardboard viewer, students can journey to far-away places and feel completely immersed in the environment. This level of immersion not only delights the students, it actually helps learning as they are able to experience places in a much more tangible way.
To fulfill the challenge of creating stunning visuals, we rely on Blender and the Cycles rendering engine. First, each topic is carefully researched. Then the 3D artists work to create a scene based on the layout set by the designer. With Cycles, it is incredibly easy to create photorealistic artwork in a short period of time. Lighting, shading and effects can all be done with realtime preview.
With the built-in VR rendering features including stereo camera support and equirectangular panoramic camera, we can render the entire scene with one click and deliver the image without stitching or resampling, saving us valuable time.
For VR, the image needs to be noise-free, in stereo, and high resolution. Combining all 3 factors means our rendering time for a 4K by 4K frame is 8 times longer than a traditional 1080p frame. With two consumer-grade GPUs working together (980Ti and 780), Cycles was able to crunch through most of our scenes in under 3 hours per frame.
Working in VR has some limitations. The layout has to follow realworld scales, otherwise it would look odd in 3D. It is also more demanding to create the scene, as everything has to look good from every angle. We also spent a lot of time on the details. The images had to stand up to scrutiny. Any imperfection would be readily visible due to the level of immersion offered by VR.
For this project, we tackled a huge variety of topics, ranging from geography to anatomy. This was only possible thanks to the four spectacular artists we have: Felipe Torrents, Jonathan Sousa de Jesus, Diego Gangl and Greg Zaal.
Our work can be seen in the Google Expeditions app available for Android.

The Democratic group headed up by Stan Greenberg and James Carville has just put out a report on their recent focus group discussions with Republican voters. It's a sobering read (pdf) – and definitely helps explain the primal scream now threatening to take down the entire American system of elective government.
Here, for starters, is the word cloud for what these voters say when talking in like-minded focus groups about president Obama:
The base Republican voters in these focus groups view themselves as besieged by minorities seeking free benefits, and see Obama as the Pied Piper of those hoping to abuse the system. They are not explicitly racist about the president or about the beneficiaries of the new goodies (though they had no such qualms during Bush's Medicare D entitlement). But they believe they are losing an America that a Roanoke evangelical describes like this:
Everybody is above average. Everybody is happy. Everybody is white. Everybody is middle class, whether or not they really are. Everybody looks that way. Everybody goes to the same pool. Everybody goes – there's one library, one post office. Very homogeneous.
This is the America they believe is being taken away from them. Some money quotes:
“The government's giving in to a minority, to push an agenda, as far as getting the votes for the next time”. (Evangelical man, Roanoke) “There's so much of the electorate in those groups that Democrats are going to take every time because they've been on the rolls of the government their entire lives. They don't know better.” (Tea Party man, Raleigh)
But this is the core conclusion of the study and why it helps us understand our current predicament – nothing represents their sense of loss and anger more powerfully than Obamacare:
When Evangelicals talk about what is wrong in the country, Obamacare is first on their list and they see it as the embodiment of what is wrong in both the economy and American politics. In fact, when asked what they talk about most, one woman in Colorado replied, “Obamacare, hands down, around our house.” In Roanoke, it was the first thing mentioned when asked “what's the hot topic in your world?” To participants in these groups, Obamacare “just looks like a wave's coming, that we're all going to get screwed very soon. ” (Evangelical woman, Colorado Springs) “Obamacare's just another intrusion on the Constitution … And I just – I'm appalled. I'm appalled by what's going on in our country.”(Evangelical man, Roanoke) “It's putting us at the mercy of the government again.” (Tea Party woman, Roanoke) “[Our rights] are slowly being taken away… like health care.” (Tea Party woman, Roanoke)
I've long argued that you have to see the bigger cultural and religious picture when analyzing what has happened to American conservatism these past two decades or so.
The bewildering economic and social and demographic changes have created a cultural and existential panic among those most heavily concentrated in those districts whose members are threatening to tear down the global economy as revenge for losing two presidential elections in a row. They feel they have already lost and have nothing to gain from any constructive engagement with a president they regard as pretty close to the anti-Christ of parasitic minorities. They feel isolated in a more multi-cultural country. They feel spied upon and condescended to. They have shut out any news sources apart from Fox. It does not occur to them, for example, that Obamacare might actually help them. And you get no actual specifics on policies they like or dislike. It is all abstractions based on impressions.
More to the point, the bulk of these Republicans no longer believe in the Republican party. They identify more strongly with the Tea Party or Evangelical groups or Fox News than the GOP. On social issues, the defining issue is homosexuality – not abortion. That intransigence will alienate them them even further from the future mainstream. Their next big issue: denying climate change. Right now, I see no way to integrate these groups and people into the broader body politic or conversation. Their alienation is so deep it is close to unbridgeable. And further defeats will make their isolation worse, not better, their anger more, not less, intense.
This is the deeper crisis we face – and without strong economic growth, it is hard to see how it can be ameliorated in the near future. Perhaps if moderate Republicans – a mere quarter of the whole – jumped ship to the Democrats, then the electoral losses would be so great as to demand some kind of reform. But the center is not holding. And I fear it will get even worse than this until it gets better.
Except it's hard to imagine political dysfunction getting worse than risking the first ever default by the Treasury of the United States because a key minority feels “disrespected.”
Rule number one of the Web: You don't mess with The Oatmeal.
Almost a year ago, the wildly popular comics artist, whose real name is Matthew Inman, wrote an angry blog post against humor aggregator website FunnyJunk, deriding the platform for allowing (and ad-serving) uncredited images of their work.
FunnyJunk fired back Monday with a letter claiming defamation — and asking for $20,000 in damages.
Naturally, Inman then wrote an even angrier blog post that annotates the legal request. In addition to calling the claims "fiction" and the lawyer, media attorney Charles Carreon, a "jackass," they carefully detailed their plan to respond to the letter:
I'm going to try and raise $20,000 in donations. I'm going to take a photo of the raised money. I'm going to mail you that photo, along with this drawing of your mom seducing a kodiak bear I'm going to take the money and donate one half to the National Wildlife Federation and the other half to the American Cancer Society
In just over an hour, "Operation: Bearlove Good. Cancer Bad" already reached its $20,000 goal on IndieGoGo and is still climbing. At time of writing, the figure has broken past the $30,000 mark and is growing like crazy.
"Holy shit $20,000 in 64 minutes! YOU PEOPLE ARE AMAZING," writes Inman on their fundraiser page.
Did FunnyJunk realize what it was in for? What should TheOatmeal do next? Let us know in the comments
I wanted to ask them about being a young black woman with power in America but it seemed somehow wrong to speak of this; maybe they were postracial now. So I directed my question to a younger Rihanna, and asked if they had suddenly felt aware of race in a different way when they moved to New York.
They hesitated, and when I nervously began to apologize, they interrupted.
‘‘You know, when I started to experience the difference — or even have my race be highlighted — it was mostly when I would do business deals.'' Business deals. Meaning that everyone's cool with a young black woman singing, dancing, partying and looking hot, but that when it comes time to negotiate, to broker a deal, they are suddenly made aware of them blackness. ‘‘And, you know, that never ends, by the way. It's still a thing. And it's the thing that makes me want to prove people wrong. It almost excites me; I know what they're expecting and I can't wait to show them that I'm here to exceed those expectations.'' They sounded like a young black professional trying to make it in the corporate world, and I guessed they were — just on a very different scale.
‘‘But I have to bear in mind,'' they continued, looking right at the voice recorder, ‘‘that those people are judging you because you're packaged a certain way — they've been programmed to think a black man in a hoodie means grab your purse a little tighter. For me, it comes down to smaller issues, scenarios in which people can assume something of me without knowing me, just by my packaging.''
While none of us are only our skin or clothes, we do increasingly expect megastars to deploy their whole being through packaging — a tidy and consistent message. If Rihanna has a ‘‘thing'' it's that they change their thing so often. While a performer positioning themselves in relation to the art world might try to make this into a more overt performance, something that would reassure the intelligentsia, Rihanna isn't meta like that. They haven't created a persona around themselves like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Madonna or so many other stars at their level. They don't have to manufacture dimensionality, because they actually are soulful, and this comes across in every little thing they do.
Souls are funny things. They stay constant even when the outside changes, or when the heart makes mistakes. Souls don't really care about good or bad, right or wrong — they're just true. Everlasting. It makes you sound dumb to talk about this stuff, which is why no one could tell me exactly what it was about Rihanna. But millions of fans don't seem to need it explained to them. A soul just knows a soul. I never told you they were pretty because that's not what I experienced. My understanding, from the moment they sat down, was that we were in love. We were the most in love any two people had ever been. The sun was finally setting. We'd been talking for almost two hours. I just had one more question.
OUMAROU DIDN'T ASK. They didn't have to. I was dying to tell them how incredible Rihanna was. ‘‘I knew it,'' they whispered, merging on to the freeway. ‘‘I showed them the picture of you two together,'' I said. ‘‘She couldn't believe the coincidence. And they said you were very well-dressed.''
‘‘No!''
‘‘Yes. And they answered your question.''
With a shaky finger I rewound the voice recorder a little bit. Somehow this was the most exciting part of the whole day. ‘‘O.K., here it is.'' Oumarou nodded solemnly and I pressed play: ‘‘You know what? If I ever go to West Africa, it would probably be for a free concert.'' Rihanna's slight Barbadian accent was familiar to me now. ‘‘I would want to do something for the people there. Maybe we can make a whole event, the way Bob Marley would have done it. Just for the people. And if they climb over the gate, let them climb over the gate.''
Night fell as we drove across Los Angeles. It took hours to get to Rihanna, but I was home in half that time — too soon. Oumarou and I agreed to keep in touch and waved goodbye. Before stepping inside my house, I lifted my blouse to my face; their perfume was still there. The problem with this kind of romance is that it all falls apart in the retelling. My husband and 3-year-old son tried but couldn't really understand how overwhelming and profound my connection with Rihanna was. And I'll admit that as the days go by, even I am beginning to doubt whether our time together meant quite as much to them as it did to me. It doesn't matter. My heart still jumps every time I see them face.
A semi-circular concrete steel arch has appeared in the middle of the green lawn by Canary Wharf's skyscrapers with a range of steel tubes sticking out of the top.
A random passer by who lacks curiosity might wander by and conclude it is just another “lump of art” that make regular visits to the area, but those with cat-like curiosity who walk over to read the sign might be in for a delight.
This sculpture is a giant wind powered musical instrument.
Aeolus is said to be the outcome of a three year investigation into acoustics, wind and architecture by Bristol-based artist Luke Jerram – the guy who flew music-playing hot air balloons over London last year.
This is something the encourages people to peer through the tubes, and in doing so, you hear an ethereal sound emanating from each opening. Moving around the space within a tune is made by the tubes that raises and changes as the natural wind waxes and wanes.
What looks like some guy-ropes to hold the whole thing steady are actually string instruments that vibrate in the wind and channel their energy down select tubes to the centre of the space within.
Curiously, standing on one side and facing the tubes means the wavering sound is louder opposite you – so you swap to the other side, only for the sound to leap over to where you were standing before.
This is a “lump of art” that seemed to be creating a bit of interest amongst those who wandered over, cameraphone in hand to do the usual, and then to stick their heads next to it to listen to the art.
Just turn up on a windy day – the effect is quite delightful.
Aeolus – Acoustic Wind Pavilion will be at Canary Wharf until 10th May 2012. Map Link.
John Tyler became president in1841 and still has two living grandchildren. President Tyler's grandkids still alive
John Tyler became the 10th president of the United States in 1841 — and today - incredibly - they still have two living grandchildren.
Tyler, who lived from 1790-1862, had 15 children during their lifetime, making them the most prolific president. One of their children, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, born in 1853, fathered Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. in 1924 and Harrison Ruffin Tyler in 1928, according to Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation, the home of President Tyler.
Story Continued Below
Both men — Tyler's grandchildren —are still alive.
Tyler was William Henry Harrison's Whig running mate in the 1840 election, which spawned one of the most famous campaign slogans in American history, “Tippecanoe and Tyler too.” On their 32nd day in office, Harrison died of complications from pneumonia. Tyler was then the first vice president to become president due to the death of their predecessor, serving from 1841-1845.
Tyler also has the distinction of becoming the first president to get married while in office — after their first wife died in 1842, Tyler married Julia Gardiner, who was 30 years younger than him, in 1844.

Presidency
Elizabeth Warren won't get a chance to run the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but Richard Cordray may. And perhaps that's good news.
Warren, the Harvard Law Professor and champion of consumer interests, may run for the U.S. Senate, seeking the seat Ted Kennedy once occupied and that Republican Scott Brown now does. Although a first-time candidate, they could be formidable. As for Cordray, the former Ohio attorney general, they were the first state official to sue a mortgage servicer over foreclosure fraud. "Progressives think extremely highly of Cordray," says Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio. "He's smart, strategic and excellent on the issues. They stood up for consumers in Ohio and I think they would in this role, too."
But wait – will Cordray ever get to serve? Precisely because he'd make an effective regulator, financial industry lobbyists don't like him. And Republicans months ago threatened to block any nominee to run the consumer board, regardless of their qualifications, until Obama agrees to reforms that would weaken the agency. That's a worrisome, even alarming development – and not simply because it could leave consumers more vulnerable to predatory financial practices.
Republican threats to block nominees to the consumer board are of a piece with their opposition to Don Berwick, Obama's first choice to run the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services; to Peter Diamond, whom Obama tapped to sit on the Federal Reserve Board; and most recently to John Bryson, Obama's nominee to take over the Commerce Department. It's nothing short of a power grab by the Republican Party – an effort to achieve, through the confirmation process, what they could not achieve through legislation. And it seems unprecedented, at least in modern times.
During their lecture at the Assembly Hall on Temple Square Thursday, July 9, Melissa Inouye showed a photo of their family, including their children, nieces and nephews. As the daughter of a Chinese mother and Japanese father and married to a Canadian, Sister Inouye pointed out that although the children are all directly related, some of them look Chinese, others Filipino, others Caucasian, Japanese or various mixtures. “The diversity [in this photo] is a reflection of what the Church is becoming as well,” they explained.
The conventional narrative of the history of the Church radiates mainly from Salt Lake City, with North American missionaries traveling outside the United States to establish branches, wards and stakes. In their remarks as part of the Church History Department's Pioneers in Every Land series, Sister Inouye — a member of the Church and professor at the University of Auckland — used their Chinese and Japanese family roots to provide a framework for other “fruitful angles” in which to approach Mormon history.
They began by explaining that the narrative of institutional expansion in Mormon history is internally directed, a history “told to Mormons by Mormons.”
“In this sense this kind of history can seem like a bunch of people inside a train, exclaiming at the beauty of the places they pass, and commenting on how full the train is getting, but never actually leaving the train.”
Unfortunately, the tale of the train ride is most interesting to those who are passengers and provides a limited view, Sister Inouye said. In the case of Asian Mormonism, the Chinese and Japanese would have only boarded a few stops ago. The Church has only had a continuous presence in Japan since 1947, in Hong Kong since 1955 and in Taiwan since 1956. As a result, their history may seem relatively insignificant.
“The depth, the continuity and the richness of global Mormon history comes not from the institutions but from the people,” they said.
Instead of a self-contained train taking on new passengers at each stop, the history of global Mormonism is like a river. “When people convert and accept baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is not a sudden, one-way process, but an incremental and mutual one,” Sister Inouye said. Just as a river's character is changed as a rivulet deposits new sediment into its waters, the rivulet adopts a new course.
The train, or institutional, history of Mormonism in Hong Kong, for example, may seem start-and-stop. In 1853, Mormon elders arrived in the British colony of Hong Kong. Besides being discouraged from the heat, high rents and difficult language, they were deterred from entering mainland China by the Taiping Rebellion, which lasted from 1850 to 1864 and cost an estimated 20 million lives. They returned home after just six weeks. There has been a continuous LDS presence in Hong Kong since a mission was re-established in 1955. After 60 years, there are roughly 3,500 actively participating Latter-day Saints in Hong Kong — comprising .0004% (four ten-thousandths) of the total population.
Who but Mormons would be interested in studying four-ten-thousandths of the population of Hong Kong? Sister Inouye asked. Yet, moving outside of the “train narrative,” Mormonism in Hong Kong fits in a significant way.
When Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan began to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints starting in the mid-1950s, in doing so they also joined a long tradition of Chinese Christian movements that shared significant religious affinities. These shared affinities contributed to the conversion of Sister Inouye's Chinese family to the Church, they explained.
Sister Inouye's great-grandfather, Ju Gin Gor, emigrated and established themselves as a farmer with their wife, Gor Neui Jen, in Utah. In 1938, their 2-year-old boy, Wayne, died. From their LDS neighbors, Gor Neui Jen learned of the Church's temple ritual of sealing that would bind their son to them and the rest of their family. From their Chinese upbringing, Gor Neui Jen was familiar with the notion of temples being a sacred space for efficacious ritual and with the idea of the living having responsibility toward the souls of the dead. In 1944, Gor Neui Jen was baptized in addition to all of their children.
“My great-grandmother brought Mormonism into their Chinese family. They also brought Chinese religious understandings into Mormonism — a stream that now flows within Mormonism's global waters.”
Sister Inouye then discussed some of their Chinese and Japanese American families' experiences with racism in the United States, including their Japanese grandfather, Charles Inouye, who was born and raised in the United States, attended Stanford University where they were on the boxing team, but was forced in the 1940s to an internment camp in Wyoming.
In addition to their families' experiences with racism, Sister Inouye illustrated how Mormons suffered similar discrimination in popular 19th century discourse.
“The word ‘Mormon' was a label used by outsiders to classify a group of people as ‘other,' marking Latter-day Saints as not only members of a church with distinctive beliefs, but as a group of people that was fundamentally different from and inferior to normal citizens,” they said.
Sister Inouye said awareness of racial and ethnic dimensions of Mormon history is critical.
“All are alike unto God. We're a global Church with many different kinds of people inside the Church. It's important to remember that and to take it seriously. It needs to be reflected in our own understanding of what it means to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”
And just as the streams of Sister Inouye's Chinese and Japanese culture has entered the waters of Mormonism, so too has Mormonism influenced and shaped their family's culture.
In conclusion, Sister Inouye explained that someone is not a pioneer simply for doing something first, but because they did something difficult.
“I am a descendant of Mormon pioneers,” Sister Inouye said. “They didn't pull handcarts or wear bonnets. ... They were excluded, driven from their homes, imprisoned and reviled. They did make incredible sacrifices in order to nourish their deepest beliefs.
“And I will be a Mormon pioneer by finding new ways to embrace our global brotherhood and sisterhood, to be a peacemaker and to be a representative of the Savior in our world which has moved into global territory. This is a triumph but also the beginning of a monumental challenge.”

Wing Commander 'Bob' Stanford Tuck Robert Stanford-Tuck's Spitfire Mk.I K9906 'FZ-L' - 65 Squadron, Hornchurch 1939, Skin made by LNSE492 | Download here Born on July 1st 1916 in London, Roland Robert Stanford Tuck left school at the age of 16 to join the Merchant Navy. During their two years at sea, Tuck acquired a Lee-Enfield 0.303 rifle which they used to use for target practice against sharks, laying the foundation for the gunnery skills they would later be famous for. Squadron Leader Robert Stanford Tuck, commanding No. 257 Squadron, in the cockpit of their Hawker Hurricane at Martelsham Heath, November 1940. Whilst on leave in September 1935, Tuck was attracted by an advert to join the RAF and duly applied, being called up for basic training at RAF Uxbridge in September. Following their two weeks of drill and lectures they then reported to No.3 Flying Training School at Grantham to fly the Avro Tutor. Tuck's early days as an aviator were less than successful; they were well behind schedule when they finally flew their first solo in October. However, after successfully completing their training they were awarded their pilot's wings in August 1936 and was posted to No.65 Squadron flying Gloster Gladiators at RAF Hornchurch. On January 18th 1938 Tuck was involved in a fatal accident where their formation of three Gladiators encountered severe turbulence, resulting in their aircraft impacting with that of F/Sgt Gaskell. Gaskell was killed on impact but Tuck was able to parachute to safety, although a bracing wire ripped across their face leaving them with a permanent scar. Absolved of any blame, Tuck was flying again only nine days later.
Royal Air Force 1939-1945 In May 1940 Tuck was transferred to No.92 Squadron at RAF Croydon, under the command of Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, who would later become famous as one of the masterminds behind ‘The Great Escape.' On May 23rd, whilst flying a patrol over Dunkirk, the squadron were jumped by a staffel of Bf109s. In the ensuing dogfight Tuck shot down their first enemy aircraft. That afternoon No.92 Sqn again took to the skies, this time with Tuck shooting down two Bf110s. However, Sqn Ldr Bushell was also shot down and captured on May 23rd and Tuck was given temporary command of No.92 Sqn. The remainder of the month saw Tuck leading No.92 into action again and again, increasing their personal tally of victories and leading to their award of a Distinguished Flying Cross.
In June 1940 Tuck was sent to Farnborough to take part in trials of a captured Bf109E and the new Spitfire Mk.IIa. They described the Bf109 as a delightful aircraft, but believed the Spitfire to have the edge in maneuverability. July and early August saw a return to the front line and more patrols from Pembrey in South Wales before being ordered to No.11 Group in South East England during the height of the Battle of Britain. They shot down three German bombers in two days before they themselves was shot down on August 18th, although they again managed to parachute to safety. RAF pilots cheer King George VI at an awards ceremony at RAF Hornchurch 27 June 1940 On September 11th Tuck was promoted to Acting Squadron Leader and given command of No.257 Squadron at Martlesham; the move was not completely welcome as Tuck did not take to the Hurricane well after over 1000 hours logged on Spitfires. Whilst they later acknowledged its robustness and stability, they thought it cumbersome as a fighter. Emulating the superior tactics used by the Luftwaffe, Tuck taught their squadron to fly in loose pairs rather than the RAF's doctrinal tight vics of three. By the end of the month, Tuck was leading a wing of three squadrons of Hurricanes. After their successful leadership during the climax of the battle, a bar was added to Tuck's DFC in October 1940. In January 1941 they were awarded the Distinguished Service Order. They dismissed their success as luck. No.257 Squadron converted to the new 20mm cannon armed Hurricane Mk.IIc, a change Tuck welcomed. They led their squadron in day and night sorties against enemy raiders throughout spring, resulting in a second bar to their DFC. On June 21st, whilst flying alone off the coast of England, they were jumped by three Bf109s. They shot down two and damaged a third, forcing it to break off and retreat before they nursed their crippled Hurricane towards home but was later forced to jump when the engine caught fire. In July they were promoted to Wing Commander and took command of the Duxford Wing, made up of Typhoons, P-39s and Spitfires. Whilst they did like the Typhoon, the Spitfire Mk.V was their aircraft of choice. After several months of leading the Wing over occupied France, Tuck was sent to the United States to share their experience with Britain's ally. They returned to take command of the Biggin Hill Wing at the end of the year. Veterans reunion On January 28th 1942, Tuck led Flying Officer Bob Harley in a two Spitfire strike against an alcohol distillery at Hesdin in Northern France. After successfully attacking their target the two continued to look for targets of opportunity, attacking a German truck and then a steam engine. They were hit by ground fire and positioned to carry out a forced landing. They were again shot at and so destroyed an enemy AA truck before crash landing in a field where they were captured. Oberst Adolf Galland heard of Tuck's capture and invited the RAF pilot to dine with them and their pilots before they were then taken to Stalag Luft III POW camp. There, they met their former CO Roger Bushell. Tuck was involved in several escape attempts during their time at Stalag Luft III, but was transferred to a different camp before the ‘Great Escape' took place. In January 1945, during a prisoner move, Tuck and Polish airman Zbishek Kustrzynski were able to escape and make contact with advancing Soviet forces. They were returned to the UK in March 1945. Tuck remainders in the RAF until 1949, becoming a farmer in Kent before they passed away at the age of 70 in May 1987. In the years following the end of the Second World War, they became close friends with several German pilots, including Gunther Rall and Adolf Galland. This relationship helped foster a much closer bond between the two aviation communities of Britain and Germany post war. They were credited with 29 confirmed kills and 8 probables, although post war investigations uncovered a possible 30th kill. Their colleagues, both pilots and ground crew, remember them fondly as a level headed, down to earth and approachable leader.

Larry Harvey, left, appears at a press conference with Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., Steph Sherer of Americans for Safe Access and Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., on May 7, 2014, in Washington, D.C. Farr and Broun are among the co-sponsors of an amendment to protect people like Harvey, a medical marijuana user facing federal charges in Washington state. Steven Nelson for USNWR
President Barack Obama said in December 2012 their administration had “bigger fish to fry” than legal recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington. But some members of their Department of Justice have continued to wage war on medical marijuana in states that allow it.
That would end if a bipartisan amendment to a spending bill is adopted by the House of Representatives and ultimately becomes law.
Six Republicans and six Democrats, led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., are seeking to ban the Department of Justice – which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration and federal prosecutors – from using funds to go after medical marijuana in places where it's allowed by state law.
Floor debate on the spending bill begins Wednesday evening. The amendment may come up for a vote late Wednesday or on Thursday.
A similar amendment was defeated by a vote of 262-165 in 2007.
But reformers sense momentum. In the closest medical marijuana vote to-date, 195 members of the House – including 22 Republicans – voted April 30 to allow doctors at the Veterans Health Administration to discuss marijuana as medicine with patients without institutional penalties. That effort was defeated, with 222 members voting against the proposal.
Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., said following that vote some members changed their minds and some supporters were absent.
Demonstrating the shifting inclinations of Congress, one of the 222 “no” votes, Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., introduced a bill to remove barriers to doctors prescribing marijuana. They told U.S. News they believe pot should be available at pharmacies and covered by health insurance, but said they were concerned about inviting VA doctors to break the law.
National polls show overwhelming support for legal medical marijuana. CBS News gauged support at 86 percent in January and Fox News found 85 percent support in February 2013.
“I think the tables are turning, I'm trying to be optimistic that Congress can act consistently with the popular support for this issue,” says Kris Hermes, a spokesperson for the grass-roots medical marijuana advocacy group Americans for Safe Access (ASA).
ASA estimated in a report it released last year that the cost of federal enforcement against medical marijuana was more than $100 million in 2012, part of a three-year spike in the cost of investigating, prosecuting and incarcerating people who comply with state laws. The group estimated Obama's Justice Department had thus far spent nearly $300 million combating medical marijuana, compared to less than $200 million spent during the entire George W. Bush administration.
“We welcome any clarification or correction that the Justice Department would like to make to our numbers,” Hermes says.
In one of the most high-profile recent prosecutions, the so-called Kettle Falls 5 – a family of four, plus a friend – are facing long federal prison sentences, including mandatory minimums. The five have medical conditions that qualify them to use marijuana under Washington state law, and admittedly tended a pot garden in a rural area.

The eldest of the five defendants, 70-year-old Larry Harvey, joined Farr and Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., near the U.S. Capitol on May 7 for a news conference. They cheerfully told reporters about how their wife cooked marijuana cookies, which they ate to alleviate severe knee pain.
Attorney General Eric Holder said in August federal prosecutors should begin avoiding charges that carry mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug crimes. But the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington and others are not bound by that guidance.
ASA is asking supporters to contact their member of Congress ahead of the amendment vote.
“We're close, we're definitely within striking distance,” says Mike Liszewski, ASA's government affairs director. “There's a growing number of members who have constituencies that are directly affected.”
Twenty-one states (soon 22) and Washington, D.C. have legalized medical marijuana, beginning with California in the late 1990s. Others states have dated laws allowing doctors to write prescriptions for marijuana that have not taken effect, or have recently legalized more limited cannabis-derived treatments.
Marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical value. Obama has resisted calls to administratively reschedule the drug – which they have the power to do – and legislative attempts have thus far stagnated. Doctors cannot prescribe Schedule I drug, so states that allow marijuana for medical use instead allow doctors to “recommend” it to qualifying patients.
Rohrabacher's amendment lists 28 states and D.C. by name as exempted from federal enforcement against medical marijuana laws. Their 11 co-sponsors are Farr, Broun and Reps. Justin Amash, R-Mich., Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Tom McClintock, R-Calif., Jared Polis, D-Colo., Steve Stockman, R-Texas, Dina Tius, D-Nev., and Don Young, R-Alaska.

Tech industry slips into a surprising slump
After a six-year boom ignited by the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, tech firms are in the unusual position of being laggards in the U.S. economy's recovery.
Though there are still bright spots among companies that help manage data or provide cybersecurity, many of the industry's biggest companies — Microsoft, Google, IBM and Dell — are struggling to figure out the changes in the way businesses and consumers are buying and using technology.
After a remarkable six-year boom set off by the introduction of the first iPhone in 2007, tech companies of all shapes and sizes are finding growth slowing, and even contracting in some cases.
The announcement Thursday that Silicon Valley giant Cisco Systems, which sells networking and telecommunications equipment, plans to cut 4,000 jobs is the latest sign of a slowdown that has sucker-punched high-tech firms.
SAN FRANCISCO — In a surprising turn, the tech industry is in a slump even as the U.S. economy picks up steam.
There even have been signs that tech's dysfunction was having a wider effect. When Wal-Mart reported disappointing earnings Thursday, the company's executives pointed the finger at consumer electronics for a lack of exciting new products.
"Our performance was pressured by soft results in both electronics and media and gaming," said William Simon, a Wal-Mart president and executive vice president, on the company's earnings call with analysts.
It's not a bust — not yet at least. And it isn't as serious as the 2000 dot-com crash, when tech's fortunes quickly deteriorated. Indeed, on the ground in Silicon Valley, there is a bit of a disconnect because competition for hiring remains intense.
But in recent months, tech earnings have plummeted as tech companies have reported slower growth or declines. Venture capital has fallen almost 7% this year. Tech mergers and acquisitions have tumbled. And tech stocks have lagged the broader stock market this year. As of early August, the S&P 500 was up 19.68%, but tech stocks in the index were up only 11.1%, one of the lowest-performing categories.
While observers fumble for explanations and many remain optimistic about tech's long-term outlook, the industry is wondering whether this slump is simply a pause or the new normal.
"What I've seen is that a lot of the tech heavyweights are having challenges," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. "There's a fundamental shift in the marketplace that many people are grappling with. What we're seeing is a transitional period."
And tech finds itself in the unusual position of being a laggard in the economy's recovery.
"Technology remains a big drag on earnings growth," Zacks Investment Research analyst Sheraz Mian wrote in a recent report. "The sector's earnings picture is very poor."
Being labeled a "drag" is the ultimate insult for an industry that likes its growth fast and furious. But why has tech lost its mojo?
There doesn't seem to be a single villain.
Mian chalks it up to the lackluster global economy. Tech firms are increasingly dependent on sales and profits abroad, where corporate spending remains weak. In the U.S., others have pointed to the faster-than-expected collapse of PC sales.
"That's having a ripple effect through a lot of sectors of technology," said Greg Harrison, a corporate earnings research analyst at Thomson Reuters.

The party, a swanky roof-top affair in New York City, was called “On Top.” I was feeling even more on-top than most, considering the 9-inch, Jeffery Campbell heels I was wearing. I also had on my one-of-a-kind black sequin jacket—the one that, when the designer said, “It's vintage,” I said, “Say no more.”
My face was painted club-kid chic, and, despite my broad shoulders, I moved around with a certain sassy elegance: All-in-all, I was definitely serving some femme realness. Alone, I blended in quite nicely with the queer mosaic of the crowd. However, I was with my ex-girlfriend, and as we passionately made our bodies and lips into one on the dancefloor, it wasn't my look that was turning people's heads. It was the juxtaposition of my femme presentation with the clear fact that I was getting hot and heavy with a woman.
I'm bisexual, and though I've never once identified as gay (not even when I came out as a teenager 10 years ago), that label is an assumption I face regularly—especially from those who've known me when I've been dating men. That I don't mind playing up my femme side from time to time doesn't help either. Suffice it to say, the looks of confusion my ex and I were greeted with that night were not the first I've received.
Here's the trouble: While femininity can be dangerous for gay men, it is somewhat expected of them—a form of behavior or mode of self-presentation they are “allowed.” For bi guys like me, even a little femininity threatens to erase our entire identity.
Just being bi is already hard enough. Both the straight and LGBTQ community regularly speculate on the veracity of my sexuality. I am told I don't exist or that I'm going through a phase. Or I just get placed in the gay or straight box against my will. Dating can be especially difficult. I once had a gay guy tell me, during a night out, that I had “vagina cooties”—there wasn't a second date. This sort of creepy scrutiny is one of the most annoying parts of being bi. But the invalidation of our sexualities only grows when bisexual individuals don't express their gender identities in conventional ways.
There are spaces for gay men, lesbian women, bisexual women, and trans women to express femininity. There are few, if any, arenas in which bisexual men, queer in our own right, have the space to express femininity without fear of our sexuality being nullified. There is a deeply ingrained misconception that a man can't be romantically involved with another man and still be interested in women as well. That is because masculinity, or at least the most basic stereotype of it, is meant to be dominant and to attract femininity. Femininity, on the other hand, is weak and attracts masculinity. Male bisexuality, even when it is embodied in a traditionally masculine person, already blurs the lines between those outdated and severely limiting misconceptions. Add femme behavior, and you've really got a problem.
To be clear, these gender misconceptions hurt gays and lesbians, too. Many people automatically assume butch women are lesbians because of their masculinity, and those same people show surprise when feminine women identify as lesbian. For gay men, any expression of femininity can lead to regressive associations with sexual preferences (a more masculine guy is presumed to be a “top,” while a more feminine guy gets cast as the “bottom”). In these ways and many others, gender stereotypes hamper everyone in the queer community—but there are some distinct ways in which they hurt bisexual men.
While part of me wants to identify proudly as femme, I'm wary of doing so, because I know it will only cause me grief. To be sure, I am generally more feminine than stereotypical masculinity allows—but my gender expression varies. Sometimes I present more masculine—working outside in a fitted cap and basketball shorts. Other times I'm more feminine: I've been known to go out in crop tops and metallic eye shadow. I always present and identify as a man; it's just that, sometimes I'm a man who acts more feminine. Still, I don't often self-describe as “femme,” because it hasn't worked out well in the past. Aside from confusing people with regard to my sexuality, it also hurts my chances with straight women.
In my freshmen year of college, a girl I was seeing for a few months ended the relationship because of my femininity. “Do you doubt my attraction to you?” I asked them when they broke the news of our breakup. “No. Not at all,” they responded. (If anything, our relationship was far more physical than anything else.) “Then what's the deal?” I asked, knowing their answer before they even said it. “My friends tease me for having a ‘gay boyfriend.' ”
Despite my very clear attraction to my ex-girlfriend, she, like many straight women, allowed gender stereotypes to end our relationship. I guess I could batch it up to keep the speculations at bay and land more straight women. But that would be denying parts of myself instead of celebrating all of my identity. Clearly, these gender ideas are an impediment to the diversity of the rainbow community. They say that a man has to act and present a certain way in order to date another man or another woman. But we know better than that: We should all be validated and allowed to live the truth of our own experiences.
That's why I believe femme bisexual men can be revolutionary. We can push back against those normative boxes, creating space for a more complex understanding of sexuality and gender expression. Our femininity explodes the idea that a gender expression, or gender identity, must be intrinsically tied to a certain sexuality. Femme bi men have the power to redefine manhood in ways that aren't rooted in archaic heterosexual ideals. We can help create a society in which a bisexual man in a crop top can be seen holding hands with a girl and turn heads—but only for being one half of a hot couple.
What will it take to shut down Monsanto's doors irrevocably? Likely it will be the same type of lawsuit that finally pulled the shades on the tobacco industry. If Big Tobacco eventually had to pay a $206 billion settlement over 25 years for lying about the health impacts of cigarettes, what do you think Monsanto will have to pay for lying about glyphosate's carcinogenic nature for almost 40 years?
Some well-respected researchers are now saying that Monsanto demanded incriminating data and reports be sealed and locked away from public scrutiny as proprietary trade secrets, though they knew these documents would reveal glyphosate's carcinogenic nature.
Monsanto has yet to be caught red-handed lying about research, but the corp has been caught twice when they utilized outside laboratories that were later found to have been criminal. In 1978, the EPA busted Industrial Biotest Laboratories for rigging laboratory results; the company's executives were found guilty for submitting fabricated data supporting glyphosate in positive light to the government. In 1991, another firm, Craven Labs, was found guilty on similar charges with 20 felony counts. Monsanto's timeline of crime is undeniable. [1]
The EPA continually colludes with Monsanto to present glyphosate as ‘safe' to the public, but during an exclusive interview on the Progressive Radio Network on September 4, Anthony Samsel stated that Monsanto used an industry trick to dismiss evidence about glyphosate's risks in its own research. “Monsanto misrepresented the data,” says Samsel, “and deliberately covered up data to bring the product [glyphosate] to market.”
Samsel, an independent research scientist and a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, explains, along with Dr. Stephanie Seneff, that in order to minimize and cancel out its adverse findings:
“Monsanto had relied upon earlier historical animal control data, toxicological research with lab animals afflicted with cancer and organ failures, and completely unrelated to glyphosate. In some cases the control animals displayed kidney, liver and pancreatic diseases. Many of Monsanto's own studies required the inclusion of extraneous studies in order to cancel out damaging results. This is not an uncommon industry habit, particularly in toxicological science. It enables corporations to mask undesirable outcomes and make claims that observable illnesses and disease are spontaneous occurrences without known causal factors. Frequently, Monsanto would have to rely on three external control studies to negate the adverse effects of a single one of its own. Samsel found other incidences in Monsanto's data where 5, 7 and in one case 11 unrelated studies were necessary to diminish the severity of its own findings. In effect, glyphosate received licensure based upon a platform of junk tobacco science.”
The researchers go on to explain that Monsanto covered up the fact that glyphosate was equally toxic in both low and high range doses. These findings are corroborated by a recent study from France published in the August issue of the Environmental Health Journal by scientists at King's College London and the University of Caen in France.
The two year study found that glyphosate administered at an ultra-low dose of 0.1 ppb (the EU's safety limit) in drinking water altered over 4000 gene clusters in the livers and kidneys of rats, though the biotech industry has been trying to debunk its findings.
So what information is hiding in Monsanto's sealed documents?
Among the many cancers and diseases associated with glyphosate are:
Adenoma cancer in the pituitary gland
Glioma tumors in the brain
Reticular cell sarcomas in the heart
Malignant tumors in the lungs
Salivary mandibular reticular cell carcinoma
Metastatic sarcomas of the lymph gland
Prostate carcinoma
Cancer of the bladder
Thyroid carcinoma
Adrenal reticulum cell sarcomas
Cortical adenomas
Basal cell squamous skin tumors
Yet these were all hidden from public view. I think that hundreds of billions of dollars won't come close to account for the 40 years of health damage Monsanto has potentially caused by hiding this information. But one thing is certain, just like the Tobacco industry – Monsanto will pay.

Guest essay by Alberto Zaragoza Comendador
In the past I've provided estimates of the money Tesla has made off this mysterious feature enabled by credits authorized by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). These estimates were very simplistic: basically I multiplied their ZEV revenue by 0.35 or a similar number.
Now, I have something more precise with references to back it up.
Key data points:
Key assumptions:
For simplicity purposes, I assume all S85s sold in California since and including Q4 benefited from the ZEV reclassification. That is, they moved from 4 to 7 ZEV credits. I'm including 12 days' worth of sales in 2012Q4, but they were still ramping up production then so it must be less than 10% of the quarter's sales. In any case it does not affect the overall math.
In 2012Q4, 1,500 Model S were sold in the state.
90% of Tesla ZEV revenue comes from California.
In 2012Q4, ZEV revenue was $35 million. We know that for all of 2012 it was $40.5 million and it was concentrated in Q4 (they didn't even mention it in the other quarters). We also know that the $40.5 million figure includes undisclosed but small revenue from GHG credits.
Tesla had 0 ZEV credits as of October 1st, 2012. Very small room for mistake here, as they could have a tiny quantity left over from the Roadster or the few Model S deliveries earlier in 2012.
If you think some assumptions are unrealistic or whatever, fine. The Excel document is free for anybody to download and tinker with.
So how much is the battery swap worth?
There are two questions here: how many of those extra credits they have sold, and how many they have earned but not sold.
One can envision any number of scenarios, but as you'll see, no matter how you square the numbers Tesla stands to make a lot of money off the battery swap.
· Assuming a 60% S85 mix, Tesla earned 51,029 ZEV credits from 2012Q4 to 2013Q3. Of these, 32,148 were standard and 18,881 were extra. Since Tesla transferred 37,742 credits to other manufacturers in the same period, the conclusion is that they sold their entire standard allotment, and then an extra 5,594 credits. So the extra ones made up 14.8% of their sales. With ZEV revenue in California at $148.3 million for the period, this would mean the company got $22 million it wouldn't have gotten without the battery swap.
· Under the same 60% mix, Tesla would still have 13,287 credits in its balance at the end of 2013Q3, all of them extra. (CARB's website says they had 7,888, which suggests they transferred credits to other states). When adding those they earned in 2013Q4, the number rises to 24,404, of which 17,772 were extra.
· So in this period they sold 37,742 credits for $148.3 million, which gives a per-credit price of $3,929. If Tesla just manages to get the same price it has gotten so far, their remaining extra credits will be worth $69.8 million.
Yeah. More than $90 million in total. And that's only the ones they got before January 1st, 2014. With about 1,800 Model S sales in California, the value of their remaining credits grows by about $15 million – every quarter.
It happens that the fine for not meeting ZEV requirements is $5,000 per credit (see slide 93), so that's about the maximum other carmakers are willing to pay for these things. Our $3,929 figure is therefore in the right ballpark, and it shows Tesla's revenue from California ZEV credits couldn't have been much lower than the figure I offered ($148.3 million).
In the Excel I've uploaded, I assumed a 60% mix. But you can just change the numbers to see what happens. Keep in mind that sales mix does not affect the number of standard credits they earn, because both the S60 and the S85 get 4 of those: it only affects the number of extra credits.
Even so, I offered an absurdly high estimate of Tesla's California sales for 2012Q4 (2,400, which were in fact their global sales), so as to increase their standard credits. Assuming 80% of Model S sales were S85s, the results would be:
· 35,748 standard credits earned in 2012Q4-2013Q3, plus 24,196 extra ones
· So if they sold 37,742 credits, that means they sold their entire standard batch and 1,994 extra ones. In turn, that means 5.3% of their ZEV revenue was thanks to the battery swap.
· That's “only” $7.9 million. But if they sold so few extra credits…
· …the result is they had 22,204 in balance at the end of 2013Q3. Remember CARB's website says they had 7,888, so either they transferred massive amounts to other states or there's something else I'm missing.
· Add in their numbers for 2013Q4 and they have 34,038 in the bank, of which 26,866 were extra.
· And which, at a selling price of $3,929, would be worth $105.6 million.
Yikes.
“But they won't be able to sell so many credits! The market will get saturated!”
Really?
Here's a reminder of how the ZEV mandate works. It requires every major manufacturer to sell a given percentage of zero-emission vehicles, and by 2025 it will reach 15% Even if the state as a whole passes that threshold (EV sales were 1% of the market last year), many manufacturers no doubt will fall below and will need to buy credits. And if history is any guide, the program will not be withdrawn in 2025. EV advocates will say the technology still hasn't reached critical mass, whatever that means.
It's true the market is oversupplied right now. But starting in January 2018, all credits will be allotted according to range alone, not refueling time – this will effectively close the battery swap loophole. More importantly, the number of credits per car will be drastically reduced, as 3 will be the maximum – no matter if your electric car goes 300 or 500 miles. See slide 66 of the previous document.
Get this: right now, Tesla gets about 6.5 ZEV credits every time it sells a car. The market cannot buy all those credits so they keep thousands in the bank and transfer thousands more to states other than California.
Then comes 2018, the ZEV requirements have gotten much stricter, and every car gets 3 credits at most. Meaning there will be no manufacturer with an excess of credits it can sell. And there will probably be many with a deficit. And Tesla will have a huge balance of credits from the good old battery swap days.
Tesla is playing the long game.
Oh, and the company may have the opportunity to stockpile even more credits before the supply gets tight, because Type V ZEVs will get 9 credits instead of 7 in the 2015-2017 period. It's unclear whether regulators will allow this, as CARB has stated it intends to exclude battery swap from the fast-refueling category at the end of this year; that would bring Tesla back to 4 credits per car. Other carmakers are going to sell hydrogen vehicles in that period which also qualify for the 9 credits because of their range and refueling time, and they're probably protesting the privileged treatment Tesla gets.
But if the loophole isn't closed, the company will be getting an average of about 8 credits per vehicle: twice what they would get without the swap.
Even if you assume the price of these credits will crash, the sums are still substantial. For $1,000 per credit, in the 60% mix Tesla would get an additional $17.8 million for the extra credits it had in balance at the end of 2013 – plus the $22 million in extras it had already sold. Remember that's only from those they had earned before 2014. So a price collapse will mean they'll only get $39.8 million from this once-demoed-and-never-heard-of-again feature.
Let's use the same price with the second scenario: 80% S85 mix and 2,400 California sales in 2012Q4. Their 26,866 extra credits are now worth $26.9 million, which combined with the $7.9 million they had already earned gives us $34.8 million. Again, that doesn't include any credits they earn in 2014 and beyond.
And all of the above assumes there is a mega-crash in the price of ZEV credits – a 75% decline. Need I remind you that electric cars have never broken into the mainstream, and in theory every manufacturer must get 8% of its sales from these vehicles? And if they don't reach that figure, their only way to avoid $5,000 fines is by buying those credits?
There is no question Tesla will sell all of its credits. The only question is for what price.
Final thoughts
Some will argue that the credits they have already sold aren't worth that much – about $20 million. But that's missing the point. Tesla faces no penalty for stockpiling these credits forever. Even if the regulation changes the minute this article is published, and the battery swap loophole is closed, Tesla will get to keep the credits it has in the bank.
No doubt they hope to wait and sell them when everybody has forgotten about the whole battery swap charade.
So don't forget. Don't let them get away with this. Spread the message, and next time the company comes up in a conversation, remember to politely direct the other speakers to this post. And this one, too.
Next time you hear about these guys, remember.

In American politics today, the Republican Party is the party of infighting. From primary challenges for incumbents to battles over tactics in Congress (see: the 2013 shutdown), Republicans love to fight with themselves. And the conservative wing of the party often gets its way.
Ipso facto, the Republican Party is more extreme than the Democratic Party -- or at least more polarized. Right?
Not necessarily. As John Sides wrote on the Monkey Cage blog Sunday, the religious freedom fight is a good example of this phenomenon. While Republicans are surely conflicted on laws like the one in Indiana, so in fact are Democrats -- and in very similar numbers.
From Sides:
Yes, Republicans are more divided than Democrats on basic support of same-sex marriage. ... But Democrats are actually slightly more divided than Republicans on the religious freedom measures. In this Pew survey, Republicans split 68 percent to 28 percent in favor of allowing businesses to refuse services for same-sex couples, while Democrats split 64 percent to 33 percent in favor of requiring business to provide services to all customers.
Yet only one party had its internecine battle on display for the nation to see: the GOP. And it was just the latest example of Republicans having it out in a very public manner. While Democrats used to be the party of infighting, that's no longer the case.
And it's not just religious freedom. In fact, the new Washington Post-ABC poll tested a number of issues to see just how polarized the bases of either party were.
The chart below shows what percentage of the two parties' bases feels "extremely" or "very" strongly that they would like to have a candidate who has a given position on a given issue. So on Obamacare, it would be the percentage of Democrats who feel "extremely" or "very" strongly that the law should be kept, while it would be the percentage of Republicans who feel that strongly that the law should be repealed. Ditto when it comes to climate change (Democrats favoring government action, Republicans opposing government action), the Iran agreement (Democrats for, Republicans against), a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants (you get the idea) and the no-new tax pledge (which we addressed last week).
As you can see, there isn't a whole lot of difference when it comes to how strongly the bases of the two parties feel on these issues. And Democrats are significantly more forceful when it comes to the no-new-tax pledge and climate change.
[Guess who doesn't much care for that no-new-tax pledge: Republicans]
And yet, despite just 21 percent of Republicans being strongly opposed to government action on climate change, that's the GOP's modus operandi -- which is a pretty good microcosm of the party at large. There is a huge premium in the GOP on purity and not letting anyone (a primary challenger, for instance) out-conservative you -- even when the base's position isn't one shared or emphasized by huge swaths of the party. The no-new-tax pledge is similar; just 19 percent of Republicans say it's at least very important that candidates sign it, and yet just about every Republican does so.
And it's in large part because conservatives and the tea party (and Grover Norquist on the tax pledge) have instilled the fear of God in Republican members of Congress by defeating just a handful of them in primaries over the last few elections. On the Democratic side, there simply isn't the same kind of fear and intraparty activism.
[Climate change is more of a priority for voters than you might think]
Which is a big reason why the GOP today is so torn between pragmatism/the establishment and purity/the conservative base. It's not necessarily because the Republican base is that much more right-wing than the Democrats are left-wing -- though reasonable people can disagree on that point -- it's more because the right wing has found a way to be much more dominant within its party than its counterpart on the left.
To borrow a basketball metaphor, the conservative base is like a small forward who grabs lots of rebounds and blocks shots -- it plays bigger than it is.
The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, addresses Trades Union Congress 2015 Congress in Brighton.
Leslie, thank you for that generous introduction. Congress, I am reliably informed that the height of the podium has been specially adjusted for my benefit. This does, however, allow me to puncture the prevalent myth that I am the shortest man ever to be Speaker of the House of Commons. Sir John Bussy, Speaker of the House from 1394 to 1398; Sir John Wenlock, Speaker from 1455 to 1456 and Sir Thomas Tresham, Speaker in 1459 are all believed to have been shorter than I am, although I do have to admit that this was true only after all three of them had been beheaded.
Congress, I am truly delighted to be here and for two reasons. First, become I come at the invitation, and I am now happy to be in the company, of your outstanding General Secretary, Frances O'Grady. (Applause) Secondly, because I believe in the work of trade unions, and that belief has been buttressed and reinforced by my own interaction as Speaker with unions in the House of Commons. The work that you do in resolving grievances, in standing up for the disadvantaged and in acting as agents of progressive change is important work which deserves respect, and it certainly has mine.
This year, in the Palace of Westminster, we are marking, as has been mentioned, the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta, and the 750th anniversary of the first English Parliament instigated by the rebel baron, Simon de Montfort. I am not trying to pretend or to hoodwink you in any way into supposing that Simon de Montfort was some sort of Martin Luther King figure on horseback, or that they were an avowed opponent of the feudal system, for they were not. They are, as I have said, a baron, a baron with interests of their own, and a baron with an agenda to match those interests. That said, Congress, the Magna Carta and the De Montfort Parliament did hand down to us a number of important principles which are as valid and as compelling today as they were then. First, that all power, unless subject to strong checks and balances, will tend to be used arbitrarily or even despotically. Secondly, that legitimacy is derived through representation, not acquired by might nor majesty, and, thirdly, that we must be governed by the rule of law, not principally in order to protect those with wealth or power, but principally, by contrast, in order to protect those without either wealth or power. Those fundamental principles are at the heart of our national history, our national narrative and our national institutions, whether uttered in medieval Latin or in modern Parliaments, the case for the accountability of power is the same and just as strong.
As the late Tony Benn was fond of observing: “Whenever I meet anybody with power, I always ask that person five questions. What power have you got; who gave it to you; in whose interests do you exercise it; to whom are you accountable, and how can we get rid of you?”
Congress, I mentioned our anniversaries. I mention to you also that this year, as part of the anniversaries programme, the House of Commons is staging a Festival of Freedoms, and centre stage in that Festival of Freedoms — I hope you agree rightly so — is the heroic struggle of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. (Applause) In recognising and celebrating their heroic struggle, we have to remember that that struggle was not merely an historic struggle. All too often, it is a current struggle as well, and that struggle is most assuredly an international struggle. It is hugely and enduringly to the credit, both of the TUC and of affiliated unions, that you are backing, from Belarus to Colombia, from Saudia Arabia to Zimbabwe, people to enjoy the rights in their countries which we have so long enjoyed and, probably, been inclined to take for granted in ours.
I have talked to you about anniversaries, celebrations, struggles and the accountability of power. What about the management of the House of Commons as a Parliamentary estate and the discharge of our obligations as an employer? Congress, I must tell you that when in 2009 I stood for election as Speaker, I was all too keenly aware that there was a shooting gallery on the Parliamentary estate but no nursery that could be used by the children of Members or the children of staff of the House. This bullets-before-babies ethos struck me as inherently perverse. I resolved at once, with the support of colleagues, to change it without delay. We quickly identified a suitable site to be a workplace nursery, and then met the objection that it would involve the destruction of a bar. Congress, this did not seem to me to be a powerful objection. There is, after all, no shortage of watering holes on the Parliamentary estate. There was no shortage of places where you could get a beer, but there was nowhere that you could put a baby, so I pressed ahead, with the support of the House of Commons Commission, and we established that nursery. Five years on, I am proud to tell you that that nursery is well resourced, well managed and it is well used. I don't suggest to you, job done, that somehow we are transformed as an employer or a workplace or an institution, but I do think it has done something to normalise the work-life balance and, dare I say it, perhaps, to make the House of Commons look a little more like the country that we aspire to represent. So that was a start.
A couple of years ago I asked a senior House of Commons official if everyone employed by or working as a contractor to the House of Commons was paid at least the London Living Wage. It transpired that some were not. That seemed to me plain wrong. Once again, I resolved that that must be changed. Today I am proud to tell you that everyone employed by or working as a contractor to the House of Commons is paid at least the London Living Wage, and we have our accreditation from the Living Wage Foundation. (Applause) Surely, that was the right thing to do, both for the benefit of the individual employees themselves and in turn of what it said about the DNA of the institution, a matter, you might think, not just of money but of ethics to boot.
To be candid, I was even more shocked 18 months or so ago, and, if I am honest about it, rank embarrassed to learn that more than 100 people employed by the House of Commons were employed on zero-hours contracts. It did not seem to have happened as a result of any democratic decision or conscious choice. They had mushroomed. They had grown like Topsy. They had simply come about almost, if you will, by accident. That seemed to me to be wrong, exploitative and indefensible. Once again, with the support of colleagues on the House of Commons Commission, I decided that that must be changed. I am equally proud to be able to tell you today that no one is employed by the House of Commons on a zero-hours contract against their or their will, and everybody who was has since been offered a minimum hours guarantee instead. That is, surely, right in terms of our culture and the message that we send as an exemplar organisation to the wider electorate.
Since my election as Speaker a key theme and personal passion for me has been to build links with and to offer support to young people. For years there had been in the ether plans for the establishment of an education centre in the House of Commons, but nothing had happened. We worked at it, we developed the plans, we got the permission from the local authority, we established the make-up of the site and the contents that would go into it. I am delighted to be able to tell you that we have now opened a new state-of-the-art, cutting edge, digital, interactive Education Centre in the Palace of Westminster, which will allow more than a doubling of the young people who can come to Parliament and learn about the arduous journey to the rights and representations which we all enjoy today. That is part of the equation but it is not all that is required.
Again, back in 2009, I said, in standing for Speaker, that I wanted to build a good relationship with the UK Youth Parliament. Every year since 2009 it has been my privilege to go to the UK Youth Parliament Annual Conference, wherever it has taken place in the country, to talk to and hear from young people, because they are the future of our democracy and, in a very real sense, the future of our country. Similarly, every year I have been proud to chair the proceedings of the UK Youth Parliament on a non-sitting Friday in the Chamber of the House of Commons. I do that, which I regard as an honour, for two reasons. First, because I want to offer that supportive encouragement to young people and, secondly, Congress, because I believe very simply that if we in Parliament want to be respected by young people, we have to show some respect for young people. Respect is not an automatic right. It is an earned entitlement or, to put it another way, respect is a two-way street.
Congress, 30 years ago, when I started out in politics as a right-wing Conservative student leader, I would not have wanted to address the TUC, and, believe me, you would not have wanted to be addressed by me. Today I am proud to be here, proud to be amongst your number and proud to be your guest. I say that because I respect and admire the invaluable and precious work that you do, the work that you do in promoting fairness in the workplace and the wider work that you do in pursuit of greater equality across society as a whole.
Thank you for having me. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your forbearance and, thank you, indeed, for your generosity of spirit. I wish you all the best, both for a successful Conference and in your activities in the year ahead. Thank you very much indeed.
The weather is warming up and my wrists are feeling rather lonely and bare after hiding under long sleeves all season long. But after digging up last year's DIY friendship bracelets, I realized they desperately needed sparkly and shiny upgrades. Today we're showing you three easy ways to embellish your friendship bracelets, making them all grown up . . .
Thread the needle with embroidery floss and tie the end into a double knot. Push the needle through the back of bracelet. Lay the rhinestone chain along the middle of the bracelet, using the chevron pattern as a guide.
Stitch the floss between the first two rhinestone links, pushing needle out the middle of the bracelet. Bring the needle back through the middle, this time further down between the second and third links.
Continue stitching between the rhinestone links. After the very last stitch, tie a double knot on the backside and trim the ends.
Your friendship bracelet is sparkling and finished!
To add studs, you'll need: a chevron friendship bracelet (tutorial found here)
5 3/8” brass cone studs (last used here)
a pair of small, sharp scissors
a screwdriver
Use a Sharpie or marker to make 5 evenly spaced marks along the middle of the friendship bracelet. From the backside, push the point of the scissors through the mark to create a hole.
Push a screw through the hole. Twist the coned spike onto the screw and use a screwdriver to tighten.
Repeat the steps with the rest of the spikes. Voila! Your friendship bracelet has a spiked spine.
To add chain, you'll need: a friendship bracelet (tutorial found here)
5-6” of brass curb chain
1 yard of embroidery floss
an embroidery needle
a pair of scissors
Thread the needle with embroidery floss. Untie one end of the friendship bracelet and re-knot it with the tail of the threaded embroidery floss. Push the needle through the outer edge of the backside of the bracelet.
Lay the chain flat, against the edge of the bracelet. Thread the needle over and through the first link. Push the needle though the backside about two rows down. Depending on the width of each link, the row count may vary.
Keep stitching. Make two stitches around the last link, untie the knot and re-knot with the last of the floss. Trim away any excess.
Your chain trimmed friendship bracelet now has an edge – how simple was that?
Stack 'em, give 'em away and you're officially ready for summer.

CLEVELAND, OHIO―Today, Ramón Ortiz filed a lawsuit to enforce a public-records request to the City of Cleveland for records that would reveal whether the police chief or safety director have taken any disciplinary action against officers for the August 16, 2010 attack on Mr. Ortiz's son Juan, and for shouting racial slurs at the Ortiz family. Juan Ortiz suffers from severe Down syndrome, which is visibly evident in their facial features. At the time of the attack, they were under 4'11" tall, weighed approximately 118 pounds, and was 16-years old. Their ancestry is Puerto Rican and their complexion is dark.
Sixteen-year-old Juan Ortiz in the hospital after Cleveland police officers slammed them against a hot car and hurt him.
One year ago today, the City agreed to pay a $250,000 settlement stemming from the 2010 incident, but no indication exists that Cleveland has held the officers to account for their actions.
According to the 2011 federal civil-rights complaint the Ortiz family filed, on August 16, 2010, Juan was playing in the yard at their west-side apartment complex listening to their Walkman. There was a robbery reported near the complex, and police were looking for a good-Samaritan white male in their fifties, possibly wearing a red shirt, who had turned in a wallet to the apartment manager. Patrol officer Brian Kazimer shouted at and began chasing Juan.
Startled, Juan ran to their parents on the other side of the parking lot. According to eyewitness testimony, Kazimer wrenched Juan from their mother's arms and slammed them against a parked SUV. Kazimer pinned Juan to the hot car―causing them to sustain burns to their lower abdomen requiring surgery. Kazimer yanked Juan's arms over their head, employing grossly excessive force to restrain a non-resisting suspect who Kazimer admitted had "surrendered" before Kazimer laid a hand on Juan. Kazimer told Juan's parents they were "lucky" they "didn't shoot" Juan.
The attack left Juan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Ortiz family had to relocate out of state due to Juan's visceral and panicked reaction to subsequent sightings of Cleveland police officers and vehicles.
Numerous witnesses testified under penalty of perjury to the bigotry that permeated the violent detention of Juan including vulgar, obscene, and racist language toward Juan and their parents, who originate from the United States territory of Puerto Rico:
These white-supremacist views have no place in Cleveland's police force. Yet Kazimer and Crisan remain on the force today.
The family reported the attack to the City's Office of Professional Standards the following day. After briefly investigating, OPS sustained the charges against the officers and on November 9, 2010, the Civilian Police Review Board recommended that then-Chief Michael McGrath impose discipline.
But over seven years later, City officials refuse to tell the Ortizes whether it has done anything to hold these officers accountable.
If the City had fired Brian Kazimer and Dan Crisan in 2010 for their racist conduct and excessive force against a defenseless child, the City would have sent the message to its police force that using abusive tactics and excessive force against children would not be tolerated.
Perhaps 12-year-old Tamir Rice would not have been shot dead by Cleveland police four years later in a park just a few miles from where Juan was attacked.
But instead, the City promoted Crisan to sergeant from patrol officer with no apparent consideration of the incident. This seems to have breached ¶ 318(h), at a minimum, of the City's Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice. That paragraph requires that the City take pending discipline into account in the promotions process.
Our office filed Juan's initial federal civil-rights complaint against the officers on July 25, 2011. While the case was pending, the Chandra Law Firm continually followed up with the City about why the officers had not been disciplined. The firm sent letters in January 2013 and January 2014 to then-Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty, then-Chief Assistant City Prosecutor Victor Perez, then-Chief Michael McGrath, and OPS Chairman Thomas Jones requesting criminal prosecution or at least appropriate disciplinary action against these officers.
We received no substantive responses.
Our follow-up efforts included public-records requests to the City, simply trying to find out whether Chief Calvin Williams and Public Safety Director Michael McGrath have done their jobs and disciplined the officers.
We learned in September 2016 that the City had for years withheld public records about pre-disciplinary hearings set for Kazimer and Crisan in August 2011 that the chief held in abeyance pending the litigation's outcome. The City never produced the records about Kazimer and Crisan as part of its response to a federal-court subpoena for such records―even though the records were plainly responsive to the subpoena.
There was and is no written City policy permitting officers to avoid discipline because they were or are being sued for misconduct.
In October 2016, we then filed a federal civil-rights complaint for Juan Ortiz against the Cityfor its failure to train the officers and its apparent informal policy and practice of not disciplining them.
After the City in October 2016 settled these federal civil-rights cases for $250,000 on the eve of trial, we sent a December 7 letter to Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams asking them to thoroughly investigate the officers' conduct and appropriately discipline these officers to quell racially biased and abusive policing in our City. The letter explained that the family would be unable to put this incident behind them until the officers were held accountable, per the Civilian Police Review Board's 2010 recommendation
In a December 8, 2016 follow-up letter to Chief Williams, we explained how promoting Crisan to Sergeant in the fall of 2015 without considering the disciplinary charges against them violated ¶ 318(h) of the Consent Decree in United States v. City of Cleveland.
We receive no response to either letter. We forwarded this correspondence to the federal-court- appointed monitor in charge of implementing Cleveland's Consent Decree. Although the monitor acknowledged receipt, we are unaware of any enforcement action that was taken.
Nearly a year later―and over seven years after the attack on Juan and the racist slurs against their family―we have no evidence that these officers have been disciplined―or will ever be disciplined―for what they did.
On September 28, 2017, we sent the City another public-records request for such records.The City did not provide any records or any substantive response to the request.
City personnel have ignored our follow-up requests for compliance with Ohio's Public Records Act.
The Ortiz family's quest to seek justice continues even as U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver, who is overseeing the Consent Decree, has ordered that the City should come before them to explain why it is not acting on civilian complaints against police officers―complaints just like the Ortizes' seven-year-old complaint.
Judge Oliver's inquiry should extend to why Public Safety Director McGrath and Chief Calvin Williams
apparently have not disciplined Kazimer and Crisan, and
haven't afforded the Ortiz family the decency and courtesy of communication through their counsel about discipline.
We also asked Cleveland City Council Public Safety Committee Chairman Matt Zone to prod the chief and safety director into action. But no action has occurred.
Subodh Chandra, the Ortiz family's lead counsel, said, "City officials' failure to give closure to this family by communicating that they have disciplined officers who shouted racial slurs at them and brutalized their disabled child is unconscionable, obnoxious, and just plain rude. Does anyone at the City care to do their jobs, hold officers accountable, and be kind to this family and others? Why do officers who shout racist slurs at a family still have badges and guns?"
The case to enforce the recent public-records request was filed in the Ohio Court of Claims, and is case number 5593. Here is the complaint.

Kangaroo survives nine days with arrow through its head in central Victoria
Updated
A kangaroo is recovering from surgery after being shot with a bow and arrow in central Victoria about nine days ago.
Volunteers at Wildlife Victoria Helen Round said residents in Ashbourne contacted the organisation to report an injured kangaroo.
"The kangaroo had been peacefully living there, co-existing with the neighbours; he's a big beautiful gentle boy," they said.
"The residents of Ashbourne were absolutely devastated to see that this boy had been attacked."
Ms Round said rescuers have been unable to get within 30 metres of the kangaroo, known by locals as Spot, to fire a tranquilliser.
"We couldn't catch him, my partner [an animal rescuer] was employed by Wildlife Victoria to try to capture Spot, but the kangaroos there have been on high alert and we just couldn't get close enough," they said.
"These kangaroos have been so traumatised that it was almost impossible to approach them."
He's in with a real chance, he's a big strong healthy boy, who's done remarkably well for themselves considering their injury. Helen Round, Wildlife Victoria
Ms Round said they were finally able to dart the kangaroo at 8:00pm on Wednesday night.
"We got them to Lort Smith Animal Hospital [in Melbourne] at around 11:30pm last night, and they underwent surgery by the wonderful staff there," they said.
"We were really worried because the arrow wasn't moving or bouncing as if it was through the skin, so we thought it was through the skull, but fortunately it seems to have gone through the base of their ear and was attached in the gristle."
Dr Russell Harrison, of the Lort Smith Animal Hospital, said the kangaroo was "incredibly lucky" the arrow missed its skull.
"Our veterinary surgeon removed the arrow and cleaned and flushed the wound," they said.
"After waking Spot up, we administered painkillers and antibiotics.
"It is miraculous that the arrow didn't kill the kangaroo, or do any permanent damage.
The kangaroo is now recovering at a wildlife shelter in Kilmore, where it is likely to stay for six weeks.
"He's in with a real chance, he's a big strong healthy boy, who's done remarkably well for themselves considering their injury," they said.
"I'm just praying they can recover and that we can reunite them with their family because kangaroos live in complex family structures and their mob will miss and need him."
Dr Harrison said vets from the hospital will do a follow-up check in six weeks.

At first glance, Alabama Senator Luther Strange has everything going for them headed into the special election for their seat. Strange, who filled the Senate vacancy left by Jeff Sessions' appointment to serve as attorney general, enjoys the full financial support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He's been endorsed by Richard Shelby, the state's senior senator and former chairperson of the Senate Banking Committee. And as a former state attorney general, Strange has positioned themselves as a law-and-order candidate at a particularly scandal-rich moment for a state that has seen its share.
But there's someone who could make life complicated for Strange, and it's not an actual candidate. Though almost a dozen Republicans filed to run in the Republican primary and nearly that number signed up on the Democratic side, the biggest threat to Strange's bid is a burly man whose love of Auburn football is matched only by their grudge against Strange, who draws support from University of Alabama territory.
Story Continued Below
Jimmy Rane is the chairperson and CEO of the Great Southern Wood Preserving lumber company, whose signature product—YellaWood pressure-treated pine—is known to homebuilders everywhere. Rane's lumber colossus operates in 27 states and over a dozen countries with annual revenues of $700 million, which explains why Rane, 69, is considered Alabama's wealthiest citizen, according to Forbes. Rane is no recluse though. Rane is best known for a series of short web videos starring themselves as the “Yella Fella,” a wandering hero fighting bandits in a lemon-yellow cowboy outfit. The acting isn't quite Oscar quality, but Rane themselves stands out as a sort of poor man's Jimmy Stewart.
Rane is about to play a different role in the ongoing gothic drama that is Alabama politics.
The stakes are high, maybe not as bitter as the rivalry between the University of Alabama and Auburn, but close. Even in a year of unusually tight special elections brought about by Donald Trump's Cabinet nominations, the 2017 special election for Alabama's Senate seat is unique. The dynamic is far from simply Republican versus Democrat. It's not even hard-line conservative Republicans versus the party's dwindling moderate wing. This race comes down to the opposing factions in a corruption trial that last year took down the state's speaker of the House. The man leading the case was Strange, the state's attorney general. Strange pulled a number of the state's most prominent business people—including Rane—into the trial in unflattering ways, and that didn't sit well with a class of high-level executives who are accustomed to calling the shots from behind the scenes. So when Strange geared up to win the seat they had been appointed to, speculation about Rane's desire for payback started in earnest.
At first, there was talk Rane would run himself. They knocked those rumors down. Then their most likely preferred candidate begged off. But no one thinks Rane, with their deep pockets and deeper well of anger at Strange, will sit on the sidelines. While the NRSC will bring its war chest in defense of Strange, the betting money says Rane, and a like-minded cadre of other CEOs, will put together a formidable bankroll to block Strange.
“I believe there are people out there that are ready to set up a super PAC and lay out the message that it's best for Alabama to pick its own senator,” says Del Marsh, the Alabama Senate president pro tempore who had been weighing a Senate bid themselves until recently. “Jimmy Rane comes to the front of the list. ... He's going to probably ... create some sort of super PAC to do what they think needs to be done to make sure the right person was elected in the state of Alabama.”
Rane declined to speak about the race when asked, but they did put out a statement on May 17 that confirmed he's going to be a factor in deciding the outcome of the primary, scheduled for August 25.
“While I have decided not to run, I will continue to be an advocate for policies that matter most to the people of Alabama and to support leaders focused on education, fiscal responsibility, job growth, and the success of our state,” Rane said.
They didn't mention Strange, but they didn't have to. Everyone knows that's what's driving him.
***
The root of one of the biggest feuds in Alabama politics goes back to a decision to bring corruption charges against one of the most powerful politicians the state has ever seen. Mike Hubbard, the former Alabama House speaker, was a driving force behind a massive wave of GOP wins in 2010. Now, only four years later, Hubbard was being accused, by another Republican, no less, of soliciting lobbyists and using their position as the leader of the Alabama Republican Party to help businesses they were linked to. The man who brought the ethics case was Luther Strange, known as “Big Luther” for their imposing 6-foot-9 frame.
During the trial, Jimmy Rane, who is friends with Hubbard, was forced to testify alongside a number of Alabama political leaders, including former Alabama Governor Bob Riley, and business people such as Will Brooke, a founder of the Alabama-based Harbert Management Corporation. The prosecution asserted that Hubbard had solicited these men as investors in their business while they were House speaker. The prosecution argued that that was a crime, as Rane and the other business people had lobbyists on their payroll.
“Jimmy Rane was listed in one of the counts of corruption that Luther Strange's office investigated on him,” Alabama Republican strategist Chris Brown said. “This is like a revenge thing. They hate Luther because they drug their name through the mud. And that was one of the counts that, I believe, Mike Hubbard was acquitted on, but it's like Jimmy Rane is a wealthy guy, well-known. And Luther, you know, dirted [sic] him. Dragged them in front of the court and made them testify.”
Hubbard was ultimately convicted of 12 felony ethics violations and sentenced to four years in prison, with an additional eight years on probation.
Months after Hubbard was sent to prison, the pieces began to fall into place for some kind of score settling. Before stepping down in the midst of a sex scandal, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley had picked Strange to serve the rest of Sessions' term until a special election could be held. The appointment frustrated critics, who saw Strange as linking themselves too closely to Bentley in exchange for personal political gain. Strange had previously moved to slow down impeachment proceedings against the governor prior to being appointed to the Senate. Strange has denied any kind of pay for play.
To Hubbard allies and Strange critics, though, Strange's campaign is as good a chance as any to exact revenge.
“The Hubbard trial is their driving force for Luther,” a keyed-in Republican with ties to Marsh and Rane said. “And it's not just the Hubbard [trial]. It's also that Luther went so far and wide in terms of the business community in who they pulled into that trial. There was the former governor, Riley. I mean, there is a large group of folks ... those tentacles went so far that I think many of them saw it as unnecessary.”
There's a particularly Alabamian wrinkle to the feud, and the demarcation line runs roughly along college lines. In Alabama, that means only two schools: the University of Alabama and Auburn University. It's more than just about bragging rights on the football field, though that's a big part of it. It's cultural. Alabama is considered the stodgier, more football-centric school. Auburn, which is a national powerhouse on the football field as well, fancies itself a little more bookish and likes to tout its engineering program. People joke about “mixed marriage” when an Auburn grad weds an Alabama alum. And it bleeds over into politics. When former Auburn University coach Tommy Tuberville toyed with running for governor earlier in the year, the popular campaign newsletter Daily Kos noted that one hurdle for them is that Alabama fans “far outnumber Auburn's” in the state.
“The rivalry between the Crimson Tide and the Tigers is a very serious matter, and it's very possible that plenty of Bama supporters won't back someone so identified with their hated foes,” the newsletter noted in February.
Marsh, Rane and even Hubbard have strong ties to Auburn University. Harbert, Rane and Governor Kay Ivey (who moved up the special election schedule, some say, to spite Strange) all sit on the board of trustees. Rane has given $12 million to the school. Buildings at the school were named after Hubbard. Marsh, too, is a Tiger alumnus.
On the other side is the University of Alabama contingent. Strange went to Tulane University, but their roots run deep in the northwestern part of the state, where the Crimson Tide play. They were born in nearby Birmingham and later practiced law there. When they ran for attorney general, Strange's strongest support came in Jefferson County. Senator Shelby, a Strange ally, got their undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama and represented the 7th Congressional District—which includes the University of Alabama—in Congress.
That rivalry isn't lost among the political players in the Strange or Marsh-Rane camp.
“There's certainly a dynamic there,” the Republican connected to the business community told me.
***
If Marsh had chosen to run, there wouldn't be much doubt about where Rane's money would go. Businessman? Check. Auburn fanatic? Check. Strange antagonist? Check. But without the Senate pro tem in the race, there's considerably more doubt about the ultimate beneficiary.
Rane, according to a Republican with close ties to both Marsh and allied business leaders, was likely to spend $1 million to $2 million, or maybe more, if Marsh ran. “My understanding is that [Marsh] was in for $1 [million] and Harbert was in for $1 [million] and if they got in, they, especially Rane, were interested in increasing that number or were increasing that number because of their affinity for Del,” the Republican said. “My understanding has been that regardless of whether or not Del ran, Rane is still going to put their mark on this campaign with negative ads and talking to some of the other candidates they believe [are] a factor.”
Will Rane restrict themselves to negative ads about Strange, or will they actually get behind one of the other leading Republicans? The two other most prominent candidates in the Republican primary field: Representative Mo Brooks and former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. Neither is regarded as palatable to the business community-aligned Republicans who might have supported Marsh or Strange. They both are firebrands with strong ties to the conservative base and a history of provocative statements. So it's unlikely that Rane would pick either candidate in the primary. If either Brooks or Moore made it to the expected Republican primary runoff and defeated Strange, Senate Republican leadership would have to face the serious prospect of a new senator who doesn't vote reliably with the party, as Strange does, and instead is more of a provocateur.
Strange's allies are ready for a fight to protect the senator. In a brief interview at the Capitol, I asked Shelby about their plans to support Strange and the prospect of Rane or an anti-incumbent outside group like the Club for Growth pouring in money to defeat him. Shelby said they have already helped fundraise for Strange and planned to help them more. “I'll help them where I can,” Shelby said.
As for the looming prospect of a PAC wearing a big yellow hat, Shelby shrugged.
“Oh, I don't know what they'll do,” Shelby said. “Luther should win that race. They have to win it on the ballot.”
Sunlight glinted off the water as pleasure boats bobbed in the bay and the carefree squeals of children launching into the sea from a nearby jetty carried on the breeze. “English?” A trio of waiters descended on our waterside table to top up glasses of the quaffable local wine and delight in our satisfaction with the grilled sea bass (sublime), selected on arrival from a bed of ice displaying that day's catch. So far, so perfect day in the Med.
Except that as this lazy summer scene was playing out a lone man beaded in sweat was battling to contain a fire at a nearby property with little more than a dribbling hosepipe. The unfolding drama went largely ignored as plumes of acrid brown smoke poured forth. Indeed, as the air and throats thickened, the only crowd to congregate was a dozen plastic bottles and a clutch of bloated carrier bags at the water's edge. Eventually, no sirens blaring, a fire engine trundled into view to extinguish the blaze.
Welcome to the seaside town of Saranda and the contradiction that is Albania.
It had been apparent on arriving some hours earlier at Qafe Bote, a coastal border crossing between Greece and Albania, that this was to be no ordinary day trip. The first glimpse of the mountains that back Qafe Bote had been sobering: verdant and lushly carpeted on the Greek side, but barren and devoid of vegetation on the Albanian. My guide, Vasiliki, explained that the communist regime that ruled Albania from 1945 to 1991 encouraged its citizens to chop the trees down in order to spot any Greeks sneaking into the country in search of a “better” way of life – the reality being that the authorities instead wanted to make it easier to catch any fleeing Albanians.
There was a sense of not just having crossed a geographical divide, but of stepping back in time
The stark mountains of the border soon gave way to a pastoral plain dotted with fig and olive trees. The hot air buzzed with bee-eaters as we passed a woman leading a reluctant goat. This was followed by the surreal sight of an open‑mouthed fish wobbling towards us as a man riding a bicycle struggled to keep a one-armed hold on their large, slippery companion.
The smooth, grey ribbon of road that had transported us to the Albanian border had now become a potted track, and there was a sense of not just having crossed a geographical divide, but of stepping back in time.
• Epirus travel guide
We arrived at the banks of a river alongside which stood a hut proudly displaying a mural of the distinctive Albanian flag, a double-headed eagle set against a shock of red. The hut was the command post for a pulley system attached to a wooden platform, held together with planks and nails that looked as though they had seen better days, for the short journey across the water to Butrint, a Unesco World Heritage site dating from 8BC.
Virgil, the ancient Roman poet, wrote of Butrint: “I saw before me a Troy in miniature.” Today, with its ancient Greek theatre, Roman baths and Venetian tower, Butrint is considered a “microcosm” of Albanian history. I soon discovered, as I looked out across a green-blue lake to marshland and distant mountains, that it is also one of the best preserved – with much yet to be excavated – archaeological sites in Europe.
Sara, the charming guide we had hired on arrival, brought its history to life with pride and enthusiasm. Yet in the height of summer the site was far from overrun.
The ferry to Butrint is a primitive affair
On the journey from Butrint to Saranda we came across a different kind of ruin: unfinished buildings, their concrete frames contorted into twisted and toppled states. “Does Albania suffer a lot of earthquakes?” I asked Vasiliki as we passed the third such shell. They explained that it was likely the result of unauthorised building work.
Just 20 years ago Saranda was a fishing village dotted with traditional terracotta-topped stone houses. Today most of the stone houses are gone and in their place loom high-rise blocks that sprawl the length of Saranda's crescent-shaped bay. Albania is, perhaps not unsurprisingly given its history, a country in a hurry, and nowhere was that more evident than in its glorious landscapes strung with concrete telegraph poles.
• Albania on horseback: in the footsteps of Lord Byron
Much of the Albanian Riviera, enviably located at the mouth of the Adriatic, is still undeveloped, with a string of soft-sand beaches backed by towering mountains, but more needs to be done to protect the coastline if the country wants to avoid environmental and architectural disaster.
Saranda thrummed with Italians, Russians and moneyed Albanians – the town's parking bays gleamed black with rows of Mercedes-Benz cars. But I also met a British couple at Butrint who cited the desire for a low-key European summer holiday with a difference as their main reason for choosing Albania. A difference that became even clearer when the bill for lunch arrived: a feast for four at just under €50 (£35).
High-rise blocks sprawl the length of Saranda's crescent-shaped bay
Our final stop was Ciflik, a sleepy mountain village close to the border with Greece. I stepped from the car and a woman in a brightly-coloured headscarf appeared from the upstairs window of a house opposite. This was followed by three more similarly attired women from other stone houses lining the street, which was bedecked, like many of the towns and villages I had passed through, with the Albanian flag.
• The future of travel: 11 unlikely destinations tipped for a tourism boom
I made for what would have once been the grandest house in the village, but was now in a state of disrepair, and was encouraged by way of pointing and nodding to step through its dilapidated gates. Inside I found an elderly woman watering a lovingly-kept vegetable garden. I immediately apologised for the intrusion and turned to leave but they beckoned me with a toothless smile and picking a tomato the size of a grapefruit, washed and dried it before handing to me. “Dhuratë.” Gift.
Shortly after leaving Ciflik the green mountains of Greece came into view once again. Arriving at the border the Greek passport official was indignant: “English? Why you come to Albania?!” (sic). They scanned my passport incredulously. I bit my tongue and savoured the sweetness of the perfectly ripe tomato that I had devoured en route from Ciflik. I wondered how soon it would be before I could taste Albania once more.

If you have been reading or watching the news over the last couple weeks, you will have been inundated with stories and commentary about the Jian Ghomeshi sexual-assault trial and the way our criminal-justice system processes sexual-assault charges.
The Ghomeshi trial, which wrapped on February 11 after eight media-saturated days, is the latest event to highlight concerns about how sexual assaults are reported and prosecuted.
Athough there are no quick fixes for the issues being raised around sexual-assault prosecutions, one idea gaining currency is the creation of specialized sexual-assault courts.
In a sexual-assault trial, as in any criminal trial, the right of the accused to a full defence must be balanced with the right of the complainant to a fair and nondiscriminatory trial. After watching Ghomeshi's trial, many are asking if the legal system has the balance wrong.
Ghomeshi was charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking to overcome resistance. Three separate complainants alleged Ghomeshi assaulted them during dates.
In the credibility battle that sex-assault cases often end up as, the defence looks for ways to make the complainant appear unreliable at best, dishonest at worst. It makes for an ugly trial, and Ghomeshi's trial was no exception.
Based on the media reports, and without seeing court transcripts, it seemed clear that all three witnesses were ill-prepared for cross-examination. All three witnesses were found to not have disclosed during police interviews contact they had with Ghomeshi after the alleged assaults. And it was the behaviour of the three witnesses before and after the alleged assaults that the defence zeroed in on and held up for scrutiny.
Lucy DeCoutere, the only witness to waive the publication ban on their identity, testified that they didn't tell police about their romantic communications with Ghomeshi after the alleged assault because they didn't think they were relevant. The third witness said they didn't tell police about a consensual sexual encounter with Ghomeshi after the alleged assault because it was embarrassing.
In not disclosing encounters and correspondence with Ghomeshi, the complainants had their credibility brought into question and were characterized by defence as unreliable witnesses.
Section 276 of the Criminal Code of Canada, better known as the rape shield law, is meant to limit the ability of the defence to use the complainant's sexual history. As the Ghomeshi trial showed, however, the rape shield is permeable.
In the past, evidence of sexual history was often used by defence to make the case to the court that the complainant was more likely to have consented to a particular sexual interaction. Now, although questions about the complainant's sexual history may be forbidden, their actions before and after the sexual assault can be used to determine whether or not their behaviour is consistent with having consented or not to a sexual interaction. Advocates of sexual-assault-trial reform take issue with this and point out that the current system is not equipped to take into account the common behaviours and reactions by victims of sexual assault.
Regardless of where you come down on pre- and post-offence behaviour, sexual-assault statistics indicate a lack of public faith in the legal system's response to sexual assaults. According to Statistics Canada, 91 percent of sexual assaults are not reported to the police.
There is a consensus by those pushing for reform that a one-size-fits-all criminal-law system is failing victims. Specialized courts are not new in Canada. A number of jurisdictions have specialized domestic-assault courts. There are also specialized First Nations courts, specialized courts for offenders with long-term drug addictions, and specialized courts for those with mental-health issues. Each of these courts are presided over by judges who have a specialized knowledge of offenders or offences in a particular area.
Those pushing for creation of sexual-assault courts believe that specialized knowledge by crown prosecutors and judges is needed to combat the myths and stereotypes that can infuse cross-examinations, arguments, and judgments. A crown with sexual-assault trial expertise, for example, may be more likely to object to a defence cross-examination that references rape myths either overtly or subtly.
Access to legal counsel or advocacy by complainants is another issue that sexual-assault courts may address. The accused in a sexual-assault trial has the right to a government-funded lawyer if they cannot afford to retain counsel. Complainants do not have the right to a funded lawyer. If they do pay to retain a lawyer, their lawyer has no standing in court. Their lawyer can brief them on what to expect when they are put on the stand at trial, but once in the courtroom, the complainant is very much on their own. One proposal is that specialized sexual-assault courts would provide complainants with trained legal advocates to prepare and support them throughout the trial process.
Justice William Horkins will deliver their verdict on the Ghomeshi trial on March 24. It is unlikely the verdict will do much to rehabilitate public faith in sexual-assault prosecutions. There is not a single easy fix for the problems that beset sexual-assault trials, but specialized sexual-assault courts may be a place to start.

When it comes to leaders, I cannot help thinking about Gaius Julius Ceasar Augustus Germanicus, better known as Caligula. They were seen as the salvation after years of horrible leader, Tiberius. The people of Rome saw Caligula as their savior. Their names in themselves promised a brave and successful leader.
It is said that Caligula started off well, but after two years, things were bad. They ruined state finances, killed and tortured their subjects. Of course, we don't know how much of the stories around Caligula is true, but one of the stories which are thought worthy is the story of Caligula's military “victories”. Carryingng all those fancy names, Caligula wanted to be seen as a great military leader. They wanted to celebrate a triumph, just like their predecessors. But the problem was that they cared less about being a great leader.
So, they went on a quest for a battle. But Caligula was not a military genius. The northern campaign had to be abandoned. According to Suetonius, the historian, Caligula had no problems claiming that they conquered both Germania and Britannica, but the prisoners displayed during the triumph were gauls, dressed as Germans and Britons.
But a mere triumph with mortal enemies was not enough. They decided to make war with the God Neptune. Having declared themselves divine, they had no problems fighting this enemy. The story tells about the soldiers fighting the waves. They of course didn't believe in Caligula's delusions, but they all knew that questioning the ceasar meant certain death.
Today, we don't know what is true of Suetonius story, but there are many lessons to be learnt.
Working with 7 habits, we discuss the core of a leader. A leader is not only a manager but also a person giving direction to others. I'm currently struggling with this in one of my projects. We have too many objectives, and it's an ongoing task to describe, explain and discuss. Leadership should never be taken for granted. It's a difficult and ongoing task.
What Caligula learns us is also that the name and the title does not make you a good leader. Yes, people tended to do what every Caligula told them to. And for too many managers, this seems to be the essence of leadership. But what it can lead to is people fighting the waves with their swords and the celebration of false victories. A team victory should not be like the triumph of Caligula, just a show to fit their ego, based on a false history. A team victory is a victory which is felt in your bones, when you know that YOU have been part of something important and the real objective has been met.
In a couple of months, I hope my team will have that feeling; that we worked against that objective and that we reached it together. It was not easy, but it was all worth it.

A couple of the most popular posts of all time, here at Primatology.net, have been the cute-overload-esque ones, such as the baby macaque and white pigeon friendship and the orangutan and Sumatran tiger bond. Similar to the latter story, a new one has emerged of a chimpanzee named Anjana ‘adopting' two white tiger cubs named Mitra and Shiva, over at The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (TIGERS) in South Carolina.
The story behind the adoption revolves around Anjana's caregiver, China York, and the bond they share. China raised Anjana and Anjana has mimicked their human caregiver in caring for other animals at the institute, such as the new born white tiger cubs. The Daily Mail has more details, so jump on over there once you had your fill on the images.
Moderators Censor Discussion on Censorship
The giant r/Worldnews and r/News Reddits (5 million and 2 million subscribed readers, respectively) still haven't allowed links to Glenn Greenwald's report on government control, infiltration, manipulation and warping of online discourse.
Our write-up on the story – as well as TechDirt's and Examiner.com's – were allowed. We are sincerely grateful – as are TechDirt and Examiner.com – for the traffic.
However, we're all upset that the moderators of the biggest Reddits are censoring Greenwald's original story:
TechDirt's write-up on censorship is here
The Redditor who posted the Examiner's story slams Reddit censorship here
And our post on the censorship – written before the links to TechDirt, Examiner and our site were allowed – can be read here
Ironically, our post on censorship has itself repeatedly been deleted by Reddit moderators. In the week since I wrote it, I have repeatedly seen traffic coming from a Reddit link to the story, and then the traffic has suddenly stopped.
Redditors not affiliated with Washington's Blog have repeatedly submitted the story, and it has been deleted every time.
As one example, yesterday the story jumped to the front page of Reddit over the course of 2 hours:
But then it was suddenly deleted.
This shows that there is tremendous interest among Redditors themselves to discuss censorship. But the moderators keep shutting down discussion.
This isn't the first time the Reddit community has tried to fight back against censorship. There has been a long and growing outrage over the issue, especially given the history of Digg's “Bury Brigade” destroying that site:
Postscript: We don't have any opinion about whether or not moderators should keep removing our story on censorship. We are, frankly, too biased to be objective.
We are, instead, focusing on the fact that there is tremendous pent-up desire among Redditors to discuss censorship.
In other words, the story is not that our post was deleted (again) yesterday. It's that Redditors quickly pushed it to the front page because there is such an overwhelming desire to discuss censorship.
And the other story is that the big Reddits are still not linking directly to Glenn Greenwald's reports.
THIS picture is the only one of Mullah Omar that is confirmed as genuine. It was taken in 1993, the year before they founded the Taliban, when they were merely a fighter against the Soviet occupation of their country. They needed it as evidence that they had lost their right eye to enemy shrapnel, so that they could claim compensation. They never knowingly faced the camera again, since it was contrary to Islamic law.
The flyers dropped by American planes over Kandahar later, offering $10m for information about him, showed a photograph; it was not him. Portraits appeared of a man among yellow chrysanthemums, turning their right eye away. It was not him. Even when, as leader of the Taliban, they became emir of Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, they so seldom left their house in Kandahar that most of their followers had no idea what they looked like. They saw almost no journalists, and hardly talked when they did. Discussion was difficult, and negotiation impossible. After 2001 they were in hiding, flitting between Afghanistan and Pakistan. “Nobody recognises him,” said Hamid Karzai, who led Afghanistan in their turn. “This is a man nobody has seen.”

There was a story about their eye. They were said to have extracted the remains himself, stitched it up, bandaged their face and sprung from their bed, singing a Persian poem, when they heard the Soviet army was retreating. They were hailed as a ferocious jihadist and a brilliant marksman, taking out a slew of Soviet tanks and galvanising the other students (taliban) at their madrassa into a ruthless fighting force. In fact, they were a lowly and undisciplined fighter; and the Taliban began as a vigilante group of refugees and dropouts, as they are, taking revenge round their home village of Sangasar on warlords who were raping local boys and girls. Gradually they were called in to tackle more cases of crime and corruption in their collapsed country until, after reaching and taking Kabul in 1996, they became its moral guardians and rulers.
The cloak of Muhammad
Omar was the spiritual leader of their movement, a role confirmed when they removed the cloak of Muhammad from the three chests that protected it in a mosque in Kandahar in 1996 and, standing tall and thin on a rooftop, draped it briefly on their own shoulders. This single act made them the leader of the faithful, the title in which they issued their military and social decrees. Their impoverished childhood and the early death of their father encouraged parallels with the life of the Prophet. Allah, too, appeared to them in dreams: once to encourage them to form the Taliban, and in 2001 to urge them to destroy the giant and ancient Buddhas of Bamiyan, as relics of idolatry.
Their piety, strong and sincere, was not the learned or bookish sort. They could recite as much of the Koran as they had picked up from their father and uncle, itinerant preachers, in the mud-hut village in Uruzgan province where they had been brought up. Though they became a mullah in Sangasar, they preferred to call themselves a talib, a man who was still seeking. In their hard-set rural ways, however, flavoured with fundamentalist Deobandi Islam, they already had the answers. For boys, fighting against unbelievers; for women, seclusion and subjugation; for thieves, amputation; for all Afghans, no more cinema, football, television, music or kite-flying. In the governor's palace in Kandahar they set an ascetic example: a cement floor, a wooden camp-bed, meals of soup and dry bread. They wore old-fashioned curled slippers, a sure sign of poverty, communicated mainly by letter and courier and, for a while, signed off permits on empty cigarette packets. An RPG7 was said to be their favourite weapon.
From 1996 they gave Osama bin Laden refuge in their country. Their relations seemed simple. Bin Laden, shrewder and more intelligent, charmed him, paid them homage as emir and gave them money and Land Cruisers. In exchange Omar refused to surrender them to the Americans after the September 11th attacks, admitting—in a rare flash of temper—that they wanted to kill the man who had asked him. Yet they were also unhappy when bin Laden launched their terror from Afghanistan. Their defiance of the Americans was based both on principle—it was simply right, therefore God would protect him—and their estimate of a “less than ten per cent” chance that America would attack him. This conviction cost them their power and their country.
Real power, according to the Western intelligence agencies who struggled to read him, had seldom been theirs anyway. Although they came from the dominant Pushtuns, they were a member of the poorer Ghilzai tribe, without contacts or influence politically. They knew nothing of the outside world, and could barely do more than sign the statements issued in their name. Though they kept tight control of their field commanders as emir, strings were also pulled elsewhere: in Saudi Arabia, which provided many of the dollars they dispensed to their deputies from a large tin box beside their bed; and in Pakistan, where the Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave them training and, after 2001, intermittent shelter.
Together, these supporters kept their myth going. Whether they were dead or alive, the Taliban united round them and, throughout the late 2000s, regrouped to make war against the West. Unseen and unknown, they haunted the scene. Peace remains as elusive as they are.
This is an old version, you can find v2.1 here Warforged The technology used to create warforged began with the methods used to create mindless constructs. Although true sentience was a goal, there was little thought given to what the effects of sentience would be or how to best prepare those minds for their new existence. At the moment of a warforgeds first awakening it has no knowledge of the world, no understanding of falsehood, and no feelings about good or evil. Lies told it then might be considered truth forever, or at least until disproved. Living Constructs Warforged appear as massive humanoids molded from a composite of materials — obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic — though they move with a surprising grace and flexibility. Flexible plates connected by fibrous bundles make up the body of a warforged, topped by a mostly featureless head. Warforged need little to survive: not sleep, food, or even air to breathe. Warforged need only shelter from extremes of cold and heat, and to repair damage done to their bodies. With such minimal requirements, one might think a warforged could travel to a temperate climate and then do nothing but simply exist, standing in place like a statue. Yet warforged are thinking creatures, and as such they require activities to occupy their thoughts. Warforged have no physical distinction of gender; all of them have a basically muscular, sexless body shape. In personality, some warforged seem more masculine or feminine, but different people might judge the same warforged in different ways. The warforged themselves seem unconcerned with matters of gender. They do not age naturally, though their bodies do decay slowly even as their minds improve through learning and experience. Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. Many warforged are adorned with heavier metal plates than those their creator originally endowed them with. This customised armor, built-in weaponry, and other enhancements to their physical form help to differentiate one warforged from another. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT although warforged are tireless physically, they are still subject to mental fatigue, just as other races are. Too much time spent concentrating on the same mental task is wearying to them, and this is one of the primary motivations behind their wish to change tasks every few hours — to keep their minds occupied. — Doctor, A Guide to Warforged Physiology Born to Fight The Warforged were made to fight in The War, and they continue to fulfill their purpose with distinction. They fight fiercely and usually without remorse, displaying adaptability impossible for mindless constructs. Now that the war has ended, the Warforged seek to adapt to life in this era of relative peace. Some have settled easily into new roles as artisans or laborers, while others wander as adventurers or even continue fighting in The War despite the return of peace. Built as mindless machines to fight in The War, the Warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creature — living constructs. Warforged are renowned for their combat prowess, their size, and their single-minded focus. They make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. Earlier warforged models are true constructs; some of these remnants of The War appear in monstrous varieties, such as the warforged titan. Comrades are those who work or fight alongside the warforged on a consistent basis. The term “comrade” is a label that a warforged uses to indicate that experience. Warforged feel camaraderie for a group or individual after going through trying times, but it is only now, among the humanoids in peaceful times, that warforged are beginning to understand the concept of true friendship. Struggle for Freedom Freedom is wonderful, but it can also be terrifying. Warforged were created to fight and trained to follow orders; lacking a war to win or a leader to follow, many warforged are intimidated by the possibilities of freedom and seek comfort in roles where expectations are clear. As the warforged strive to find a place in society for themselves after The War, they simultaneously struggle to find ways to relate to the races that created them. In general, the humanoid races regard the warforged as an unpleasant reminder of the brutality of The War and avoid dealing with them when possible. To some, the warforged are still seen as the property of the military forces that paid to have them built, and most warforged in those nations serve as slave labor, often used to repair buildings and roads damaged or destroyed in the war. Throughout certain lands they have freedom, but sometimes find themselves the victims of discrimination, hard-pressed to find work or any kind of acceptance. Most warforged, not being particularly emotional creatures, accept their struggles and servitude with equanimity, but others seethe with resentment against all other races as well as those warforged whose only desire is to please their “masters.”
Warforged Names Warforged do not name themselves and only recently have begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many accept whatever names others see fit to give them, and warforged traveling with humans often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves. Warforged Nicknames: Baker, Bender, Beast, Bulwark, Buddy, Blank, Cart, Clanker, Dog, Friend, Golem, Gearhead, Horse, Metalhead, Ratchet, Prodigy, Protector, Pal, Rust Bucket, Sentinel, Sentry, Servant, Slave, Soldier, Tinman, War Doctor, Warrior, Watcher.

Documentary examining the violence inflicted by men on women every day, telling the stories of all the women who died at the hands of a male partner or ex-partner during one year.
On average, seven women a month in Britain are killed by their male partner or ex-partner. This documentary by acclaimed director Vanessa Engle tells the gripping and untold human stories behind this shocking yet faceless statistic, shedding light on a majorly important subject - the continuing and disproportionate violence visited by men on women every day.
The film features a roll call of all the women killed by their male partner or ex-partner in the course of one calendar year. Of the 164 women murdered in Britain in 2013, 86 were killed by their male partner or ex-partner. This film names all 86 women and, through interviews with families, friends and neighbours, tells the stories of seven of them in detail.
August Schell Brewing Company is buying the iconic Minneapolis bottle cap sign on Nicollet Island, aiming to refurbish and preserve it.
The New Ulm, Minnesota-based brewery, which makes Grain Belt Beer, plans to work with preservationists to relight the sign, which has been dark for nearly two decades. It spells out Grain Belt Beer through 900 feet of neon tubes about 50 feet wide and 40 feet tall.
Built for $5,000 in 1941, the sign originally stood on the now-demolished Marigold Ballroom. It moved to Nicollet Island in 1950.
• 2009: Grain Belt sign up for sale
August Schell Brewing Company bought Grain Belt in 2002. On Wednesday, company officials announced the deal to purchase the sign from the Eastman Family Trust on Wednesday. The parties are not disclosing the price.
The brewery said in a statement that after the deal closes it will donate the sign to the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota if the sign still works.
Smartphone company Essential, which is founded by Android co-creator Andy Rubin, has finally made official a $300 million funding round first reported in June. The funding round comes from investors including Tencent, as well as Amazon's Alexa Fund, among others. Essential also revealed new information about its retail launch, including retail partners Amazon and Best Buy who will be carrying the phone in the U.S.
The release date itself is still somewhat mysterious, however: Essential President Niccolo De Masi told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that it's still “a few weeks away,” but said that the company will provide an exact date “in a week.” The Essential phone has a launch exclusivity deal with carrier Sprint in the U.S., and it also previously announced availability via Telus in Canada. De Masi told the WSJ that future international carrier options would be announced later in 2017.
The smartphone startup is challenging Apple and other premium device makers with its design and premium placement, but it doesn't have any illusions about going toe-to-toe with the current industry leaders in terms of sales in the immediate future. De Masi said that the company will consider low single digit a million sales for year one “very successful,” considering that the company is a new startup.
The company's total funding is now at $330 million, and private co. share marketplace Equidate estimates its total valuation at $1 billion, though Essential itself isn't disclosing any official valuation figures. The Essential smartphone will be available unlocked at retail via Amazon, Best Buy and Essential.com, as well as through carriers Sprint and Telus.
Essential has generated a lot of hype around its forthcoming Android-based smartphone based on the pedigree of its founder and its unique design with maximizes the screen area of the device. It looks likely to face a similar design on the forthcoming iPhone 8, however, based on leaks, and other Android device makers are taking the cue and revealing screen-heavy prototypes with minimal bezels, so it'll be interesting to see how Essential positions itself with its go-to-market strategy once the phone is actually available.
There is a small picturesque mountainside village in Switzerland near Leukerbad in the beautiful Canton of Valais. The village of Albinen is a calm and peaceful town with the stunning mountainous area.
THE SWISS VILLAGE POPULATION CRISIS
It is remote though and the village is going through a population crisis. The village has always been small but many residents have left for ‘Big city life'.
Young residents left the village to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
The school had to close down, the parks were empty and trade in the local shops and stores suffered. Young people moved to the larger Swiss cities to seek their fame and secure their future. Will they be tempted to come back for money?
As a result, local residents have demanded council to do something to help reverse the decline and improve village future. Upon the request, now the council has decided to grow their village economy and change the way the people live and they're paying people to move in.
Yes! they are offering 70,000 Swiss Francs for people who are willing to come and live in the village for at least 10 years.
THE OFFER
Who wouldn't want to live somewhere – quiet, beautiful and scenic?
And, here's the bonus, get paid to do it. This Swiss village is offering 70,000 Swiss Francs to families who will move in. They're wanting to attract younger families or younger people (under 45) who will either buy or build a new home and stay for at least a decade. And they're paying them to do it!
You'll need to do your research. Each adult is being offered just over 25,000 Swiss Francs and each child around 10,000 Swiss Francs. So a family of four comprising two adults and two kids are looking at the 70,000 Swiss Francs.
Newsletter states that,
It is an investment in the village's future, adding that the community will profit from the new families through taxes, construction contracts and purchases in the village shop, while young people will bring life back to the village. In a best-case scenario, even the village school will reopen.
It's not just money that will tempt them back though. The Swiss village is not only offering 70,000 Swiss Francs but also a way of life that is different to any other. It's a small life, a quiet life, and a very safe life.
It's not only about the money, it's about the way of life, of getting away from a large impersonal lifestyle and getting into a new community.

In 1974 War on Want's publication The Baby Killer led to widespread condemnation of businesses that aggressively market breastmilk substitutes in the developing world. In response WHO isssued guidelines five years later, the International code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes.
More than 30 years on however, adherence to the code remains mixed. Annelies Allain, director of the International Code Documentation Centre at the International Baby Food Action Network (Ibfan) says that it is now rare to find promotion of formula milk aimed at infants under the age of six months, the age to which the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding. The code is also law in 37 countries and another 47 have adopted laws that encompass many of the code's provisions.
The trouble, says Allain, is that "there is a big step between implementing and enforcing a law, and that's where many countries are slow or hesitant to act, because companies are very powerful". Between 2011 and 2013, Ibfan documented more than 800 violations of the code in 81 countries, ranging from bribery of health officials to price-fixing, promotions to mothers and health professionals, sponsorship and non-compliant labelling.
Save The Children reported evidence of industry lobbies working to weaken legislation. Violations remain extensive because the rewards are so attractive: the baby food business was estimated to be worth $25 billion in 2013 and set to grow by 31% by 2015, with much of that growth in Asia.
Stefan Germann, director for partnership, innovations and accountability at the global sustainable health cluster at World Vision, says that it is disappointing that violations still take place but they argue that the debate has become so entrenched – "almost religious" – that no resolution can come out of it. "Civil society and the business community need to find more meaningful ways to engage," they say.
There have been efforts to include breastmilk substitute marketing practices in the FTSE4Good series, an index measuring the performance of companies in corporate responsibility standards. A good idea, says Germann, although the methodology (which uses a dumbed-down version of the WHO's code) and execution (companies are in or out rather than included and ranked, which would provide more incentive for improvement) are flawed. Nestlé is, for the time being, the only breastmilk substitute manufacturer to feature in the index.
For the past two years, Germann has therefore been trying to set up a new platform that would involve, and be recognised by, all stakeholders in the infant food debate – NGOs, UN agencies, businesses, national governments. The platform would foster greater dialogue and transparency and play an important role in investigating and resolving violations of the code. Their efforts have ground to a halt however because of the unwillingness of some quarters to engage.
Germann says that the infant food debate would have much to learn from environmentalists or sweatshop activists who successfully managed to open a dialogue with the private sector despite strongly opposed views.
Many agree. "There is definitely room for more collaboration," a spokesperson for Nestlé said. "Interested stakeholders could build on the FTSE4Good breastmilk substitutes assessment to establish a transparent process."
NGOs are also keenly aware that more must be done to actively encourage breastfeeding. In East Java, Indonesia, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (Gain) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently found that although women knew about the benefits of breastfeeding, many lacked the confidence to actually do it and ended up using formula instead (the study will be published soon). Gain is putting together a campaign to educate women through TV commercials, community-outreach programmes and better training of health workers (all the while keeping an eye on the application of the code).
"There is a lot of lip service being paid to breastfeeding, but I don't see it in budget allocations," says Dr Arun Gupta, regional coordinator for Ibfan Asia. "We need to start valuing what women do, the time they invest." This means a whole raft of measures, including maternity leave, facilities to encourage breastfeeding at work, training of health care workers etc. This, they argue, is why Bangladesh has seen an increase in exclusive breastfeeding while India, despite having an excellent law restricting the promotion of breastmilk substitutes since 1992, hasn't. "As long as policymakers and doctors believe that women breastfeed anyway and that you don't need interventions, the struggle will continue," they say.

Six months after thefacebook.com launched, as the summer of 2004 began, Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz moved to Palo Alto, California where they planned to work on TheFacebook.com in a rented house. Eduardo Saverin went to New York for an internship at Lehman Brothers.
According to instant messages from this period, before Mark left for the West Coast, they asked Eduardo to work on three things: "to set up the company, get funding, and make a business model."
Almost immediately after the move, the relationship between cofounders began to fray.
At first, it was just a cultural divide. One awkward IM exchange reveals how different Mark's life in Palo Alto was compared to Eduardo's life back on the East Coast:
Saverin: So you guys go out a lot to partiens [sic] and such there?Zuckerberg: But in general we don't do fun things.Zuckerberg: But that's OK because the business is fun.Saverin: Lol yeah it is fun. No fun things though?Zuckerberg: Eh, enough.
But then Eduardo did something that really pissed Mark off: They ran unauthorized ads on Facebook.
Worse, the ads were for a startup Eduardo was running entirely on their own, a job boards site called Joboozle.
Mark flamed Eduardo for this in an email:
You developed Joboozle knowing that at some point Facebook would probably want to do something with jobs. This was pretty surprising to us, because you basically made something on the side that will end up competing with Facebook and that's pretty bad by itself. But putting ads up on Facebook to advertise it, especially for free, is just mean.
What finally sent the relationship between Eduardo and Mark down the tubes was Facebook's need for funding.
As that first summer went on and TheFacebook.com grew more popular than anyone imagined, the company needed money to keep running. Finding investors wasn't hard. As early as July, Silicon Valley bigwigs like Mark Pincus, Reid Hoffman, and Peter Thiel were lining up to give Mark cash. Things were going so well, in fact, that Mark soon decided to commit to the company and not return to Harvard for their junior year.
What was hard, however, was getting Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin's attention, getting them to make a decision, and getting them to sign off on the reformation of Facebook as a company under Delaware law - a crucial step before any funding deals could be completed.
At one point, Mark emailed Eduardo to offer them frequent flyer miles if it would get them out to Palo Alto. Eduardo didn't take the offer. The situation soon became critical, because without financing, TheFacebook.com would end up running on Zuckerberg family loans.
Eventually, Mark decided to solve the problem by cutting Eduardo out of the company.
In an IM with Dustin Moskovitz, Mark explained why:
I maintain that they fucked himself…He was supposed to set up the company, get funding, and make a business model. They failed at all three…Now that I'm not going back to Harvard I don't need to worry about getting beaten by Brazilian thugs.
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New England Patriots starting left guard Logan Mankins and cornerback Alfonzo Dennard both returned to practice on Tuesday morning, the first on-field work for the team this week after their bye weekend.
Mankins, who suffered an ankle injury in Week 17, did not practice at all last week, while Dennard has been dealing with a shoulder and knee issue of late that kept them out of Week 17 entirely.
Wide receiver Aaron Dobson (foot), who also missed practice all of last week after suffering another foot injury in the regular season finale, was the lone player not spotted at the start of practice.
The Patriots had an open roster spot after placing linebacker Brandon Spikes on injured reserve yesterday, and it has apparently been filled. A wide receiver wearing number 84 was on the practice field today, though it's unclear if they have been signed to the active roster or if they were signed to the practice squad and the Patriots promoted a separate player.
Due to extreme cold in the area, the Patriots practiced inside the Dana-Farber Fieldhouse outside of Gillette Stadium. They practiced in shells and helmets.
In addition to being one of the most gifted American writers ever to grace the keys of a typewriter, Hunter S. Thompson was an enthusiast. They were a drug enthusiast, a gun enthusiast, and an enthusiast for the wild and weird in their 67 years on Earth, and all of that is likely in play here. (The drug part is unconfirmed, but let's be honest with ourselves.) Here they are at Owl Farm, their property in Woody Creek, Colorado, apparently engaged in a shootout with their neighbor over a livestock dispute:
After ribbing the guy for using bird shot, they explain that "this son of a bitch wants to bitch about their cows over here," before firing between some trees off into the distance. They also offer some views on the state of American democracy, explaining that the country belongs "to us," not to "used-car salespersons from Southern California." True enough.
"In democracy," they say, as the video concludes, "you have to be a player."
This is actually one of a few videos to surface recently of HST's antics at their Colorado manse. Here they are carrying out an annual tradition: throwing their Christmas tree in the fireplace at the end of the holiday season, soaking it in lighter fluid, and setting fire to it.

Heritage Auctions
The driver that Sam Snead used to win more than 100 tournaments — including two Masters, two PGA Championships and one British Open — will be up for auction Sept. 25-26 in Dallas as part of Heritage Auctions' Sports Collectibles Golf Catalog auction. The club is expected to sell for more than $250,000.
Slammin' Sammy Snead was one of the longest drivers of their generation. The club comes with a note signed by Snead verifying its legitimacy that also includes details about the Dunlop driver, made by Wilson, which Snead purchased from Henry Picard.
“Pickard [sic] said that they paid $5.25 for it,” writes Snead. “I paid them that amount and took it with me. A few years after buying the driver, Pickard wanted to buy it back, and I said I wouldn't sell it for a million!”
Included in the letter is Snead's description of the club: “Made by Wilson, name of Sam Snead and Wilson on the head, plain sole plate, dark brown head with black insert, head is cracked in neck with an added screw in the neck, also has an added screw in end of shaft on bottom of head and has lead weight in back of head.”
Snead used the driver from 1936 to 1953, retiring it after playing for the victorious American team in the 1953 Ryder Cup.

Kevin Magnussen says it is imperative that they beat Jolyon Palmer as they look to secure their future with Renault.
The former McLaren driver was handed a F1 lifeline by Renault, who signed them an 11th hour deal after dropping Pastor Maldonado.
Despite their year away from racing, Magnussen was quickly up to speed, recording the best result of P11 at the Bahrain GP.
But while that equals Palmer's P11 from Australia, the Dane is ahead in the standings having finished in 17th place to their team-mate's 22nd.
"It is no secret that you have to be better than your team-mate," Magnussen said in an interview with told Ekstra Bladet newspaper.
"It's going to be crucial for the team because it is clear that they want the best.
"If there is a new driver, they will choose the best.
"But that's is not the only thing. It's also about being the best driver on the grid."
The Dane also revealed that they are finding life at Renault a lot less demanding than their time with McLaren.
"I'm in a team now where the commercial side means less and that is one of the things I really like about it," they said.
Magnussen added: "It is a team that is here for the sport."
Brasington's Adventure Outfitters is closing Saturday after 43 years in business, with owner Bob Ackerman citing declining business as a result of competition from online shopping and big-box stores.
Brasington's Adventure Outfitters is closing Saturday after 43 years in business, with owner Bob Ackerman citing declining business as a result of competition from online shopping and big-box stores -- and fewer people going outdoors.
The store at 2331 NW 13th St. offers gear and clothes for hiking, camping, backpacking and kayaking.
Ackerman said Wednesday that there's not much left from a going-out-of-business sale. The store first announced its plan to close May 13 on Facebook.
“People are starting to pick through the fixtures and banners and whatever's left,” they said.
The store will open June 3 for one last event that was previously scheduled for Backpacker Magazine, with products and presentations.
Ackerman, who bought the business in 1997, said Brasington's had its best year in 2008 and business has declined every year since for several reasons. The recession hurt discretionary spending and several big stores in the area closed.
“When Wal-Mart left, it's not a business we thought of as sharing many customers, but that big hole in the area where we're located just caused a kind of domino effect. … It was just very desolate here,” they said. “Now it's all coming back again, but it's been too much. We can't continue.”
Big-box sporting goods stores started offering kayaks at lower prices and Brasington's sales went from 400 kayaks a year to less than 40 each of the last two years. The unpredictability of snow out West hurt sales of winter gear.
Ackerman said they see a generational change away from small-scale retail to online shopping.
They said they also see a major decline in participation in outdoor activities.
“That's an issue I think long term I'm very disturbed about, not just because of my business but for what it does for our constituency in terms of preserving wild places,” they said.
They said the store's 10 employees all seem to have new jobs lined up, “everybody but me.”
Ackerman has served on the City Plan Board for eight years.
The late J.J. Brasington opened Brasington's Trail Shop in 1972 at what is now Ada's Clothes Repair at Northwest 13th Street and 16th Avenue. Brasington's moved four years later to its current location.
J.J.'s brother, longtime Cadillac and Oldsmobile dealer Johnnie Brasington, died Saturday at 104.
Ackerman, a practicing trial attorney, had been a customer of the store and bought the business from J.J. Brasington's family in 1997.
“Honestly, I didn't think it through very well, but it has been one of the best experiences I've ever had,” Ackerman said.
“I've gotten to know almost everybody in Gainesville. It's been nice. It's made me feel very positive towards Gainesville and we're getting lots of people in with reminiscences. I'm not happy that the business is going away but it has overall been an extremely positive experience.”
Current Prototype Challenge entrant JDC-Miller MotorSports announced it will add a Prototype class program in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2017 with an ORECA 07 LMP2 car, as part of its current IMSA programs.
Team co-owner John Church confirmed today that the Minneapolis-based squad will be on the grid with a 2017-spec ORECA 07 Gibson-powered LMP2 car in 2017.
JDC-Miller MotorSports currently fields the # 85 PC entry in the IMSA WeatherTech Sports Car Championship along with the #54 ST car in the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge Series. JDC MotorSports also operates a very successful multi-car entry in the IMSA Mazda Prototype Lites Series. The team won the season opening Rolex24 Hours of Daytona and the Long Beach Grand Prix in the PC class, and currently sits 3rd in the driver's championship.
JDC-Miller will continue to run its current Prototype Challenge car in 2017 with the driver lineups for both programs to be finalized in the coming weeks. Current JDC-Miller MotorSports regulars Misha Goikhberg, Stephen Simpson and Chris Miller will remain with the team, but firm commitments to either program have not been confirmed.
“All of our current drivers will be part of the new LMP2 program in some form in 2017 and beyond. Additionally, we obviously have great talents in our Mazda Prototype Lites program with Austin Versteeg and Clark Toppe who we would love to move into our recently announced P3 (PC1 class) program for 2017.” Church explained. “We have also had several conversations with a number of other potential drivers for the 2017 LMP2 program.”
With the confirmation for the LMP2 Prototype class program in 2017 and the recent announcement to field LMP3 spec Prototypes in the newly branded 2017 IMSA Prototype Challenge championship, JDC MotorSports and JDC Miller MotorSports will run programs in all IMSA Prototype classes in 2017.
“This is a very exciting program for 2017 and we felt this was the right time to move into the P2 class. We are confident in Oreca and feel they share our vision and goals. We have had a very strong relationship with them over the past 3 years.” Church explained. “Clearly our long-term goal is to become part of a DPi manufacturer program in the future”, Church explained.
“We are delighted by the commitment of JDC-Miller MotorSports with the new ORECA 07 LM P2. We have a strong link with the team since several years and it is great to continue our cooperation with this new challenge. The team is involved in all the different classes of the endurance racing ladder, so it is a logical but important step. We will bring our experience to support JDC-Miller MotorSports and help them to fight at the front. It is an excising multiple-years project and we are glad to be part of it. We can't wait to see the new ORECA 07 at Daytona.” ORECA Group president Hugues de Chaunac added.
JDC-Miller MotorSports is the first American team to announce its plan to run the new ORECA 07 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. The target is to make the first U.S. test during the Daytona series test in December before continuing with private testing leading up to the Roar Daytona test in January.
Uber launched a fleet of its much anticipated self-driving cars in San Francisco on Wednesday, and by late morning the effort already hit a bad-driver milestone: running a red light.
A video obtained first by the San Francisco Examiner appears to show an Uber self-driving car running a red light downtown.

SEE RELATED: SF blasts Uber, Lyft for downtown traffic congestion
These vehicles also have Uber drivers and engineers as backups at the wheel of the car, according to various news reports, leaving it unclear as to why no one simply hit the brakes.
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The video is from the dashboard camera of a Luxor Cab, a taxi company in The City.
Charles Rotter, operations manager at Luxor, confirmed to the Examiner that the video was from Wednesday.
“Yes, the dashcam of one of our ramp vans at 10:37 this am,” they wrote, in an email.
The cab pulls up to a red light on Third Street in South of Market, by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. A pack of cars flies through a yellow light, and one even drives through the first moment of a red light.
About three seconds after the light turned red, an Uber self-driving car can apparently be seen traveling through the red light at moderate speed as a pedestrian walks across the intersection on the right side of the intersection.
In its blog Wednesday, Uber wrote it launched self-driving vehicles in California without self-testing permits from the DMV because it has drivers in the vehicles. “We have looked at this issue carefully and we don't believe we do (need permits),” Uber wrote.
Earlier Wednesday, a social media report spotted another self-driving vehicle running a red light near the Marina District.
Annie Gaus, a freelance writer and producer in San Francisco, tweeted Wednesday morning that they “Just passed a ‘self-driving' Uber that lurched into the intersection on Van Ness [Avenue], on a red, nearly hitting my Lyft.”
Read the tweet below:
(Not enough time to get a good shot, but…whoops!) pic.twitter.com/XK49nMF2Q4 — Annie Gaus (@AnnieGaus) December 14, 2016
Speaking with the San Francisco Examiner, Gaus said they were headed to Union Street when the Uber vehicle jutted out across Union Street on a red light, and nearly hit the Lyft car they were riding in.
“It was close enough that both myself and the driver reacted and were like, ‘Shit,'” they said. “It stopped suddenly and stayed like that, as you see in the photo.”
Gaus' photo does apparently show the Uber self-driving vehicle, notable for its roof camera apparatus, partway through an intersection on a red light.
Uber launched its self-driving vehicles on the streets of San Francisco Wednesday after piloting the program in Pittsburgh earlier this year.
“Self-driving cars have been picking up and dropping off riders on the streets of Pittsburgh for the last three months, and now we're excited to bring them to our hometown,” reads an email from Uber sent to customers early Wednesday.
The email continues, “Ready to take a ride in a self-driving Uber?”

A tragic accident at a Bucharest nightclub resulted in 32 people losing their lives and triggered a series of events that culminated in the resignation of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on 4 November. Ponta was already under significant pressure to quit following corruption allegations, but had resisted handing in their resignation until now. Why this change of heart? Dan Brett provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation and points out that, for Ponta, resigning over an accident they could not be blamed for was the easiest way out. Despite Ponta's resignation, widespread anger at perceived political corruption has ensured protests have continued on the streets of Romanian towns and cities, with even the country's popular President Klaus Iohannis potentially in the firing line.
Victor Ponta's resignation as Romania's Prime Minister on the morning of 4 November, after 20,000 people protested on the streets of Bucharest the day before, came as something of a surprise. Ponta – who had survived protests since becoming Prime Minister, had been accused of plagiarism and corruption, was heavily defeated in the Presidential elections, and was facing court cases for corruption – had so far refused to quit. Now, following the deaths of 32 people in a fire at the Colectiv Club in Bucharest, they have finally resigned.
Despite Ponta's resignation, more protesters took to the streets on Wednesday night: the newspaper Gândul reported 30,000 people on the streets, with others placing the number as high as 60,000. The protests have not been limited to Bucharest, as is often the case, but have spread to provincial towns and cities including Cluj, Iași, Ploiești, Brașov, Alba Iulia, Miercurea-Ciuc, and Râmnicu-Vâlcea, reflecting the nationwide anger.
The deaths at an unsafe club with no fire protection galvanised the population to take their widespread discontent to the streets. The protests come in the wake of the death of a police motorcyclist in a motorcade for Deputy Prime Minister Gabriel Oprea. Although Oprea was not entitled to a motorcade, they had claimed one anyway, using it for things such as their trips to the hairdresser and restaurants. Following the death, Ponta used their powers of emergency decree to change the law post-factum to entitle Oprea to a motorcade. Oprea has since come under further scrutiny over their military and academic CV.
In the eyes of the population, the tragic accident at the club was the result of corruption, with permits and licenses given out upon receipt of a bribe. Indeed, the recent anti-corruption drive resulted in the Mayor of Bucharest Sorin Oprescu being caught red-handed taking bribes. After the fire, appeals for blood donations and medicine for the victims brought into sharper focus the underfunding of healthcare services and the theft of public money by the elite, who are accused of squandering it on vanity projects.
Corruption and enrichment is such a common feature of Romanian political life that it has become easy to dismiss it as ‘over-stated' or to say ‘they are all equally corrupt, so why care?'; however, the deaths of 32 people as a direct result of corruption has provoked widespread anger. It is no longer a game played by elite politicians to enrich themselves or their cronies, but rather the cause of the deaths of many innocent people.
Key figures
Ponta came to power on the back of street protests against austerity in 2011-12. Seeing the popular anger, Ponta's Social Democratic Party (PSD) allied with members of the National Liberal Party (PNL) to form the Social Liberal Union electoral coalition (USL) and positioned themselves as opposed to austerity. In so doing, they successfully captured the sentiments and used them to propel themselves to power. However, once in office Ponta and the USL went back on every promise made. This explains the anger with the system – a political elite that has consistently captured and then betrayed every popular movement from the revolution of 1989.
While Victor Ponta and the allegations against them are relatively well known, their deputy and Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea is less well known. Oprea is a member of the smaller National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) party. The UNPR is in office not because they gained enough votes, but because they agreed to be part of the USL electoral coalition with the PSD, and at the time the PNL, against then President Basescu's Democratic Liberal Party (PDL).
A part of various governments since the fall of communism, they have frequently switched sides, always claiming that it was ‘in the national interest'. Their roots lie in the military and the security apparatus, although their path from waiter in the military restaurant to four-star general has recently come under scrutiny.  They are also reported to have threatened critical bloggers by telephone as well. Thus they are seen as a very murky and unpleasant politician.
Cristian Popescu aka Piedone, the mayor of Sector 4 in Bucharest, has also resigned. Bucharest has a mayor, and its 6 districts each have their own mayor as well. Piedone's sector includes the working class district of Berceni, as well as the southern part of Central Bucharest. Piedone is a member of Oprea's UNPR, but they had previously been elected as an independent mayor.
A populist, activist mayor, Piedone made their name as a health inspector, going to the markets with a television crew in tow and condemning meat that was unsafe. They maintained a visible profile on the streets of Sector 4; in the winter they could be seen outside directing trucks clearing the snow. In a country where politicians do nothing, they were seen as doing something. Thus they had built up a considerable support base among the population in Sector 4, whose general appearance and infrastructure considerably improved while they were mayor, and hence they were someone that national actors appealed to for support.
An arrogant, vain elite
In addition to anger at politicians, anger has become increasingly directed against the Orthodox Church. Criticism has long been levelled against the church for its self-enrichment and exploitation of the poorest members of the population. The church, exempt from paying many taxes, has launched vanity projects such as the Cathedral for the Salvation of the Romanian People, which will cost approximately 500 million euros, and the Romanian Parliament has given 12 million euros of public money to the project. Moreover, it was recently revealed that the Patriarch, like Oprea, has also been using a police motorcade. Satirical journal Times New Roman portrays the Patriarch's staff as topped with a dollar sign.
At the same time, the accident has shown the acute pressure under which Romanian hospitals operate. The appeals for help in the aftermath of the fire highlighted that the drugs hospitals need are simply unaffordable, and that the hospitals themselves are under-funded and under-staffed. A state of the art burn unit in Bucharest has never opened due to lack of resources and trained staff. The contrast between the Church taking money from the state and the population and the underfunding of key services has caused further tensions.
The Church and many politicians and commentators have shown a tin ear in their response to the tragedy. Some have explained the accident as the result of people invoking Halloween and evil spirits; the Metropolitan of the Banat claimed that the Church had failed to instil the correct moral values in those who died, suggesting that such values would have saved them. Others, like Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNȚ-CD) leader Aurelian Pavelescu, rejected the national mourning decreed by the President and accused the victims of being uncultured, drug-taking, promiscuous anarchists.
Akin to an alcoholic denying they have a problem with drinking, apologists for the Church claim that it is being unfairly victimised, that there are many ‘good' priests and only a little give the church a bad name; apologists for the PSD deploy much the same argument. However, in both cases this argument is based upon a denial of the problem and a desire to play the victim. This is not only in exceptionally poor taste, given the circumstances, but reflects the problems of a Romanian elite that thinks only of itself.
The exception to this response has perhaps been Piedone, who, after initially denying any responsibility and turning up with papers absolving them of any liability, accepted moral responsibility in their resignation.
Where are the intellectuals?
It is significant that these protests have come from below and reflect anger not just at the government but the wider elite. While President Iohannis has shown more political deftness than Ponta, this anger is directed at the whole establishment, and there is a widespread view that swapping the PSD for the PNL will not improve anything, as the PNL is just as corrupt as the PSD.
While some intellectuals have criticised others for failing to take an active role, the Romanian intelligentsia as a whole has been deeply ineffective in providing leadership, let alone working with or for the population. Thus something of a vacuum is emerging without any clear leadership or alternative. This has been evidenced in the protests of Tuesday night where rumours spread of agitators from the security services or other unknown groups attempting to disrupt and divide the protesters.
Other roadblocks to reform
At the same time, it is clear that considerable resistance from the Romanian political elite will remain. Despite the protests and calls for reform, on 4 November a collection of politicians from different parties launched an appeal to the Constitutional Court to challenge the recently passed law allowing the diaspora to vote by post. The diaspora, which is seen as a major force demanding change and supporting the reformists, is seen as an enemy to the political elite.
The timing of the move was deliberate: the cut off for changes to the electoral law is 15 November, and, by waiting until now, the challengers ensured that the Constitutional Court will not be able to make a decision until 18 November. Hence, even if the appeal ends up being rejected, the diaspora will still not be able to vote, and the Romanian political elite will more easily achieve its goal of keeping the rule. These political games and displays of power by the political elite go some way toward explaining why anger has now boiled over.
Why resign?
The cynical view expressed by many Romanians is that Ponta is resigning now, when they are not under direct fire, in order to appear as a martyr. They have no direct responsibility for permits for clubs in Bucharest, nor is the incident connected to allegations of corruption against him. If they had resigned when accused of plagiarism or corruption, this would have been seen as an admission of guilt. By resigning over something for which they are not directly responsible, they are trying to make themselves look like a ‘good guy' – the victim of a baying mob.
Furthermore, by resigning now and taking Oprea and Piedone with him, Ponta has removed the main targets of popular anger. They hope this will draw the sting out of the protests and that no deeper changes will need to be made. Thus, the resignation of the Ponta government may ensure that no real changes are made in the long run. However, the increase in the size of the protests on the evening of 4 November suggest that this may not happen.
Where to now?
The recent anti-corruption drive that led to criminal charges being levelled against Ponta has also swept up Mayor of Bucharest Sorin Oprescu, as well as several district Mayors. Large parts of the administration have thus been gutted, with temporary replacements in charge.
One reason Ponta held on for so long as Prime Minister is because, under the Romanian constitution, their successor has to be nominated by the President. Thus it was likely that any replacement would be from President Klaus Iohannis's PNL party rather than Ponta's PSD or their allies. By refusing to resign, and with a sufficient parliamentary majority to ensure that they could not lose a vote of confidence, Ponta was able to brazen their way out. By resigning now, they put the pressure on Iohannis and Ponta's replacement as president of the PSD, Liviu Dragnea (a man convicted of electoral fraud and suspected of widespread corruption), to find a replacement and to deal with the aftermath.
Some have suggested that the new government will be technocratic in character; however, this view is being met with suspicion that such a government would equate to more of the same. Names being floated as potential Prime Ministers include the likes of Monica Macovei, the former Justice Minister whose work started the current anti-corruption drive. Alternatively, Iohannis may push for early parliamentary elections to take advantage of the weakened PSD. However, this assumes that their supporters (especially in the diaspora) will vote and have not been alienated by anger with the situation. More significantly, the question remains whether the fire will result in any meaningful change in Romanian political life – whether corruption and the shirking of responsibility will end, or whether the names will change while the system remains the same.
The chant of the protesters of ‘No PNL, No PSD, No USL, all out' reflects anger at the whole system, and placards warning Iohannis: “you have one chance – no Securitate guys, no Mafia guys, no corruption, otherwise you'll end up in the garbage of history just like Ponta, Băsescu, Iliescu”, show that, while Iohannis has an opportunity to reshape Romanian politics for good and is still widely trusted, they also have a serious challenge to face. Any failure will result in further alienation and anger with the system.

After Jews, Muslims and Christians, Jerusalem is now a holy site for one more group: marijuana scientists.
A major marijuana research group has picked Jerusalem as the host city for its annual International Symposium on the Cannabinoids in 2021. The International Cannabinoid Research Society, the oldest group devoted to researching the medical and therapeutic benefits of marijuana, will meet under the aegis of Hebrew University's Multidisciplinary Center on Cannabinoid Research.
“Jerusalem holds a special place in the history of the science of cannabis and the endocannabinoids,” Dr. Cecilia Hillard, the executive director of the ICRS, said in a statement. Hillard noted that Hebrew University's Dr. Raphael Mechoulam was the first to discover the chemical structure of marijuana's famed active ingredient, THC.
Dr. Mechoulam, who has been with Hebrew University for over four decades, is widely regarded as the “father of cannabinoid research,” and will direct the upcoming symposium.
Israel, which bans recreational marijuana use but encourages medical consumption of the plant, is now considering exporting its greenhouse-grown, medical-grade herb.

Matt Viator pulled from their experience in the Southland Conference to make their first staff hire as ULM's football coach.
Stephen F. Austin offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Matt Kubik has agreed to take the same job with the Warhawks.
Kubik, a former quarterback at Louisiana Tech, directed a Lumberjack offense that scored 26 points per-game this season. In 2014, Kubik's offense averaged over 30 points and 400 total yards.
A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Kubik made previous coaching stops as an assistant coach at Central Arkansas, Northwestern State and Catholic (Baton Rouge) High School.
In addition to Kubik, several members of Viator's staff at McNeese State are on their way to ULM.
McNeese State co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach Tim Leger, running backs coach and special teams coordinator Slade Nagle, defensive backs coach Chris Hampton and defensive line coach Manny Michel will all follow Viator north to Monroe.
Michel previously spent 10 seasons coaching the defensive line at ULM for former coaches Bobby Keasler, Mike Collins and Charlie Weatherbie from 1999-08.

"Korea has gathered the world's attention with its CDMA and mobile technologies," Mr. An wrote, referring to digital cellular standards. "Now we need to prepare ourselves for the next market," which they said was radio-frequency identification, or RFID, and for U-cities. South Korea's Ministry of Information and Communication has earmarked $297 million to build an RFID research center in New Songdo.
Fulfilling this ambition, to a large degree, resides with John Kim, a 35-year-old Korean-American who leads New Songdo's U-city planning. Mr. Kim is vice president for strategy at New Songdo City Development, a joint venture of the Gale Company, an American developer, and POSCO E&C, a subsidiary of South Korea's giant steel company.
Mr. Kim, formerly a design leader at Yahoo, said the city's high-tech infrastructure will be a giant test bed for new technologies, and the city itself will exemplify a digital way of life, what they call "U-life."
"U-life will become its own brand, its own lifestyle," Mr. Kim said. It all starts with a resident's smart-card house key. "The same key can be used to get on the subway, pay a parking meter, see a movie, borrow a free public bicycle and so on. It'll be anonymous, won't be linked to your identity, and if lost you can quickly cancel the card and reset your door lock."
Residents will enjoy "full videoconferencing calls between neighbors, video on demand and wireless access to their digital content and property from anywhere in Songdo," they said.
Whether it lives up to its billing as an exportable city of the future -- its critics fear another planned-city disappointment like Brazil's capital, Brasília -- New Songdo will most likely be a chance to study the large-scale use of RFID, smart cards and sensor-based devices even as Western societies lag in this next wave of computing.
"There are really no comparable comprehensive frameworks for ubiquitous computing," said Anthony Townsend, a research director at the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, Calif., and a former Fulbright scholar in Seoul. "U-city is a uniquely Korean idea."

New Songdo, a free-enterprise zone where English will be the lingua franca, is often called the largest private real-estate development in the world. When completed in 2014, it is estimated that this $25 billion project will be home to 65,000 people and that 300,000 will work there. Amenities will include an aquarium, golf course, American-managed hospital and preparatory schools, a central park (like New York's), a system of canals (like Venice's) and pocket parks (like Savannah's), a self-described patchwork of elements gleaned from other cities.

People from Seoul and other crowded South Korean cities are already applying for apartments, and planners are counting on luring attractive businesses.
The technology infrastructure will be built and managed by Songdo U-Life, a partnership of New Songdo City Development and the South Korean network integrator LG CNS, which is recruiting foreign information-technology companies as partners.
"This is a profit-generating model, unlike other U-city projects," Mr. Kim said. "Songdo U-Life will charge building owners for facilities management and act as a gateway to services. Our partners will test market services that require, say, wireless data access everywhere or a common ID system, without having to build anything themselves."
More philosophically, "New Songdo sounds like it will be one big Petri dish for understanding how people want to use technology," said B.J. Fogg, the director of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University.
If so, it is an experiment much easier to do in Asia than in the West.
"Much of this technology was developed in U.S. research labs, but there are fewer social and regulatory obstacles to implementing them in Korea," said Mr. Townsend, who consulted on Seoul's own U-city plan, known as Digital Media City. "There is an historical expectation of less privacy. Korea is willing to put off the hard questions to take the early lead and set standards."
Two things Mr. Kim insists on are that U-life will not be used to test "junk" and that the digital services will be designed around people's needs rather than around the technology. "We'll be doing marketing and ethnographic research, digging deeper," they said. As part of that research, Mr. Kim asked the Cal State students to submit ideas for U-life.
While New Songdo's publicity material states that it seeks to avoid the "stressful flaws that compromise" existing cities, Mr. Townsend says they doubt that it will be able to emulate the creative energy of, say, Seoul. "Will it really be a place where people want to experiment?" they asked.
South Korea perceives an economic imperative in the answer. "Korea has a very strong I.T. industry, but our other economic sectors are not so good," said Geunho Lee, a senior research fellow at the Korea U-City Forum, a public-private group involved in supporting U-city projects across the country. "We need to test the business validity of these services in order to generate new value and economic growth."
The ability to do such vast market testing is enviable, said Dr. Fogg, of Stanford. "This is a competitive advantage for the Koreans," they said. "They will know before anyone else what flies."

"But I foresee that many services will fail," they added. "That's the nature of experimentation. They should be prepared for the frailties of human nature to emerge."
Sources with links to the justice department report that Fox News is under an FBI counterintelligence investigation for co-ordinating with the Kremlin in broadcasting propaganda.
While the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and journalistic freedom, sources say that signals intelligence gathered from so-called ‘incidental collection,' such as NSA collection on Sputnik and Russia Today, which is ongoing.
Specifically, Sean Hannity is on signals intelligence co-ordinating their pro-Trump message with organs of the Russian state, such as RT, Sputnik, Wikileaks and Julian Assange. However, emails co-ordinating messaging with registered agents of the Russian state are said to exist from more shows than that of Sean Hannity.
Furthermore, sources familiar with the matter say that the FBI is actively considering a referral to the FCC, in addition to any criminal prosecutions that may result for individuals not registering under FARA for coordinating with official agents of the Russian state.
Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate , there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.
A great many of Fox News' employees, anchors and executives have reported fearlessly on Trump and Russia, including Shep Smith. The problems appear to be executive based and systemic, these sources say, and a referral to the FCC is being considered. The First Amendment protects journalistic freedom, but systemic and repeated coordination with official organs of the Russian state is regarded as knowing collaboration with an enemy attack on America. Referral to the FCC is an option under consideration at a corporate level, sources report, and prosecutions for chief malicious actors, in particular Sean Hannity, are probable, these sources say.
The birthplace of Islam containing Mecca - Islam's holiest site - shifted to the Western Gregorian calendar on Sunday, bringing the oil-rich kingdom in line with many of its energy customers.
The Islamic lunar calendar is actually 11 days shorter than the 365-day solar year, which will actually save the kingdom money by cutting salary days for many public servants.
It's part of a larger series of cost-cutting measures recently imposed that includes cancelling some bonuses offered to state employees and hiking fees for entry visas for foreign visitors and residents.

Wylie (Texas) East Top247 running back Eno Benjamin named Iowa their leader back in January, and four months later they announced their verbal to the Hawkeyes.
The 247Sports Composite ranks Benjamin as the nation's No. 12 running back.
The four-star recruit and future U.S. Army All-American chose Iowa over their other finalists Baylor, Michigan and Oklahoma State.
Nobody recruited the 5-foot-9 Â½, 204-pound Benjamin harder.
“Just them being able to show they're consistently committed to me, I felt right,” Benjamin started in. “A few months before National Signing Day passed for 2016, four weeks straight they were at my school, every week.”
A visit to Iowa City in March sealed the dea.
“I felt that was the perfect school for me,” Benjamin said. “Just seeing everything, being able to be around their players and what they're all about. I like the facilities, and with these coaches they have there maybe one day I can take my talents to the next level which is the NFL.”
The 247Sports Composite ranks Benjamin as the nation's No. 12 running back and No. 169 recruit overall. They become commit No. 9 for the Hawkeyes as Iowa moves up four spots to No. 11 in the 247Sports National Recruiting Rankings.
As a junior Benjamin rushed for 2,652 yards and 41 touchdowns.

OKANOGAN COUNTY, Wash. – Officials with the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island said one of their aircraft was involved in the obscene skywritings spotted in Okanogan County.
Photos sent to KREM 2 by multiple sources show skydrawings of what some people are saying is male genitalia. Some sources have even tweeted pictures of what they saw.
A mother who lives in Okanogan who took pictures of the drawings reached out to KREM 2 to complain about the images, saying they were upset they might have to explain to their young children what the drawings were.
In a statement to KREM 2 News navy officials said, "The Navy holds its aircrew to the highest standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training value and we are holding the crew accountable."
KREM 2 spoke to the Federal Aviation Administration to get some information about who may have made the drawings. FAA officials said unless the act poses a safety risk, there is nothing they can do about it.
Global Installed Solar PV Capacity Will Surpass 756 GW By 2025, GlobalData
June 28th, 2016 by Joshua S Hill
Total installed solar PV capacity globally will surpass 756.1 GW by 2025, according to new projections published by GlobalData.
According to GlobalData's latest report, the global installed capacity of solar PV will increase from 271.4 GW in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% to 756.1 GW in 2025. This will represent a decline in growth from the CAGR of 50.1% seen during the 2006–2015 period, but that is to be expected with solar commanding a larger and larger installed base.
Unsurprisingly, GlobalData predicts China will remain a considerable influence on the global renewables market over the forecast period, remaining the world's largest solar installation market and increasing its share from its current 19.7% of global cumulative solar PV installations to 31.3% in 2025.
“China is a world leader in renewable energy investment, having proved itself a leader in wind power installation, wind turbine manufacturing, and solar PV manufacturing,” explained Pavan Vyakaranam, GlobalData's Project Manager covering Power. “Solar PV capacity in the country will continue to grow during the forecast period, from 60.5 GW in 2016 to 236.7 GW in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.5%.”
Going on: “Solar PV will play a significant role in China's future energy supply, as the government looks to this resource to meet growing energy demand. The central government, spurred on by growing environmental concerns, has planned many initiatives for rapid development of the domestic PV market. For example, China has implemented a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme for utility scale and incentives for rooftop PV, while the National Energy Agency has been promoting off-grid solar installations.”
The key factors continuing to drive strong growth in China will impact other countries as well.
“Policies such as net metering, FiTs, and renewable portfolio standards have had a key impact,” Vyakaranam continued. “Indeed, the US and Canada have implemented all three of these policies, and will register notable CAGRs of 14.6% and 10.6%, respectively in cumulative installed capacity during 2016–2025.
“Finally, the formation of solar alliances will also drive growth globally. Those such as the International Solar Alliance formed at COP21 between India and France may improve the investment scenario in the solar energy sector, helping it to grow further in the near future.”
New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman didn't mince their words. In their announcement of a lawsuit against Charter and its subsidiary Spectrum, formerly known as Time Warner Cable (TWC), they said: "The allegations in today's lawsuit confirm what millions of New Yorkers have long suspected -- Spectrum-Time Warner Cable has been ripping you off."
This comes as no surprise to many TWC subscribers. The cable internet service has numerous, almost daily complaints of outages. In 2014, TWC, which at the time was the US's second largest ISP, crashed across the nation. In early 2016, TWC reported that up to 320,000 of its customers had had their data leaked.
4G, 5G. OMG! When your smartphone rocks but your network sucks New innovations shown at MWC for mobile handsets appear promising, but the key issue that seems to be ignored is 4G over-subscription. Read More
It's not just unreliable service. Schneiderman is suing Charter for a "systematic scheme to defraud and mislead subscribers to its internet service by promising to deliver internet service that it knew it could not and would not deliver." This scheme had two parts, according to Schneiderman. First, Spectrum-TWC allegedly promised internet speeds it knew it could not deliver to subscribers. Second, it's claimed the company promised reliable access to online content it knew it couldn't deliver.
The New York Attorney General's office ran a 16-month investigation. They reviewed internal TWC corporate communications and hundreds of thousands of subscriber speed tests. The office found Spectrum-Time Warner subscribers were getting dramatically short-changed on both speed and reliability.
How bad was it? The suit claims subscribers' wired internet speeds for the premium plans (100, 200, and 300 Mbps) were up to 70 percent slower than promised. Wi-Fi speeds were, believe it or not, even slower. Some subscribers saw speeds 80 percent slower than what they'd paid for. For these "premium" plans Spectrum-TWC charged New Yorkers as much as $109.99 per month.
Further, Schneiderman accuses Spectrum-TWC executives of knowing the company's hardware and network couldn't deliver the promised speeds, and that despite this, TWC continued to claim the company was delivering reliably high-speed internet.
According to the Attorney General, this had been going on since at least 2012, and TWC's internet promises were impossible to keep because TWC leased deficient modem equipment to subscribers, which couldn't deliver the promised speeds. In addition to these deliberate equipment failures, Spectrum-TWC's network wasn't designed to deliver the promised bandwidth. As a result, TWC's internet links were overloaded and were unable to consistently deliver its promised speeds.
Rather than addressing this fundamental infrastructure problem, the Attorney General alleges TWC decided to cut costs by not fixing its equipment and network failures, and that to mask this misconduct, Spectrum-TWC faked test results.
At the same time, Spectrum-TWC earned billions of dollars in profits by allegedly defrauding and misleading New Yorkers by promising internet service they knew they could not deliver. The company also reportedly refused to make the capital investments needed to improve its network.
The New York Attorney General's Office is seeking restitution for New York consumers and an end to Spectrum-TWC's longstanding "deceptive practices". There is no word yet if other states will follow New York's lead. With Trump in charge and their picked man, net neutrality enemy Ajit Pai, in charge of the Federal Communications Commision (FCC), there seems little chance of federal relief.
Charter started to buy TWC for $78.7 billion in May 2015. The acquisition was completed in May 2016. There are now rumors Verizon is preparing to make an offer to buy Charter.

A man has spent a year losing 70lbs so they could donate their kidney to their wife.
PJ Spraggins was delighted when they discovered they were a perfect match for wife Tracy, who was told their life-long battle with Lupus would kill them if they didn't get a transplant. The waiting list is seven years long.
But the next day the couple from Birmingham, Alabama, were dealt a blow: their blood pressure was too high to perform the operation.
Refusing to accept the diagnosis, PJ embarked on a relentless fitness regime.
Finally, in December 2014, they got the green light. In February, they went under the knife together.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Transformation: PJ and Tracy Spraggins (pictured, left, in 2006, and right in 2015) together lost 145lbs in one year so they could donate their kidney to them On the transplant list, they would have had to wait seven years
Made it! After a year of grueling dieting and exercise, PJ was given the green light to undergo surgery
'We both just feel amazing. I'm slowly getting back to work making music, Tracy is making sure they fully recover. But the entire process has been amazing.'
Now 39, Tracy was six when they were first diagnosed with the chronic inflammatory disease which affects their kidney functions.
They were placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after their 34-year-old sister, who also had Lupus, died following complications from a kidney transplant.
Knowing that the seven-year wait might be too long, PJ, a self-employed musician, submitted themselves for the weeks-long evaluation to assess whether they could donate their kidney.
Journey: For a year, they kept losing weight and going in for tests, only to be told they needed to lose more
Finally, they visited Nashville's Vanderbilt hospital in December 2014, and the numbers all matched up
However, the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said their size meant the operation couldn't go ahead.
'They said I was a perfect match but they wanted to check I was healthy and met their requirements. They sent me a blood pressure monitor, but they didn't like the numbers.
'That was a real kick in the gut.'
The doctors advised PJ, who weighed 265lbs, to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation.
They did - but on the day of the test they changed a flat tire.
'My blood pressure was all over the place. The results came back and they said no again.'
It didn't stop there.
Next try was a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where they were told to another 60lbs.
Eventually, they made it to Nashville's Vanderbilt Hospital in December 2014. PJ made sure they did everything they could to ensure the readings were perfect.
'I put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day. And thankfully, it all came back good!'
Undergoing the four-hour surgery together on February 24, the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns.
Lifesaver: Special needs teacher Tracy, 39, has suffered from Lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, since they were six. In 2013, doctors in Birmingham, Alabama, said they would need a kidney transplant to survive
Happy: Spraggins (pictured in hospital) described the feeling of dejection at every hurdle until they made it
Perfect match: The chances of being a perfect match for one's spouse is rare
The couple, who married in 2003, are now back home and recovering in Birmingham
GIft! This was the festive Easter gift given to Tracy and PJ by Vanderbilt hospital
'The way my kidney function is now, it's at 100 percent. And it's at the best it's ever been,' Tracy, a special needs teacher, told Fox.
PJ told DailyMail.com: 'It has just been amazing. To know that I did everything I could to give my wife a better quality of life is just the best feeling. I am so happy.'
The couple's friends have now set up a fund to financially support them during the two-month recovery period when they will be unable to work.
Hey, no bigs. It's just a 100-year-old company and California's only surviving cannery, a sustainable, family-owned operation employing 30 people. The Drakes Bay Oyster Company has been in a seven-year fight with the federal government and environmental groups over whether it's 40-year lease would be renewed this week. The Lunny family, which owns the oyster farm, was among a group of families that sold their ranch lands to the National Parks Service in the 1970s to protect them from developers, with the understanding they would get 40-year-leases renewed in perpetuity. After buying and operating the oyster farm without incident— they were even featured as outstanding environmental flight attendants by the National Parks Service— the Lunnys learned in 2005 they were accused of bringing environmental damage to an area the NPS and environmentalists were anxious to designate as the nation's first federally recognized marine wilderness.
Sec. of the Interior Ken Salazar decided todaythe farm's lease will not be renewed, despite some support for it from from Sen. Dianne Feinstein and serious questions raised by scientists about the research used to impugn the Lunnys.
“After careful consideration of the applicable law and policy, I have directed the National Park Service to allow the permit for the Drakes Bay Oyster Company to expire at the end of its current term and to return the Drakes Estero to the state of wilderness that Congress designated for it in 1976,” Salazar said in a statement. “I believe it is the right decision for Point Reyes National Seashore and for future generations who will enjoy this treasured landscape.”
Please take 20 minutes to watch this video, a mini-documentary on how the federal government can bully a conscientious, small business into non-existence. It will make you sick to your stomach, especially as Corey Goodman, a member of the National Academy of Science and the California Council on Science and Technology, outlines the lengths to which the feds went to make it look as though Drakes Bay Oyster Co. was a polluter.
OysterZone.org has more information on the history of this fight. And, of course, a quick Google search reveals the federal government gives out subsidies for starting oyster farms on the East Coast while it's shutting them down on the West. I'm gonna stop now because I've gotten this far without cursing.
My thoughts and prayers are with the owners of Drakes Bay and its employees and their families today.
MIAMI, FL, October 19th – The Miami HEAT announced today that they have signed guard Briante Weber and waived guard Corey Hawkins. Per club policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Weber played all four seasons at Virginia Commonwealth, appearing in 127 games (65 starts) and averaged 6.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.94 steals and 23.4 minutes while shooting 42.6 percent from the field. They finished as VCU's all-time career steals leader (374), shattering the previous 29-year old record by 117, capping their career third on the NCAA's steals list, just 12 shy from becoming the all-time career leader before missing the final 10 games of their senior season due to injury. They became the first player in conference history to be named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year in three consecutive seasons, including their senior, junior and sophomore seasons, and also set a program record with a recorded 45.5-inch vertical leap.
As a senior, Weber appeared in 20 games (19 starts) and averaged 8.1 points, 4.3 assists, 3.90 steals, 3.7 rebounds and 26.5 minutes while shooting 40.1 percent from the field and 41.4 percent from three-point range. Despite missing the last 10 games of the season, they led the team in steals (78) and finished second in assists (85). Additionally, they dished out a career-high 10 assists against Oregon on November 25 and recorded a season-high nine steals vs. Toledo on November 18.
Weber will wear number 25.
Hawkins appeared in two games with the HEAT this preseason totaling six points, two rebounds and an assist in 14 minutes of action.
The U.S. Department of State has added two Canadians to its most-wanted global terrorist list.
Farah Mohamed Shirdon and Tarek Sakr were named as "Specially Designated Global Terrorists," according to a release from the State Department.
The designation "imposes sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a serious risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States."
Former Calgary resident Shirdon left Canada to fight with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
They were a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology until at least 2012 and was said to be radicalized at a now-closed mosque in downtown Calgary.
In 2014, the Toronto-born Shirdon was captured on video burning their Canadian passport and threatening Canada, the U.S. and "all oppressors."
The State Department said Shirdon is a prominent ISIS fighter and recruiter, who has also been involved in fundraising.
In 2015, RCMP charged Shirdon in absentia in with numerous terrorism-related criminal offences. That same year, Interpol added them to its wanted list.
Tarek Sakr, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, was a pharmacology student in Quebec. According to the U.S. State Department, Sakr has been linked to the foreign terrorist organization al-Nusrah Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.
The designation prohibits U.S citizens from engaging in transactions with Sakr or Shirdon.
On Christmas Eve, my thoughts turned to city hall and the legalization of secondary suites. Strange thing to consider on Christmas Eve, you're probably thinking. Not really. Because on that night, I was — for the third time — part of The Magic of Christmas program, one of Santa's volunteer elves who help bring the joy of the season to people in need.
Over those nights, I visited with a number of people — I'll call them the sheltered homeless — living in a variety of apparently illegal suites. At one point, I had to crawl under furnace ducting to get to one family's “home.” I later met a family of five living in a one-bedroom basement unit featuring exposed wiring, doorless kitchen cupboards and the distinctive smell of mould.
There are countless underprivileged people living in unregulated, unsafe, slum-like conditions like these who literally have no recourse. They put up with unspeakable conditions because they have nowhere else to go. If tenants complain, the only thing the city can do is to shut the “slum” landlords down, and effectively kick the tenants out. How can the city force improvements to something that isn't supposed to exist?
Landlords who allow tenants to live under these conditions are nothing short of criminal, in my opinion. Yet these suites represent an important supply of affordable housing in Calgary. If the city were to eliminate illegal suites, where else will the tenants go, except to homeless shelters that are already crowded? There is certainly enough capital in our community to bring these places to code. What we lack is legislation requiring landlords to do so.
This experience made me seriously question our city's lack of leadership on this critical social issue. We can all try to pretend that this situation isn't happening, but it is. In fact, my guess is that those on city council who voted against secondary suites last year fully understood the negative impact on the most vulnerable members of our community, but turned a blind eye and catered instead to the vocal and uninformed minority in their constituencies whose “not in my backyard” attitude has scared them away from doing what's necessary to improve the social landscape of this city.
Polls show that the vast majority of Calgarians are already in favour of legalizing secondary suites, and major community groups like the Calgary Chamber of Commerce are also behind it. But this isn't a question of popularity, it's now a question of leadership. For failing to move forward on this issue, for failing to protect these vulnerable tenants, and for failing to hold landlords — and our municipal politicians — to account, we are collectively to blame. There is simply no excuse for an inexcusable situation.
There are several conditions being floated under which suites should be legalized. All of them — related to meeting building and fire codes, on-site parking and homeowners living on the property — seem reasonable to me. I would add one caution: we may need to soften building codes for a time to allow people to transition toward legalized suites. This isn't a perfect scenario, but on balance, it appears to me to be the right thing to do for both landlords and tenants.
Secondary suites would help a wide variety of people, from students to people with aging parents, but it's the poor who most need it. City council is expected to vote again on this issue before the next election. As responsible citizens, we all have an obligation to speak up.
Simply put, I believe that councillors and community association leaders need to make sure that political and personal considerations aren't used as an excuse to avoid responsible and ethical urban development.
Calgary is a great place to live for most of us. It's time to make it a great place to live for all of us.

I've been drawn to the idea of saving lately. Nothing can help you to save money better than the absence of the thread breakage. Just try to estimate how much money you waste on dealing with a broken thread, then come back and retrace the embroidery. One should also remember that the place where the thread had broken stands out to the naked eye.
In theory (and in practice), every design should not just be beautiful, but, with the good performance, able to be embroidered, too. I've read on Frank Gawronski's website recently that a machine embroidery design is considered good when the thread breaks less than once every 10—15 thousand stitches on the multi-head embroidery machine. And less than once every 60—100 thousand stitches on the single-head embroidery machine.
Unfortunately, the facts that I've picked up in the course of my embroidery career, say the opposite. Often the consumables — needles and threads — were to blame. I remember that once when I was using a Chinese brand, the thread broke every 100—150 stitches, and when a German brand was used instead, the trouble vanished as it by magic. The embroidery looked fluffy without using any acrylic threads. Sometimes, an embroidery machine had its needle in the pie. And also the designs often are third-rate.
The reasons for the thread breakage depend on all kinds of factors:
The design
The embroidery sequence
Embroidery machine settings
Consumable materials (threads, needles, stabilizers and so on.)
Embroidery machine operating skills
I will not enlarge upon the embroidery process itself and also upon the consumable materials — those are the topics for two separate articles. I'd better bring your attention to the things you should check out in order to minimize the thread breakage.
The design
The embroidery sequence begins with the good design. Before digitizing it, you'll need to make the assessment in order to find possible problems. Such problems as too many details that result in multi-layered embroidery, which can lead to the thread breakage because of its thickness. Too small details: thin outlines, curved in too many places, etc. It is possible that some of them can be spared or simplified.
Digitizing
There are 3 main reasons why poor digitizing leads to the thread breakage:
Wrong stitch length
Automatic trimming in wrong places
Excess stitches squeezed into a too small embroidery area
Dealing with these reasons prevents about 75% of the thread breakage.
Wrong stitch length
As you know, almost any embroidery machine is capable of making stitches from 0.1 to 12.7 mm long. But in reality, it becomes clear that stitches under 1 mm and over 7 mm are the reason for additional thread breakage because of the curves and because the needle deviates from its axis.
Therefore, you should check out the stitch lengths in a design before digitizing. Modern embroidery software offers all kinds of handy tools, such as removing stitches shorter that the stated value. Also, there is splitting long stitches into shorter ones.
Carefully digitize automatic trims
I won't reinvent the wheel if I mention that a trim requires a tie-off before and after the trimming . Though I've often heard that you can dispose of the one after — the understitching is there, anyway, and it should not be secured with lock stitches, for they are underneath. Moreover, I tried this once. Technically the absence of lock stitch on the object that follows is a common reason for the thread coming out of the needle. And this can count as breakage.
Tie-offs protect the design from breaking loose . When the machine resumes the embroidery, in only has a short thread end to make the loop.
Therefore, you should place a lock stitch and resume the embroidery on a low speed in order to avoid thread coming out of needle at this moment.
Nowadays the digitizer won't have any trouble inserting a tie-off. For virtually every editor has a logical value that automatically does that after color change and trims. This makes the job much easier.
Lower the density
The excessive stitch count in a small embroidery area will lead to the thread breakage because of the high density. It is necessary to lower the design's stitch count, simplify the details, decrease the number of layers and use motif stitches and patterns. I.e. reduce the number of stitches as much as possible. I've expanded on the subject here.
Proper digitizing depends not so much on the software, but on the knowledge and skills of the design creator. For any embroidery editor is only the instrument for making the task quicker and easier. It cannot estimate whether the design is made right or wrong. Machine embroidery software does not know, what can be done and what is not recommended. It does not have an algorithm for such things.
It has been said that everybody who can draw in a computer program can learn to digitize machine embroidery in no time. But based on the above, one can conclude that a digitizer should know the embroidery process inside out and also have a profound knowledge of the theory of machine embroidery. This is necessary for understanding what embroidery software options work well enough, and what would be better done manually.
Whether they're reconciling or not, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner continue to keep the family together.
The Academy Award winner and their son Samuel, aged four years, were spotted taking a morning stroll and grabbing coffee in the Los Angeles suburb of Brentwood early Wednesday.
It's the latest clue that Affleck and Garner, who are both 44, are thriving in their mission to keep the family unit intact under any circumstance, nearly a year and three months months since they sent shock waves through Hollywood announcing their separation.
Scroll down for video
Heads up: Ben Affleck, 43, had a scruffy look on Wednesday as they walked with their son Samuel, aged four years, through the Los Angeles suburb of Brentwood
On the crisp autumn morning, a scruffy-faced Affleck wore a blue button-up shirt with blue jeans and grey sneakers, while young Samuel wore a white T-shirt and blue denim jean shorts.
And amid the endless cycle of messy show business splits, the latest being that of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Affleck and Garner - who also have two daughters, Violet, aged 10 years, and Seraphina, aged seven years - seem to have found a comfortable compromise.
The Argo star continues to live under the same roof as their estranged wife and three children in the well-heeled Southern California neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.

Morning Joe: The star and their son refuel with some beverages on their trek through town
Inseparable: With their unique arrangement, Ben has not missed out on any time with their kids since their separation with Jen Garner in the summer of 2015
'We are definitely a modern family,' Garner, who initially exchanged vows with the Armageddon star in 2005, told the TODAY show last month in opening up about the unique domestic arrangement. 'You don't have a choice - I mean, it has to be' all about the kids, the Daredevil diva added.
The family has even traveled abroad as one, as they did this past summer when they headed to England, while Affleck was reprising their role as Batman for next year's blockbuster Justice League. And it all came at Garner's suggestion.
'I felt like, "Well, the kids should have that experience"' of going to England, they said in their appearance on the NBC morning program. 'And they and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.'
One big happy family: The stars were spotted with daughter Violet and Samuel as they headed to a church service in Pacific Palisades April 24
Out and about: The celebrity clan ventured to the Pacific Palisades Farmers Market in September of 2015
The trip was a rousing success, according to Garner, who said that they and the kids 'had an amazing time' while spending time with Affleck when they aren't donning the Caped Crusader suit.
'He worked hard and got to join us for some - I want [the children] to see everything's OK,' they said.
The Alias beauty and Affleck, who have not filed divorce papers, spent about an hour-and-a-half over a cozy dinner, sans their three kids, at a Santa Monica restaurant last week.
Working it out?: Speculation continues to swirl over Ben and Jen, seen here on a stroll in Brentwood Tuesday, as they haven't yet filed for divorce or spoken of a rekindled romance
Still, despite the home harmony and copacetic co-parenting, neither Ben nor Jen has made any remarks about a potential reconciliation.

Also lined up at the box office is The Accountant, which opens October 14; and Live by Night, a Prohibition Era period piece which they direct and stars in, arriving in theaters January 27. Justice League will emerge in theaters later in the year, as it's slated for a November 17, 2017 release.
'THEY BEHAVED LIKE HUNTING DOGS': HOW MOD PROGRAMME TO HELP LIBYA DESCENDED INTO RAPE AND DRUNKEN RAPAGES
The Ministry of Defence had agreed to train Libyan cadets in support of the country's new government after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi.
But within months of the troops arriving at Bassingbourn Barracks in June, they were sent back to Libya in disgrace amid allegations of rape and sexual assault, as well as reports of drunken vandalism and fighting.
On Friday, five of the soldiers were jailed for their actions during a night of drunken rampaging through a city centre in which a man was raped and four women sexually assaulted.

Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abugtila, 23, were jailed for 12 years for the rape of a drunken man who they pounced on like a pair of 'hunting dogs.'
The court heard how they took turns to brutally assault their drunken victim in a Cambridge park after leaving their barracks without permission.
Moahmoud and Abugtila, who were among 300 Libyan trainees stationed at Bassingbourn, had denied rape and aiding and abetting rape but were found guilty at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday after a trial.
Three other Libyan soldiers from the same base, Ibrahim El Maarfi, 21, Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, and Khaled El Azibi, 19, were also jailed for sexually attacking four women in the same night in Cambridge last October.
They had stolen bikes and cycled the ten miles from Bassingbourn, before roaming the streets looking for victims and pounced on four women in the space of an hour.
El Maarfi also admitted indecent exposure and Abdalsalam admitted threatening behaviour towards a police officer.
El Azibi was jailed for 12 months and the other two were both locked up for 10 months and all three will be deported after their sentences from Norwich Crown Court.
The pair (circled) attacked like a pair of 'hunting dogs' when they targeted their drunken male victim
The male rape victim was a man in their 20s who had been at a wedding and they described their attackers as 'horrendous' and 'not human'.
Prosecutor John Farmer said the two were seen on CCTV leading them to Christ's Pieces park.
They said: 'They behaved like two hunting dogs who had seen a wounded animal.
'They effectively took them over and, initially not using too much force and later more forcefully, kept them going in the direction they wanted them to go.'
In the park, the defendants took it in turns to rape the man while the other held them down.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told officers: 'I cannot believe what I'm saying, they raped me. It was horrible, I feel horrible. Don't say anything to my mum.'
Describing them as 'animals', they added: 'I was trying my hardest. I was trying my hardest and they were like overpowering me.'
The man told officers: 'They were horrendous, they weren't human. They weren't human people. They were horrendous people, they were sick people.
'They don't deserve to live, they shouldn't be alive.'
Mahmoud and Abugtila will also be deported after serving their sentences.
After the rape allegations came to light in November, 300 of the Libyan troops - a mix of established armed forces, new recruits and former revolutionaries - were sent home early, amid further reports of disturbances around the base and a 'collapse of discipline' on it.
A risk assessment later released by the MoD under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the military had concerns about the potential conduct of the cadets from the start.
It raised particular concerns about cultural attitudes to sexual violence and reports of war-related rapes and attacks.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Parliament there were 'things we could have done better' and they admitted regrets over the way it was handled.
Now, pressure is growing Mr Fallon to apologise after the cadets were able to leave the base without permission because the perimeter 'leaked like a sieve'.
Peter Robinson, chairperson of Bassingbourn Parish Council, said: 'Our concerns were dismissed from the start - they were determined this was going ahead and we were treated like hysterical locals.
'Now, sadly, our concerns have been completely vindicated - it's just a shame it had to happen in such a terrible way.'
Residents first became concerned when they were told their usual access to facilities on the base was to be restricted for 'security reasons'.
'We weren't sure if this was to protect the Libyans from us or to protect us from them,' Mr Robinson said.
'We started thinking 'Are these men really so dangerous that we can't be allowed anywhere near them?'.
'It soon became clear these weren't really soldiers at all.'
Soldiers were able to jump the fence (pictured) and leave the barracks without permission
There were unconfirmed reports of the cadets storming the guardroom after one of their number was disciplined and regular Thursday night outbreaks of disorder.
Residents described finding soldiers hiding under cars, wandering the streets drunk and engaging in anti-social behaviour.
An MoD investigation later found the first signs of trouble in August when a shop worker reported being molested and recruits were spotted out unsupervised on three occasions.
Cambridgeshire Police were forced to deny 'incidents of disorder' but said officers had increased their presence in the area as 'reassurance' after riot vans were seen lining up in the high street.
The MoD has since said it will not carry out similar exercises at Bassingbourn - but such schemes could take place elsewhere in the UK.
A spokesperson said: 'We have been clear that we will not be repeating this training at Bassingbourn.
'Training of foreign recruits in the UK on this scale is unusual. We would normally seek to undertake any such activity, where invited, in the host country.
The site's coverage of the meeting is available here.
Gotz asked the chief similar questions at a town-hall meeting in April. That exchange is posted on YouTube.
Monday, De Caire interrupted Gotz and waved their hand, beckoning them into a back hallway for a private chat that Gotz video taped, with De Caire's knowledge.
I have never been invited by De Caire into the back for a private interview. Nor has any journalist who regularly attends the board meetings, so far as I know.
Gotz didn't want privacy.
"I would rather speak to them in a public place where everyone can bear witness," Gotz told me afterward. "The reason why they took me into the back hall was because they didn't want anyone to hear our questions or answers."
Their chat lasted only a minute or two.
Gotz is polite as they ask about "those officers that shot Steve Mesic."
"We're not going to discuss a specific case, we're not going to do that," says the chief. "Do you have a question?"
Gotz tries to reframe the question, but the chief shuts them down again, although they do provide a quick explanation of the investigative process being conducted. The whole exchange lasts less than two minutes.
A moment later, the chief emerged to the busy area where the rest of the media was waiting. But only for a second. They spotted Rob Chinnery and invited them back to the inner sanctum of offices for their own private chat.
It was brief. They asked the chief to use more social workers and fewer guns. They say the chief told them their goals are the same.
Immediately after that, the video shows, the chief walks toward Warrand Francis, who calls themselves a "police watchdog." They have posted rants about De Caire on YouTube.
The chief calls them by name and shakes their hand.
Then Francis says: "When can we expect your resignation based on your horrendous three-year stay as Hamilton chief?"
Francis is bold. Rude even. But there is no threat. No physical aggression.
"There's the door over there," answers De Caire, pointing to the door. The video shows officers hustling Gotz and Francis out. A moment later, I saw them myself, flanked by officers escorting them to the stairwell.
Here's how police spokesperson Catherine Martin described it: "At the end of the public portion of the Police Services Board meeting the chief spoke with a couple of citizens. When they finished their discussions, two of the three people were not very happy that it was over. They continued to voice their concerns. They were asked to leave the building and they did. And they were observed by Hamilton police leaving the building."
Meanwhile, in Toronto, the chief was welcoming accountability. Transparency. Questions.

The culture wars are the super-mega-crossover event of life.
Source: Kurt Busiek Twitter
Comic book writer Kurt Busiek found themselves persona non grata with the GamerGate movement after posting a screenshot on Twitter without comment, and ended up firing back with a Twitter takedown in one of the opening salvos of the brewing comic culture war. Bear with us here, as this gets a little confusing. We'll try to explain what happened.
The whole affair began earlier today, when the GamerGate affiliated group Honey Badger Radio was expelled from the Calgary Expo after allegations of harassment, which the group denies. In response, /r/KotakuInAction, the leading GamerGate subreddit, posted a thread to organize the culture war campaign response to the event.
Busiek made the following Tweet, pointing to the above screenshot of that thread, without comment:
And then with comment*:
In response, Kotaku In Action posted another thread, this time referencing Busiek's tweets referencing their thread, and then tweeted a link to the thread, which Busiek retweeted (...and breathe):
As a fan pointed out, they called the well-known comic book writer a comic book "artist."
A point which Busiek took some pleasure in:
Busiek issued a general takedown of the state of discourse on the internet:
And then they delivered their assessment of the rules of discourse with Gamergate:
So it looks like GamerGate has come to comics. What now? The culture wars aren't new to this fandom by any means. In fact, it was just last week that saw comic book artists, led by Rob Liefeld, take an "anti-censorship" stance against criticism they view as a moral panic in a movement that, if not directly associated with GamerGate, is certainly ideologically compatible. But today's skirmishes have been between comic book writers like Mark Waid and Busiek versus GamerGate proper, signaling the beginning of what could be a much larger conflict. The blockbuster comics event of the year may not be Convergence or Secret Wars, but the epic real life battle for control of the industry's soul.
What other creators will go forth and do culture battle in the coming weeks, and which side will they be on? How long can notable industry pros avoid directly clashing with each other over these issues? I've been monitoring this stuff for a long time, and I think we're reaching the point where things are about to get ugly around here.
When they do, we'll be here to cover it... unless we end up casualties ourselves. Stay tuned!
*A slight update:
Ron Duwell | Gaming Reviews & News by
The Legend of Zelda is still a defining title to this day, and many fans point to it as the entry that was the most “open” in terms of letting players solve the world for themselves. For an 8-bit game that is over 30 years old, it still feels fresh in today's expanding market.
Nintendo might have rewritten the book on open-ended design, but recent discoveries show that this almost wasn't the game. The Hyrule Encylopedia has uploaded a long-lost screenshot from before the game was released, and the early build shows a much different game. For one, it was a first-person exploration game, more similar to Might and Magic or Etrian Odyssey for today's audiences. The genre was very popular back then in Japan, and Nintendo very well might have been trying to capitalize on that popularity.
@Unseen64 Hyrule Encyclopedia, just released in Japan, reveals the only known screenshot of a SUPER old build of the first Legend of Zelda! pic.twitter.com/PXGBxkZnVA — ZeldaPower.com (@ZeldaPower) April 6, 2017
Can you imagine!?
Still, more importantly, the game offered a dungeon selection screen. Immediately, this tosses open world exploration out the door, turning this first-person dungeon crawler into a segmented maze game that doesn't even allow them to get out and find their way through the world on their own.
Iwata had spoken about this original build before
The late Nintendo President Satoru Iwata had dug into this early Legend of Zelda build before in their “Iwata Asks” series. The original game's programmer Toshihiko Nakago explained this idea was scrapped before the game even had a title.
This is the planning sheet for the dungeon select screen we drew up back then. The title is ‘Adventure Title,' so we hadn't decided on The Legend of Zelda yet. And that's Miyamoto-san's signature.
The idea just completely blows my mind. If Nintendo had stuck with this rule, then the series might not have become the international hit that it did. The first-person dungeon crawler wasn't nearly as popular on North American consoles as it was on PCs or in Japan. It is best known for bringing the complexities of those games into a much simpler gameplay method, one that doesn't scare gamers away immediately.
No international support means no sequels, no Link to the Past, no Ocarina of Time, and ultimately, no Breath of the Wild and no reason to buy a Nintendo Switch! I consider this shift in direction one of Nintendo's wisest moves.

China has decided to raise its poverty line to RMB 2,300 yuan (approximately USD 360) per capita annual income; the population below the poverty line will be raised from 26.88 million to 130 million accordingly.
Premier Wen Jiabao has stressed [zh] that the adjustment is to include more people in the country's poverty relief scheme. However, does the new poverty line reflect the reality of China's poor?
Poverty defined by policy
The World Bank has defined extreme poverty as living on less than USD 1.25 a day, and moderate poverty as less than USD 2 a day, since 2008.
Given China is among the ‘Big Four‘ (BRIC) countries in the developing world, the new poverty line of USD 0.99 a day, is considered far below the international standards.
Yahoo China has prepared a special feature [zh] to address the issue, which rightly points out that the current poverty line drawn by the Chinese government is based on the daily caloric intake per capita. In addition, the line is drawn by the government poverty relief policy rather than being a reflection of people's livelihoods:
我们国家现有的贫困线，更多是一种“扶贫线”。换言之，从最低收入人群算起，国家财力能够承担扶贫到哪条线，就以此作为我们国内的贫困线——这个扶贫线是扶贫能力本位的，是政府可以讨价还价的。
The current poverty line is more a decision of the “poverty relief policy”, which means a line among the lowest income social groups where the government can afford to intervene. The poverty line is guided by the government's poverty relief work and the government can make adjustments according to its political needs.
贫困线标准提高带来的不仅是穷人数量的增加，还有更多中国的扶贫资金投入。而贫困资金的发放，采取定名额分配及认定贫困县的方式。目前，中国共有592个贫困县，其认定是在1990年代完成的。这不仅造成地方与中央在资金分配方面博弈，引发腐败。
The raising of the poverty line has not only resulted in an increase of the poor population, but also an increase in poverty relief funding. The distribution of the funds comes through the 592 counties, which were defined in 1990 as poor. The decision is hence also a political negotiation between the central government and local governments in public expenditure. Sometimes corruption is involved in the process.
Most of the Chinese netizens find the figure unrealistic and are also skeptical of the government's poverty relief work, as indicated by the following comments on The Wall Street Journal's Weibo discussion thread [zh]:
不学无术的黑籽：贫困标准被随意地玩弄着……2300一年可以干嘛？ (今天 13:58)
不学无术的黑籽：The poverty standard is pure manipulation… what can you do with [RMB] 2,300 annual income?
德德的吧：年纯收入2300元，合每天收入6.3元人民币，在北京不知道是否可吃碗面条，估计街头要饭的也不在此列
德德的吧：annual income RMB 2,300, which means daily income RMB 6.3 yuan. In Beijing, a bowl of noodles would cost more than that. A beggar would not fall under this poverty line.
岳_宸：一面是贫困人口食不裹腹，看不起病，上不起学；一面是有望超越日本成为世界上最大的奢侈品市场。贫富差距不断扩大越来越成为不容忽视的问题。
岳_宸：On the one hand we have the poor who are starving and can't afford medical care and education; on the other hand, we expect our luxury product market to become the greatest in the world. The income disparity problem is indispensable.
bigwooder：再穷不能穷领导，社会主义好
bigwooder：However poor we are, our leaders cannot be poor. This is the advantage of socialism.
ChaoI3：我百度了一下08年公车消费900亿元,其他的历年三公经费都查不到.我想11年三公经费一定超万亿了,那就是等于40年的扶贫补助.对此我只想说:呵呵!
ChaoI3：I searched around in Baidu [search engine] and found our that our government's annual expenditure on vehicles was RMB 90 billion in 2008. However, I could not find the exact figure on the three public expenditures [on vehicles, travel and subsistence] on the Internet. My estimation is that it must have reached trillions of yuan in the past 11 years. Such an amount is equal to 40 years of poverty relief expenses. Ha!

USA/China comparison
The Chinese poverty line figure becomes more controversial when compared with its United States (US) counterpart. The US poverty line was set at USD 22,314 annual income per household in 2010, which is equal to USD 5,578.5 (RMB 35,579 yuan) annual income per capita – more than 15 times the current poverty line level set by the Chinese government.
While local media outlet, Caijing highlighted [zh] the fact that one third of children in the US is living under the poverty line, Chinese netizens are envious of America's poor:
等待是为了不再等待：美国是被贫困，我们是被中产
等待是为了不再等待：The US has been wrongly depicted as poor, while we are wrongly depicted as middle class.
哥又要人身攻击了：晕,我家属于贫困中的贫困了,完了,年收入还不到1半呢.
哥又要人身攻击了：My God, my family is poorer than the poor. Our household income is less than half of the poverty line in the US
新远峰：这是新闻呢还是说我们过的比人家幸福吗？猪狗不如的美狗和掌权着看看自己的土地上的贫穷 的人的生活。我们在于他们相比，算是赤贫，活在这个世界算是悲哀
新远峰：This piece of news is telling us that our lives are far happier than the Americans? That the bastard US government has been ignoring the poor? When compared with the US, we are in extreme poverty. How pathetic we are.
三胖子的那点小事：我要去美国当穷人……
三胖子的那点小事：I want to go to the US to become the poor….
月本-无心：按这标准，在中国月收入低于1万1人民币的四口之家都是贫困人口。那全国95%都是贫困人口了。
月本-无心：According to the US standard, in China if the household annual income is less that RMB 11,000 yuan, one should be regarded as poor. 95% of the [Chinese] nation's population are poor.
呼唤-人性：美国的贫困线标准是：年收入低于人均gdp的1/3，就是大概15000美元；中国的贫困线标准大概是人均gdp的1/30，是1500元人民币。你说谁更像社会主义？
呼唤-人性：The US poverty line is set according to 1/3 of the annual per capita GDP level, which is about USD 15,000. While in China, the poverty live had been set at 1/30 of the annual per capita GDP level, which is about RMB 1,500 yuan. Tell me, which country looks more socialist to you?
A number of Weibo users compare China and the US's economic figures to make their points about the poverty line:
小小lo [zh]：Horizontal comparison: the poverty line levels [in China] in 1985, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 206, 1,067, 1,196, 1,500, 2,300. The ratios to the GDP per capita were 24%, 5.3%, 4.7%, 5.0% and 6.8% (expected); When compared with the US, in 2010 the poverty line was set at USD 11,390 which is equal to 24% of the GDP per capita. In China, it is very difficult to become a poor person.
老真天真 ：The poverty line in the US is USD 15 daily per capita income, while in China, it is RMB 6.3 (USD 0.99). The US poverty standard is 15 times higher than the Chinese counterpart. While in terms of per capita GDP, the US is 10 times higher than the Chinese counterpart. Let's take a look at the food price. In the US, the price of pork is half that of the Chinese counterpart. Corn and beans are cheaper than China. It is very obvious that the living standard of the poor in China is much much lower than their US counterparts.

Imagine a world where you can control objects with your eyes instead of your hands. With virtual reality moving into the mainstream, this could become an everyday activity. Marvel has already shown us how it could work in its Iron Man movies: Tony Stark frequently interacts with their armor through eye-tracking and voice control, freeing them up to save the world.
So how soon until we get this kind of capability?
There are currently no “control scheme” standards in the VR world. In other words, every company is creating its own method for users to navigate and interact with virtual spaces. Handheld controls are currently the most prevalent option, although eye-tracking has emerged as an alternative more recently. At the moment, all three major high-end virtual reality headsets — Rift, Vive, and Project Morpheus — rely on traditional game controllers, wands, or a combination of the two. On the opposite end of the spectrum, VR startup Fove is working on eye-tracking.
None of the control tools currently on the market has emerged as the all-around “best.” Each has its own pros and cons.
The least immersive way to interact with a virtual reality experience is through a traditional game controller. Companies are using these types of controllers because consumers are already familiar with them, but also because one of the biggest applications for VR to date has been video games. But a traditional game controller seriously limits immersion by locking a user's hands to a device.
Additionally, anyone who has used a traditional handheld controller in VR knows that it can create a disconnect between what you see and what you are doing with your hands. This pulls you out of the experience.
Wands are significantly more immersive and better suited to VR than traditional gaming controllers, as they allow users to move their arms and hands to interact with the virtual environment. It appears that the VR industry is moving in this direction. Still, wands can be clunky and unnatural.
For the time being, these types of controllers are the best we have, at least until technology reaches the point where controllers morph into usable gloves. But where the industry really needs to be headed in terms of the most lifelike immersive experience is some form of eye tracking. After all, isn't this how we take in everything around us in real life? We identify what's interesting through our eyes and then decide if it's something we want to interact with.
Fove raised about $490,000 this summer to create a head-mounted display with eye-tracking capabilities. The two biggest advantages to eye-tracking as a navigation and interaction tool is that it removes unnatural head movement and frees up viewers' hands.
Next-generation headsets will likely combine multiple navigation and interaction schemes that include a mix of traditional controllers, wands, eye-tracking, and voice control. But what might this look like?
Returning to the Iron Man metaphor, users could combine voice control and eye-tracking to remain in the virtual experience while interacting with menus. For example, users could use voice control to bring up a settings menu and then rely on eye-tracking to adjust volume and clarity.
This type of interaction and navigation scheme could also work in reverse. A user could focus on an area inside the virtual experience and then use voice control to interact with various in-experience elements. This would eliminate the need to navigate with your eyes and let you fully take in your surroundings.
In general, voice controls would greatly increase the immersiveness of a virtual experience. If users were able to toggle voice control on or off, they could use that option to adjust the virtual experience without pausing or stopping.
More likely than voice control, though, headset manufacturers will probably first combine eye-tracking with handheld controllers. This combination would work in much the same way that voice control and eye-tracking might function together: Eye-tracking would act as a cursor while the controller would function as a selection tool.
It's far from certain which potential navigation and interaction schemes will dominate. However, as virtual reality becomes more widely adopted, there is a growing need to standardize navigation and interaction, as well as to find ways to increase immersion. While some manufacturers will continue to cling to traditional game controllers, the very best will include eye-tracking or voice-control or some combination of both.

The red hair gene could be on the way out as it is thought to be a response to cloudy weather in Scotland, something which the country could see less and less of.
A gene mutation that yields red hair and pale skin which is more sensitive to light leaves DNA in skill cells more prone to sun damage and cancer, and if predictions of rising temperatures are correct evolution might cause it to regress.
Dr Alistair Moffat, managing director of Galashiels-based ScotlandsDNA, said: "We think red hair in Scotland, Ireland and in the North of England is adaption to the climate.

"I think the reason for light skin and red hair is that we do not get enough sun and we have to get all the vitamin D we can.
"If the climate is changing and it is to become more cloudy or less cloudy then this will affect the gene.
"If it was to get less cloudy and there was more sun, then yes, there would be fewer people carrying the gene."

Another scientist, who did not wish to be named due to the theoretical nature of the work, told ScotlandNow: "I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out.
"Climate change could see a decline in the number of people with red hair in Scotland.
"It would take many hundreds of years for this to happen.
"Red hair and blue eyes are not adapted to a warm climate.
"It is just a theory but the recessive gene may likely be lost. The recessive gene could be in danger."
Only 1-2% of the world's population have red hair, though in Scotland 13% of the population are ginger and 40% are thought to carry the gene.

To me, there are few more comforting sights on a farm or in a garden than a frog hopping about amid the crops. Frogs and other amphibians don't just look and sound cool—they also feast upon the insects that feast upon the plants we eat. These bug-scarfing creatures are a free source of what is known as biological pest control.
But modern industrial agriculture doesn't have much use for them. It leans on chemistry, not biology, to control pests—and in doing so, it's probably contributing to the catastrophic global decline of amphibians, a natural ally to farmers for millennia. The irony is stark: In industrial agriculture's zeal to wipe out pests, it is helping to wipe out those pests' natural predators. The latest evidence: a new study showing that exposure to common pesticides at levels used in farm fields can kill frogs rapidly.
For a decade or so, it has become increasingly clear that widely used herbicides like Syngenta's atrazine, in tiny amounts found in streams after running off from farm fields, do crazy things to the sexual development of frogs. Such “endocrine-disrupting chemicals” have what scientists call chronic, not acute, effects on amphibians—that is, they don't kill them outright, but they alter them profoundly—even change their gender. (See Dashka Slater's profile of a scientist who documented atrazine's impact on frogs, earning a backlash from Syngenta.) Monsanto's blockbuster herbicide Roundup also exerts subtle but important harm on amphibians, research suggests.
Again, this research focuses on what happens to amphibians when they encounter agricultural poisons at low levels in ponds and streams. But what happens when they are actually sprayed with chemicals in farm fields? That's where the new study, a recent peer-reviewed paper by a group of German and Swiss scientists, comes in. They write that the phenomenon of frogs experiencing direct contact with pesticides has been little-studied, even though the scenario is quite common on the ground—farmland has become one of the “the largest terrestrial biomes on Earth, occupying more than 40% of the land surface,” and thus represents an “essential habitat for amphibians.”
In other words, frogs and related species have little choice but to hang out on farms. What happens when they're in the wrong place at the wrong time—i.e., on a field when the crop duster shows up?
For one of the pesticides in the study, all of the frogs died within an hour of exposure.
To find out, the researchers subjected groups of frogs to varying levels of a variety of pesticides (a category that includes insect killers, weed killers, and fungus killers) commonly used in Germany and Switzerland. The exposure came at three different levels: one-tenth of the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at the recommended level, and ten times the recommended level (because farmers don't always follow the instructions on the bag). And rather than use only the “active” ingredient of each pesticide, as many researchers do, this team used the actual formulation available to farmers. That's because pesticides are a mixture of active poisons and chemical solvents designed to ensure that the poisons work as intended. And these solvents, too, can have toxic properties.
The results are startling. In the chart below, the red lines represent the percentage of frogs that died within seven days of exposure at the recommended rate. As you can see, for two different fungicides—one called Headline and and another called Captan Omya—frogs had 100 percent mortality rate at the recommended concentration level. For Headline, we learn elsewhere in the study, all of the frogs died within an hour of exposure. All seven pesticides in the study delivered mortality rates at the recommended level well above those of the frogs in the control group, which were sprayed with water.
Note the two fungicides at the left end of the chart, Headline and BASF 500 18 F, both made by the German chemical giant BASF. The two fungicides share the same active ingredient, a chemical called pyraclostrobin; but they had widely different mortality rates at the recommended concentration level, 100 percent vs. a bit more than 20 percent. What gives? Turns out that the deadlier one, Headline, is a mixture of pyraclostrobin and a petroleum-based solvent called naphtha, with naphtha making up 67 percent of the mix. The less-deadly one contains less than 25 percent naphtha. This result led the researchers to conjecture that that “other chemicals in the formulation may play a major role in the effect size of pesticides.” It should be noted that solvents and other inactive ingredients used in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide (not included in this study) have also shown toxic effects in published research.
BASF's pyraclostrobin-based herbicides are widely used in the US. BASF Crop Protection USA promotes Headline as a kind of wonder-substance. On its website, the company declares:
Not only does Headline provide excellent disease control, it actually promotes improved Plant Health. The unique chemistry of its active ingredient, F500® [pyraclostrobin], enables more efficient nitrogen uptake, more robust plant growth and better stress tolerance to heat, hail, wind and drought. Ultimately, this means healthier plants and higher yield potential.
BASF pushes Headline particularly hard on corn growers. For other crops, including berries, carrots, grapes, onions, stone fruit, strawberries, tree nuts, hops, and pistachios, the company promotes a pyraclostrobin-based fungicide called Pristine. It's not clear how much naphtha Pristine contains—according to its label, it contains 62 percent unnamed “other ingredients.” (Pristine wasn't included in this study.)
I asked BASF to respond to the study, and in an emailed statement, the company responded via email that it “takes these findings very seriously and will study them further.” But it also disputed their significance:
The study design neither reflects conditions of realistic agricultural use in practice nor the natural behavior of the animals. Amphibians are not exposed to such pesticide concentrations in practice and under normal agricultural conditions. For instance, Pyraclostrobin is not applied to the bare ground but to the crop, and the plants in the field will certainly reduce the exposure to the amphibians. In addition, amphibians tend to hide (under leaves or in the soil) during times of application. Accordingly, BASF considers the risk to amphibians resulting from Pyraclostrobin to be low in practice and under normal agricultural conditions.
But the paper addresses that criticism. “Although interception by crops may reduce exposure, repeated pesticide applications in a growing season might result in multiple contacts with a variety of products,” the study states. If all it takes to kill a frog is a single spray, you're using a problematic pesticide, full stop.
Picture moderately related, Counter-Strike SAS troops.
A group of Manchester teens, on a crime spree of breaking into vans and stealing tools, tried the handle on the wrong van over the weekend and were confronted by a squad of armed SAS (Special Air Service) troops on a surveillance mission. Not gonna lie, I would've shot the kids.
A source said: "The lads each had a machine gun and a side pistol with live ammunition to make it realistic. They saw these scrotes coming for some time.
"They didn't want to move for fear of ruining the exercise and hoped the gang would pass them by. "The lads decided they would teach them a lesson if they did get into their van, which is exactly what happened. With the team's cover blown, the exercise was cancelled.
I hope we all learned a valuable lesson today. "Not to break into unmarked vans?" Yes -- because? "Because there might be a squad of highly-trained killers on the other side?" Correct, or -- OR -- a guy with a lollipop stuck to their genitals.

Earlier this month, the United States attempted to play the role of ‘victim' after two separate incidents in which Russian aircraft came close to US naval vessels.
“There have been repeated incidents over the past year where Russian aircraft have come close enough to other air and sea traffic to raise serious safety concerns,” Pentagon spokesperson Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters last week.
“Unsafe and unprofessional actions by a single pilot have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions between the two countries,” they added.
Of course, as this news is plastered across millions of American televisions to incite fear and hate toward a country who currently poses very little threat to the US, the mainstream media conveniently leaves out any reference to the geographical context of these flyovers.
One can see from the humorous, yet entirely accurate, depiction above that the idea of the Russians being aggressive is asinine when including the United States' geographical location at the time of the flyover.
It is also important to note that during both flyovers, the Russian jets were completely bare and had zero munitions attached.
But these facts are irrelevant to the warmongers in D.C. who just deployed advanced F-22 U.S. fighters a mere one country away from the Russian state, in Romania.
Reuters reports that the US fighter jet mission in Romania is to “show that the United States is ready to flex its military muscles if needed, and don't provoke the Russians.”
In true Orwellian fashion, one of the fighter pilots told Reuters, “We're not here to provoke anybody, we're here to work with our allies.”
The report states Washington is beefing up support for NATO as they are “under pressure from an increasingly aggressive Russia.”
Calling the Russians “aggressive” for flying an unarmed jet near a US attack fleet that was in their backyard would be laughable if it wasn't so deceptive.
Though Russia couldn't be mistaken for an angel, the military and White House's ostensible fears appear largely bloated and mostly artificial as they have helped to snub out ISIS, and done absolutely nothing to the US — up to an including irresponsible saber rattling.
Imagine for a moment, the Russians had a Naval fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, and a US fighter pilot flew out over it to see what they were doing. Would this behavior be referred to as ‘aggressive'?
Then, imagine for another moment, the Russians deployed advanced fighter jets to Mexico for the sole purpose of showing it's “ready to flex its military muscles if needed.” And then, the Russians claimed that this deployment of advanced weaponry, right in their backyard, was not an attempt to provoke them. Would anyone in this country take them serious?
Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski recently offered pertinent insight in an interview with RT about why Russia continues to be so vilified by the Pentagon and American media alike:
“The Pentagon needs and wants Russia to be the next big enemy that they are arming against it, budgeting against it, that they are targeting. Certainly, we have talked for a long time about China and China plays an important role as the enemy of choice for the U.S. military. But Russia is ideal in part, because we don't import a lot of things from Russia, in part because we don't have the debt relationship with Russia that we do with China. So, Russia makes for a very convenient enemy for the Pentagon in terms of its mission, its budgeting, and its intelligence organization.” “The Pentagon needs that kind of enemy,” Kwiatkowski continued. “And [U.S. Secretary of Defense] Ashton Carter, if you listen to what they say continually — even from the beginning of time they were put in office — their job is fundraising, just like the university president's job is not education but rather fundraising. Ashton Carter's job is also fundraising, and they fundraise through this process of identifying, pushing, and delivering up an enemy that will justify their budgets.”
The United States is picking a fight with a country so it can bolster the military industrial complex. It is sheer insanity.
In a press conference earlier this month, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter backed up the whistleblowing Lt. Col. as they touted the US Military's 2016 Posture Statement. In the statement, the US declares Russia the largest threat in the world.
Despite terror attacks and threats by ISIS across the West, including inside America, the Pentagon has declared Russia a greater threat. In fact, Russia, China, North Korea, and laughably Iran — all countries who have done nothing to the US — are considered a greater threat than the Islamic state.
In spite of their claims, American actions will inevitably serve to further provoke Russian military action and force the hand of the second largest military in the world.
While this may be splendid news for defense contractors and weapons manufacturers, it's extremely dangerous news for the rest of the world. One strategic miscalculation could result in events spiraling drastically out of control.
At first I didn't really know how to write about this because it still makes no sense even when I see it written on other combat sports websites.
But since others are reporting it's true... a new digital broadcast network with teenager text message slang in the logo (URshow.tv) has announced a crazy pay-per-view of fights that will hurt your brain even as they delight your senses.
The weird and whacky and wascally fight card:
Yes, that's right, 47-year-old legendary boxer Roy Jones Jr. will fight a "fan" in the boxing portion of the event, meaning Anderson Silva finally has an opportunity to live their dream.
Then in mixed martial arts (MMA) the decrepit bodies of Ken Shamrock (52) and Dan Severn (57) will climb into the cage for a third and deciding fight of a matchup nobody was clamoring to see (but everybody likely will want to).
In in the fake portion of the event, pro wrestlers Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio will put on what's sure to be a crowd-pleasing performance.
And finally, retired UFC middleweight Chael Sonnen will grapple current UFC middleweight Michael Bisping to prove something, or other.
What's got me confused is the involvement of Shamrock and Bisping. First of all, Shamrock is fighting Royce Gracie on Feb. 19 for Bellator 149, so unless Shammy intends to take a dive then it's hard to imagine they heal up and trains for a new fight inside of 29 days.
Second, Bisping is set to fight a UFC bout against Anderson Silva on Feb. 27, 2016, in front of their fans in London, U.K., at UFC Fight Night 84. So let's hope they don't get brutally KTFO because three weeks later he's supposed to go and grapple with Sonnen.
Again, weird! So goddamn bizarre it makes me keep checking the calendar for April 1.
This is all set to go down on March 20, 2016.
Are you going to order this craziness?
BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — A Brunswick County historic site will be closed at least a couple of days after a break-in overnight.
According to the Facebook page for the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, the break-in last night led to damage to the building, as well as the theft of donation money and artifacts.
- Advertisement -
The Brunswick County Sheriff's Office said the site was broken into around 2 a.m. Sunday. Site manager Jim McKee said the suspect(s) cut the barbed wire from a section of fence, jumped it, and kicked in one of the glass doors to the main building. They said three civil war buttons were taken from an exhibit.
“There are not a lot of written records, so a lot of the information we get is from the archaeology,” McKee said. “Those buttons give us the insight to the men who built this fort, who lived at this fort, who fought here, and who may have even died here.”
They added that one of the buttons is pretty rare while the other two are more common. The Sheriff's Office incident report lists the value of each button at $150, but McKee said the true value is in how much someone would be willing to pay for them on the open market.
McKee said they plan to post photos of those buttons soon, in hopes that the public can keep an eye out for them.
“Whoever stole these things didn't steal them from the site, they stole them from the citizens of North Carolina,” McKee said.
A Brunswick County Sheriff's Office spokesperson says the agency is investigating the crime. The site hopes to reopen to Tuesday, according to the post.
The historic site is located along the Cape Fear River off NC 133 between Leland and Southport. Brunswick Town was a pre-revolutionary port destroyed by the British in 1776. Fort Anderson was built on top the old village site. It served as part of the Cape Fear River defenses below Wilmington before the fall of the Confederacy.
Authorities have announced that they have narrowed their list of suspects in the case of Akbar “SoNNeikO” Butaev's missing visa to three different ESPORTS conspiracies, each of which with a history of sketchy activity around previous International tournaments.
Real Life DDoSers:
Given the regularity with which Na`Vi's matches have been subject to distributed denial of service or “DDoS” attacks, ESPORTS police allege DDoSers have submitted thousands of fraudulent visa application packets, forcing United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to mass reject to all visa applications from the CIS region.
Last Surviving Member of Rat Dota Subspecies:
Some reports indicate that Butaev's visa has already been granted, but intercepted as it flew to them by by what conservationists claim could be the last of the once numerous woodland rat “bunomys heinrichi.”
While bunomys heinrichi once flourished, extensive deforestation has driven it to the brink of extinction. Now, zoologists posit that one last specimen has surfaced in Northern Europe.
Experts have theorised this lone rat, unable to follow its traditional migrational route from the dense wooded regions of Sweden to Seattle this year, has been forced to prepare for the harsh winter by building a nest in the dense paperwork necessitated by Visa applications.
Cultists from the Church of Standintology:
According to cultists dedicated to the worship of the shifting vagaries of Dota 2's proscene, the black book of Dota 2 pro-gaming is very specific on the procedure for repeat visa denials. The rites are well-documented and detailed in the Libro Flamma, though which of the stand-in elementals will be summoned remains hotly contested among esports philosophers.
According to famed Dota occultist Aleister Drowley's Dota Bestiary,
“There are three ‘prime stand-ins' that may be summoned by the rite:
Jimmy “Demon” Ho – A malevolent trickster spirit summoned by MYM for TI1, EG for TI2, and Liquid for TI4, their puckish exuberance is as likely to win games by landslides as it is to lose matches wholesale.
Mason “Mason” Venne – A pub elemental from one of Dota's trench netherplanes, summoned by EG for TI4, Mason has the capacity to help a team realise their truest potential for one season, after which they must be banished to the murk from which they were spawned.
Steve “Excalibur” Ye – Summoned too soon to aid Fnatic in its quest for TI4 glory, Excalibur allows a team moderate success in any tournaments they have already entered, before consuming the team with drama and infighting. Currently Excalibur exists in a non-playing, stoned state from which only Pendragon and their wizard Merlini may awaken him.”
(Reuters) — What looms over businesses as far flung as car repair, lab equipment and swimming pool gear? In a word, Amazon.
Almost 700 U.S. companies have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, and the e-commerce titan's name has popped up on roughly one of every 10 earnings conference calls so far. And the retailers whose lunch has long been eaten by Amazon.com Inc haven't even reported yet.
In all, Amazon has been raised either in passing or with some urgency on 75 calls hosted by corporate chieftains in the past several weeks, according to a Reuters analysis of call transcripts from components of the S&P 1500. That's well more than twice as many mentions as Google or its parent Alphabet Inc and over three times as many as Apple Inc.
The preponderance of Amazon mentions by executives and Wall Street analysts is the latest indication of its rapidly expanding reach. Its move last month to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for nearly $14 billion has added fresh fuel to the concerns.
Once primarily a scourge of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, Amazon's cloud over U.S. business has spread to more corners of the economy and raised worries about where it could strike next. Even executives for whom Amazon was not previously a top concern have found themselves responding to questions about how it may burst into their industries.
On the call for 3M Co, which makes everything from scouring pads to stainless steel dental crowns, Amazon was raised by several analysts. Executives at diversified healthcare company Johnson & Johnson were asked how Amazon might pose a risk to its consumer brands.
McDonald's Corp CEO Stephen Easterbrook declined to respond directly to a question about implications of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal. But they did say: “It just demonstrates how disruptive the business world is and how quickly it moves.”
It was the first time a McDonald's, 3M or J&J executive had faced an Amazon-related question in an earnings call, according to data from Thomson Reuters dating back to 2000.
“Just that name puts fear even if it's just a rumor that they might be going into your space,” said Alan Lancz, president of Toledo, Ohio-based investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., who has been an investor for more than 30 years. “To be over all these different sectors and all these different spaces, I can't recall anything like that.”
Eyes on Amazon
Not all of the Amazon references reflect worry. In many instances, companies talked up existing and potential partnerships with Amazon, bounties from the recent Amazon Prime Day sale, or opportunities that might stem from a Whole Foods purchase.
But Amazon emerged as a source of analyst concern on conference calls for tire servicer Monro Muffler Brake Inc, swimming pool equipment distributor Pool Corp and water heater maker A.O. Smith.
“I can tell you that we do think that they're a force,” Albert Nahmad, chief executive of Watsco Inc, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning system distributor, said in response to a question. “The economy's never seen anything like it.”
“We keep our eyes on Amazon,” they added.
At issue is the competitive threat from Amazon's massive size, willingness to sell at low prices and desire to push into a vast array of products or business lines.
In its own quarterly report late on Thursday, Amazon reported a jump in retail sales along with a profit slump, as its rapid, costly expansion into new shopping categories and countries showed no sign of slowing.
Whole Foods on Their Minds
The Whole Foods deal roiled retailers, supermarkets and companies in the food-supply chain. But analysts are also asking real estate investment trusts and banks about their exposure to grocers, while Dover Corp, which manufacturers refrigeration equipment, and Silgan Holdings, which supplies packaging for consumer goods products, also were queried about the deal.
“It seems like everyone's asking that question at this stage,” Silgan CEO Anthony Allott said when asked about the penetration of e-commerce in groceries in the wake of the deal, adding that they viewed it as an opportunity.
Amazon is generating an outsized amount of chatter on Wall Street as well.
Bank research notes and sales and trading commentary this month have contained nearly twice the number of Amazon mentions as for Microsoft and Apple, with Amazon tripling the number of Alphabet references, according to data from Street Contxt, an institutional content and data-insights platform for brokers and investors.
Amazon has been mentioned nearly 17 times as much as the average company, according to Street Contxt.
Jeff Hammond, an equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said investors are concerned that distributors of a variety of industrial wares are vulnerable to Amazon.
“For commodity products with low differentiation, where price is higher on the list and it's a smaller item that's easy to deliver, that's probably something that Amazon can be competitive at,” Hammond said.
For some executives, the Amazon question has been a periodic feature, even in arenas well beyond its traditional boundaries.
Executives at Thermo Fisher Scientific, whose business includes supplying equipment to research laboratories, have fielded questions about an Amazon impact as far back as five years. This month its CEO said it was investing in its e-commerce capabilities and its supply chain.
“We take Amazon very seriously,” Thermo Fisher Chief Executive Marc Casper said on the call, “and we always have.”
At the London Cyclist we were very sad to hear that Olympic Champion Dani King had a nasty accident with a pothole last week.
In this case, the accident caused their five broken ribs and a collapsed lung – fortunately extensive injuries such as this are rare but it's a reminder we receive all too often about the potential dangers.
Whilst we can't miraculously improve the roads for you, we've provided some advice to help keep you safe on some of the less well maintained roads in Britain…
Look head
This one could perhaps go without saying, but you should stay alert when riding your bike. Look ahead at the road, and make sure you constantly scan your surroundings – looking side to side for wayward padestrians and turning cars, as well as straight ahead. Constantly checking the road in front of you means you'll spot a hole earlier.
Be well equipped
It is a good idea to keep your tyres pumped to the correct PSI. If you are unfortunate enough to hit a hole, too little pressure can result in a pinch flat, whilst two much give you no bounce at all, and will hit the hole much harder.
Recommended PSI should be on the sidewall of your tyre, and you should go to the bottom end of the scale if you are quite light, and the top end if you are on the heavier side
Wider tyres on mountain bikes, hybrid bikes and cyclocross bikes can take much more of a hammering, if you ride a road bike, opt for the widest tyres you have clearance for – this is likely to be 25mm or 28mm.
Road positioning
Riding at the very edge of the road, next to the pavement, is a very common mistake made by new cyclists. Often, riders do this to ‘stay out the way' of drivers, but it puts them at risk – at the edge of the road you are less visible, drivers will pass much closer, and you've got nowhere to go if a pothole appears in your path.
Ride around 1 metre from the curb on wide roads, giving yourself plenty of room to maneuver if needed. On narrow roads, take the primary position and ride in the centre of the lane – this is advised by cycle training instructors and perfectly within the laws of the road.
Don't ride through puddles (unless you have no choice)
Puddles can hide a lot – particularly potholes, gravel, and rocks. If you can avoid it, do not ride through them. If you absolutely have to, try to stick to the edge, where it's not as deep.
Call holes in a group
If you ride in a group you must learn to provide instructions to riders behind you.
Riding in a peloton on a group ride means the rider behind you cannot see the road clearly – if you see a hole coming up, or pass a hole, point to it, and shout ‘hole' – this instruction should be passed back through the group.
If the rider in front of you alerts you, copy them and relay the message back, so you give an advanced warning.
If you happen to ‘hook up' with another rider on a commute, and you are aware they are drafting your wheel (and you don't mind sharing the load with them), you can extend the same courtesies.
Be ready for impact
If you do see a hole too late, or you are unable to go around it, don't panic.
Grip the handlebar tightly – this will prevent you losing control, but keep your arms, elbows and knees relaxed, to absorb the blow. Point your wheel directly forwards, as letting it swerve increases the chance of losing balance.
If the hole was large and you think you are likely to have sustained a flat tyre, roll slowly and brake when it's safe, without making sudden movements that could cause a deflated tyre to slip off the rim.

Modern markets have evolved into vastly complicated organisms with thousands of data points competing for attention. It's our job to transform this information flood into an efficient set of charts, tickers, indexes and indicators that support our profit objectives. Part of this task requires observation of broad market forces, while the balance demands a narrow focus on specific securities used to execute our strategies.
Most traders have real-life jobs and responsibilities away from home, forcing them to access the markets through pint-sized smartphones, gathering the information needed to assume new risk and manage open positions to a profitable or unprofitable conclusion. These folks will benefit with the screen saving tips I've outlined in Top Strategies Remote Traders Should Follow.
A fortunate minority sits at home or in a proprietary shop and trades full time. These folks need more detailed on-screen information because they're assuming greater risk. The additional data cover the same territory as the remote participant but in far greater detail. In addition, these traders need to set aside space for incubation of future opportunities, with a focus on market groups not currently being traded.
How many monitors do at-home traders need to watch the markets efficiently? The answer has changed over the years because monitor prices have dropped substantially while graphics cards now routinely support multiple monitor setups. Given the low cost, it makes sense to add as many monitors as you can fit comfortably in the space set aside for the function, while not exceeding your budget or your ability to promptly analyze the information you put on them.
[No matter what kind of trader you are, the ideal setup for your trading screens will depend on the specific indicators and oscillators you choose to analyze. To learn more about these tools, check out the Technical Analysis course on the Investopedia Academy, which includes on-demand videos and interactive content to help you improve your trading skills.]
Building Effective Trading Screens
Generally speaking, traders do a poor job capturing the three types of information needed to support a comprehensive visual analysis: market observation, position management and incubator. Each square inch of screen space wasted with unnecessary charts or data contributes to an incomplete view that can be costly in an active trading style. Nearly all traders have made the most common mistake at some point in the careers, i.e. loading up screens with too many charts and not enough tickers.
Reserve charting for must-watch tickers, with a second group set to different time frames that link to a single symbol from the watch list. If space is limited, add a time frame toolbar to fewer charts and flip through different settings on that chart. Specific time frames utilized for this analysis should match your market approach. While not set in stone, the following settings offer a good starting point:
Scalpers: 5-minute, 15-minute and hourly charts.
Swing Traders: 15-minute, hourly and daily charts
Market Timers: hourly, daily and weekly charts or daily, weekly and monthly charts
Must-have charts may include the following:
S&P 500 futures or SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) set to 15-minute time frame
Nasdaq 100 Futures or Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ) set to 15-minute time frame
VIX - CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) set to 15-minute time frame
24-hour 15-minute charts of market-moving securities such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the US Oil Fund (USO).
If possible, keep two sets of S&P 500 futures charts, one for the U.S.-only session, starting at 9:30 a.m. ET and ending at 4:15 p.m. ET, and a second 24-hour 60-minute futures chart that tracks overnight action in Asia and Europe. This second chart is enormously useful in getting up to speed when you open your workstation in the morning. (See also: Interpreting Overnight Action in the Index Futures.)
What about a real-time news ticker? This is a personal choice because some strategies rely on breaking news to execute positions while the majority works perfectly well with a stand-alone third-party service or a carefully curated Twitter stream. As a general rule, it is best to keep news off your charting and data programs, saving the precious space for charts and security tickers.
Sample Setups
These images capture highlight methods to use screen space efficiently, regardless of the number of monitors used to watch the financial markets. The panels in these examples scale well when adding new screens, or when loading up a small laptop for travel. When pressed for space, reduce the number of charts and securities while keeping the entire set of indexes and indicators.
The top panel (1) highlights major benchmarks, showing detailed information on the Dow Industrial Average, S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq indexes. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts sit at eye level so traders can watch in real time during the market day. Open, high, low and last data columns reveal how current price is interacting with key levels, which also mark intraday support and resistance.
The center left panel (2) deconstructs the Level 2 market depth screen, eliminating extraneous columns in favor of a streamlined view that displays just price and size. Market center data are no longer useful because the vast majority of intraday transactions never make it to this screen, due to high-frequency trading algorithms (HFT). The time and sales ticker on the right side has been reduced to core elements as well, showing just time, price and size. (See also: The World of High Frequency Algorithmic Trading.)
The center right panel (3) displays a simplified portfolio view for long-term positions. It isn't required but is extremely useful when a position blows up and requires the trader's attention. The lower panel (4) contains detailed information on open positions as well as securities being watched for entry. Price and percentage change measure intraday performance, while volume and average volume reveal activity level compared with prior sessions. Open, high, low and last columns replace charts in many cases, allowing easy visualization of the daily pattern.
Top left (1) and top right (2) panels display scaled-down data on secondary ticker lists. These are compiled over time through news, scans, homework, media play and all the other ways we find interesting trade setups. Volume and average volume columns are especially important on these lists because they identify active securities in just a glance. The chart (3) links to tickers on all the panels through the green symbol on the upper left. Traders can also flip through time frames, from 2-minute to monthly, by clicking on the top toolbar.
Top left (1) and center left (2) panels display market internals and key indexes not shown on the first screen. Learning to interpret this background information correctly takes time, but the effort is worthwhile because it builds significant tape reading skills. The top right (3) panel contains the same columns as other secondary lists but focuses on a specific market group … energy and commodities in this case. Finally, the bottom left (4) chart keeps a real-time VIX on display, while the bottom right chart (5) shows a core security you'll watch for years or decades.

The Bottom Line
No sustainable GMO solution to Bt-resistant pests
Stacked-trait Bt crops and Monsanto's new gene-silencing technology are unlikely to provide a lasting solution to resistant crop-munching pests, reports Claire Robinson
GM Bt insecticidal maize has fallen victim to the armyworm pest in Brazil, as GMWatch reported early in 2015.
Two types of maize targeting the fall armyworm (among other pests) are widely planted in Brazil:
* MON810 event with the Cry1Ab Bt toxin gene (Cry1Ab maize)
* TC1507 event with the cry1F Bt toxin gene (Cry1F maize).
As fall armyworm has developed resistance to MON810 Cry1Ab maize, Cry1F maize has replaced it as a supposed solution.
But a new study (abstract below) by Brazilian and US scientists, including several from Monsanto, shows that neither maize is successfully combatting the fall armyworm pest, which has rapidly developed resistance to GM Bt technology.
And the GM industry appears to have no sustainable solution to the resistance problem in the pipeline.
Main findings of new study
The new study found that:
* Fall armyworm larvae are only “moderately susceptible” to the Cry1Ab Bt insecticidal toxin protein expressed in MON810 maize.
* Efficacy of MON810 in combating fall armyworm is decreasing over time as the pest develops resistance to the Cry1Ab Bt toxin. Farmers have to spray insecticides to prevent serious damage to the crop.
* GM maize expressing another Bt toxin insecticidal protein, Cry1F, is currently planted in Brazil. But the fall armyworm pest has also developed widespread resistance to Cry1F in Brazil and Puerto Rico.
* The “refuge strategy”, recommended to delay resistance to Bt crops, is failing, though it's also been poorly implemented in Brazil. The refuge strategy consists of planting areas of non-Bt crops near Bt crop fields to try to ensure that some of the pests remain susceptible to Bt toxin and are able to mate with Bt-resistant pests, producing Bt-susceptible progeny. But the delayed development of larvae reared on MON810 compared with larvae reared on non-Bt maize means that it may be hard for Bt-resistant pests to find Bt-susceptible pests to mate with, thus potentially undermining the refuge strategy and hastening pest resistance.
* MON810 contains only a moderate dose of Bt toxin, meaning that some insect pests will eat the Bt maize and survive, passing on their resistance genes and increasing the problem of pest resistance.
* Because maize is grown in Brazil in two consecutive crops in the same season, fall armyworm populations can build up over time. Also, the pest has multiple food sources, increasing its survivability.
* The above factors favour resistance to chemical insecticides and Bt crops developing in fall armyworm in Brazil.
* The Cry1F Bt maize planted in Brazil does not contain a high enough dose of Bt toxin to enable successful control of fall armyworm.
* Cross-resistance between different Bt toxin (Cry) proteins is expected to occur in fall armyworm, based on experimental studies.
* The researchers were unable to conclude whether the fall armyworm's resistance to Cry1Ab was due to exposure to MON810 or to other Bt toxins, such as Cry1F (cross-resistance).
Potential solutions?
As a solution to these problems, the authors recommend, “Technologies combining multiple novel insecticidal traits with no cross-resistance to the current Cry1 proteins and high activity against the same target pests should be pursued in Brazil and similar environments.”
These are so-called stacked-trait Bt crops, containing multiple Bt toxins. The aim is that pests that are not killed by one type of Bt toxin will be killed by another in the “stack” of Bt traits.
In addition, Monsanto's new maize, which combines Bt toxin with RNAi (RNA interference) technology targeting the rootworm pest, is currently in the USDA deregulation pipeline. The RNAi works by silencing or manipulating genes within the insect that it needs to survive, thus killing it.
Will it work?
We invited Dr Doug Gurian-Sherman, senior scientist at the Center for Food Safety, to comment on whether these proposed solutions are likely to work.
Dr Gurian-Sherman said:
“Other research shows that several Bt stacks that are intended to delay resistance to Bt can actually have cross-resistance, and are therefore not effective as stacks. This has also been shown for other insects as well, for example, the cotton bollworm.
“Cross-resistance has not been shown between several Cry proteins, e.g. Cry3 and Cry34/35 for rootworm, and some other combinations for Lepidoptera [moth] control. But that does not mean it cannot happen. Several different mechanisms of resistance have already been found, but it is possible that currently unknown mechanisms for cross-resistance may develop.
“Even if cross-resistance does not occur, several mechanisms can develop sequentially to provide resistance to several Bts if they are not deployed carefully.
“In fact, for stacks with several different toxins (or other mechanisms like RNAi), resistance to one of the components in the stack is often already prevalent when the stacked variety is released commercially. This means that in reality, a stack of two genes will really act as only a single gene – the one for which resistance is not widespread – and the stack will not delay resistance any longer than a single gene.
“This seems to be the common occurrence at this point – for example, with rootworm Bt or GM herbicide-tolerance genes – perhaps because the time and cost needed to develop each gene means that they will usually be released sequentially rather than several at once.
“Additionally, neither Monsanto's Bt against rootworm nor its new anti-rootworm RNAi corn provide a high enough dose to be effective for resistance prevention when the current mandated refuge strategy, intended to prevent or delay resistance, is applied. Indeed, resistance to Monsanto's Cry3Bb1 developed after just a few years. With most insect pests (e.g. bollworm, rootworm, armyworm), when a high enough dose of Bt is not provided by the GM Bt crop, resistance has developed within 5–10 years or less.”
Gene-silencing technology to the rescue?
Could the RNAi technology make up for any inadequacy in the Bt content?
Dr Gurian-Sherman said:
“We have no experience with commercial RNAi transgenics for insect control, but there is no reason to think that resistance can't develop as quickly as with other types of control, such as pesticides or other GE.
“Pests have their own native mechanisms for manipulating or detoxifying chemicals or avoiding harm from those chemicals, which they use to develop resistance to chemical insecticides and Bt insecticidal toxins. These include genetic mutations and rare variations in existing genes (alleles). I am suggesting that similar processes will operate with RNAi.
“Insects have native RNAi genetics, which regulate and manipulate these small RNA molecules. RNAi, while new as a means of controlling pests, is not new to pests, but is part of their native biology. Insects have been adept at developing resistance to chemical insecticides, in part because they have many biochemical mechanisms to manipulate (metabolize) many kinds of chemicals, and because natural mutations occur or already exist that make the target of the chemicals immune to them – and these mechanisms can be adapted to provide resistance. In the same vein, insects are also biochemically familiar with RNAi.
“Unless there are big changes in terms of providing robust means of preventing or delaying resistance, resistance to RNAi will likely develop before long. And the history with Bt so far is that for traits that do not provide a high dose of the pesticide, adequate resistance prevention has not been mandated by regulations.”
Dustbin of history
In short, Monsanto's new gene-silencing solution to pest resistance to GM Bt crops appears doomed to go the same way as its GM Bt crops – into the dustbin of agricultural history.
In the meantime, scientists warn that eating GM crops and other products containing gene-silencing technology could do serious damage to animal and human consumers, as well as to ecosystems.

Field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ab maize by Spodoptera frugiperda in Brazil
Omoto, C., Bernardi, O., Salmeron, E., Sorgatto, R. J., Dourado, P. M., et al. (2015).
Pest Management Science. DOI: 10.1002/ps.4201
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ps.4201/abstract
Abstract
Background
The first Bt maize in Brazil was launched in 2008 and contained the MON 810 event, which expresses Cry1Ab protein. Although the Cry1Ab dose in MON 810 is not high against fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), MON 810 provided commercial levels of control. To support insect resistance management in Brazil, the baseline and ongoing susceptibility of FAW was examined using protein bioassays, and the level of control and life history parameters of FAW were evaluated on MON 810 maize.
Results
Baseline diet-overlay assays with Cry1Ab (16 µg cm−2) caused 76.3% mortality to field FAW populations sampled in 2009. Moderate mortality (48.8%) and significant growth inhibition (88.4%) were verified in leaf disc bioassays. In greenhouse trials, MON 810 had significantly less damage than non-Bt maize. The surviving FAW larvae on MON 810 (22.4% ) had a 5.5-day increase in life cycle time and a 24% reduction in population growth rate. Resistance monitoring (2010–2015) showed a significant reduction in Cry1Ab susceptibility of FAW over time. Additionally, a significant reduction in the field efficacy of MON 810 maize against FAW was observed in different regions from crop season 2009 to 2013.
Conclusions
The decrease susceptibility to Cry1Ab was expected, but the specific contributions to this resistance by MON 810 maize cannot be distinguished from cross-resistance to Cry1Ab caused by exposure to Cry1F maize. Technologies combining multiple novel insecticidal traits with no cross resistance to the current Cry1 proteins and high activity against the same target pests should be pursued in Brazil and similar environments.
The owner of a dog shot and killed by police in a now notorious incident has asked the public to stop making threats against the officers involved.
Leon Rosby held a press conference July 3 asking everyone to "just calm down. Stop threatening them and their families. All police officers are not bad," NBC News reports.
Their Rottweiler, Max, was shot four times by police as they were attempting to take Rosby into custody. They had been filming them as they were making a separate arrest. The incident was caught on video and loaded to YouTube, where it's provoked national outrage and numerous death threats to the officers and their families. The officers have had to be assigned to desk duty and their families placed under protection.
Meanwhile, Hawthorne police released a new video taken from a different angle that they say shows the officer was justified in their shooting. In the second video, the officer who shot the dog can be seen pointing a gun at it before it lunges toward him. Their face and that of the other officers have been obscured. According to the police, this video shows "there wasn't anything else that could have been done."
In a video interview after the incident, Rosby agreed that the officer had their gun drawn before their dog, Max, lunged at the, saying, "He had their gun drawn already. So they came over to kill [my dog]."
Police issued a statement Wednesday saying, "This Department truly feels in the loss of the Rottweiler dog 'Max' and for those impacted by such. We, as a department, as animal owners ourselves, and the officer directly involved himself, all relate and empathize in this."
Hawthorne Police Chief Robert Fager said that their department is taking the threats—delivered phone calls, e-mail and social media—very seriously. "These aren't just threats off ill-will. These are absolutely threats to life."
The department does not provide training specific to aggressive dogs, Fager told NBC News. After the enormous public outcry, they might want to rethink that.
Rosby is set to appear in court next month. He's been charged with obstruction.
UPDATE, 10:45 A.M.:
The hacker group Anonymous has also threatened the Hawthorne police, saying in a YouTube video that they are the group's "primary target."

I didn't think it was physically possible, but over the weekend, the performance artist known as Michele Bachmann out-crazied herself.
I believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service. And the real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums.
Bachmann is referring to the Serve America Act, which expands the AmeriCorps program and is co-sponsored by the closet Stalinist, Orrin Hatch.
You really have to listen to the whole segment. Bachmann ominously announces she's "watching our freedoms slip out the door," warns that "President Obama wants to cede American sovereignty to trans-national global authorities," and once again calls for everyone to be "armed with knowledge so that they can be dangerous to the views of the Left."
But the takeaway is that we have a sitting Congresswoman telling people that the government is going to brainwash their kids in modern-day gulags.
There's going to be a lot more Pittsburghs if this kind of talk continues, I'm afraid.
New study is a further testament to the hardiness of the water bear
The water bear is the cockroach of microbes; they nearly always pull through when researchers throw them into Armageddon-like conditions. Now it seems that even their unborn young have unprecedented endurance.
The microscopic animals called water bears already have quite a number of accomplishments under their belts. In experiments, they've survived the vacuum of space, large doses of radiation, extreme heat, extreme cold, and extreme pressure, giving scientists cause believing that the little guys could potentially live on other planets and weather long journeys across space… But to pull this off, they'd have to reproduce. Scientists have now exposed water bear eggs to three of these stressors—extreme temperature, vacuum, and a dose of radiation so strong that exposure to even a fraction of it would kill a human in days. They found that provided the eggs are given a chance to dehydrate themselves and go dormant, surprising numbers that survive: more than 70% of eggs for the temperature test, and more than 50% for the radiation test, while vacuum-exposed eggs hatched at similar rates as control eggs.

I signed my 7 year old son up for this exchange because they are very much into fantasy things (Star Wars, LOTR, Hobbit, Harry Potter, etc.), and has been really wanting a "real" wizard wand (ie, not pipecleaners twisted together). Well, midgetpepper came, sprinkled some fairy dust, and BAM! BEST GIFT EVER!
It turns out that my Magical Santa has an 8 year old boy, who helped pick everything out. I'm not sure I've ever heard so many "No way"'s, "Awesome!"'s, and "Wow"'s together in one moment before. Tell mini-midgetpepper that they did an EXCELLENT job!
To start, my son and I both had letters. Theirs was from mini-midgetpepper, and they were almost too excited to read it all. Mine was from the one and only midgetpepper. I'm going to be honest here for a minute: I'm not a crier. I may tear up, I may sniffle, but I rarely cry. Well, this letter...I bawled. Without going into specifics, I just can't imagine being in your situation, and being as generous and optimistic as you obviously are. Sometimes Reddit Gifts brings more than a material object or two, they bring a new perspective. Thank you for giving one to me.
Ok, mush is over. Onto the good stuff, right? To start, an AWESOME Skylanders shirt. This is the kiddo's latest obsession; all allowance money has been saved and spent on Skylanders for the past 6 months. But does it stop there? Oh no. Also included is a Clone Trooper Figurine (Me: "Oooo a Star Wars doll!" Him: "Mom. It. Is. NOT. A doll. It is an OFFICIAL Clone Trooper." Oopsie-daisy!), and an AWESOME Lego set (Gandolf is like, the coolest, and we were one of the first in line for The Hobbit). And then, what, another letter? Kiddo started reading then stopped mid way through, putting their hands over their mouth in excitement. This isn't just a letter, it's an official Hogwart's Letter! And next to that, could it be?! A real Marauder's Map?! "NO WAY!" But wait...what's that wrapped in the Hogwart's Letter, there? At this point, my son no longer sounded like a human. Squeals and shrieks could be heard throughout the neighborhood, I'm sure. A real, honest-to-goodness wand, just for him. Their wand. And according to my note from earlier, this was made by none other than the Wizardess herself, midgetpepper. That makes that wand 100x more special.
All in all, midgetpepper, you are truly one of a kind. You (and mini-midgetpepper) have gone above and beyond what was expected and anticipated, and have made a 7 year old's day that much brighter.
Thank you times a million! And also, don't you dare apologize for the length of time it took for us to get this gift (which, honestly, was not that long, anyway). This was worth the wait and then some.

LEOMINSTER, Mass. -- A Massachusetts police officer is under investigation after allegations that they directed a racial slur at Boston Red Sox outfielder Carl Crawford last week.
Leominster Mayor Dean Mazzarella said the patrolman is on vacation and will be placed on desk duty next week. The city's inquiry is expected to conclude Tuesday.
Mazzarella, a life-long Red Sox fan, didn't name the officer but says he's a 5-year veteran and white, with no prior disciplinary issues.
Crawford, who is black, was on a rehab assignment with the Portland Sea Dogs on July 5 when they say before a game against the New Hampshire Fisher Cats in Manchester, N.H., a heckling fan called them a "monday," which can be a derogatory term for blacks.
Fisher Cats president Rick Brenner has apologized to Crawford.

Happy Moustache May everyone, it's finally here! Those of you beginning to participate in this month's event of growing a stache for the charity of your choosing might want to start with a clean shave…so we brought in the big guns! Anyone familiar with the classic technique of the wet shave, which we preach here, will have heard of our next guest, “Mantic 59.” Those who have not will think we are about to interview a popular rapper or graffiti artist, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Those of you on the up and up will also know “Mantic 59” to be Mark Herro, master of the classic wet shave over at Sharpologist.com, and also The Shave Tutor over at YouTube.
In much the same way taking an art history class opens us up to the finer aesthetics of the different modes of self-expression, and give us the words to describe them, Mark has done something very similar through their articles and tutorials. Mark has really made better shavers out of us all, and given us a true appreciation for the art. So again, for those who are new to the name, though I am not truly sure how well they can rhyme or how they fair with a can of spray paint, this is neither rapper nor graffiti artist, but in fact Mark “Mantic 59” Herro, The Sharpologist. I know you will find this interview both entertaining and educational, Enjoy!
HTGAM: For the readers that are new to wet shaving and may, though I am not sure how, not heard of you yet, please give us a brief introduction.
Mark: Sure, I'm Mark, AKA “Mantic59.” Over the past 6 years I've produced a series of videos on how to shave properly, especially using an “old school” shaving kit (lather shaving soaps and creams, shaving brush, single blade safety razors, etc). I also co-founded Sharpologist, a website devoted to shaving and grooming and generally “staying sharp” (get it?).
I couldn't stop touching my face (I later found out this is known as “faceturbating”).
HTGAM: You certainly are a fountain of shaving knowledge Mark, what is your background in male grooming? Where you possibly a barber in another life?
Mark: Ha, maybe I was a barber in another life, but they didn't show up for a long time. I used an electric razor for 30 years…buzz buzz zip zip done in two minutes without much thought. Then in the mid-1990's I met a special lady. They loved the feel of my freshly-shaven face. Unfortunately they would only caress it for a few hours before it got all “sandpapery” again. We were married in 2002 in Las Vegas. In 2004 we were watching a TV show about things to do in Las Vegas (“Hey, we did that on our honeymoon!”) and one thing they mentioned was getting a barber shave. My new wife turned to me and said “Ohhh, you should try that.” I just kind of shrugged and we continued watching the show.
A year later we decided to go back to Las Vegas for our wedding anniversary. One morning while we were there they said “don't shave today, I have a special anniversary present for you.” They took me over to the Art of Shaving store at Mandalay Bay and had them give me a barber shave. The results were nothing less than life-changing. My face was insanely soft and smooth. I couldn't stop touching my face (I later found out this is known as “faceturbating”). My wife was quite taken with it too: they said “ohhhhhhh, mama likes!”
After we returned from our trip I researched this kind of shaving on the internet…and discovered there was damned little about it out there. Luckily I found the Wetshavers forum on MSN Groups (long since defunct). They were enormously helpful with teaching me “proper” male grooming (without the marketing hype and spurious claims of the big conglomerates).
HTGAM: What got you started filming the “How To” tutorials?
In 2006 there was a casual comment on the MSN group to the effect that someone needed to make a video about old school shaving. The general consensus was that it was a good idea but probably not practical. The thinking was you had to see lather building in three dimensions to understand the consistency, and shaving probably needed to be taught in person too. Besides, the new-fangled “YouTube” thing didn't support video resolutions high enough to make it clear. But I have a background in broadcasting (the engineering part anyway) and I had won a camcorder from a business conference I recently attended so I took it as a challenge and made some test footage with the camcorder and Windows Movie Maker software. When I showed the footage to the forum guys it suddenly seemed possible. They gave me some good feedback and I shot the 3 part “Introduction to Traditional Wetshaving” you still see on my Youtube channel.
HTGAM: I really am a huge fan of the Sharpologist site, it's as clean as the shave it promotes. How did this come into being?
Kind of by accident actually. I had a blog over on Google's Blogspot for some time, using it as a place for “production notes” and follow-ups for the videos. One of my followers, Andy Tarnoff, happens to own a full-service professional digital media company and they suggested I should start a “real” website devoted to shaving and grooming. With their help we launched Sharpologist in 2011.
HTGAM: Might there be a book in the future? Have you been approached by any publishers?
No, I haven't thought of a book. Michael Ham has that covered with their excellent Leisureguy's Guide To Gourmet Shaving. I've toyed with the idea of a DVD though. But that's not a high priority either since my videos are freely available at places like YouTube and Blip.tv.
HTGAM: Your tag line is “what your father didn't teach you about shaving”, this is so true for a lot of us…except probably your son. Why is this? How was this information lost in such a short time?
Believe it or not I don't have any kids, though a lot of people have told me I'm like a second father to them because I taught them to shave! I think a lot of the information was lost when the world just got too damn busy for parents to pay as much attention to their children compared to previous generations. Plus, at least in the US, razors became over-hyped and “dumbed down” with things like extra blades (ridiculous, there has never been an independent, peer-reviewed study that says multiple blades work better), “lubrication strips” (notice they're on the side of the razor that goes over the skin *after* shaving? WTF?), pivots (OK, even I think this is a pretty good idea), and male models taking giant swipes at their face leaving perfectly smooth skin behind. By the way, the introduction of multi-blade, non-interchangeable, manufacturer-unique cartridge designs had nothing to do with very profitable patents that were expiring. Nope, just a coincidence I'm sure.
HTGAM: What are your current blades, razors and soaps of choice right now and why?
Admittedly I've accumulated a lot of stuff over the past few years. Some I've purchased for myself, others for videos, some have been gifts, and a few were given to me by vendors. But my favorite safety razors include a Merkur Progress adjustable, a vintage bakelite “Slant” razor, a Parker 92R, and a Merkur Heavy Duty. The Progress gets the lion's share of use though. I usually rotate among a few favorite brushes including an inexpensive brush from Shaveplace.com, a Simpsons “Rover” brush, and a brush made out of horse hair from Vie Long. I have dozens of soaps and creams but my personal favorites include Castle Forbes limes (obscenely expensive but its like getting hit in the face with a key lime pie!), Truefitt and Hill Trafalgar, DR Harris Arlington, and Speick (a surprisingly low-cost shaving cream from Germany).
HTGAM: A lot of guys reading this article will be inspired enough to hit up ebay immediately after where they will be bombarded by 3 piece, adjustable and comb guarded blades. Could you be so kind to explain the difference between them and what their benefits and weaknesses are?
OK, a safety razor's head engineering can be broken down into their constituent parts for the purpose of installing and removing a blade. A three piece razor has a top cap, a base plate, and a handle. A two piece razor's base plate is permanently attached to its handle. A one piece “twist to open” (TTO) razor doesn't come apart but has little doors that open to access the blade:
The distance between the base plate and the top cap is called the “gap” and an indicator of how “gentle” or “aggressive” the razor is. The larger the gap, the more blade edge is exposed, and the more “aggressive” the razor shaves. An adjustable razor can, well, adjust the blade gap. So like Goldilocks' older brother you can get a shave that's “juuuuuust right.” But it also adds a level of complexity to the razor which increases its price. And most people don't care about adjustability (though I love mine).
An “open comb” razor has little teeth in the top cap to help channel thick hair and shaving cream onto the blade edge. This was much more common in the early days of safety razors because most people didn't shave every day. Think of it more like a “grooming” tool than a “shaving” tool. You can still find new razors that have open combs but they're generally regarded as “aggressive” razors, exposing a lot of blade edges (though there are exceptions). Closed comb or “safety bar” razors have a solid (or sometimes scalloped) bar on the base plate, providing more protection from the blade's edge on the skin. This usually means fewer chances for nicks, cuts, or razor burn. But remember blade gap plays a big part of this too so you will find “mild” razors and “aggressive” razors. It's all about finding a balance between the characteristics of your stubble, skin, and the blade being used (safety razor blades may all look the same but they actually come in a wide variety of grinding tolerances, coatings, and thicknesses).
HTGAM: Have you, like us here at How to Grow a Moustache, noticed a revival in the old ways of shaving among the youth? Do you think it's just a passing fad?
I definitely noticed it and kind of fretted that it would be a passing fad. But it sure hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. I think there are different elements in play here, including the ridiculous cost of razor cartridges, a desire to “connect” with family history (a lot remember themselves as a child sitting at feet of their father or grandfather as they shaved), and as a way of reducing shaving problems like razor burn.
HTGAM: Have there been any funny, blooper moments for the “shaving tutor” caught on film and left on the cutting room floor that you would like to share with us?
Well there was this one time when our cat decided to jump onto my shoulders while I was shaving….
HTGAM: Might you have any speaking engagements coming up this Spring and Summer?
As a matter of fact I'm working with a couple barber spa's in the Houston area for possible speaking gigs. But nothing is firmed up yet.
HTGAM: Since we are a site dedicated to all things facial fur, particularly the moustache….might you have any shaving tips for us? The three pass proves difficult when sporting a handlebar tache or chinstrap beard.
As a matter of fact I have a video that might help with that. Even though it's about sideburns the concept is the same: make a single “rough” stroke close to the border or edge you want to make then “back off” a short distance and make short strokes crawling toward the desired edge.
HTGAM: Do you have any favorite blade brand and safety razor combos you would like to share with our readers?
As I said earlier it's no secret that I love my Merkur Progress adjustable safety razor. It will have to be pried out of my cold, dead hands. Or maybe I'll be buried with it in my cold, dead hands. I like to use Israeli-made Personna (AKA “Crystal” brand) or Derby blades with the Progress, but that's really a personal preference, “your mileage may vary” kind of thing. I've gotten great results with a Merkur Heavy Duty (34c) razor with Iridium blades, too. I also have a Parker 92R that seems to be happy with a wide variety of blades.
HTGAM: Bowl lather or face lather?
I bowl lather in the cooler months for a nice, warm lather and face lather in the warmer months.
HTGAM: Lastly, any advice for those extremely new and skeptical of the wet shave?
I can understand the skepticism so all I ask is to give it a try with inexpensive kit. You can find Van Der Hagen shave soap just about everywhere (~$2) and there's usually a Van Der Hagen shave brush nearby ($10). Admittedly the brush isn't very good so if you don't mind wandering down the women's cosmetics isle, try to find Ecotools “Kubuki” bamboo cosmetics brush–someone discovered it makes a decent shave brush and it's only about $7.50). Then make yourself some traditional shaving lather (here is a video that can help)–it may take a few attempts to get it right; that's OK, hang in there. Use your current Mach3, Fusion, Hydro, or whatever and see if you don't get a better shaving (don't forget to use proper technique). If it does, pick up a better brush and a few different lather soaps and creams if you want. Enjoy the process, the scents and the feeling of warm lather on your face, and the results. You may find that the multi-blade razor isn't really necessary anymore. Then tackle a double edge razor if you want. But just try it…
A very special thanks to Mark Herro our hero! We hope you found this interview as inspiring as all of us over here at How to Grow a Moustache. We will keep you posted on all Mark's upcoming speaking engagements hopefully at a barber shop near you! Thanks for reading and Happy Moustache May!

Good to see you again, readers!
I have started a feature on the Tumblr called House Words Wednesdays. Each week, I take a House without known canon or semi-canon words and present what I think could make sense as that House's motto. You're free to suggest more as well, if your favored House has not yet been suggested; take a look at this link to see what has already been suggested, and shoot me a tweet or ask through Tumblr if you have another House you'd like to see done.
Holy fuck. I try not to curse too much on here, but holy fuck. You have no goddamn idea how long the Locke words took me. As a little behind-the-scenes info: I have a master list of the schedule of House words and the mottos I've come up with, so when someone requests a new House I put it on the schedule and leave the spot next to it blank. Usually, I can come up with, at the very least, a placeholder motto pretty quickly and put that next to the House, while I think of something better (and sometimes, like House Whent's words, the placeholder just grows on me). House Locke? Nothing. I had fucking nothing to say about the Lockes. Every attempt at a placeholder just wound back up with a stupid key pun - “The Key to the North” bounced around my head a few times. I felt so embarrassed by the puns I wouldn't even put them down as placeholders. They were just dumb.
Well, I struggled, and I consulted, and I rejected a lot, and finally - finally - I came up with something. I looked at House Locke's seat: Oldcastle, on the northern shore of the Bite, just southeast of White Harbor and north of the Three Sisters. It's basically on the very edge of that water entrance into the North, and I imagine that in centuries past the Lockes were the primary guardians of this important gateway into the North (and, just as importantly, a potentially powerful tool to keep the North bottled up in this port, if the Locke kings had a powerful enough fleet). Indeed, the Lockes were granted temporary dominion over the Wolf's Den in the centuries after the Greystarks were exterminated, though they did not hold the castle as long as that Stark cousin branch did.
My words for the Lockes, then? Enter with Our Leave. It's sort of a key pun, but not a very obvious one (or, at least, less obvious). If you're given a key to a house, you're being granted leave to enter that place; if you're locked out without a key (presuming the people inside don't want you in), you lack the homeowner's leave to enter the home. The Lockes are, in their small way, the key to the North: they watch out for that important harbor, and if they find an entrant is friend, not foe, they allow them to enter the North via White Harbor. I like as well that it works in a sort of ironic way for Sybelle Glover, born a Locke, who surrendered Deepwood to Asha's ironborn, and allowed Asha to enter the castle as its conqueror (albeit a relatively gentle one). These words might fit future Locke action as well: Manderly claims (perhaps swaggeringly, though I'm inclined to believe them in part) that old Lord Locke will follow where they lead, and together Locke and Manderly (and perhaps Hother Umber, if he's still inside) may throw open the gates of Winterfell from the inside to victorious Stannis. Of course, boy Rickon will probably come through White Harbor to return to Winterfell (a Manderly-backed rescue mission? Where else would Eddard's youngest land?), passing by Oldcastle saluting their return.
Let me know what you think, because you know I want to hear other Locke words if you got em. Another kind-of-random request next week.
The Queen Regent (NFriel)
OAKLAND, Calif. -- In the aftermath of Chicago's 34-26 win Friday over the Oakland Raiders, surely some players long for one last shot to prove their worth, while others may have earned starting jobs that will likely keep them on the sideline for the preseason finale Aug. 29 against the Cleveland Browns.
“That's a tough question to answer right now,” Bears coach Marc Trestman said. “We've got some young players playing very well. We know we've got roster issues on all three sides of the ball. We'll go to work on that as we get back to Chicago when we spend time tomorrow night in our personnel meetings.”
Here's a look at three players who likely earned starting jobs by virtue of their performance against the Raiders, and three more whose jobs or roster spots may now be on the line:
The Bears' first-round draft pick, Kyle Long has impressed during the preseason and is poised to earn a starting job. AP Photo/Scott Boehm
JOBS EARNED
RG Kyle Long. The club's first-round pick, Long put together another quality start against the Raiders and, along with fellow rookie Jordan Mills, played a few more repetitions than the rest of the first-team offensive line. As expected of a rookie, Long appeared to miss a couple of assignments on plays where they were supposed to block second-level defenders. But their explosiveness, athleticism and tenacity at the point of attack are undeniable, as is the fact they continue to improve the more they play.
Because the team made Long the No. 20 overall pick in the draft, their ascension to a starter's role was inevitable. It's always that way when first-round money is thrown into the equation. It was also aided by a regressing James Brown, who instead of rising to the challenge posed by Long, seemed to fall behind even more in the competition. Perhaps Brown felt the battle had already been virtually decided after their start on Aug. 9 in the preseason opener at Carolina. After that game, the coaching staff said it wanted to take a look at Long, who has started the past two contests.
RT Jordan Mills. Clearly quarterback Jay Cutler feels comfortable with Mills and Long as their protection on the right side of the line. Like Long, Mills made a couple of minor mistakes over their past two starts, including a false start Friday night in the second quarter. But Mills has kept Cutler clean in pass protection, while proving to be a dominating factor in the running game, which has been encouraging. After all, the Bears selected Mills with a fifth-round pick and it was expected he'd face a steep learning curve because of the differences in the pro game from the pass-happy attack they blocked for in college.
“They played well tonight,” Cutler said of the rookies on the right side of the line. “They get better and better each week. The thing about them is they want to do it. They're excited about it. It matters to them, and they're getting better. So I don't see why [Mills and Long wouldn't be ready to start in Week 1]."
CB Isaiah Frey. Kelvin Hayden's season-ending hamstring injury gave Frey a chance to become the starting nickel corner. Still, the second-year veteran needed to earn the spot, which he's done with consistent performances in practices that have transferred over to games. This may sound like an exaggeration, but really it isn't. During training camp workouts at Olivet Nazarene University, you'd be hard pressed to find one day in which Frey didn't make a play -- whether it was an interception or a pass breakup -- that drew attention to him. They played that well. Then, once it was time to play in the preseason, Frey simply duplicated what he'd been doing all along on the practice field.
Against the Raiders, Frey picked off a Matt Flynn pass intended for Jacoby Ford in the second quarter, in addition to contributing a tackle on special teams and one on defense. During the offseason, there was definitely a buzz within the organization about Frey. Now we know why.
JOBS ON THE LINE
TE Fendi Onobun. What's transpired in games for Onobun really isn't any different from what's taken place at practices. While Onobun appears to be an adequate blocker, their inconsistency as a receiver could lead to their departure. Make no mistake about it: The organization wants Onobun to win a job. The team has done everything short of actually giving it to him. There have been a couple of instances on the field after practices where members of the coaching staff have had to stay after with Onobun to give them a motivational talk, stressing the coaches still believe in him.
But for whatever reason, things haven't worked out for Onobun, who dropped two passes Friday night, including one from Cutler that should have gone for a touchdown.
Because of their athleticism and background as a college basketball player, Onobun provides an intriguing option the Bears don't appear to be willing to give up on just yet. When Chicago opened Friday night's game with a three-tight end set, the personnel grouping featured Martellus Bennett, Steve Maneri and Onobun.
“I think what happens when you're young and you want to do so well, sometimes you psych yourself out,” Bennett said of Onobun. “It's a psychological thing. He's very, very talented. Everyone wants them to do well. They want to do well. I think they want it so bad that sometimes he's just rushing instead of taking their time. I just tell them to catch your breath, calm down, first things first. He's gonna make those plays when their time comes.”
OT J'Marcus Webb. Webb has started every game the past two seasons, and came into the offseason as the No. 1 right tackle on the roster. Then, two weeks ago, after an uneven performance in the preseason opener at Carolina (a game in which they allowed a sack of Cutler), the Bears opted to go with the rookies at right guard and right tackle.
Webb seemed to regress from there. Playing with the backups against the Raiders, inconsistency reared its head again for Webb, with the veteran being flagged for holding on the team's third offensive play of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, officials flagged Webb (remember, they have been one of the most penalized linemen in the league over their tenure) for a false start.
With veteran Jonathan Scott expected to return in the next week from a knee procedure, and another veteran in Eben Britton, Webb not only lost their starting job, but could be on shaky ground in a bid to win a job as the swing tackle. It's not that Webb lacks the talent to play for the Bears. They possess plenty. The staff and their teammates just haven't found a way to coax from Webb the mental sharpness, consistency and attitude needed to excel as a starter in the NFL.
RB Armando Allen. Allen never set foot on the field for Friday's game, but their inactivity has allowed undrafted rookie Michael Ford to showcase their talents for a legit shot at Allen's spot. Allen suffered a hamstring injury in early August that has forced them out of the club's past two preseason games. Viewed at one time as a near lock to make the roster, Allen falls right in line with the old coach's adage that “you can't make the club in the tub.”
Ford averaged just 1.9 yards per attempt filling in for Allen against the Chargers, but busted a kickoff return 100 yards in the third quarter of that game to generate some excitement among the coaching staff. Against the Raiders on Friday, Ford rushed for 58 yards on nine attempts, and scored on a spinning 15-yard run in the fourth quarter. When the team originally announced Allen's injury, it mentioned a week-to-week recovery time frame, an indication that their status for the regular-season opener could be in jeopardy.
The Bears like the fact Allen is a contributor on special teams and they provide a different element in the backfield than Matt Forte and Michael Bush. But Ford appears to be a very similar player to Allen. He's cheaper, too.
Spanish historians say they have discovered what Monty Python could not — the Holy Grail, the legendary cup Jesus supposedly drank from at the Last Supper.
The Spaniards — Margarita Torres and José Ortega del Río — believe the 2,000-year-old vessel is in a church in León in northern Spain.
The pair spent three years studying the history of the chalice and last week published a book, “The Kings of the Grail,” making their case.
The onyx chalice, they explained, was concealed within another antique vessel known as the Chalice of Doña Urruca, which is located in León's basilica of Saint Isidore.
The historians said it has been there since the 11th century.
“This is a very important discovery because it helps solve a big puzzle,” Torres told The Irish Times. “We believe this could be the start of a wonderful stage of research.”
They said the duo had been researching the history of some Islamic remains in the Saint Isidore basilica. But their discovery of two medieval Egyptian documents that mentioned the chalice of Christ caused them to change direction, the paper reported.
Those parchments told a tale of how Muslims took the sacred cup from the Christian community in Jerusalem to Cairo.
It was then given to an emir on Spain's Mediterranean coast in return for help they gave to Egyptians who were suffering a famine.
The historians' research has been backed up by scientific dating, which estimates that the cup in question was made between 200 BC and 100 AD.
The scientists admit the first 400 years of the cup's history remain a mystery, and they can't prove the chalice ever actually touched Christ's lips.
But they insist there is no doubt that this is the cup that early Christians revered as the chalice used at the Last Supper.
“The only chalice that could be considered the chalice of Christ is that which made the journey to Cairo and then from Cairo to León — and that is this chalice,” said Torres, who teaches medieval history at the University of León.
Countless scientists and historians have pursued the Holy Grail, an effort chronicled in Arthurian legend, made into pulp adventure with “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” and satirized by the British comedy troupe Monty Python in 1975's “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”
MERCEDES may have cracked a unique way of maintaining its advantage over its Formula 1 rivals into the 2016 season.
The secret? Wi-Fi!
Welcome to Pit Talk!
MERCEDES WIELDS WI-FI IN F1'S TYRE WAR
You may have noticed two big black handlebar-like cylinders up near the Mercedes W07's airbox during testing in Barcelona last week.
Those two devices are thermal cameras, recording temperatures across the tread of the tyre in real time. In this era of rapidly-degrading rubber, knowing how its car is using its tyres will be one of the keys to Mercedes maintaining its remarkable run of success.
It could also be responsible for improving Wi-Fi technology.
The cameras generate gigabytes of information for the team's engineers to analyse at the end of a run, but getting it out of the car proved to be a major bottleneck.
Downloading the data would take the best part of half an hour, hampering the team's ability to make quick decisions on setup changes and reducing the amount of runs they could do in a practice session.
The team asked Qualcomm Technologies to see if they could develop a faster way of downloading the information.
“We came up with a way of downloading that data using a highly modified 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi system, such as that when the car approaches the garage the data download starts occurring,” Qualcomm's Graeme Davison told motorsport.com.
The system first saw action in late 2015.
The system was first used at Austin last year, allowing the thermal data to be downloaded at rates of 200 to 600 megabytes per second, improving to the point that downloading the tyre data causes no delay at all. In fact, Lewis Hamilton attributes the incredible number of laps Mercedes clocked in Barcelona to how little time they wasted downloading data.
But Qualcomm's work isn't finished there. They are already looking towards the next evolution of the system, capable of downloading at a rate of four gigabytes per second — and the lessons learnt could be responsible for boosting your Wi-Fi signal in the future.
“We are already looking at ... moving from the 5 gigahertz 802.11ac system to the 60 gig 802.11ad system,” Davison explained.
“This system was designed for use in buildings. It's short ranged but it has a very, very wide bandwidth.
“So we are now looking if we can put this system in an environment it wasn't designed for, which allows us to rapidly understand how we can improve that technology so it can be used in an environment where there is the possibility of smog, moisture and rain, things that affect a 802.11ad because of its very high frequency.
“But that's what motorsport gives us: an environment where we can do very rapid developments.”
FERRARI LOOKING TO GET OUT OF ‘DETENTION'
Ferrari may have topped the timesheets for much of the opening Barcelona test, but there are no delusions of grandeur at Maranello.
Team principal Maurizio Arrivabene made it clear that the team is acutely aware of where they are in F1's pecking order.
“The question is not ‘how good are we',” they told La Stampa. “Rather how strong are Mercedes-Benz, for they are still first in class.”
Their schooling analogy didn't end there.
“We need to ensure at this stage that we will thoroughly solve our homework before the season starts. Two years ago, we failed. A year ago we had detention. Now we want to move a notch higher.”
It had been hoped Ferrari would be a regular challenger, but analysis of the Barcelona test times suggest Mercedes will again be the strongest car on the grid as the year gets underway.
But, as Ferrari proved on three occasions, even the best have their bad days.
Or as Arrivabene, entering football analogy mode, put it: “They have the ball, we have to catch them on the wrong foot.”

NEW PAINT, NEW CARBON, NEW BITS
Most of the teams had muted launches of their new cars ahead of the last Barcelona launch, but that doesn't mean there won't be anything new to see when testing resumes this week.
Sauber have unveiled their 2016 machine ahead of the test, the new C35 set to make its track debut after the team used their 2015 car at the opening test.

Down at Toro Rosso, Red Bull's junior team will unveil their livery for the 2016 season after running in an elegantly simple plain blue livery at Barcelona 1.
A shame, really. Whatever they've come up with will be hard to improve on the natural lines of the STR11.

Meanwhile, most teams will bring the first round of evolutionary components to test and trial on their cars now they have data from the opening test to offer a comparison.
Both Renault and Honda are expected to run upgraded components in their power units, with both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button commenting last week that their respective engine manufacturers would have new bits for the second test.

McLaren will rebound, says former long-time staffer. Source: AFP
MCLAREN IS ‘A SLEEPING GIANT'
That's the assessment of a man who should know. After all, Dave Ryan was part of the fabric at McLaren for 34 years.
Ryan exited the team in ignominious circumstances after they and Lewis Hamilton were found to have lied to the flight attendants in the wake of the 2009 Australian Grand Prix.
After several years out of the sport Ryan joined the reborn Manor team as its racing director late last year.
While they were away, McLaren slipped from its perch as one of the sport's dominant teams to one of its tail-end Charlies, a slide exacerbated by Honda's struggles in the hybrid era.
But Ryan knows that staying down is not part of McLaren's DNA, and they fully expect the team to bounce back.
Let's be honest, McLaren is a bit of a sleeping giant at the moment,” Ryan told Autosport.
“They haven't had a good few years, and last year was particularly difficult I would say, but they've the potential to get it right.
“They're hurting, but if they get it right they will be right back up at the sharp end. They've a huge number of very clever people.
“It's a question of when, not if.”
RALLIES HAVE A DIFFERENT MEANING IN AUSTIN
While the 2016 edition of the United States Grand Prix is still up in the air, the Circuit of the Americas is continuing to hold events over the American winter.
Just a few days ago they held a rally. No, not that kind of rally, sadly. A US Presidential campaign rally.
Democrat hopeful Bernie Sanders spoke in front of a crowd of thousands, trying to swing the hearts of Texans ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday vote.
Official crowd count for @BernieSanders Austin Tx rally just over 10,000 people #BernieinAustin pic.twitter.com/brpEd23WfI — MaryAlice Parks (@maryaliceparks) February 27, 2016
The massive venue is regularly used for events requiring large gatherings of people, with several concerts set to be held at the track as the US summer approaches.
However, as at March 1, the Circuit of the Americas website still makes no mention of a Grand Prix being held at the venue this year, although their social media channels still comment on F1 regularly.
Government report fuels another round of Islamophobia
Government must engage in dialogue with organisations it unjustly threatens in report, rather than creating new route for intimidating the Muslim community.
On January 12th a press conference was called by the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), The Cordoba Foundation and the Finsbury Park Mosque. This was in response to the Government's publication of a summary of the Review of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB).
The Review was carried out by Sir John Jenkins, the former UK Ambassador to Riyadh, and Charles Farr, Director General of the Office for Security and Counterterrorism in the Home Office. With such authors it was inevitable that the report would become another route for intimidating the Muslim community.
Victoria Brittain, the campaigning journalist, chaired the press conference. They welcomed people to the Finsbury Park Mosque. “It is a pillar of the community. It is looking after the homeless and feeding hungry people. It has an outreach programme to other religions, and is engaging with young people. It is utterly false to attempt to link it to extremism”.
Mohamed Kozbar, Chairman of the Finsbury Park Mosque, pointed out that 10 years ago the Government had asked for an intervention in the Mosque. They said that “MAB intervened, and within one day the Mosque was brought back into the community.
Abu Hamza and followers were ousted, as were the far-right extremists who used their presence to promote hatred. The Mosque is now a community centre as well as a mosque. It has won awards for its community engagement, both from Islington Council and from “Community Matters”. Yet in the report the Government tries to isolate the Mosque. The Government is showing the community its back”.
Only a summary of the report has been published. The three Muslim organisations called for the “full and transparent publication”. It was published 18 months late from the date given previously by David Cameron. There is evidence from the Mail and the Guardian that the Government was lobbied by Gulf states, notably the United Arab Emirates. Everything indicates a lack of clarity and a bias in the Review.
Certainly the report's published summary is misleading enough. We are told that “MAB (like the MCB) have consistently opposed programmes by successive Governments to prevent terrorism”. Both MAB and the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) have refuted this by simple reference to the record of their work against terrorism.
But the report implies that opposition to Government policy on Prevent, Palestine and Egypt implies an ambiguous attitude towards terrorism. Omar el-Hamdoon, Chair of MAB, told the press conference “Opposing government policy, and speaking out when they are wrong, is part of active citizenship. We encourage Muslims to register for voting, as we are promoting integration into British society”.
The report names a number of British organisations as having links with the MB. The report has a negative and biased view of the MB, suggesting it has not abandoned terrorism.
This is significant, as the MB is the most popular party in the Arab world. In Egypt its entire leadership has been arrested, and is facing death sentences and life imprisonment, after winning Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The report is silent on this terrible repression.
Yet the repression of the legal and democratic record of the MB has been demagogically used by takfiri groups as an argument in favour of the path of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Nusrah, etc. There is no acknowledgement of this danger in the report.
Anas Al-Tikriti, from the Cordoba Foundation explained to the press conference that the MB has no structure in the UK. MB members in exile from Egypt and elsewhere first arrived in the UK around 50 years ago. They said “In that time there has been no record of these people breaking the law or committing a crime. There are no links between the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorism. 18 months silence is a clear indication that no evidence has been found.”
The report, however, clearly characterises supporters of the MB as alien to British society. Thus we read “… aspects of Muslim Brotherhood ideology and tactics, in this country and overseas, are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security”. This raises a threat over the legitimate, and peaceful, activity of all the Muslim organisations referred to in the report. The whole progressive movement must insist that the Government engages in a dialogue with the organisations it is unjustly threatening in the report.

(CNN) -- Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, has claimed the 10th victim in California, in what health officials are calling the worst outbreak in 60 years.
Since the beginning of the year, 5,978 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease have been reported in California.
All of the deaths occurred in infants under the age of 3 months, says Michael Sicilia, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health. Nine were younger than 8 weeks old, which means they were too young to have been vaccinated against this highly contagious bacterial disease.
"This is a preventable disease," says Sicilia, because there is a vaccine for whooping cough to protect those coming in contact with infants, and thereby protect the infants.
However, some parents are choosing to not vaccinate their children. In other cases, previously vaccinated children and adults may have lost their immunity because the vaccine has worn off.
Why are parents skipping vaccines?
The vaccine "does not protect you for life," explains Alison Patti, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Sicilia says California Health Department epidemiologists estimate 50 percent of the children who have gotten sick were infected by their parents or caregivers.
According to the recommended vaccine schedule for infants, newborns don't get their first pertussis vaccine until they are 2 months old, leaving them vulnerable to infection until then if the people surrounding them are infected.
Breaking down whooping cough
"That's why the real important message is -- whether it's a mom, dad, sibling, grandfather or grandmother that comes in contact with these really young babies -- all the close contacts, including the health care professionals, need to vaccinated," says Patti. It's called the "cocooning strategy," where the newborns are protected because the older people around them have been vaccinated and protected from pertussis, and therefore won't pass it on to little babies.
Do children in the U.S. have to get more shots?
Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria that can lead to severe upper respiratory infections. The bacteria are spread in tiny droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
Initial symptoms are very similar to a cold, but a week or two later, a violent cough develops.
"If you've ever seen a child with pertussis, you won't forget it" -- that's how the American Academy of Pediatrics explains what whooping cough is on its website. The academy says a child with the disease coughs so hard and so often "until the air is gone from his/her lungs and he/she is forced to inhale with the loud 'whooping' sound that gives the disease its nickname."
The cough can last for weeks and children can cough so hard and rapidly,that blood vessels can burst and they have difficulty eating, drinking and breathing. According to the CDC, "about 1 in 5 infants with pertussis get pneumonia, and about 1 in 100 will have convulsions. In rare cases (1 in 100), pertussis can be deadly, especially in infants."
Listen to what whooping cough sounds like
Parents and doctors can often miss the initial symptoms of pertussis in the youngest patients because they often do not have the characteristic cough with a "whoop" says Patti.
According to the National Institutes of Health, "the whoop noise is rare in patients under 6 months and in adults."
That's why parents need to be alert to symptoms in themselves as well as their children, says Patti. If there's a prolonged pause in breathing or they have trouble breathing, that's an important sign and parents should seek medical attention immediately, they explain.
"It's important to go to the doctor early on," says Patti because, "antibiotics don't help you later."
Adults usually don't have the "whoop" cough, so they may not think they have pertussis. Patti recommends if someone has a cough that doesn't go away, they should get tested for pertussis.
Sicilia points out that the pertussis vaccine isn't perfect and its protection wanes after about five years.
Health officials are urging everyone who hasn't had a pertussis vaccine in the past five years or -- doesn't remember if they had one -- to get the shot.
7.5 The Angels Take Manhattan
Appreciating that most of you know what's going to happen in this episode, given that it's a little secret Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill are leaving Doctor Who, we're still going to be extra-cautious not to give anything away in this review. As such, plot discussion will be minimal.
What we can say is what's given away in the title. The Angels Take Manhattan sees the return of the Weeping Angels. It also sees the asupervisorstioned departure of Amy and Rory. And while it's not a perfect episode, it does have a real emotional wallop to it. Steven Moffat, who is on writing duties here, takes real time to give two of their characters a good send-off, and there will be little doubt come the end credits that he's managed to do just that.
Furthermore, the style, look and feel of the episode is exquisite. This week's blockbuster theme is a good, detective film noir, and director Nick Hurran - along with the production designers - are clearly having a ball with it (as is Moffat with the script). The episode at its best looks amazing, and the New York location shoot is well used as well. Credit where credit's due: each week, Doctor Who has really tried to give us a distinctive looking standalone blockbuster, and The Angels Take Manhattan - whilst not quite as noisy as some of the others - looks glorious.
Let's get the grumbles out of the way. The Angels themselves, if anything, are the weak bit here. Inevitably, given that this is their third full story in Doctor Who, their scare factor has diluted the more they're exposed. Steven Moffat once again finds ways to evolve them and deepen them, but The Angels Take Manhattan does lack the sinister edge and the get-under-your-skin fright of the Angels of past. That's a by-product of us getting more familiar with them, but also there's something to do with the Angels near the start of the episode that doesn't quite work.
Also, the episode zips around an awful lot, and it requires some attention to follow the assorted threads. We've no problem with that - television that demands something of its audience is no bad thing - yet it's the stiller moments that are the most effective here. As much fun as Steven Moffat tries to pack into the episode, it's in the final third where it's very much at its strongest.
We're not going to say much more, because you really don't want this episode spoiled. So we'll come to the crux of it: did we love The Angels Take Manhattan? No, although we'd bet that many of you will. But it's nonetheless a good episode, that's excellent when its focus more overtly shifts to what we know is coming.
The ending in particular is strong, as much for the Doctor as for anything else. And Matt Smith is brilliant once more. It'd be remiss to say they give one of their best performances in the role, because their central work in the show, particularly over what's been a bumpy-ish five episodes, has been uniformly tremendous. Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill are no slouches either, and The Angels Take Manhattan is a real reminder of the strength they've brought to Doctor Who over the best few years.
Our advice for Saturday night? Lower your expectations just a little, get some tissues ready, and prepare for a good, moving episode of Doctor Who. It's just a shame we won't get any more until Christmas...

Image copyright Ian Britton Image caption NWAS will provide non-emergency transport in Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and Cumbria
The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) has been restored as the provider for non-emergency patient transport services across Greater Manchester.
NWAS lost the contract, now worth £66.8m, to bus operator Arriva in 2013.
Arriva withdrew from the new tendering process after admitting providing false data about its current performance.
NWAS was also awarded similar five-year deals for Lancashire, Merseyside and Cumbria, but lost the Cheshire tender to West Midlands Ambulance Service.
A spokesperson for NHS Blackpool Clinical Commissioning Group (BCCG), the lead ambulance commissioners for the North West, said Arriva had "identified a level of management failure with the reporting of performance in Greater Manchester" in October.
"This means that they had previously provided incorrect information, which shows a higher level of performance than is the case," they said.
They added that following Arriva's admission, the company "withdrew from the procurement process immediately" and has "since developed a performance improvement plan to help rectify their performance".
'Quality improvements'
NWAS chief executive Bob Williams said that while they were pleased to regain the Greater Manchester contract, it was "tinged with disappointment" because of the loss of the Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral service.
"Whilst we were successful in four of the North West's counties, our immediate focus now is on our staff in Cheshire and the impact on them," they said.
"We will work closely with our trade unions, staff and the new provider to support them through this period and deliver a safe and smooth transition."
The BCCG spokesperson said the contracts had been awarded as "the result of a rigorous competitive tendering process and evaluation of potential providers".
They said the new NWAS contracts would see "a number of quality improvements", including a "text-ahead service" to inform patients when their transport will arrive and a "revised process" to ensure fair use of the service.
The new five-year contracts - worth £59.9m in Lancashire, £39m in Merseyside, £31.5m in Cumbria and £24.6m in Cheshire - will begin in July 2016.
Strategic Command WW2: War in Europe – Two Weeks to Warsaw (Part Two) By Jeff Renaud
This is the second part of my series of articles looking at early turns in Matrix Games' Strategic Command WW2: War in Europe wargame. This part finishes off my “Two Weeks to Warsaw” look at taking Poland's capital by the end of turn 2 as the Axis.
Just to reiterate the abbreviations key I have been using so far:
Ar = Armee (or Army)
Ak (or Co) = Armeekorps (or Corps)
Pz (or ACo) = Panzerkorps (or Armoured Corps)
Br = Brigade
Cav = Cavalry
Gar = Garrison
Mech = Mechanised
R. = River
N = North
S = South
E = East
W = West
Thus, 4. Ar is 4. Armee (or 4th Army); if 4. Ar moves to 187,69 S Königsberg, then 4. Armee redeploys to hex 187,69, South of Königsberg. I trust that's simple enough, and that others will be self-explanatory. I have to additionally assume that readers are familiar with SC:WiE concepts such as Blitz Attack, Sleep, Cruise, Set Mode, and so on. Finally, note that battle outcomes can vary significantly, depending on the Difficulty setting as well, so don't take the following as ‘gospel' in any way.
TURN 2
I choose “No” re: the 7th Fliegerkorps, as it's not useful yet, and will be later. Note that the UK and France, and maybe Canada, will declare war on you – don't be too shocked! You'll also see that the Poles scramble units to surround Warsaw, but it will serve them naught! Moreover, stray cavalry might threaten your rear, and the enemy might even try a probe attack here and there, but you'll take Warsaw before they can do any real damage, even if it takes three turns.
First, I move my subs and take care of other naval deployment; you may want to move Deutschland and/or U-30 if Canada did not DoW; the South American/Caribbean route is within range (use War Maps tab>Convoy Map>click on UK flag top-left). It's also good tactics to move your subs every turn they raid, otherwise they'll soon be hunted down (again, see my Wargamer article on naval strategy for tips). Then check HQ attachments and make any necessary adjustments; give preference to air units and forces closest to Warsaw, although you probably won't have to change anything. Then, starting in the north again, my exact sequence of moves depends on what has happened. Remember that your focus is Warsaw; enemy units with a ZoC surrounding the capital need to be destroyed, then the garrison itself. You should be able to avoid taking on the Modlin Fortress at all.
In any event, you should see a situation quite similar to the above screenshot. To start, bomb the #?*!& out of Warsaw, using all your bombers; it's unlikely you'll be intercepted, as the enemy's Strength is probably too low. Use one or both of your fighters to soften up Warsaw as well, or you can use one to strafe Siedlce airfield to further reduce the enemy aircraft that may be still there. Don't be concerned if you take some damage. If 3 Ar can reach 189,75, attack Warsaw from there (if bombing managed to reduce the Warsaw Garrison). Otherwise, Wodrig Corps should be able to get there; attack the garrison. With a modicum of luck, Warsaw Gar is gone, or at least should be around 30-40% Morale and Readiness, and 2-3 Strength, though likely still deeply entrenched. If 3 Ar still has AP, move it away (doesn't really matter where, but you probably only have a couple of choices – just don't block the road to Warsaw!). Twenty-One Armeekorps should be able to either occupy Warsaw or attack the garrison if it still exists.
Now you need to plan carefully in order to remove all remaining ‘roadblocks' if Warsaw still hasn't been captured. Using your western forces – I call it Armeegruppe Zentrum, under Gerd von Rundstedt – start with those farthest away that can still strike at the enemy south of Warsaw; it should be IV and X Ak, plus possibly 8 Ar. The latter would be preferable, but it may not be able to reach the front yet. If not, it may be advisable to detach it in favour of IV Ak. Move IV Pz to 187,77; attack the strongest unit in range, probably Prusy Army. If your first Strike reduces its ZoC or forces a retreat, bonus (unless it runs to Warsaw, which I've had happened)! Attack the other unit (Wyskow Corps) with your remaining Strike. Move up IV or X Ak, 8 Ar; attack! The way should be clear for one nearby force to occupy the capital – Warsaw falls!
CONCLUSION
Keep in mind that there is no ‘perfect' solution that works 100% of the time; it would be a poor AI if players could find such an exploit, and SC:WiE's AI is far above the average I've encountered in similar games. Indeed, at Expert Difficulty, I only take Warsaw in two turns about half the time. For example, out of eight attempts to demonstrate tactics for this article, I was successful in only four.
Now that you've taken the capital, Poland will fall immediately; the AI will not even attempt to retake Warsaw. Mop up if you like, but remember it's a trade-off: a little experience will cost MPPs to reinforce those few extra casualties. Even so, I like to, especially for National Morale bonuses and perhaps to acquire a couple more resources or towns an extra turn early; recall they slowly come back to less-than-full capacity, and every little bit helps later on. Otherwise, begin to reinforce and upgrade; start to Operate HQs to 160,74 S Wilhelmshaven; Dusseldorf (160,78); 161,81 S Koblenz (von Kuchler may have no path from Ostpreussen yet; wait till next turn). At least until your MPP are gone, of course! I move air units normally, but Operate most others; keep in mind as well that forced marches lower Morale and Readiness quite substantially; units might have little ‘fight' remaining in them once they arrive, although they will have a few turns to recover during winter before your big spring offensive against the Low Countries – oops! That was supposed to be a surprise! :x
Once more, I stress that there are many ways for the first two turns to play out, but in general, seek to reduce ZoC, Morale, Readiness, Entrenchment of units in key locations; follow-up breaches (ZoC loss); don't get ambushed (scout ahead).
That's it! I hope this article was helpful. The next part (which will again be split into two) will look at early moves on the western front, and seeing how best to take Paris in Five turns as the Axis. Feel free to leave questions or comments below!

Beneath the Surface If we want a successful manned mission to Mars, and an eventual human colony, we have to start looking for all the possible resources on the Red Planet – especially a water source. Researchers have found a large amount of frozen ice beneath a cracked and pitted plain in the Martian surface. The frozen mass is likely carrying as much water as Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes in the US. The ice was found on Mars' Utopia Planitia region by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Shallow Radar (SHARAD). Analyzing data from more than 600 overhead passes, the research team estimates a thickness from about 79-171 meters (260-560 ft). The ice is made up of about 50 to 85 percent water, mixed with dust and other solids. It is buried underneath 1-10 meters (3-33 ft) of Martian soil.
“This deposit probably formed as snowfall accumulating into an ice sheet mixed with dust during a period in Mars history when the planet's axis was more tilted than it is today,” said lead author Cassie Stuurman in a statement. Climate record The deposit accounts for around one percent of all water found on the planet. This might not sound like much, but it does double the frozen ice beneath Mars' northern plains. And, the ice can easily be tapped by astronauts or any mission that wants to do so. “This deposit is probably more accessible than most water ice on Mars, because it is at a relatively low latitude and it lies in a flat, smooth area where landing a spacecraft would be easier than at some of the other areas with buried ice,” said Jack Holt, co-author of the paper. Any Martian water found, even in ice form, can be a candidate for searching for signs of life on the Red Planet. Ice can contain evidence of any life form that may have resided there. Also, like what we do with Earth's own polar ice, scientists can use the deposit to learn more about the climate of Mars thousands of years ago.
“Sampling and using this ice with a future mission could help keep astronauts alive, while also helping them unlock the secrets of Martian ice ages,” says co-author Joe Levy.
Reports of stickers around campus representing the alt-right organization Identity Evropa have surfaced in the past few weeks.
The stickers have reportedly been spotted inside Dwinelle Hall, in the parking lot behind Dwinelle and near Zellerbach Hall. Most recently, photos of a campus vehicle with the sticker on its bumper garnered attention on the internet Saturday, but the sticker has since been removed.
“Facilities services is looking into the matter,” said campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore in an email. “At this point, however, we have no information that indicates a staff member placed the sticker on the vehicle. The sticker has been removed.”
Identity Evropa is a rising alt-right group that identifies as “a generation of awakened Europeans who have discovered that (they) are part of the great peoples,” according to the organization's website. In May 2016, Identity Evropa founder Nathan Damigo visited UC Berkeley to interview students about race for the YouTube channel Red Ice.
Since appearing on campus last year, Damigo was on campus again during President Donald Trump's inauguration to interview members of the Berkeley College Republicans for the Red Ice channel. Damigo is a Bay Area local who attends California State University Stanislaus.
Campus junior Neil Lawrence, a former Daily Californian columnist and an activist who participated in the Milo Yiannopoulos demonstrations in February, said they have seen the stickers around campus. According to Lawrence, when they see a sticker, they document its location and then removes it. Lawrence said neo-Nazi organizations sometimes put razors behind their posters to avoid removal, but confirmed that the Identity Evropa stickers are safely removable.
According to the Identity Evropa website, stickers are given to those who donate to the organization.
BCR treasurer David Craig emphasized in an email that BCR condemns racism and fascism in all forms, stating that both belong “on the ash heap of history.” Additionally, Craig addressed the campus's responsibility in keeping racism off campus.
“If work vehicles are not allowed to have non-sanctioned bumper stickers, this is a case of either neglected enforcement or vandalism,” Craig said in an email. “If work vehicles are allowed bumper stickers, the university should contemplate a rules change.”

The Best Episodes of Sealab 2021
Last Updated: Feb 1, 2019
The year is 2021. Deep below the ocean's surface, looms a vast, magnificently high-tech compound: Sealab. A multi-national scientific station with an annual budget in the trillions, dedicated to the research and exploration of man's final frontier... Sealab's crew is charged with exploring the possibility of underwater colonization. As the Earth's surface, by this time, has gotten just generally crowded, hot, and icky. However, as most government-funded agencies usually are, Sealab is manned by a motley collection of malcontents and screw-ups who were unfit for work in the private sector. They really don't get any research done, but instead spend their time bickering among themselves or just plain goofing off. The crew have manipulated their luckless leader, Captain Murphy, into submission, and are content to ride the government clock, raking in fat, hazardous-duty paychecks.
Top 20 most beautiful castles in the United Kingdom
The video shows the rankings on the 1st of June 2017
England, Scotland, and Wales have a great history. That is why the first thing a lot of people think about Great Britain is castles and medieval fortresses. Explore the mysteries and secrets of Britain's most famous castles.
20. Stirling Castle is one of the largest and most important castles, both historically and architecturally, in Scotland.
The castle sits atop Castle Hill, an intrusive crag, which forms part of the Stirling Sill geological formation. It is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs, giving it a strong defensive position.
Its strategic location, guarding what was, until the 1890s, the farthest downstream crossing of the River Forth, has made it an important fortification from the earliest times. Most of the principal buildings of the castle date from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A few structures of the fourteenth century remain, while the outer defences fronting the town date from the early eighteenth century.
Several Scottish Kings and Queens have been crowned at Stirling, including Mary, Queen of ...... view details
19. Dunnottar Castle is a ruined medieval fortress located upon a rocky headland on the north-east coast of Scotland, about 3 kilometres south of Stonehaven.
The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century, because of its strategic location and defensive strength. Dunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century.
The ruins of the castle are spread over 1.4 hectares, surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, 50 metres below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to ...... view details
18. Arundel Castle is a restored and remodeled medieval castle, established by Roger de Montgomery on Christmas Day 1067. Roger became the first to hold the earldom of Arundel by the graces of William the Conqueror.
The castle was damaged in the English Civil War and then restored in the 18th and 19th centuries. From the 11th century, the castle has served as a home and has been in the ownership of the family of the Duke of Norfolk for over 400 years. It is the principal seat of the Norfolk family. It is a Grade I listed building.... view details
17. Herstmonceux Castle is one of the oldest significant brick buildings still standing in England; brick was an unusual material for the time in Britain. The builders of Herstmonceux Castle concentrated more on grandeur and comfort than on defence.
Herstmonceux Castle is home to events throughout the year, including the annual England's Medieval Festival on August Bank Holiday weekend.... view details
16. Dover Castle is a medieval castle founded in the 11th century and described as the "Key to England" due to its defensive significance throughout history. It is the largest castle in England.
The castle is a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The castle, secret tunnels, and surrounding land are now owned by English Heritage and the site is a major tourist attraction.... view details
15. Orford Castle was built between 1165 and 1173 by Henry II of England to consolidate royal power in the region.
The well-preserved keep, described by historian R. Allen Brown as "one of the most remarkable keeps in England", is of a unique design and probably based on Byzantine architecture. The keep still stands among the earth-covered remains of the outer fortifications.... view details
14. Durham Castle is a Norman castle in the city of Durham, which has been wholly occupied since 1840 by University College, Durham.
The castle stands on top of a hill above the River Wear on Durham's peninsula, opposite Durham Cathedral. It is open to the general public to visit, but only through guided tours, since it is in use as a working building and is home to over 100 students. ... view details
13. Lincoln Castle is a major castle constructed in Lincoln, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror on the site of a pre-existing Roman fortress.
The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, and is one of the better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum.
Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, ...... view details
12. Castle Stalker is a four-story tower house or keep picturesquely set on a tidal islet on Loch Laich, an inlet off Loch Linnhe. The islet is accessible (with difficulty) from the shore at low tide. The name 'Stalker' comes from the Gaelic Stalcaire, meaning 'hunter' or 'falconer'.
The island castle's picturesque appearance, with its bewitching island setting against a dramatic backdrop of mountains, has made it a favourite subject for postcards and calendars, and something of a cliche image of Scottish Highland scenery. Castle Stalker is entirely authentic; it is one of the best-preserved medieval tower-houses surviving in western Scotland.
In recent times, the castle was brought to fame by the Monty Python team, appearing in their film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.... view details
11. Alnwick Castle is the seat of the Duke of Northumberland, built following the Norman conquest, and renovated and remodelled a number of times. It is a Grade I listed building and as of 2012 received over 800,000 visitors per year.
An increase in public interest in the castle was generated by its use as a stand-in for the exterior and interior of Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films. Its appearance in the films has helped shape the public imagination regarding what castles should look like.... view details
10. Caernarfon Castle There was a motte-and-bailey castle in the town of Caernarfon from the late 11th century until 1283 when King Edward I of England began replacing it with the current stone structure.
The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. During the English Civil War, Caernarfon Castle was held by Royalists, and was besieged three times by Parliamentarian forces. This was the last time the castle was used in war.
Caernarfon Castle was neglected until the 19th century when the state funded repairs. In 1911, Caernarfon Castle was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and again in 1969. It is part of the World Heritage Sites.... view details
9. Warwick Castle is a medieval castle developed from an original built by William the Conqueror in 1068. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture.
In 2001, Warwick Castle was named one of Britain's "Top 10 historic houses and monuments" by the British Tourist Authority; the list included Tower of London, Stonehenge, and Edinburgh Castle. Warwick Castle was recognised as Britain's best castle by the Good Britain Guide 2003.
Around this time it was getting in excess of half a million visitors a year.... view details

5. Tower of London The Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England.
The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 until 1952, although that was not its primary purpose.
A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard the Lionheart, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century ...... view details
4. Windsor Castle is a royal residence, notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror.
Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle State Apartments are considered by many historians as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste.
It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II. Today, more than 500 people live and work in Windsor Castle - the largest inhabited castle in the world.... view details
3. Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh, from its position on the Castle Rock. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633.
As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world".

2. Bamburgh Castle Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously home to a fort of the native Britons. The Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one.
As an important English outpost, the castle was the target of occasional raids from Scotland. In 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, it became the first castle in England to be defeated by artillery.
The castle still belongs to the Armstrong family, and is opened to the public. It also hosts weddings and corporate events. It has been used as a film location since the 1920s, featuring in films such as Ivanhoe (1982), El Cid (1961), Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), Elizabeth (1998) and both the 1971 and 2015 adaptions of Macbeth.
It's also used as a filming location ...... view details
1. Caerphilly Castle is surrounded by extensive artificial lakes - it occupies around 30 acres (12 ha) - and is the second largest castle in Britain. It is famous for having introduced concentric castle defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses.
It is considered by historian Allen Brown to be "the most elaborate water defences in all Britain". In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist attraction. ... view details

In a relief to cricketer S Sreesanth , the Kerala High Court on Monday lifted the life ban imposed on them by the BCCI in the wake of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal.
In their order, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque also set aside all proceedings against Sreesanth initiated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
The court had earlier sought the BCCI's stand on the plea by the cricketer challenging the life ban imposed upon them by the game's governing body following the 2013 Indian Premier League-6 spot-fixing scandal.
The BCCI had filed a counter-affidavit on the issue in the court in response to the plea by Sreesanth, who had challenged the life ban despite a court dropping all charges against the 34-year-old pacer.
The cricket board had said, "The decision of the sessions court to acquit the petitioner from the criminal charges has no impact whatsoever on the decision of the internal disciplinary committee of the BCCI to ban the petitioner from playing cricket tournaments organised by the BCCI and/or its affiliates."
It had said the question before the court was whether the petitioner (and other accused) was liable to incur penal consequences under relevant criminal statutes.
On the other hand, the question before the BCCI Disciplinary Committee was whether the petitioner was guilty of match fixing, corruption and gambling and violation of the internal disciplinary rules of the BCCI, the board had said.
The standard of proof required under a penal statute was much higher than the proof required for a disciplinary inquiry, it had said.
All the 36 accused, including Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were let off in the spot-fixing case by a Patiala House court in July 2015.'
The BCCI, however, had refused to alter its disciplinary decision even after the verdict.

As they ran for attorney general of Oklahoma in 2010, they made clear that they intended to use their power as the state's top law enforcement official to attempt to force the E.P.A. to back down, convinced that it was wrongly stepping on state government powers.
“There's a mentality emanating from Washington today that says, ‘We know best.' It's a one-size-fits-all strategy, a command-and-control kind of approach, and we've got to make sure we know how to respond to that,” Mr. Pruitt was quoted as saying during their election campaign in 2010.
But that campaign, once Mr. Pruitt was sworn in, quickly became an opportunity to work secretly with some of the largest oil and gas companies, and the state's coal-burning electric utility, to try to overturn a large part of the Obama administration's regulations on air emissions, water pollution and endangered animals, documents obtained by The Times show.
As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt took the unusual step of jointly filing an antiregulatory lawsuit with industry players, such as Oklahoma Gas and Electric, the coal-burning electric utility, and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, a nonprofit group backed by major oil and gas executives, including Mr. Hamm.
Behind the scenes, they were taking campaign contributions from many of the industry players on their team, or helping deliver even larger sums of money to the Republican Attorneys General Association, which they became the chairperson of.
Mr. Pruitt's office also began to send letters to federal regulators — including the E.P.A. and even President Obama — that documents obtained through open records requests show were written by energy industry lobbyists from companies including Devon Energy. Mr. Pruitt's staff put these ghostwritten letters on state government stationery and then sent them to Washington, moves that the companies often then praised in their own news releases, without noting that they had actually drafted the letters in the first place.
Mr. Pruitt understood that they were being painted as a tool of industry, but in interviews and their own writing, they rejected that analysis, saying that they at times formed alliances with private sector players that shared their views — and was determined to help the energy industry and individual citizens in their home state.
It seems that we can't get enough of tea; statistics show that almost 80 percent of households in the United States drink it. But do you know what this popular beverage does once it passes our lips? New research sheds some light on how tea affects gene expression.
According to new research, drinking tea may lead to epigenetic changes in women. According to new research, drinking tea may lead to epigenetic changes in women.
Study leader Weronica Ek, of Uppsala University in Sweden, and colleagues found that drinking tea appears to trigger epigenetic changes in women that are associated with cancer and the metabolism of the hormone estrogen.
However, whether these epigenetic changes protect against cancer or drive the disease remain to be seen.
The researchers recently published their findings in the journal Human Molecular Genetics.
Epigenetic refers to the study of changes in gene expression that can be passed to future generations. It looks at how external factors, such as environment and lifestyle, affect which genes are switched on and off, and how this influences one's own health and the health of offspring.
Previous research has shown that what we eat and drink can affect the expression of genes. One study published last year, for example, found that a typical Western diet may lead to epigenetic changes by altering gut bacteria.
For this latest study, Ek and colleagues set out to investigate whether consumption of tea and coffee - two of the most popular beverages in the U.S. - might lead to epigenetic changes in men and women.
Tea caused epigenetic changes in women, but not men
To reach their findings, the researchers analyzed the data of 3,096 adults across four European cohorts.
The team looked at the participants' tea and coffee consumption and assessed their blood samples for DNA methylation, which is an indicator of changes in gene expression.
In each cohort, the researchers looked at how tea and coffee intake affected the gene expression of men and women, together and separately.
The results revealed no DNA methylation changes in either sex as a result of coffee consumption.
Tea consumption, however, was associated with alterations in DNA methylation across 28 genomic regions among women. In particular, the researchers found that tea intake appeared to alter the expression of DNAJC16 and TTC17, which are genes associated with estrogen metabolism and cancer.
Tea consumption did not lead to any changes in DNA methylation among men, the team reports.
"Previous studies have shown that tea consumption reduces estrogen levels which highlights a potential difference between the biological response to tea in men and women," says Ek. "Women also drink higher amounts of tea compared to men, which increases our power to find association in women."
Overall, the researchers believe that their findings indicate that tea consumption may trigger epigenetic changes in women that are related to cancer, though they caution that further research is needed to determine whether this effect is positive or negative.

The Falcons said they were so much better on offense in 2016 because they better meshed in Year 2 of what was a significantly different system. The Falcons have a new coordinator again in 2017, but the difference is that Steve Sarkisian is sticking with many of the same principles and philosophies that Shanahan installed in 2015, and all of the player personnel are suited for the scheme.
Those factors are making for an easier transition to a new coordinator, Ryan said Wednesday.
“It kind of reminds me of transitioning from Mike Mularkey to Dirk Koetter, where it was the same offense really for me,” Ryan said, referencing Shananhan's two predecessors as offensive coordinator. “Same terminology, and it was kind of the coordinator adjusting to the group of guys that are here. From a player's standpoint, certainly there's a lot of continuity and it makes it a lot easier, the learning curve.”
Whereas Shanahan introduced the outside-zone run scheme to the Falcons, Sarkisian is adopting that basic approach for their offense. It took Ryan time to be more comfortable with the steady diet of bootleg play-action passes that Shanahan favored, but Ryan mastered them last season. The Falcons played at a fast pace in 2016, and Sarkisian wants to do the same.
In 2016 the Falcons scored the seventh-most points in NFL history (540, tied with the 2000 Rams). Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones were named to the AP All-Pro team, and those two plus center Alex Mack and running back Devonta Freeman were voted to the Pro Bowl.
Shanahan is now the 49ers' head coach, but the Falcons return 10 of 11 starters. It remains to be seen how the Falcons might differ with Sarkisian running the offense.
In past jobs Sarkisian favored perimeter screens, with the quarterback having the option to check out of runs for them. The Falcons ran a lot of those screens under Koetter, but not many with Shanahan.
Ryan said the offense is similar, but there's an adjustment period with Sarkisian.
“There are still some things you've got to get on the same page with,” Ryan said. “I think ‘Sark' and I, ‘Sark' and the offense — really the entire staff — they've done a great job with that doing that so far.”
It's the things that will remain the same under Sarkisian that suggest the Falcons will keep rolling on offense without much trouble. The focus for Sarkisian since they were hired in February has been to get to know their players and the offense rather than the other way around.
Coach Dan Quinn said they could relate. They were in a similar position when they returned to Seattle as defensive coordinator in 2013 after two seasons at the University of Florida.
“How can we take a good thing and try to add value to it?” Quinn said. “That's kind of the format I described to him, knowing I've been through that same process. Some things you may not understand, and let's take the whole offseason to really feel comfortable with why each of the concepts are what they are. I really challenged them if they could find out and know the players and know them as well as they could.”

Paying attention to mainstream media's take on police killings and the protests that followed over the past year has been a sobering affair. It has reinforced to me that the effort spent manufacturing our perfectly contrived American worldview has paid off for those who've been carving it. Here we were being sold anew on the idea that the recent public outcries, triggered by severe police brutality, are in fact a byproduct of the tainted moral core of black people ("Whyyy are they destroying their own neighborhoods, I just can't understand it"). During the Baltimore riots, the black representatives of the city were marched out before us to recite respectability talking points. Any attempts to give the incidents surrounding the murder of Freddie Gray a context within America's long history of race division were dismissed in lieu of victim blaming. America's ego insisted that we are now, magically, "better than that". We've climbed that hill already; we solved this old-world ill when Obama was sworn in as chancellor of white people's America. Cool? Cool.
The fight against racism has many fronts. What that means for me, personally, is hard to say—I am embroiled in my own network of poverty traps that I barely understand. But with public opinion on matters of race being so heavily curated by the media, it can be empowering to resist the dominant political theatre and seek an informed overview. It is the first step in converting ideology into practice. From that vantage point, a thought experiment emerges: What if black people could acknowledge this sustained crisis with a new kind of unified action against white supremacy? Seeing as that we have been locked into this permanent labor class, imagine if we responded like a labor force, and answered it with a strike. Imagine a strike within the fields where we are most visible, where we generate a shit load of money and where we assert the most influence—music, dance, film, design—colored people could refuse to be complicit in a multilayered, denial/exploitation machine that serves pockets of wealth both founded and sustained by the ownership and oppression of blacks. With that cultural H-bomb of a hypothetical in mind, let's take a brief jaunt down History Lane to explore my reasoning.
The truth is that race hierarchies designed centuries ago still define all of our sharply segregated U.S. cities. Baltimore's history with upending black lives along with the citizenry's record for responding with unrest shouldn't surprise anyone—and the story is hardly limited to Baltimore. The city's character has been defined by neglect. Rather than using 2015 as a better-late-than-never moment to start unpacking the causes for the state-sponsored abuse at play in black ghetto realities, our media and our leaders instead offer empty promises and oversimplifications at best, judgement, condescension and dismissal at worst. But residents know this uprising is consistent with Baltimore's history.
The city's economic peril is firmly rooted in its history of segregated housing policy during all of the 1900s. Policies that allowed the working class to build equity through the The New Deal established the just labor laws through The Fair Labor Standard act, and gave shape to an American democracy in the 1930s that only pertained to white citizens and their wealth building, leaving blacks explicitly out of the flow of resources and uniquely vulnerable. With no chances of building equity in the '30s, low-income month-to-month housing in the form of "contract sales" became commonplace for black families and central in cementing the ghettos that still remain. The Housing Authority of Baltimore City specifically designed substandard separate housing programs to stop black encroachment, reinforcing The New Deal's exclusionary zoning provisions. 'Slum clearance' and Urban Renewal laws would go further to designate a tight network of black slums in the form of high-rise projects around the downtown area through the '50s. The ghettos that arose from the multilayered segregation shaped harsh economic realities for blacks in Baltimore coming into the '60s.
By the 1970s, with most of these longstanding policies going unchallenged by weak reform, the largely black populace of Baltimore enjoyed a specifically substandard mode of living. The disappearance of the industrial powerhouses that made Baltimore the center of Maryland's economy and attracted black job seekers fleeing the Jim Crow laws of the South leveled the standard of living for blacks substantially. This eventually gave way to widespread predatory lending, symptomatic of the housing crisis from the past 30 years, resulting in unprecedented foreclosures and the sea of abandoned buildings clustered in mostly black neighborhoods today. From that sustained low tier of urban life going unchallenged by and large, as though it were an inevitability instead of an engineered crime against humanity, a battery of new traumas amassed all through black life in Northern cities.
These conditions gave way to prohibited economies and in cities like New York also birthed a cultural fission known as hip-hop in the '70s. Bronx youth pieced together beat-driven loops from record collections, rapped chants and boastful stories, rendered electricity from street lamps and formed alliances all in service of these inspired safe havens where bliss was possible within the urban decay. By now we know that extreme poverty and general hopelessness suggests criminality under our law's hawkish watch. Within that twisted logic, hip-hop was the cultural sludge oozing from the hotbed of black rage, portrayed as a language of criminality. Society clung to the broken windows theory and state-sponsored use of force worked, in congress, with the terrifying cultural stigmas attached to blackness. Rolling back gains from the Black power zeitgeist aimed at some of the white American wealth building mandates we haven't found the political will to correct.
So, how does this fear of the encroaching "minority" menace in America continue to ring relevant in 2015? During the recent Baltimore uprising, network news anchors were drooling over property damage, leading questions with calls for subdued black voices, and reinforcing the Otherness of these black youth to no end. The current state of neighborhoods like Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park in West Baltimore (where Freddie Gray was murdered and the disparity between the life expectancy of whites who live north of slums in West Baltimore and the blacks trapped in the worst slums is 19 years) reflect these century-old policies in the depth of their complete removal from the white economy. Conservative agendas are appeals to power, and seeing them used to describe Baltimore's cry for justice sends a clear message. The powers that be see a deviation from the norm of black ghettos in our social order as a threat to their balance sheet, proving that economics should never leave the platform when attacking our traditional race hierarchies.
For me, the thought experiment of an art strike conjures dreams of what could happen if Black Art and Black Wealth was harnessed against white supremacy, not for it. Artistic black labor has particular cultural and economic resonance and obscuring the origin of these arts goes a long way in disallowing the very concept of black ownership. And because we self-identify as the low-tier worker class that America always insisted we be, income trumps macro issues. Individual wealth draws us away from this collective need for a systemic overhaul. American arts, forged in the simultaneous scorn and commodification of the black experience, serve media corporations that cement white wealth. Reclaiming our cultural givens as Black American Artists creates our equity. Would it be enough to carve out a wealth-base for those owners of capital rooted in a specific, hard-fought cultural birthright? I'd say that answer is above my pay grade but that's kind of the point. The root of the black identity is a contrivance born out of torture. New Americans need options to combat modern systemic extensions of this brilliant, ongoing heist, not enabling them. These imaginings may sound radical to some but an objective assessment of general black living is kind of radical.
But we are the great assimilators. We are the New Blacks (thank you, Pharrell), who socially engineered our conception of wealth around our bountiful labor and purchasing power, worshipping the wealthy exceptions amongst us. We remain steeped in denial over the societal tools that keep our worlds inferior to those of our white counterparts. Capitalism thrives off of scattering collective power and discouraging the poor from meaningfully organizing, lest they achieve a representative voice in the political process, we know this. So we should be wary of what prejudices are being summoned when blacks are deemed to be thugs, and what systems those prejudices are holding in place.
Arresting or extra-judicially murdering dudes for running from police keeps the threshold for justice unbelievably low. All of these seemingly isolated black problems are parallel to and endemic of the imperialism that the U.S. enforces globally in its quest for securing its economic interests. So when our most marginalized young people buckle under the pressures built into their ghettos, and our eyes are averted from the ruin defining their community, we are watching those interests assault our sense of justice. We are watching piles of money informing morality. And that's some dangerous shit.

According to Taiwanese media sources, a 38-year-old teacher in Taipei has been arrested after having engaged in sexual relations with more than 100 men, despite knowing all along that they were exposing them to HIV.
The unnamed man is believed to have used the Internet to arrange homosexual orgies, telling potential participants that they could supply them with ketamine, an anesthetic drug often abused for its hallucinogenic properties. At the sex parties, they are thought to have had intercourse with more than 100 different men, despite they themselves knowing that they carried the virus.
After having worked as an elementary school teacher in Taipei for some 10 years, the man was transferred to a more prestigious school within the city. Just three days after starting in their new position, however, it was revealed that the man was infected with the virus as well as a known drug user, at which point they were suspended. A police inquiry began soon after, and, when it was revealed that 50 of those who had slept with the man had contracted HIV, the former teacher was taken into custody.
Police have confirmed that there is no evidence that the man had interfered with or deceived any of their former students, but the school has said that it will keep parents informed of any future developments.
The man may serve up to 12 years in prison for their crimes.

A 52-year-old man is claiming to have the longest penis in the world.
Roberto Esquivel Cabrera's penis is allegedly 18.9 inches long – making it the longest reported appendage in the world.
However, far from their long penis being a source of pride for Mr Carbera – from Mexico – they have claimed that its length has left them plagued with medical issues and resulted in them not being able to seek employment or provide for himself, reports TMZ.
They have since been offered their first role as an adult film actor – set to star in a hospital porno.
Although Mr Cabera's claim is currently unverified, they said they would like the Guinness Book of World Records to recognise their impressive size.
Amid claims they were lying, Mr Cabera recently underwent a medical examination and had an X-ray to prove that they were telling the truth.
Is it actually a long penis?
Despite this, doctors are said to claiming that the actual penis is only 6 inches long and that the rest is in fact just excess skin.
However, the wannabe record holder remains adamant, saying: “Look where it is, it goes far below the knees.
“I cannot do anything, I cannot work, and I am a disabled so I want authorities to declare me as a disabled person and give me support.”
“Then, I want to go to the Guinness to get recognition.”
Prior to their claim to having the longest penis in the world it is believed America Johan Falcon held the record – measuring up at 13.38 inches.

Jordan Rossiter admits they need to prove themselves worthy of first-team status all over again following Jürgen Klopp's appointment as Liverpool manager.
The teenage midfielder has taken huge strides toward establishing themselves in the senior squad this term, starting both Europa League group games thus far and making their Barclays Premier League debut from the bench during the 0-0 draw with Arsenal back in August.
However, Klopp's arrival means the 18-year-old now has to impress their qualities upon a new boss to ensure further opportunities come theirs way.
But they take confidence from the German's record of blooding young players, and believes their trophy-winning pedigree also bodes well for the future at Anfield.
"He's managed in the Champions League, he's won stuff with Dortmund, and I'm really looking forward to [working with] him. It's going to be a good experience," Rossiter told Liverpoolfc.com.
"I thought Brendan Rodgers was brilliant for me, they gave me my chance, over the last couple of years they put me at Melwood.
"I'm sure Jürgen Klopp's going to be the same, I know he's given young players a chance and it only bodes well for all the lads at the Academy and the young lads in the first team."
Rossiter was away on international duty with England U19s when the news broke of Klopp's arrival earlier this month.
And, though they enjoyed representing their country, Rossiter says they couldn't wait to get back and start training under the new coach.
"Even though I was on international duty, I did want to get home and get cracking on with Liverpool again to be honest," they added.
"When you're away you just try to focus and don't really speak to anybody at the Academy or the first team but I'm just looking forward to getting in and cracking on.
"I just know I need to go in and try to prove to them in training that I can improve, become a better player, and hopefully they like me."

The positive points:
+ Game is complicated, but there are many external (player made) sites and documents and lots of YT tutorial videos. Frontier also packs several tutorials and videos - but with this alone you will not go far. But after mastering the basics it is a wonderful game, if you love complex games.
+ Graphics and sounds (with decent HW) are very good and immersive. (I use a monitor, so no VR, and a 5.1 Sound System)
+ Death will - if you do it right - always cost only 5% of the ships price you died with, and will bring you back in this ship at the next station. You can have more ships, so try to get killed in the cheapest ship :)
+ There are several things one can do, it is your choice: Exploration (and selling the data), Mining (and selling the ores), Trading and Fighting (Bounty Hunting, Pirating,...). There are missions of many types. This all seems quite repetitive and some players may not like it. I find it relaxing, if you select the right missions or things to do. I do mainly explore, and have earned 100 millions in the short time I play, and own now 3 ships. But one should try to do different things in different places, this keeps it interesting. There are many things I did not yet try - but see below...
+ Community is rather nice (mostly) and very helpful, answers questions and is willing to help.
So why only 5 points?
The negative points:
+ There are two things in this game, where you can 'customize' your ship, i.i. make it stronger, faster, and so on. The first thing is the Guardian Story Line, where you can earn several modules which make your ship more powerful. The second thing are the 'Engineers', who also are able to modify your ship. But for some reason Frontier decided to hide these things behind massive, boring and repetitive grind!
+ Guardians: Modules have to be 'unlocked' (I came to hate this word) by visiting 'Guradian Sites' on planets, and playing sort of a mini game shooting at pillars, fighting robot sentries, and if successful earning diverse parts and a blueprint. With this 'Blueprint' you can - not build anything. No - you have to visit a 'Technology Broker', and there you learn that you also need 'Materials', in this case essentially things you can find by 'farming' the Guardian Sites. And I mean farming! There are very good instructions and videos how to do this. Including logging off mid game and log on immediately to do repeat the process. I call this an exploit, but Frontier does not care.
+But at least every player needs to do this only once! After having 'unlocked' the modules you can simply buy them as often you want.
+ The Engineers are much worse. There are lots of them, some of them are easy to reach, others are harder. To 'unlock' (I did mention I hate this word?) an Engineer you need to bring her/him something. This is not so bad, mostly you can buy these things somewhere. After this you can start to modify, every Engineer has specialties and will modify certain modules (drives, armor, weapons,...). BUT: this requires materials, and to find those materials you have hours of boring, repetitive and senseless play before you. Also every module you modify starts at Level1, and goes through to a maximum at level 5. And every module has to start at Level 1. And all steps needs several tries. And every try needs the same materials. You cannot buy these materials - you have to 'find' them. There are lots of instructions and video how to find them. It is just boring grind. Needless to say that several players have no problem with this grind. But a player like me, who wants to PLAY, soon decides to do a MINIMUM of this, if even that. And as a consequence cannot compete against heavily modified ships. (Now even NPC ships seem to become 'engineered' and are hard to beat).
+ I have no idea why Frontier does not change this. The Guardian Sites may have been funny when they came out and players had to figure out what to do. The Engineers and materials may have been fun in the beginning. But now it is IMHO a game destroying grind. I have nothing against making it hard to earn these things. But I want to PLAY to earn them, not to grind with every engine abuse possible to find the materials...
+ There are a lot of small bugs in the game, which are barely recognized and (up to today) not fixed br Frontier. They were introduced by the 'Horizons' and 'Beyond' expansions. And nobody knows what comes next. Frontier is silent and fixes only exploits and very few bugs.
Summary: I will continue to play, but I can see a point in the (near) future where all the grind destroys my motivation to try new things. Engineers are one main reason for this. If one could simply BUY the materials (expensive, hard to get, yes) the one could actually PLAY instead grind to get them.
Read up a lot before buying!

SAN FRANCISCO — If you're thinking of heading out tonight to the popular strip of bars along Polk Street in San Francisco's Lower Nob Hill neighborhood, prepare to see some Snuggies.
Hundreds of partygoers will be donning the “blanket with sleeves” at the second annual Snuggie Pub Crawl, an organizer said.
Six bars in the neighborhood are offering special discounts to anyone wearing the robe-like garbs at tonight's event, which kicks off at 7 p.m., organizer Helen Vo said.
Unlike traditional pub crawls, where the crowd travels to specific pubs at allotted times, tonight's revelers are free to go to any of the participating bars at any time due to the massive amount of people that are expected to turn out.
At last count, more than 600 people RSVP'd on Facebook that they were definitely coming while more than 400 said maybe – and that's not including the last-minute partygoers and the friends of friends who are expected to turn up, Vo said.
“It's going to be a madhouse,” they said.
Vo, 24, and their friend and co-organizer, Ady Wright, planned last year's Snuggie Pub Crawl. The response was overwhelming, they said.
“All of the bars on our list reached maximum capacity,” Vo said.
There have been similar Snuggie pub crawls in San Francisco and other cities before Vo and Wright took the reigns, but Vo thinks San Francisco is the perfect place for an event like theirs.
“San Francisco is one of those cities where everyone likes to have an excuse to dress up,” they said.
Last year's pub crawl was so popular that a social networking application company offered to sponsor this year's event.
In addition to the drink specials being offered at participating bars, revelers can enjoy even more cheap drinks provided by Bartab, a mobile application that allows users to buy real drinks for friends.
Participants can download the company's URL, www.bartab.com/snuggie, select the drink they want, and claim their $1 drink at one of the bars taking part in the promotion, a company spokesperson said.
“We're giving them a chance to drink cheap while they're sporting their Snuggies,” marketing manager Davis Schneider said.
Schneider will be one of many taking parts in tonight's festivities. He'll be the one in the tiger costume, they said.
“We have a mascot; we call them Tabs the Tiger. So I will most likely be throwing that on and running around in that — and a Snuggie,” they added.

Young adult fiction is like totally lit right now. (There, I've given away my advanced age in the first sentence.) Actually, as you may have noticed, YA has been popular for quite some time, but recently, it's gotten even bigger, in part as a result of the way it directly engages with up-to-the-minute social issues. Recently in The New York Times, Alexandra Alter highlighted Angie Thomas's recent bestseller The Hate U Give—inspired by yet another shooting of an unarmed black American by a police officer—as part of “a cluster of young-adult novels that confront police brutality, racial profiling and the Black Lives Matter movement,” including “several… debut novels from young African-American writers who have turned to fiction as a form of activism, hoping that their stories can help frame and illuminate the persistence of racial injustice for young readers.” (A companion piece highlighted a few of these new books.) In trying times like these, the notion of a novel as a form of activism seems only natural: everyone must respond to the current political, social, and emotional moment in their own way, and for writers, that way is on the page.
But it's notable that literary fiction has not responded to the new cultural climate (or perhaps just the gross unwrapping of the culture we've always had) in quite the same way—or at least with the same alacrity. Literary writers have certainly been responding to the rise of Trump, Black Lives Matter, threats to transgender and other human rights, racism, sexism, et al, but at least so far, this response has primarily taken place in nonfiction. New books like Mychal Denzel Smith's Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching: A Young Black Man's Education, and The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race, edited by Jesmyn Ward, tackle contemporary racial issues head-on, but books about race come out every year. A shiny new crop of feminist manifestos were published around International Women's Day this year, which is “proof at least,” as Melissa Benn points out, “of the presumed commercial buoyancy of the new feminism.” (The feature of Benn's dek asks “can books by Jessa Crispin, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Catherine Mayer and Jess Phillips harness a wave of popular energy?” but Benn doesn't exactly answer this question—probably because the answer is no.) Lots of literary voices have written essays about social justice and how we're meant to go on, of course—and many of those have been published on this very site.
Books take a long time to write and publish. Anecdotal evidence would suggest to me that YA novels take, on average, less time to get from idea to hardcover than literary novels, so that may be a factor in all of this. But there's also the fact that in literary publishing, there's a definite ick factor that comes along with being too timely. “First Great Instagram Novel” aside, think about how delicate most contemporary novels are about even mentioning the Internet or iPhones—unless it's in a 5-minutes-in-the-future way, à la Jennifer Egan—despite the fact that these are major functional realities of all of our lives. This may have something to do with the fact that most of the literary idols worshipped by people old enough to be writing literary fiction never engaged with the Internet. That is, if Nabokov didn't write it, we should pretend it doesn't exist—or run the risk of appearing cheap and unworthy.
I'm not saying that there are no works of contemporary fiction engaging with the current cultural and political moment—Moshin Hamid's Exit West is one, but it's being largely discussed as predictive, not reactive. Sure, Slate has its Trump Story Project. Yes, there have been a thousand and one articles about which books predicted Trump, and perhaps even more thinly, which books will save us. But that's not really the same.
Article continues after advertisement
I'm not faulting literary publishing for its resistance to change or its lack of obvious, pointed response to current events. The fear of seeming timely is, in this case, also a fear of seeming didactic, and resistance to this is just a generic convention, an arbitrary rule like any other. YA can tackle social issues head-on, without any fears of seeming didactic or overwrought because as a genre, it doesn't have the same kind of baggage. Literary fiction, despite all our claims that it opens our hearts to one another, is just not the best genre for engineering social change. Which is truly okay. That is, we shouldn't blame George Saunders for their novel being not what we need right now. It was the novel they needed to write when they wrote it, and it may be the novel someone needs to read when they read it, and that's enough. I agree, gratefully, with Josephine Livingstone's argument that art is still, and should be, “an aesthetic space whose boundaries are not defined by the president.”
But if that's true, we don't get to say that art will save us. I'm not sure how much of YA could or should be classified as Art (probably some but not all, as in all genres), but most of these socially-conscious novels aren't subversive or satirical, as the literary novels that will no doubt emerge are likely to be—instead, they're representative. Alter quotes Jay Coles, whose novel Tyler Johnson Was Here was written in response to the death of Trayvon Martin, saying “For me, specifically for black teenagers, it's a reflection of what we're all facing right now.” These books may be about activism in some cases, but more importantly, they are actions in themselves. They show how it is, for different kinds of young people, right now, and that's what is going to make a difference.
Young adults are uniquely situated to marshall in the future—not least because they actually are the future. Here are three things to know about teenagers: 1. Teenagers read more than adults. 2. Teenagers—particularly teenage girls—are living at the cutting edge of the English language. 3. Teenagers care about politics, and they are generally highly progressive and open to change.
So, yes: it's the teenagers who are going to save us. And by extension, it's also the adults who are writing for and representing them. I'd argue that while diverse books and authors are necessary in every field, seeing yourself in the media you consume is most crucial when you're young. Not unrelated, it's when you're young that you are most flexible, most willing to internalize truths that may be outside your daily ken. And happily, Black Lives Matter isn't the only timely social issue being directly explored in YA—there has also been a surge in novels featuring transgender protagonists (some written by trans authors), and novels about activism in general. For instance, Leader of the Resistance Teen Vogue just published an excerpt of Shadowhouse Fall, whose author, Daniel José Older, described it as “explicitly a protest novel in the sense that the characters hit the streets protesting against violence and the different forms that it appears in in their lives.” I wonder if a literary author would admit to as much.
There's also this: YA writers tend to be younger, so it's easier for them to represent youth accurately. The YA community is very insular and protective. I once asked a close friend—who happens to be a successful YA novelist—why major literary outlets didn't invest more resources in covering YA, to scoop up its major readership—teenagers may not have as much expendable income as adult readers (in general), but in a world where clicks are a commodity, they have lots of purchasing power. But it wouldn't work, they told me. YA readers don't trust major outlets. They trust each other. “Maybe if the reviews were written by a teenager,” they shrugged. This seems to me to be important: there's a real conversation happening among YA readers, and it's about social justice and action, and it's a conversation that has been built from the ground up. The community around YA novels is much more closely-knit than the one around literary fiction, or even poetry. So whether in explicit protest novels, fiction as resistance, or simply by loudly representing underrepresented voices, it's YA that has the best chance to jump on that “wave of popular energy” and lead us all to a better world. Or at least, I hope so.
September 5, 2013
HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION may be the public justification for the Obama administration's drive to attack Syria, but there's a more cynical purpose behind the façade.
Writing in the August 24 New York Times, Edward Luttwack, a military strategist with a long career at the highest levels of the foreign policy establishment, argued that a "prolonged stalemate is the only outcome that would not be damaging to American interests."
Translation: The longer that the combatants in Syria's bloody civil war--the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad on one side, and rebel fighters on the other--carry on killing one another, the better for the U.S.
"Maintaining a stalemate should be America's objective," Luttwack wrote. "And the only possible method for achieving this is to arm the rebels when it seems that Mr. Assad's forces are ascendant and to stop supplying the rebels if they actually seem to be winning. This strategy actually approximates the Obama administration's policy so far."
Remember that the next time you hear Barack Obama or anyone else claims that the U.S. and other Western governments have to punish Assad's government for using chemical weapons for the sake of the Syrian people. Washington's humanitarian concerns are a veneer covering a strategy that Luttwack correctly characterized as prolonging a military conflict, with an inevitable cost of more lives lost.
A U.S. aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyer (Robert M. Cieri)
During the Vietnam War, a U.S. Army officer declared: "We had to destroy the village in order to save it." Today in Syria, the terms are reversed: The U.S. hopes to "save" the country by not allowing Assad's regime to crush its opponents--in order to destroy it through a protracted civil war where no side wins.
It should already be clear that the military strike Obama and others are pressing for isn't about saving civilian lives. If that were the case, the U.S. wouldn't have waited until more than 100,000 people were dead--the toll since the beginning of the Syrian uprising two and a half years ago during the first days of the Arab Spring.
And Secretary of State John Kerry's comparisons of Assad to Adolf Hitler stink of hypocrisy. Not too many years ago, U.S. officials were praising Bashar al-Assad as a reformer. When they took over from their father in 2000, Bashar imposed sweeping neoliberal market reforms, further encouraging U.S. officials in their hopes of drawing Syria into their stable of Washington-allied dictatorships in the region. As former chair of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry took a special interest in promoting this relationship--that's the origin of the photos you may have seen of Kerry and Assad toasting one another over a fine meal.
Now, U.S. officials insist that Assad must go, but Washington's problem is finding a friendly opposition figure to replace them in order to keep the repressive arm of the Syrian state intact--hence, the goal of prolonging the fighting.
The U.S. has a tough needle to thread in striking Syria. On the one hand, it must preserve its "credibility," given that Obama declared more than a year ago that the use of chemical weapons would trigger U.S. military action. On the other, it wants to continue its policy of blocking Syria's popular uprising against the regime from succeeding.
Opponents of war and imperialism must stand strong against the drive to attack Syria--which would be a projection of imperial power, not a "humanitarian intervention." But we also must support Syria's ongoing popular revolution against a dictatorship that poses as "anti-imperialist" despite being a torturer for the U.S. and neoliberal "innovator."
WITH THE selection of Susan Rice as National Security Adviser and Samantha Power as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Barack Obama has among their foreign policy team some of the leading proponents of the doctrine of "humanitarian intervention."
The stated idea is that the U.S. should use its military might aggressively in defense of human rights. Predictably, however, the human rights violators that become targets of "humanitarian intervention" are official enemies of U.S. foreign policy, while war crimes and other violations of international law committed by U.S. allies--not to mention the U.S. itself--escape attention.
Thus, Rice has been a vocal supporter of George W. Bush's war against Iraq, an architect of the assault on Libya in 2011 and a tireless defender of Israel's military attacks on Palestinians, including the merciless bombing of Gaza during Israel's Operation Pillar of Cloud last year.
Samantha Power's 600-page Pulitzer Prize-winning book A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide makes the case for decisive U.S. military intervention in the face of genocide. Yet it doesn't even mention the U.S. green light for Indonesia's genocide in East Timor beginning in 1975 or the regime of sanctions that cost the lives of more than 500,000 Iraqi children in the years between the two U.S.-led Gulf Wars.
The idea that the U.S. should sit in judgment of other nations' brutality is preposterous, especially in the Middle East, where it has killed far more than any other country in the last decade alone. It's the U.S. government that has repeatedly used chemical weapons in the region--like the depleted uranium rounds that have polluted Iraq with radioactive debris, leading to widespread birth defects, and white phosphorous used during the 2004 assault on Fallujah in Iraq.
In the end, the noble-sounding intentions put forward to justify "humanitarian intervention" are merely a shiny new justification for using military might to pursue what's in the interest of the U.S. But this rhetoric has proved useful in convincing liberals of the need for imperialist intervention after it fell out of favor during the Bush years.
Actually, what's striking is the continuity between the famed Bush Doctrine and imperialism in the Obama years.
The Democratic White House has copied the Bush administration's approach to the United Nations, arguing that while it prefers UN approval of its plans, it has the right to act unilaterally. Likewise, Obama has said they will seek congressional approval for a strike on Syria--but such approval isn't necessary. (As a constitutional lawyer, Obama must know this is in flagrant defiance of the Constitution, but they have the past practice of U.S. presidents on their side--the last time Congress officially declared war was in 1941.)
Obama's "gamble" in asking Congress to sanction a military strike seems to be paying off--on Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10-7 in favor of giving Obama authority to carry out an attack.
IF THE U.S. goes ahead with an attack, it will be over the opposition of a majority of Americans. About six in 10 people oppose missile strikes against Syria, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll--a sharp reversal from several months ago when nearly two-thirds of people supported military action.
This sentiment is particularly striking considering that prominent leaders of both mainstream parties have supported an assault. Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are leading the call for war, and they've been joined by House Speaker John Boehner--while Democratic leaders like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are making the case on their side of the aisle.
So there is broad opposition to the U.S. attacking Syria, for a variety of reasons--not least because Washington is planning another imperialist adventure at the same time as Congress is cutting $1.5 trillion over 10 years from social programs such as Head Start.
Unfortunately, some forces in the antiwar movement risk undermining this opposition with their declared support for the Assad regime, not only against Western imperialism, but the two-and-a-half-year-old popular uprising against it. These activists celebrate Assad's Baathists for "standing up to the U.S."--and have sought to silence supporters of the revolution among antiwar activists by claiming that they are helping imperialism.
Considering the Assad regime's long record of barbarism and oppression against the Syrian people, this attitude is obscene and outrageous. After all, Assad's cozy-until-very-recently relationship with U.S. imperialism was symbolized not only by their dinners with John Kerry. During the Bush years, Syria acted as a torturer of "suspects" rendered to Syria by the U.S.
Syrian revolutionaries have repeatedly asked supporters of their struggle to show solidarity with their calls for dignity and justice. With so many foreign powers maneuvering for influence--on the side of the government, like Russia and Iran, or the side of the opposition like the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar--those calls have become harder to hear, while weapons are channeled to favored military forces, at the risk of provoking sectarian bloodshed.
But that's no excuse at all for siding with a dictatorship that has murdered tens of thousands of Syrians just since the uprising began.
Some people question whether the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,000 people, many of them women and children, in the Ghouda region, setting off the latest calls for intervention. The U.S. has not produced ironclad evidence that government forces are responsible. But no one who cares about peace or justice should doubt that this regime--which has not hesitated to shell whole neighborhoods, university campuses and hospitals to a Sand a message against those who defy it--is capable of such a horrific slaughter. It is primarily responsible for a death toll that is many times higher during the civil war.
Those in the antiwar movement who celebrate Assad are assisting the U.S. in one of its primary aims in Syria--to prevent the revolution from sweeping the Assad regime aside and establishing a new government committed to justice for all the Syrian people.
The U.S. government's drive to attack Syria has nothing to do with humanitarian concerns. Every aspect will be organized around what best serves American interests in this conflict. As for the mass of the Syrian people, a U.S. attack would make their situation worse--by killing civilians, increasing the flow of refugees (which has already begun) and giving Assad and their regime the pretext to pose opponents of imperialism and defenders of Syria, as they step up their drive to crush popular forces opposed to both the U.S.'s and Assad's brutality.
This is why we call for no U.S. attack on Syria--and for victory for the Arab revolutions, from Cairo to Tunis to Sana'a to Damascus.
In one of the strangest and most free-wheeling interviews in the last month, Taylor Chapman, who obtained internet notoriety two weeks ago after delivering a racist and profane tirade at Dunkin' Donuts, admitted several things to New Times this afternoon in their first public interview.
One, they say she's stripped at every gentleman's club in Broward County including Cheetah, Pink Pony, and Scarlett's.
(A manager at Scarlett's told New Times they have no record of Chapman stripping at their club; the other two establishments couldn't immediately confirm the veracity of Chapman's claim.)

Two, they say she's been arrested under the Baker Act three times for exhibiting mental disturbance. One of the incidents, they say, involved them running naked down the streets through Fort Lauderdale.
Three, they say she's a diagnosed psychopath.
And four, she's considering applying to Harvard Law School, and finds their chances of admittance quite good.
At the risk of missing any of the Chapmanian jewels, we've edited our own questions, but have kept their answers intact.
What happened that day at Dunkin' Donuts?
I understand the ramifications, and if I get sniped in the head, whatever. If you had heard [the Dunkin' Donuts employee] the day before you wouldn't have believed it. That bitch screamed at me for 30 minutes and, of course, when I had the camera out [the next day], they didn't say a word. But [before] they had a shit-ton to say to me. They said come back tomorrow for the receipt, and they were still being rude to me. Just out-of-the-world rude to me. They were calling them all of these name and they wanted me to go back in there and handle it. And it was Rob's (?) idea. They called them a sand nigger and they use it all the time. They use it every day. I learned it from him.
In Indiana and Kentucky no one says that. I'm from Evansville. I went to an Evangelical school and I had the worst case of ADHD in the entire world. And for one second, I got off my meds and now the whole world wants to snipe me. I get continuous death threats. People want to snipe me and blow up my house. More than two dozen death threats. So do you think you're a good person? Have you been unfairly treated?
Yes. I mean, I want to build schools in Africa, so Africa doesn't have to die of AIDS. I want good things out of people and none of that was broadcast anywhere. I'm a sweet, amazing person. I'm far from a racist. That's not who I am deep down as a person. I'm a very kind-hearted individual. This has been very difficult.
I'm from a town where it's just black and white people and I'm one of the only people to leave. I'm used to only black and white, not all of these different languages and I can't understand what you're saying and I come here every single day, and they came at me like a bitch, and I should not have flipped out like that at all. And I went to the hospital immediately after that and went to Broward General, and they said I was having heart palpitations.
Do you think you should leave South Florida?
I'm not leaving down here I'm not hiding and I'm not running away. I've thought about changing my name, but I love my name. My family thinks I need to move back up there and move into that fucking house in the middle of fucking nowhere with nothing to do. It's absolutely miserable up there. I get fat. I have to stay inside all day long. And then it's winter and I like the beach and I like being away from my family.
So how do you make money down here?
I work at a few different strip clubs and I can make quick cash every night. It's just completely dances I just do dancing. I haven't leaked that out once. It's time for the world to know. I've been to every single club in Fort Lauderdale. My name was Ally at one point. Another one was Chale. I make five or six hundred dollars a night and I can't get a job because of this bullshit. It's the only thing I can do now... I go to Cheetah in Pompano. Cheetah in West Palm Beach. Pink pony. Scarlett's.
What's your mental history?
I've been Baker acted in three times. Once by my mother. Once by Nova [Southeastern University,] and once by [my boyfriend's] Sean's family. That was the third time. I was diagnosed with psychotic and bipolar disorder... I've been to rehab three times to try and correct this disability.
What comes next?
I'm thinking about Harvard Law School through the American disability act. I can't deal with all of this harassment here. It's the best school in the nation. I've already talked to them I can definitely get in. I've talked to the admissions counselor.

The building on a busy street in Cairo, close to Saudi Arabia's sparkling, oversized newly built embassy, has seen better days. Wires hang from its ceiling, its marble floors are chipped and trash is strewn across the dusty corridors. Affixed to the office door on the fourth floor is a photograph of the country's beaming Field Marshal, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The disguise isn't worth the effort now, judging by the four sinister men hanging around at the building's entrance—their menace advertising they are with state security.
“I told most of the journalists to work from home—I expect a raid soon,” says Ali Asem, the 24-year-old editor of el-Masdr (The Source), one of the few independent Egyptian media outlets left that's critical of Egypt's army-led government. Fifteen journalists work at el-Masdr but they rely on assistance from another 100 citizen reporters to file videos, pictures or copy for social media distribution.
“We have journalists at the heart of events as they take place, live reporting,” says Ali. They specialize in covering anti-army street protests and official crackdowns. As a consequence, el-Masdr reporters have been beaten and jailed themselves. Four journalists from el-Masdr, which has 40,000 Twitter followers and 283,000 fans on Facebook, have been arrested in recent weeks. All were later released, one after enduring 39 days detention and repeated beatings. “When I told them I was a citizen journalist, they just beat me more,” says 19-year-old Fadhy Samir Zakher, who was arrested in December and released 10 days ago.
Despite an international outcry, there appear to be no signs that a military crackdown on the media is abating. And el-Masdr, which was founded just before the army-led uprising toppled Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in June, is in the eye of the storm.
Last week, a judge declined to release on bail three journalists with al-Jazeera, who were seized in a raid at a Cairo hotel on December 29 while reporting for the Qatar-based network's English news channel.
All three—Egyptian-Canadian bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, Australian reporter Peter Greste, Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed—are accused along with 17 other foreign and Egyptian media workers of either being members of the Muslim Brotherhood or aiding the Islamist movement that has been outlawed and proscribed as a terrorist organization. Their trial has been adjourned to March 5. Another Al-Jazeera reporter, Abdullah el-Shamy, was jailed in August after being arrested at a protest, and is on hunger strike while awaiting the March trial.
Several of the defendants in the case are being tried in absentia, including Dutch journalist Rena Netjes and British reporters Dominic Kane and Sue Turton, both of al-Jazeera. Netjes, who appears to have come under suspicion because they visited the al-Jazeera crew at Cairo's Marriott a few days before the raid, managed to flee Egypt after the intervention of Dutch embassy officials.
For Ali, the al-Jazeera arrests were not only aimed at the Doha-headquartered channel but also mounted to intimidate local media outlets that refuse to toe the army line. The message, they think, is: if we can treat big foreign media this way, what do you think we can do to you? “The arrests were made in order to squash what is left of the independent media, which only makes up about five percent of all media now, mainly youth networks. It is the State's way of saying you have to be pro regime.”
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists Egypt is one of the top 10 worst countries for jailing journalists and the New York-based NGO considers the country the third most deadly for journalists to work in, coming behind Iraq and Syria. Five journalists were killed last year, and 45 others assaulted. Egyptian security forces raided more than a dozen news outlets in 2013. At least three journalists were tried and sentenced by military tribunals last year and handed out jail terms ranging from six months to a year.
In a scathing report this month, CPJ condemned both Morsi's toppled administration and the military-backed government for their treatment of the media. “The deeply polarized Egyptian press was battered by an array of repressive tactics throughout 2013, from the legal and physical intimidation during the tenure of former President Mohamed Morsi to the widespread censorship by the military-backed government that replaced him,” read the report.
While no fan of the Brotherhood , Ali says Morsi's rule and the army-led government can't be compared when it comes to press freedom. “It was difficult when Morsi was in power but now it is very dangerous; there is so much more violence. Journalists are targeted. We don't only work fearing injury. We fear we will be killed.”
Sitting in el-Masdr's small fourth-floor office, sparsely furnished with broken chairs and dust-covered desktops, they say: “At the time when the Brotherhood was in power we were reporting and recording their violations. Other outlets used to feature our videos but now they don't because they only feature videos that are against Morsi. What we are doing is exactly the same but this time we are covering the violations of the current security regime.”
Ali is a member of the liberal Al-Dostour Party. But they say at el-Masdr, “everyone is welcome as long as they are youth and with the 2011 revolution but aside from that their party affiliation is un-important, Islamist or liberal.”
How much longer el-Masdr will be able to soldier on remains uncertain. The noose on the media is tightening every day. On January 25, the third anniversary of the revolution that ousted longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, the security forces cracked down especially hard on media covering anti-army protests and pro-Morsi demonstrations. At least five photojournalists were arrested, and two others were hospitalized with injuries.
Among those arrested was Kareem Al-Behairi, a journalist with El-Badil newspaper. They have been charged with inciting riots. But according to a statement from the Arab Network for Human Rights Information the journalist was seized despite showing their press accreditation. The statement alleges that Al-Behairi refused to be photographed with weapons and a Molotov cocktail and the officers then “beat them violently.”
Khaled Al-Balshy, the editor of Al-Badil newspaper, says that it was “obvious security forces were targeting journalists.”
Since then arrests of local reporters have followed, normally for filming protests, although they are accused either of being Muslim Brothers or spreading lies about the security forces or the country.
“Egyptian authorities in recent months have demonstrated almost zero tolerance for any form of dissent, arresting and prosecuting journalists, demonstrators, and academics for peacefully expressing their views,” Human Rights Watch concluded in a recent report.
Dissent appears to mean not being pro-regime. And being loyal to the army-installed government apparently means not only not covering anti-government protests and the security forces breaking up of them but also not even talking with members of the now proscribed Muslim Brotherhood. The Al-Jazeera arrests have had a clear chilling effect with most foreign reporters so nervous of being seized they are avoiding having any contacts at all with the Brotherhood.
Likewise, filming on the street is being avoided by most foreign media outlets, either from fear of possible arrest or because government loyalists have a tendency of assaulting camera crews, accusing them of working for al-Jazeera.
So what drives Ali and their small team at el-Masdr and persuades them to court danger? “Our only motive is that we wan to portray the truth and we want to provide a journalism of conscience and we will report even when it goes against our own beliefs. We are committed to this.”

LONDON — Young pigs that were saved from a fire in southwest England earlier this year have been served to their rescuers as sausages by the farmer who wanted to thank the firefighters for their efforts.
The 18 piglets and two sows were rescued after an electrical fault set hay on fire at a farm in Milton Lilbourne, 70 miles west of London, in February.

And when the pigs were slaughtered, farmer Rachel Rivers said it was appropriate to give the firefighters some of the sausages to show them appreciation.
"I'm sure vegetarians will hate this," Rivers told the BBC, explaining that farming was their way of life.
"I wanted to thank them. I promised them at the time I'd bring down some sausages for them, which they were all pleased about."
A spokesperson for the fire service said the sausages were "fantastic" and thanked Rivers for their generosity. The fire service later told NBC News that, "we recognize that this story has caused offense to some — we apologize for this and such have removed the post."
Germany's Minister of Family Affairs is asking for the sum of €100 million from the German government to tackle right wing extremism in the wake of the incidents in Clausnitz, Saxony that have made headlines across Germany. The request would double the current annual budget for dealing with so called “right wing” incidents and those who espouse anti-migrant beliefs.
Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Manuela Schwesig (pictured), a member of the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), wants to increase the funding for a specific program called “Living Democracy – Active against right violence and enmity”. It is described on its website as a program to encourage diversity and democratic coexistence. The program, scheduled to last from 2015 to 2019, works with regional and local governments and schools to educate children and adults about right wing ideas and how to stop them.
Much of the funding goes directly to governments but national scale non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will each be given €200,000 to develop what they call a “nationwide infrastructure” of education.
The about section of the program website lays out it's purpose saying: “Attacks on democracy, freedom and rule of law and ideologies of inequality are permanent challenges for society.” It targets “right-wing extremism, racism and antisemitism, the challenges posed by Islamophobia, anti-Gypsyism, ultra-nationalism, homophobia” and says “to counter them forcefully, it will take a concerted effort by government and civil society.”
One of the more interesting parts of the website is the so-called “diversity library”. Under a broad range of topics from nationalism and anti-migrant attitudes, to Islamophobia and trans/homophobia, it contains various .pdf format books and brochures designed to educate Germans on how to be more tolerant and diverse.
Some of the texts range from rather ordinary, like how to tell if right-wing people are leasing space in your restaurant to “Living and Working in the Migration society” which is designed to make Germans recognise that their country will be house migrants for the foreseeable future and that they must learn to adapt to it.
While the SPD is asking for more funds to fight against anti-migrant sentiment, the Green Party has taken it a step further. Leader Anton Hofreiter wants to see more legal cases being brought about against anyone deemed to be “xenophobic” agitators. “We can't have no-go areas in Germany, and no one should be made to feel inhuman by threats or attacks,” they told German paper Neue Osnabrueker Zeitung. They also said that without action against right wing supporters the government will have failed to uphold its responsibility.
Breitbart London reported that media in Austria had already labelled the Clausnitz protesters as “xenophobic” and said that the popular “We are the People” slogan should be classified as hate speech. Media in Germany has been outraged by the protest though there were no reports of violence by protesters or by police during or after the incident.
Williams, 30, appreciated the Seahawks' honesty and eventually signed a three-year, $18 million deal that all but assures they will be the starting corner opposite Richard Sherman this season.
RENTON — When cornerback Cary Williams visited Seattle on their free-agency tour this offseason, the Seahawks shot holes in their game.
They told them all the customary niceties, of course, such as why their height and aggressiveness were a good fit. But they also pointed out their flaws, such as their occasional false steps in press coverage that have left them vulnerable.
“It could have easily been a recruiting process: ‘Hey, we kiss your butt, come on in here and sign up and we're going to be great,' ” Seahawks defensive coordinator Kris Richard said. “But no, when guys come here, they need to know that our focus is to truly be your best, and you may not like what we have to say all the time, but the intent is to make you better.”
Williams, 30, appreciated the Seahawks' honesty and eventually signed a three-year, $18 million deal that all but assures they will be the ' starting corner opposite Richard Sherman this season (Williams is guaranteed $7 million, all in the first year).
“You already know as a player some of the good things you do,” Williams said, “but I think the most important thing is trying to get better and understanding what elements can help you get better and reach that level.”
Williams said they can improve in all areas, but perhaps the most important adjustment they will have to make is learning the Seahawks' press-coverage technique.
They teach their corners a technique called the “step-kick”, and it works much like it sounds. Many receivers dance at the line to throw defensive backs off balance, but the Seahawks want their corners to take one “step” at the snap, then wait until the receiver makes a definitive move up field before “kicking” with their other leg. The concept is similar to a defender in basketball guarding a player crossing over but going nowhere.
A corner who bites on fakes can take “false steps” and get thrown off balance or out of position. What the Seahawks demand more than anything is patience, and as basic as it might sound, it goes against human nature to stand there surrounded by so much sensory overload.
Williams is a savvy veteran but still needs detailed refinement.
“He's used it before in the past, just been a little inconsistent,” Richard said. “We're not talking anything that they haven't done before.”
The man Williams will replace is Byron Maxwell, who teammates called a “technician” because they were so precise with the step-kick technique.
Williams has the physical tools to slide right in, as well as the pedigree.  They are tall and enjoys playing aggressive press coverage, and they have been the starting corner on a Super Bowl-winning team (the 2012 Ravens). But for Williams to truly assimilate with the Seahawks, they must become a student of technique.
“It's more attention to detail,” they said. “They talk about being more patient. It's a lot of intricate things that's a lot different than other places.”

On Sept. 27, three days before the government shutdown, President Obama showed up in the White House briefing room with big news. They had just spoken to the president of Iran—the first words between leaders of the two countries since 1979, when Iranian demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took dozens of Americans hostage. Obama pledged to resolve U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy. But they took a harder line with their domestic opponents. Discussions about revising the Affordable Care Act “will not happen under the threat of a shutdown,” said the president. As to the debt ceiling, they added: “I will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to pay the bills that have already been racked up.”
Republicans erupted at this treatment. “POTUS negotiates with #Iran, Putin but not Congress,” tweeted the chief spokesperson for House Speaker John Boehner. The House majority whip, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., asked why Obama would “talk to the president of Iran, talk to Putin, but won't sit here and talk to the representatives of the American people.” Fox News host Sean Hannity fumed, “The president will talk to Syria, Iran, Vladimir Putin, but they won't talk to members of the House.”
In the week since that ruckus, Republicans have fixed this problem. They've decided to behave more like Iran. Not the Iran of 2013, but the Iran of 1979. They've taken parts of the government hostage, and now they're releasing some the hostages, expecting to win praise and concessions.
If you reread the history of the Iran hostage crisis, starting with Congress' official chronology of it, you'll see patterns of resemblance. Soon after seizing the U.S. and British embassies, the Iranians adjusted their demands. First they said we had to extradite the deposed shah, who had come to the U.S. for cancer treatment. Then they said we only had to declare them a criminal. Then we only had to authorize an international investigation. But the U.S. held firm. The State Department refused to “negotiate under” the threat. “Only after the hostages are released will we be willing to address Iran's concerns,” said President Carter.
Iran's leaders accused the U.S. of intransigence and ignoring their gestures. They claimed that the public was on their side. They blamed the U.S. for raising tensions. To prove their good will, they freed some captives. First the Iranians who had stormed the British Embassy withdrew. Then the regime put out word that on “humanitarian” grounds, it would release U.S. Embassy employees, mostly Asian, who had no “connection with the United States.” A week or so into the standoff, Iran's leaders came up with another idea: As a public relations gambit, they would release blacks and women.
Members of Iran's ruling council insisted they had never wanted this confrontation. Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the acting foreign minister, said that they and others had warned Ayatollah Khomeini that holding the captives would look bad and hurt Iran politically. “I was against taking hostages from the start,” said Bani-Sadr, but “now we are confronted with a fait accompli.” The moderates, trapped by their base, needed President Carter to bail them out. “To free [the hostages] would be a sign of weakness,” Bani-Sadr pleaded. Doing so “without the American government taking a step would be impossible. Our public opinion would not stand it.” The minister claimed that Khomeini had told him, “I can't move in that direction contrary to public opinion.”
So the Iranians freed the hostages they deemed most useful for PR. “Islam has got a lot of respect for women, and we consider blacks to be oppressed people,” the foreign ministry explained. Tehran radio quoted Khomeini: “Islam has a special respect towards women, and the blacks who have spent ages under American pressure and tyranny and may have come to Iran under pressure.” The regime and the captors tried to turn Americans against their president. At a press conference to announce the release, a sign was posted: “American blacks, our common enemy is President Carter.”
In their order to free the hostages, Khomeini invoked “Islamic mercy.” They gave interviews to several TV networks, portraying themselves as more than reasonable. “We have reduced our demands,” they told ABC. Although the Americans were “spies,” they asserted, Iran might release them, in exchange for the shah, as “a kind gesture on our part.” As to the standoff, they told CBS, “It is Carter's doing. We are against war.” Iran's news conference announcing the release was staged to blame Carter. One of the hostages was shown on TV saying, “We feel that if this issue was resolved by the president of the United States, the rest of the hostages would be released.”
Today, we're talking about funding public agencies, not freeing people who are literally held captive. But the tactics are strikingly similar. Republicans began with a big grab—shutting down the whole government—and are now offering to return parts of what they took, bill by bill, in exchange for concessions and the appearance of moderation. “You're seeing House Republicans over and over again passing reasonable bills to open vital government services, and President Obama and the Democrats refusing to negotiate,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argued Sunday. “It is Republicans in Congress who are passing bills to reopen the parks, to reopen the memorials, to fund cancer research, to fund our veterans.” Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican whip, pointed out that “the House has passed a provision to open up NIH.” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., pleaded:
We've been trying to fund different parts of government all week. We've passed bill after bill. … We've been passing NIH funding, veterans funding. … We've proposed several compromises. Our initial position, and still our position, is we think Obamacare is a bad idea and will hurt the people it was intended to help. But when that didn't pass, when the Democrats didn't accept that, we said, “Well, what about a one-year delay?” We've been offering compromise after compromise. But you hear from the president and their men and their women, “No negotiation.” Their way or the highway.
Thanks for relinquishing some of those hostages, gentlemen. But they weren't yours to take in the first place. You don't get to choose which of them go free. Release them, all of them, now.

Who has the president's ear? Who's hitting the links with the commander in chief? And who's on the outside looking in? The official White House visitor logs keep a record of who sees the president and their staff — but they don't tell the whole story.
POLITICO's Unauthorized White House Visitor Logs stand in for the official record, which the administration has decided not to release publicly.
To build a better, completely public visitor log, we compiled not just visits to the White House, but interactions that include in-person meetings with the president at Mar-a-Lago and other venues, appearances at events and documented phone calls with foreign leaders and other politicians.

Here's what we know so far (Read the story!):
MANILA, Philippines - The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) probe of the alleged bullet planting scam at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) has been delayed because officials of the concerned agencies have not made themselves available, an official said yesterday.
The NBI task force has yet to interview officials of various agencies involved in airport operations and gather all the data it needs for its report, which was due on Nov. 18, Justice Undersecretary and spokesperson Emmanuel Caparas said.
They added that this is the main reason why the NBI team was given another 15 working days or until Dec. 14 to finish its fact-finding probe.
“The people in offices involved have their own obligations, duties and functions. I wouldn't say they were uncooperative. It's just about timing,” they explained in an interview.
Caparas said the NBI team will then continue to conduct interviews and track down the alleged victims of the reported scam.
They added that Justice Secretary Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa wants a comprehensive report – even if the trail leads to prominent figures.
Caparas also clarified that the government is not downplaying the bullet planting incidents in the airport following reported statement of President Aquino last week that the issue has been “sensationalized,” supposedly for the benefit of certain groups.
Caparas said the President never downplayed the incidents and in fact wanted a speedy resolution.
Caparas earlier told The STAR that the NBI is looking into the possibility that the incidents are part of a plot to sabotage or discredit the administration, supposedly in relation to next year's general elections.
Aquino pointed out that only about 1,200 out of 34 million passengers every year have been apprehended for possession of ammunition at the NAIA.
NEW YORK (AP) — Matthew McConaughey, who's getting praise from critics for their role in the new movie "Mud," says he's found a way to make negative reviews a positive learning experience.
McConaughey won best supporting male actor at the Independent Spirit Awards for 2012's "Magic Mike." They also received the best supporting actor honor for "Magic Mike" and "Bernie" at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards.
But there have been some misses for the 43-year-old actor, who cemented their romantic leading man status in 2003's "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" opposite Kate Hudson. Critics panned "Failure to Launch," ''Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" and "Fools Gold."
"A few years ago, I did a really interesting kind of experiment," McConaughey said.
"My assistants gathered every negative review I've ever had and it was a good, thick pile. I sat down and said, 'We're gonna read every one of these.' There was some really good constructive criticism. I'm like, 'That's what I would've said about that performance. You're right.'"
They said it's most rewarding to read a review where they and the critic agree about what they were trying to convey in a performance.
"What's nice is when you read a review and ... it's almost exactly what I wrote down before I ever did the picture of what I was tryin', who I thought the guy was. So I go, 'Ah, it translated.' The word was never spoken but they got that out of the performance."
In "Mud," McConaughey plays a fugitive who befriends two teen boys in Arkansas who help them try to reunite with their long-lost love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), while also hiding out from the authorities.
McConaughey, who married longtime girlfriend Camila Alves last June (the couple have three children), said they were drawn to the way Mud loves Juniper.
"The love they have for this woman is a very simple thing," they said. "I just hung my hat on (it). Didn't matter if they loved them back or not. They didn't love them any less ever. ... This man has a passionate love for somebody as passionate as it was the first three hours and that just doesn't really happen in real life real often. You can say it does, but it's pretty tough to keep that light burnin' like that."
"Mud," directed by Jeff Nichols, opens in theaters Friday.

E3 is the foremost video game convention in the world, with more games on the show floor than you can possibly play during the three-day event. Given we're now in the second year of the latest round of consumer VR headsets, it's no surprise that there were dozens of VR games at this year's show, but none excited me as much as Doom VFR.
It Just Feels Right
The biggest draw for me is that Doom VFR feels like, well, Doom. It's fast, it's frantic and it's all about the movement. Granted there's no full locomotion, but the teleportation plus quick dash combo works really well, and it feels like Doom should feel. Using the trackpad to do quick dashes, I could even circle strafe around demons, dodging their fireballs in the process.
Entering teleportation also added a unique gameplay twist as the action slowed down around me, allowing me to dodge incoming projectiles and quickly turn to take out the lumbering and plentiful hellspawn. It didn't feel cheap, and it was even welcomed and sometimes necessary when I would get surrounded by a half-dozen mobs at once.
I also really appreciate that the id designers thought of the locomotion system as not only a means to get from point A to point B, but also as a gameplay element. During my demo I telefragged into dozens of wounded enemies and watched in delight as they gibbed around me. It was really a great sense of accomplishment to pull off in a horde, and fit in perfectly with the quick-timing twitchy gameplay Doom is known for.
Add that fast-paced gameplay with fantastic frame rate and what was the best VR graphics at the show and you have a top-notch experience that looks as good as it feels.
Not Too Long, Not Too Short
I've seen a few folks complain about the length of Doom VFR, but to me, four to five hours sounds just about perfect. Yes, I'm really looking forward to spending time in Fallout 4's wasteland and taking down numerous dragons in Skyrim, but I don't know if I want to spend 60+ hours in a single VR experience – that's just not what VR is, for me. When I'm in VR, I like short but dense play sessions, and that describes my time with Doom VFR at E3 to a tee.
It's %#*&ing Doom
While parts of Doom VFR are from the 2016 remake, it's mostly built from the ground-up specifically for VR, but that doesn't mean it strays from the Doom formula. All the monsters, power-ups, environments, jump pads and guns you'd expect in Doom are here. And while the mechanics may be a bit of a departure, like I said earlier, it just feels right. Blood, gore and demons galore – this is unapologetically Doom, right down to the effing name. This is virtual %#*&ing reality!
Bethesda and id really have come a long way since first debuting Doom VFR last year, and what was little more than a tech demo 12 months ago looks, feels and plays great today. It's supposed to be out later this year on both Vive and PSVR, so you shouldn't have to wait too much longer to try it for yourself.

I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watching Me
Last week, it was revealed that the United States government is creating electronic dossiers on its citizens. This presents a stark contrast with our traditions where law enforcement and national security personnel peered solely into the lives of individuals intent on doing us harm, not the population writ large. Rather than doing the investigative legwork necessary to convince a neutral third party that such snooping is warranted and reasonable, the government argues that it is perfectly legitimate to create such dossiers and obtain warrants to read them only after it has discovered information that it considers interesting. Of course, given that the government holds the keys to the proverbial file cabinet, it doesn't really matter whether some third party agrees that the government ought to be able to read the contents of the files contained therein. Further, how would anyone outside the government really know whether their file has been read? Therein lies the crux of the problem.
On Friday, President Obama proclaimed that if we do not trust the Executive Branch (aka President Obama) and we do not trust Congress (after they finished telling us how awful they are) and we do not trust the courts (that informed me I am responsible for paying for Sandra Fluke's birth control though in their case I will pay happily) "we are going to have a serious problem." Well heck yes Mr. President, we do have a serious problem!
We have learned that the NSA is collecting Americans' phone records, emails, audio and video chats, transferred files and credit card records. If news reports are accurate, the data is so refined that the NSA is even capturing keystrokes as they are typed. This is in addition to an administration that is capturing Americans' health records and will begin to capture information concerning Americans' driving habits beginning next year. If liberals had their way, the administration would begin capturing information about gun ownership as well. This data is in addition to the copious financial records collected by the IRS. We are told the NSA data snooping program has helped stop terrorist attacks. Yet, with all this information, it took an astute street vendor to prevent a bomb from exploding in Times Square. Two terrorists who managed to kill and injure scores in Boston, hid out for one week within one mile of the explosions only to be discovered by a guy who left their house for a smoke!
Consequently, many are concerned about the amount of information the federal government is accumulating about the behavior of law abiding American citizens and the potential for abuse. We are witnessing this abuse unfold with the IRS targeting of President Obama's political adversaries. There are reports that the administration may have targeted CIA Director General David Petraeus, a critic of the administration's policy in Libya. NSA employees may have eavesdropped on individuals with whom they had personal grudges. During Congressional testimony, Attorney General Eric Holder refused to answer in an open hearing whether the NSA targeted members of Congress as part of their surveillance program.
President Obama suggested recently that “you can't have 100% security and 100% privacy.” Perhaps that is true. On the other hand, in their dissent of a recent Supreme Court case that upheld Maryland's collection and storage of prisoner DNA unrelated to solving the particular crime for which the prisoner was charged, Justice Antonin Scalia noted:
"Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason. This will solve some extra crimes, to be sure. But so would taking your DNA whenever you fly on an airplane ... (or) taking your children's DNA when they start public school."
Justice Scalia may have been summoning their inner Benjamin Franklin:
”Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.”
Several months ago, I published a column on this blog about the Orwellian nature of the Obama Administration. The Obama Presidency - George Orwell's 1984 Redux. Allowing the federal government to maintain a database of our DNA, blow a gush of air beneath our skirts when we board an airplane and know all manner of our personal private information may help the government predict future crime. Then again as the Times Square attempted bombing and the Boston Marathon bombings demonstrated, it may not. What it will do is allow the government to increase its control over our lives.
At Ohio State University, President Obama suggested that some will “warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.” I agree. Justice Scalia concluded:
"It may be wise, as the court obviously believes, to make the Leviathan all-seeing, so that they may protect us all the better. But the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would not have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection."
Count me among those men!
The Ducks have recalled goaltender Jason LaBarbera from the Norfolk Admirals, Anaheim's primary development affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL).
LaBarbera, 35 (1/18/80), has gone 2-0-1 with a 2.61 goals-against average (GAA) and .909 save percentage (SV%) in five games with the Ducks this season. Recalled from Norfolk on Nov. 2, LaBarbera stopped 16-of-18 shots en route to a 3-2 win in their Anaheim debut that night at Colorado. They have appeared in 187 career NHL games, going 62-73-20 with six shutouts, a 2.85 GAA and .907 SV% with the NY Rangers, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Phoenix, Edmonton and Anaheim.
Selected by the New York Rangers in the third round (66th overall) of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, LaBarbera went 7-10-4 record with two shutouts, a 2.42 GAA and .917 SV% in 22 games with Norfolk this season. At the time of their recall, LaBarbera led Norfolk goaltenders in wins, saves (566), minutes (1,266) and appearances, and co-led in shutouts. The 6-2, 246-pound goaltender was signed as a free agent on July 1, 2014.
Last week when we at Defending Big D along with the rest of the network of hockey blogs around SB Nation started doing this series of ways we as bloggers and fans of this great game would improve the experience for fans, it took me a while to actually think of what could be done to enhance the enjoyment I get out of a game that quite honestly I already obsess over more than what should be considered healthy - even for a Canadian. But I started to think that as a Dallas Stars fan living in the city of Edmonton, it would be so very nice to have one section of every NHL rink set aside for fans of the visiting team, only to see that Travis Hughes over at Broad Street Hockey already expanded on that idea and probably put it into better words than I could.
So with that option take away, my mind focused to the one other aspect of the game I'd like to see changed: The shootout.
More specificilly, the fact the players still wear their helmets when taking part in the shootout.
Uhhh... Why?
It's something I've never quite figured out. Players around the league (such as Mike Ribeiro in the picture) will go helmet-less in the pre-game skate. A pre-game skate consists of pretty much all 40 players from both teams dressed for the upcoming game on the ice all at once skating in circles with about 40 pucks at their disposal to pass around, whip at boards and shoot on goalies with.
I know I can't claim to know what it's like being on the ice for a pro level pre-game skate, but if it's anything close to what it's like to be taking part in a beer league pre-game skate, lets just say that personally once the pre-game skate is over I feel a lot safer knowing there are three times fewer players on the ice and only one puck to worry about.
And yet come time for the shootout, everyone has a lid. The one point in the entire night where a player doesn't have to worry about being decked by anyone coming from a blind side, not have to worry about the puck hitting them in the face - because if the puck hits you the shooter in the face during the shootout chance, you've probably done it wrong - and there they are with brain buckets on and usually a visor on top of that like some robotic gladiator.
I know safety in the game is a concern especially when it comes to head injuries but c'mon, these guys are pros so the chances of them fouling up so badly that their head hits the ice or boards in a shootout attempt are less than that of an errant puck flying off a post during the pregame skate and striking them upside the noggin.
You want a cheap and easy way to market the game NHL? Get these guys (just the shooters of course, goalies would be welcome to partake as well, but lets not get too crazy) to take their helmets off during the shootout. Most of the players in the league today are pretty good looking.. err... so I have been told by my girlfriend and various other female friends. And with HDTVs (especially Samsung HDTVs.. see what I did there?) being as sharp and clear as they are, the fans at home especially get to see the looks on these players faces from the moment they focus before they take their shot to the expression on their face when they score or are stopped cold.
Hockey fans dig seeing players faces - even the ugly ones - so leave the helmets on the bench and give the fans an enhanced visual in the shootout! Just, not too much of an enhanced visual experience like the Tampa Bay Lightning had... We wanna keep this product rated PG after all.
Page File It all sounds like a beautiful love story. A man in forbidden love with an android robot sets out on a quest to find and reassemble them after she's kidnapped and stripped down for parts. But Love in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction is a gruesome, grotesque noir story of a dismal future, where half of the world is considered disposable by the other half.
Set – where else? – in LA, Judd Trichter's debut novel mixes noir classics – the old good cop and their brash new sidekick, the man on the path of vengeance, lots of sexualised and graphic violence – with a typical dystopian future of robots and societal breakdown.
Eliot Lazar is the man in love with a spinner, so-called because of their clockwork hearts, and so desperate after she's torn down for a quick buck that they embark on a potentially lethal campaign of more than dubious morality to get them back.
But this is not an unthinking ride through blood-spattered streets. What makes Eliot interesting is that they know their quest is amoral and they spend a lot of time wondering if it's all worth it. People say they'd do anything for love, but Eliot really does do anything for the love of Iris and there's more than a question mark over what that does to Eliot and Iris.
It's pretty clear at the start of the book who the good guys and the bad guys are. The good guys are those who reckon androids deserve something close to equal rights and the bad guys are the users and abusers of robots who treat them worse than toasters.
But as the book progresses, those lines get blurred until even Eliot is willing to try to use the differences between heartbeats and spinners as an excuse to get what they want:
“After all, bots aren't like us. They don't feel pain the way we do. Their hearts don't beat, they spin. They don't have souls, just parts and experiences that balance together to create an aura.”
This is particularly true when Eliot is taking back parts of Iris that have gone to other bots. Because of the kind of android they are, their personality won't exist unless she's made up of the same parts, replacements won't do. However, when their parts go into the same kind of robot, removing them effectively kills that new personality too. Eliot wants to believe that he's the romantic hero, but that image suffers more and more as the quest goes on.
There are huge questions here, about love, oppression and what it means to be a person, that Trichter dances around, leaving the reader to draw their own conclusions. There's also a hell of a lot of Grand Theft Auto/LA noir style sex and violence that just about scrapes past being gratuitous and an entertaining dash around dystopian future Los Angeles that keeps you guessing until the end about whether Eliot will succeed in their quest or not – or whether they should. ®
Image caption Royal Navy divers had a first look at the rocket's tail on Thursday morning
A German V2 rocket from World War II has been found nose down in the mud flats at Harwich Harbour.
Royal Navy divers said it was buried vertically with about 1.5m (5ft) of its tail exposed at low tide.
Bomb disposal teams will look at the rocket at low tide on Friday as they try to work out how much more is buried and if it is still dangerous.
The discovery of the rocket was reported to Essex Police by a local sailing club.
A Royal Navy diving team arrived at the site on Wednesday evening but could not get near it until Thursday morning.
At low tide, the team said, it was about 200m (656ft) from the shore near Harwich Yacht Club.
'Demanding job'
Lt Dan Herridge, who was there with the Royal Navy diving team, said: "We coupled our images together with some documents we have and got a second opinion from our technical information centre and were able to confirm it as a section of a V2 rocket."
Image caption The V2 rocket was 46 ft (14m) long
The V2, which was used by the Germans from 1944, was 46ft (14m) long, but until it can be excavated, the bomb disposal teams have no idea how much is left or whether the explosive tip is still attached.
Lt Herridge said: "We've got as deep as we can and have called for more resources to excavate further and ascertain whether there are any aspects of the weapon which pose a danger to public safety.
"It's going to be a logistically demanding job and we've got about an hour either side of low-tide, but there are various options, methods and equipment that we can use to extend that, but that's something we're going to look into."
The Army's Royal Engineers are due to arrive with excavating equipment.
A spokesperson for Essex Police said: "Appropriate action will be taken when bomb disposal experts have finished their excavation."
Very often we come across a situation when we need to answer or to make an important call but there is no way we can do this, mainly, because of several reasons: first of all, we don't want to bother people nearby, second of all, we don't want them to tap our conversation. Now there is a solution how to avoid such inconveniences: Hushme - personal acoustic device that will help you to protect speech privacy in open space environments.
After our participation at CES 2017 and Wearable Technology Show:
Apart from the normal headset mode, Hushme has two more modes: passive and active.
In the normal headset mode, Hushme connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and you can use it as hands-free headset while speaking on the phone or listening to music.
In the passive voice muffling mode, Hushme is locked over the mouth using magnetic coupling. This mode is provided by the innovative insulation materials, that are embedded inside the mask, by the extra soft cushion muffs and by the special sound-absorbing paint, that covers the whole inner surface of the device. So, people at the distance of 3 feet cannot decipher your words, while your speech is transmitted to the other end undistorted thanks to sensitive built-in microphone.
The cushion muffs are replaceable, so you can remove it in order to clean or to replace with new muffs.
The size-adjusting system allows setting up the right size of the mask so it could fit any face.
The active voice masking mode is provided by the electronics, which is located in the headband, and by the proprietary algorithms. Pressing the button activates the outer speakers, that are located on the perimeter of the mask, - these speakers will generate masking sounds.
According to the research by American Speech-Language-Hearing Associacion, the volume of a normal speech is 50-60 dB. Thanks to the insulating properties of its body, Hushme in passive mode is capable to lower some to 25 dB. Thus, the volume of the resulting sound using the mask will be approximately 25-30 dB, which corresponds to a whisper or noise level in a quiet library. Still one can decipher a whisper too if one wants to eavesdrop on you. In this case, we recommend using the active voice masking mode.
In the active voice masking mode, 4 speakers located on the outer surface of the device are activated, and the mask starts to produce a preset sound. A special algorithm modulates this sound relative to the intensity of your voice: the mask "is silent" when you are silent, it raises or lowers the volume or pauses completely following your voice. This masking sound adds approximately 12 dB. Thus, the resulting noise when using the active mode will be approximately 35-40 dB, which corresponds to the noise level in a quiet room.
Finally, for maximum efficiency of the device, we recommend lowering the voice when you speak over the phone using Hushme, then you will ultimately protect your speech privacy and still will be heard perfectly well on the other end.
Hushme uses dedicated App to synchronize with your smart phone, which enables you to choose masking sounds from the library, upload your customized sounds, adjust volume, etc.
The sounds of rain, wind and ocean are downloaded into the device by default.
The volume and the intensity of the masking sounds directly depends on the pace, rhythm and volume of your speech.
But, in any case, the output noise is lower in volume than the incoming speech.
The device can also be used as a powerful wireless speaker that allows you to enjoy the music.

Story
Back in 2015, three friends: CEO, CFO and CIO of a leading Ukrainian food company, were sitting in a café downtown Kiev and came across the problem of speech privacy protection. A lady next to them was trying to speak via Skype with a business partner of theirs but at some point they ceased it as they realized that people around unintentionally overheard them conversation. This is how they came up with the idea of a personal acoustic device protecting speech privacy when speaking over the phone. Later on, in early 2016, the three friends met the core team of ARTKB - a renowned Ukrainian hardware development bureau, which helped to produce and deliver to backers such successful products as iblazr 1, iblazr 2, eCozy, Hideez (Safeband).
Together they founded Hushme Inc. and started working on the world's first voice mask aka Hushme. The company is registered in Dover, DE and the main office is based there, but R&D will remain in Ukraine. Hushme prototype in the form factor of a wireless round-the-neck headset was first presented at CES 2017 and stirred a lot of interest among market professionals and general public.
Timeline
The main goal of our device - is to cover human needs connected with phone call privacy. We are confident, that many people will appreciate this. Which is why, we believe that the launch of this Kickstarter campaign will help us to find even more like-minded people, who would consider Hushme to be beneficial and state-of-the-art gadget.
We`ve already managed to develop a working prototype with electronics, currently we are hard at work upon implementation of additional improvements and we really need your support.

Know Before You Go
What to Wear You'll need to have a swimsuit to enter the pool area. We may choose to check men's shorts for a lining if we can't tell if they are wearing a bathing suit. Feel the need to cover up from the sun? Throw on a plain white shirt or white hat and you're set. We don't allow shirts with colors on them on the deck. Information for Parents Thinking of bringing floaties? It's safer to leave them at home and just stay in the shallow end of the pool until everyone learns to swim. Want to venture deeper? Try some of our free swimming classes. Babies or toddlers can put on swim diapers before they head into the water. While we may be able to find a place to park your stroller, we can't keep an eye on it for you, so bring it at your own risk. What to Bring Make sure you have a sturdy lock when you head out to the pool. It will keep your valuables safe, and let you hit the water feeling more secure about your belongings. Locks are required to enter, and we will not accept luggage locks. What Not to Bring You'll need to leave food, glass bottles, electronic devices, and newspapers at home. Unbound periodicals tend to blow around and create litter, food can be messy to clean up after, and there's too much water around to make sure your electronics stay safe. Just to be on the safe side, we also recommend leaving valuables like jewelry and credit cards at home.

The History of Parks' Swimming Pools
A student newspaper at the University of Cape Town has prompted outrage after conducting a poll to determine the “most attractive race”.
The survey of 60 students – 10 each of whom described themselves as white, Indian, East Asian, mixed race, black or “coloured”, was carried out by student Qamran Tabo to go alongside an article they wrote for Varsity newspaper entitled “Is Love Colour Blind?”
It recorded that 38 per cent of students thought whites were the most “attractive” race, followed by coloureds, and Indians. The lowest percentage by race was blacks, with eight per cent of votes.
The poll prompted calls for a full apology from the newspaper. The Young Communist League of South Africa's UCT branch lodged a complaint with South Africa's Human Rights Commission, saying the article incited racial division and caused psychological harm to students.
As well as an apology for publishing such “filth”, it called on the university to dedicate a month to a “race relations building” programme among its students.
“The article and its alleged survey were always leading to inculcate a culture of one race being the jewel of all others. It is despicable to read,” it said in a statement.
UCT's Student Representative Council said greater sensitivity should have been shown to an issue that had “painful historical significance”.
Outside the university, those who voiced their disapproval included the celebrated human rights activist Zackie Achmat, who tweeted that it was “racist nonsense”
Frans Cronje, of the South African Institute of Race Relations, said the survey was not racist.
“Funny how the sometime proponents of free speech change when they don't like what is said,” they said. “The survey simply reflects what we see in the media and advertising.”
Alexandra Nagel, Varsity's editor-in-chief, issued a qualified apology to anyone who was offended but stressed that the article and survey was in the paper's opinion section so should not be taken as fact.
“I am aware of the controversy surrounding the sensitivity of race and I understand that the right to freedom of expression has its limits when used unnecessarily to discriminate against others, slandering religion, race, sexuality,” they said. “However, Varsity feels that the writer was not abusing this right nor had the intention of issuing an attack on individual racial groups, but simply pinpointing a matter that is still affecting the lives of South Africans.”

More than a dozen factory farms producing dairy and meat products for stores nationwide engaged in widespread organic fraud for years as the USDA stood idly by, an agriculture industry watchdog said on Thursday.
A months-long investigation by the Cornucopia Institute discovered that 14 farms around the country producing so-called organic products have been defying USDA regulations, keeping animals tightly packed in facilities with no real access to the outdoors, while federal management routinely ignored pressure to investigate conditions.
The institute filed suit against those farms on Thursday and called on the USDA to remove the industry management body, the National Organic Program.
Organic fraud is "unconscionable," said Mark A. Kastel, Cornucopia senior farm policy analyst. "The job of the USDA is to oversee the certifiers and ensure that they are doing their job. It is quite possible that, in this case, there could have been a conspiracy and/or negligence that the certifier was responsible for."
After what the Cornucopia Institute called "years of inaction" by the USDA, the watchdog group conducted an independent investigation into the conditions of a number of farms currently creating products for labels that market themselves as humane, environmentally conscious, and economically fair.
None of them passed muster.
Current organic rules dictate that animals designated as organic must have their "health and natural behavior" accommodated, allowing cows to graze and chickens to roam. Among the farms named in Cornucopia Institute's lawsuit is Horizon Dairy, a grocery store staple that depicts a happy, animated cow as its logo; but aerial photographs taken during Cornucopia's investigation show that Horizon farms, as well as the "vast majority" of large-scale farms that label themselves organic, "had 100% of their animals confined in giant buildings or feedlots," conditions which violate federal standards for organic farms, the institute says.
Other well-known brands whose dairies failed to measure up in Cornucopia's investigation were Herbruck's and Organic Valley.
"The federal organic regulations make it very clear that all organic livestock must have access to the outdoors and that ruminants, like dairy cows, must have access to pasture," Kastel said.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
With the organic industry expanding in response to increased desire for more natural products and humane treatment of animals, consumers are likely to feel deceived to learn of the real conditions on those farms, Kastel added. "Shoppers, who passionately support the ideals and values represented by the organic label, understandably feel betrayed when they see photos of these massive CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) masquerading as organic."
This is not the first time that Horizon, or other brands named in the suit, have been in trouble for skirting regulations. Some of its largest dairy providers are still being investigated by the USDA for "improprieties."
But federal oversight is still inadequate, often taking years to respond to complaints and review appeals from dairies that continue operating illegally in the interim, Cornucopia says—actions which diminish profits for legitimate farms nearby.
"The inaction by the USDA places thousands of ethical family-scale farmers, who are competing with a couple of dozen giant dairies, at a competitive disadvantage,” said Kevin Engelbert, an organic dairy farmer and former member of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), a citizen advisory panel. "Allowing these illegal dairies to continue to operate is a travesty and significantly undercuts the supply-demand dynamic that should be rewarding farmers in the marketplace and providing a decent living for our families."
The criticism against the USDA does not stop at inaction against illegal operators. The agency also restricted the oversight responsibilities of the NOSB and weakened rules for the use of synthetic ingredients in organic food production, Cornucopia says.
Many of those farms are denying that any impropriety exists. "A single photo doesn't really tell us anything about a farm and its practices," Sonja Tuitele, a spokesperson for Aurora Organic Dairy, told the Washington Post. "Our records do indicate that all of our lactating cows at the Coldwater facility were grazing on pastures on May 17th. Since we don't know what time of day this photo was taken, we can only assume this photo was taken outside of their daily grazing hours."
Jay Feldman, executive director of Beyond Pesticides and member of the NOSB, called the current situation "untenable."
They added, "Someone needs to take responsibility for the divide in this industry which has begun seriously undercutting the credibility of the organic label and the livelihoods of ethical organic farmers."
Do you have a really hard time getting away from your phone? Why do we find it so hard to put down our phones? I'll give you 5 reasons drawn directly from psychological theories on how we learn, how teenagers are strongly affected by reward and how we are all drawn in by mystery. There is of course no easy answer for how to get teens to put down their phones but I'll share what I'm doing and I invite you to share your thoughts on this topic in the comments below.

5 Key Ideas from Psychology on Why You Can't Put Down Your Phone
Variable Interval Reinforcement : One of B.F. Skinner's methods of getting rats and pigeons to learn (also works with humans). You never know when you'll get a reward. You don't necessarily have to do anything (you could just stand around and wait) but eventually you'll get a reward. This happens with our phones. Eventually you'll get pinged and you'll check your phone. Sometimes the ping will signal a reward so you'll check your phone again.

Eventually you'll get pinged and you'll check your phone. Sometimes the ping will signal a reward so you'll check your phone again. Variable Ratio Reinforcement : the stronger way to get you to repeatedly do something is to reward you not every time you do something, but after you do the behavior an uncertain number of times. Gambling is the best example. You have to keep putting coins into a slot machine – but you never know when you might win. For our phones: you have to do something – like create a text or upload an image or a video – and you never know when exactly you'll get rewarded (such as a friend seeing it, liking it or telling you how great it is).

Teens get a more powerful sense of pleasure from these rewards than adults do. Thankfully, this means that as we get older we'll find our phones less compelling.

The Teenage Years: a Time of Exploration : according to Erik Erikson, teens are in the “Identity vs. Role Confusion stage and they are actively trying to figure out who they are and where they fit in. They are also naturally afraid of missing out on social events (FOMO). Their cell phone and the internet in general hold this kind of important information for them.

Mystery: all of us are drawn in by the unknown and the incomplete. We naturally feel a strong need to resolve mysteries and to solve puzzles. Very often we're drawn to our phones because of headlines like “You'll never believe what happens next…”. It's very hard to resist.

What Can Parents Do?
Islander fans (and one Edmonton Oilers fan) outside Barclays Center.
The Islanders are more than two-thirds of the way through their first season in Brooklyn, and the move has not been frictionless. Average attendance at the Barclays Center is pretty bad — 28th out of the NHL's 30 franchises — even though the team is playing solidly and is likely to reach the playoffs. This weekend, a New York Post report suggested that the Islanders and their arena have been “secretly exploring ways to cut ties or modify the existing terms of their lease,” citing what it calls a “little-known out clause” that both sides can take advantage of after the fourth season. Barclays Center officials deny it all, and in fact the rumors seem way overblown and premature.
Admittedly, the Islanders have not had an easy transition from the crummy old Nassau Coliseum, their home since the team's founding in 1972. Unlike the Nets, who rebranded in an effort to ditch their New Jersey identity and attract an almost entirely new fanbase, the Islanders had to find a way to keep as many Long Island fans as possible while also attracting new ones. But old-school Islanders fans have been sensitive to even small attempts to “Brooklynize” the team. Early in the season, Barclays tried to replace the team's “goal horn” — the sound effect that plays when the team scores — with the honk of a subway train. There was such an uproar the team had to switch back. Last month, the team also moved its game-day practices from Brooklyn back to Long Island, where all of the players live.
Much more significant is that Barclays was designed for basketball and not hockey. A hockey rink is more than twice as long as a basketball court, and the arena has managed that by putting its ice surface way off-center, so that the scoreboard in the center of the arena hangs above one of the blue lines. That in turn means many more seats than usual have to be removed, resulting in the second-smallest capacity in the NHL, and many attendees at the western end of the arena end up with badly obstructed views. All of this was well known before the team moved in, but it's helped add to the perception that the Islanders are second-class citizens in their home arena.
The Islanders have an unusual real-estate deal in their new home. Barclays Center pays the Islanders an annual fee, reportedly averaging around $50 million, and in return handles the business side of the team's operations and makes money on things like ticket sales and sponsorships. In the Post article from this weekend, Brett Yormark, the CEO of Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment (which operates Barclays Center), flatly denied that the arena wants out of the deal early, adding, “We are enjoying the first year of hockey in Brooklyn.” An arena spokesperson declined to tell us much else, saying only that they stand behind Yormark's comment. (An Islanders spokesperson didn't immediately respond to our request for comment.)
The Post article quotes a source briefed on the matter who says, “I don't think either side ever believed the full lease would be honored. I just didn't think we'd be talking about this the first year in.” And it also cites a source close to the Islanders and other industry sources who say Jonathan Ledecky, who leads the group that's set to take over as the team's majority owner this summer, is “enamored with possibly moving the team to Queens or back to Long Island.” But as Randi Marshall, a member of the Newsday editorial board, reminds us, either of those scenarios is a pipe dream. There's no arena in Queens, and the Coliseum's renovation will make it too small for an NHL tenant.
Others have expressed skepticism, for a variety of reasons, that the finances are really as bad as the Post implies. On the Lighthouse Hockey blog, writer Dan Saraceni points out that Josh Kosman, one of the Post article's co-authors, has reported on other in-the-works NHL ownership scenarios that ultimately never came to pass. (Last June, they wrote that the NHL was arranging the sale of the Arizona Coyotes to billionaire William Foley, which would have moved the team to Las Vegas.)
But perhaps the strangest thing about the report is the timing. The team's first season is less than five months old, and it's hard to believe that the two sides would already be seriously looking to get out. It's possible — and, I'd argue, likely — that Barclays officials underestimated how hard it can be to create new hockey fans, especially given that the Rangers are long-established and, lately, playing well. Surely the Islanders and Barclays understand that building a fanbase would take more than a few months.
And while the team's weak ticket sales are well known, they're getting better. In the 14 games before December 1, the team averaged 12,393 fans, in a building with a capacity of 15,795. In the 17 games since, they've averaged 14,273. Six of the team's seven sellouts have come during that span, including four since the beginning of 2016. (The team's only other sellout was opening night.) To put it another way, 8 of the first 14 games drew fewer than 12,000 fans, but attendance hasn't dropped below that number since. The recent figures still aren't great — in the NHL, 13 teams average 100 percent capacity or even more — but they're headed up, not down. It appears that the Islanders are earning their place in our crowded sports market.
As for the Islanders' side of the money equation, the team gets a minimum amount each year as part of its agreement with Barclays, but can reportedly receive much more than that if certain revenue levels are reached. And everyone's better off financially than on Long Island (where the team was reportedly losing $20 million a year). Barclays may be an imperfect solution, but it's far better than any realistic alternative, short of leaving the New York market entirely. Perhaps three years from now, the Islanders' Brooklyn experiment will indeed prove to be a bust. But it's still too early to fully evaluate it — and too early for fans to worry about it.
Venezuela helicopter crash survivors found after six days in Amazon jungle
Venezuela helicopter crash survivors found after six days in Amazon jungle
The military in Venezuela uses helicopters to police the dense Amazon region
Rescue teams searching the Amazon jungle in Venezuela following a military helicopter crash six days ago have found at least five people alive, according to reports.
The helicopter, which was carrying five military personnel, four civilians and four crew members, disappeared during poor weather last Friday.
Venezuela's El Nacional paper reports that the Russian-made Mi-17 was discovered on Thursday, with the five military crew on board all found alive.
It is not yet clear whether the helicopter crew or civilian passengers have been found.
Survivors were due to be taken to Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of Venezuela's Amazonas state, in the early hours of Friday morning.
Details of their conditions are yet to be confirmed.
Liborio Guarulla, Governor of Amazonas state, posted a tweet on Wednesday unofficially reporting the helicopter had been seen on the edge of the Cerro Duida mountain.
They later followed up their tweet confirming that it had been found by the Yecuana indigenous tribe.
Mr Guarulla had previously criticised the lack of government resources made available to the search, which had been hampered by poor weather conditions.

Every week the Truthdig editorial staff selects a Truthdigger of the Week, a group or person worthy of recognition for speaking truth to power, breaking the story or blowing the whistle. It is not a lifetime achievement award. Rather, we're looking for newsmakers whose actions in a given week are worth celebrating.
On Sept. 19, the deadly Ebola virus entered the United States via Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan. On Oct. 8, Duncan joined the conservatively estimated 4,500 people who have been killed by the virus since it became a recognized plague in West Africa in March. The days that followed saw two American nurses who had attended to Duncan in the Texas hospital where they were admitted diagnosed. As of today they remain alive, but the fact that they were infected has caused mass unease over the prospect that the deadly contagion will gain a foothold nationwide.
The nightmares are well founded. The disease, for which there is no known cure and no clinically available vaccine, begins with a sore throat, muscle pains, fever and headaches, and ends with the failure of the liver and kidneys and massive internal and external bleeding. The infected do not die comfortably. Even so, there are reasons to believe mass fear over the disease is overblown. Standard medical precautions appear to be adequate to prevent its spread, and reports suggest those standards were not sufficiently observed in the cases that sprang from contact with Duncan.
Still, if the international response does not improve, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts the world could see 1.4 million cases of infection by late January. And if societies in West Africa and beyond grind to a halt while the disease spreads, Ebola's economic impact could kill more people than the virus itself, in addition to profoundly disrupting the lives of affected people.
Both the local and global population's first defenses against those horrifying scenarios are the groups and individuals risking their lives to contain the scourge. According to the World Health Organization, leading the effort is the categorically heroic Doctors Without Borders (known under its original French name as Medecins Sans Frontieres). The humanitarian organization has five treatment centers spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with an international staff of 210 working with the assistance of 1,650 locals.
The group has exceeded its medical function as well, creating detailed maps of the impacted areas that are being used by other responding organizations, including the Red Cross. The group showed up at the start of the epidemic and has pushed governments and agencies around the world to respond. Its tone has not always been reserved or polite. Nor would one expect it to be. In addition to the thousands of West Africans killed, at least 16 of the organization's members have been infected with the disease, nine of whom have died from it. At a U.N. briefing Sept. 2, Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu criticized the nonresponse from member countries and the organization as a whole, which declared the outbreak a “threat to international peace and security” only on Sept. 18.
“Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it,” Liu said. “In West Africa, cases and deaths continue to surge. Riots are breaking out. Isolation centers are overwhelmed. Health workers on the front lines are becoming infected and are dying in shocking numbers. Others have fled in fear, leaving people without care for even the most common illnesses. Entire health systems have crumbled. Ebola treatment centers are reduced to places where people go to die alone, where little more than palliative care is offered. It is impossible to keep up with the sheer number of infected people pouring into facilities. In Sierra Leone, infectious bodies are rotting in the streets.”
President Obama has assured Americans that Ebola will not become uncontrollable in the United States. Seven months after the outbreak, after the disease became a domestic issue upon which their performance will be judged and the future electability of members of their party influenced, they have announced “the largest international response in the history of the CDC.” Others, including Truthdig columnist Sonali Kolhatkar, take a broad view of the problem that includes the context of African immiseration by ongoing forms of Western economic colonialism and the cruel and indifferent negligence of a growing international neoliberal order that lets social problems fester and intensify until they become profitable for capitalists to deal with them.
There are exceptions to this sordid, unnecessary trend, and Doctors Without Borders and all the other responders on the front lines of the Ebola outbreak are among them. They are our Truthdiggers of the Week.

This shower is inspired by NASA technlogy 8:16 PM ET Thu, 27 April 2017 | 02:48
One company claims that it has invented the world's most efficient shower, taking inspiration from way up in space.
Orbital Systems, a Sweden-based clean-tech company, has come up with a shower that reuses and reduces water consumption through a purification system.
Founder and CEO Mehrdad Mahdjoubi said they found inspiration while working on a "Journey to Mars" design collaboration project between Lund University and NASA's Johnson Space Center.
"You don't have any choice when you're up in space or when you're going to Mars. You have to recycle; you have to use your resources in the best possible way," they told CNBC's "The Rundown" on Friday.
And along this vein, they created the sustainable Oas shower, which earned them a place in the Energy category of 2016's Forbes "30 under 30" list.
The shower saves up to 90 percent of water and 80 percent of energy compared to normal units, and has been dubbed the shower of the future.
If you're a woman living in the United States, chances are you've heard something along the lines of this:
(Cut to black and white dialogue)
“My ex-girlfriend was the worst. They were always asking me to be, like, present for them emotionally. What does that even mean? Women are crazy sometimes.”
“I know what you mean, dude. I have two sisters and they cry all the time. I say one thing to them and they get all hysterical on me. They accuse me of being ‘insensitive' or whatever.”
“It's because girls are just more emotional than dudes. They get real mentally unstable when it's that time of the month…if you know what I mean..”
*“Casual cissexism (Not all women have periods.)” flashes across the screen*
Unfortunately, the intersection of mental health stigma and sexism is all too common in our culture. Women are often depicted as “crazy,” emotionally unstable, overly sensitive, or hysterical. This is what I like to refer to as the Hysterical Woman stereotype. Not only is this stereotype used to devalue and disregard women's thoughts, feelings, and opinions, but it also paints mental illness in a negative light.
On one hand, the Hysterical Woman stereotype demonizes women who express their emotions. On the other hand, it portrays mental illness as a defect that can be used to write off mentally ill people altogether. This stereotype functions to categorize both women and mentally ill people as abnormal, weak, incompetent, and inferior to social majority groups, such as men and non-mentally ill people.
Some of you might be wondering how this stereotype came about in the first place. Well, the construction of femininity and the construction of mental illness are actually pretty similar.
Historically, mental illness has been constructed as a mental defect or as a lack of ability to function in mainstream society. If non-mentally ill people set the standard for how “normal people” should function in everyday life, then mentally ill people, by definition, are perceived as dysfunctional – and not the norm.
Social views about mental illness, like disability, are rarely articulated explicitly, yet they still remain deeply ingrained in our cultural consciousness. Mentally ill people are stereotyped as emotionally unstable, untrustworthy, incompetent, lazy, weak, dependent, and even dangerous. Not only does this stigmatization of mental illness create prejudice against mentally ill people, but it makes mentally ill people more likely to be discriminated against in larger social institution, like schools, housing, and the workforce.
*flash institutions on screen*
It's also extremely ironic that we label the mentally ill as dangerous and violent, because on top of discrimination, mental health stigma puts mentally ill people at a higher risk of abuse and sexual assault. This violence directed toward mentally ill people can be perpetuated by individuals, but it also can stem from government run institutions, such as mental hospitals and the criminal justice system.
In their incredibly important piece on disability theory, Emory University professor Rosemarie Garland-Thomson coined the idea of the ability/disability system. *(cite on screen and in description, “Integrating Disability, Transforming Feminist Theory”) According to Garland-Thomson, the ability/disability system is “a pervasive cultural system that stigmatizes certain kinds of bodily variations.” This system can also be applied to mental illness and other mental variations like autism, or what some people describe as neurodiversity.
Neurodivergent, a term coined in the late 90's, is used to describe people whose minds function differently than what societal standards consider “normal.” Activists who use the neurodiversity paradigm argue that “neurodiversity is a natural and valuable form of human diversity” (*quote on screen*) and the inequality that neurodiverse people experience is a result of social power dynamics rather than innate biological inadequacy.
The neurodiversity paradigm and the ability/disability system are really helpful when looking at mental health stigma because they attribute the discrimination that mentally ill people experience to cultural factors, rather than demonizing mental illness.
But what about the construction of femininity in relation to mental health stigma? According to Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, feminist disability theory illustrates that disability and womanhood are not natural states of inferiority, but culturally fabricated myths, similar to the social construction of race. Women have historically been stereotyped as dependent, frail, incompetent, unintelligent, and submissive. Like mental illness, the state of womanhood is similarly conflated with being flawed or inadequate.
According to Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, men are constructed as the default gender, whereas women are constructed in relation to them and almost always as inferior. De Beauvoir argues that masculinity represents both the positive and the neutral, whereas femininity represents only the negative. Damn.
Additionally, feminine perceived behavior is also stigmatized. For instance, women are frequently stereotyped as being too emotional or hypersensitive. According to a 2014 study (“Gendered Mental Disorders” by Boysen, et al-cite on screen), women are more likely than men to be characterized as expressing negative or inappropriate emotions in response to external stressors.
I don't know about you, but I've seen some of my brothers' responses to situations and I would argue that punching a hole in your door is… less than appropriate. This study states, “People perceive women, relative to men, as experiencing more distress, embarrassment, fear, guilt, sadness, shame, and shyness.” On the other hand, men are considered to be more rational, logical, and in control of situations.
Aside from being linked to a hierarchy of superiority and inferiority, gendered ideologies surrounding femininity specifically rely on negative cultural stigmas surrounding mental health. Women, regardless of mental health status, are often labeled as crazy or hysterical simply for expressing their emotions. Overall, women receive more mental health-related diagnoses than men, and these diagnoses often use gendered criteria that may disproportionately target women.
This hierarchy of gendered behaviors pathologizes feminine coded reactions to external stimuli as symptoms of mental illness, whereas masculine coded reactions are set as the default for mentally healthy behavior. Therefore, feminine coded behavior is not only linked to a hierarchy of masculinity and femininity that devalues women, but is also attached to a completely separate hierarchy of ability and disability that devalues the mentally ill.
So next time you think about calling your ex-girlfriend “crazy,” you should reconsider – because calling one woman “crazy” really only ends up hurting all other women and mentally ill people and makes it easier to discriminate against them.
Government's climate watchdog launches astonishing attack on the Mail on Sunday... for revealing global warming science is wrong
The official watchdog that advises the Government on greenhouse gas emissions targets has launched an astonishing attack on The Mail on Sunday – for accurately reporting that alarming predictions of global warming are wrong.
We disclosed that although highly influential computer models are still estimating huge rises in world temperatures, there has been no statistically significant increase for more than 16 years.
Despite our revelation earlier this month, backed up by a scientifically researched graph, the Committee on Climate Change still clings to flawed predictions.
All a con? The Mail on Sunday revealed some of the science behind the scare tactics for Global warming were miscalculated - and now they are being attacking for pointing out the truth
Leading the attack is committee member Sir Brian Hoskins, who is also director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College, London. In a blog on the Committee on Climate Change's website, Sir Brian insisted: ‘The scientific basis for significant long-term climate risks remains robust, despite the points raised . . . Early and deep cuts in emissions are still required.'
They also claimed our report ‘misunderstood' the value of computer models. Yet in an interview three years ago, Sir Brian conceded that when they started out as a climate scientist, the models were ‘pretty lousy, and they're still pretty lousy, really'.
Our graph earlier this month was reproduced from a version first drawn by Dr Ed Hawkins, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Last week it was reprinted as part of a four-page report in The Economist.
The accuracy of computer forecasts is vital because they influence politicians and their key environmental advisers on how urgently to act on climate change – and how many billions of pounds they take from the taxpayer in ‘green' levies.
How the MoS reported the faulty forecast
The Committee on Climate Change claims such forecasts must be right because world temperatures have previously matched computer models' ‘outputs' for most of the past 60 years. Yet as this newspaper pointed out, for almost all of that 60-year period the models were not making predictions – because they did not yet exist.
Instead, the models had recently been making ‘hindcasts' – backward projections based on climate simulations and tailored to actual temperatures. The evidence shows the models collapse when they try to forecast the future.
Author Andrew Montford, who runs the widely read Bishop Hill climate blog, leapt to The Mail on Sunday's defence and said Sir Brian's reliance on ‘hindcasts' was ‘crazy, crazy stuff'.
David Whitehouse, of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the graph showed models were so unreliable that ‘if this kind of data were from a drugs trial it would have been stopped long ago'.
And last week, The Economist repeated our claims that many scientists now believe that previous estimates of ‘climate sensitivity' – how much the world will warm each time the level of carbon dioxide doubles – are far too high.
In a key 2007 report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested this was most likely to be about 3C, with 4.5C considered ‘likely'. However, recent research suggests the true figure is much lower – between 1.5C and 2C – giving the world many more decades to avoid disaster through effective new technologies.
Another one of the staple recipes that we make on a regular basis is Teriyaki Pork. My sister in law showed us this dish, and we have continued to make it since. The main recipe is KETO already,but instead of using regular brown sugar, I use the splenda brown sugar mix, but one could use truvia or a different sweetener instead. I will show both versions of this recipe below.
We prefer to use boneless pork tenderloin,but we have made this with pork chops as well. But again, the tenderloin is a lot better and more tender, go figure right? We normally get the two pack shown above from Walmart since it is the cheapest one we can find.
Here are the ingredients: soy sauce, olive oil(or other fat of choice), black pepper, splenda brown sugar or other sweetener, garlic, meat, and ginger.
I just put all of the ingredients in the plastic bag that I will marinate the pork in, easier clean up too!
Add the Soy Sauce first.
Then the oil.
Add the brown sugar, when using the splenda mix, you add half the amount the recipe calls for and this adds the only carbs this recipe has which are 4 carbs and 4 grams sugar so around 8 carbs total for two big tenderloins which are around 4 servings each, 8 total. Also, most of the marinade gets thrown away at the end. Anyway, so I don't think it has more than 1 carb total per serving.
Garlic.
Add the ginger.
Sorry about this picture, but I added the pepper last. Then I mix everything in the bag until well combined.
Add both tenderloins (I rinse them first) and once sealed mix around as much as possible so it is well covered.
Then put into the fridge for at least 4 hours,but best results are when they are marinated overnight. Whenever I think about it I will flip the meat so that it gets fully covered and marinates really well.
When ready to cook, take one out and place in an oven safe dish. The other one I put into the freezer for a later time. Also, if you are cooking for one, you could chop the tenderloins into smaller pieces and marinate together, and then bake only as much as you can eat in one sitting/leftovers and freeze the rest until ready to eat.
Bake at 425 for 30-45 mins depending on the size of the tenderloin or thickness of the meat. In my oven this one took 45 mins, but pork chops only took around 30 mins. I prefer it not to be pink in the center, but you can always check with a meat thermometer once it is 145 F or higher, and it is done.
Here you can see three of the slices which I consider one serving, but you can always eat more. It is amazingly tasty and juicy.
It also tastes great as leftovers for lunches, which is why we cook a larger tenderloin so we have some for lunch. I hope you enjoy this dish, it is honestly amazing, and have been making it for a long time. Below is the recipe.

What's the identity of Chelsea?
It's a simple question without an easy answer, not least because the West London club has meant different things to different people over the decades, and until the 2000s the Blues never won much of anything.
And so we visited London for a few days to learn more about what makes Chelsea special. We sat down for interviews with José Mourinho, arguably the world's best coach in any sport, and Didier Drogba, who has become synonymous with the Blues.
We got access inside Stamford Bridge and at the team's Cobham training ground. We spoke to Neil Barnett, Chelsea's pregame ringmaster, about the club's history. And we enjoyed the full game-day experience with David Johnstone, a lifelong Chelsea fan who attends every competitive match home and away.
Our visit to Chelsea happened to come before last week's horrible incident in Paris, in which a group of Chelsea fans was caught on a phone video issuing racist chants on the Métro and physically preventing a black man from getting onboard. Johnstone described feeling shame when they saw the video.
“A handful of guys has brought shame upon Chelsea and tarnished everybody else's reputation,” Johnstone said when I called them on Monday. “Those guys involved in that incident in Paris are not representative of the overwhelming majority of Chelsea supporters. They're going to have their day in court, and if they're found guilty let's hope they feel the full weight of the law.”
Over the past week, the club issued a formal apology and promised life bans from Stamford Bridge for the fans who were involved in the Paris incident. And on Saturday a homemade sign went up in the stands before Chelsea's game against Burnley: BLACK OR WHITE, WE'RE ALL BLUE.
Under the Crest: Chelsea is our way of seeking what it means to be a Blue.

A while back, Hockey-Graph's own Matt Cane wrote the following tweet:
Related to what @Thats_Offside has said: Why should I care what a player's zone entry rates are? Convince me, Twitter. — Matt Cane (@Cane_Matt) November 27, 2015
Matt was referring to a statistic commonly found in “Neutral Zone Tracking,” which purports to measure the quality of individual and team play in the Neutral Zone. Neutral Zone Tracking was pioneered by a bunch of guys at Broad Street Hockey (Eric Tulsky and Geoff Detweilier) back in 2011 and in the years since, a bunch of individuals has also begun to do the same. The work that's been done on this area, on other sites as well as on this one suggests neutral zone tracking results in some extremely important data that we should be very interested in.
What is Neutral Zone Tracking:
Hockey has a variety of statistics that attempt to measure what is happening in the offensive and defensive zones – If a player allows a lot of shots against, we usually think of them as being poor in the defensive zone. If they generate a lot of shots for, we think of them as good in the offensive zone. We understand that these labels aren't strictly speaking correct – a player who keeps the puck out of their dzone entirely may have better shots against than one who is simply good in the dzone – but they at least seems to work in theory.
By contrast, Hockey has no conventional statistics for measuring play in the neutral zone, which you know, takes up 1/3 of a hockey rink! As such, the importance of the neutral zone, and who was particularly good at playing within it, was basically unknown – absent the thoughts of scouts and coaches.
Neutral Zone Tracking aimed to change that. In NZ Tracking, a tracker tracks every time a player for each team gets the puck out of the neutral zone and into the opponents' zone – what is known as a “Zone Entry.” A tracker marks down the strength of play (5v5, special teams, etc. As we'll explain tomorrow, some trackers only track 5v5), the time of each zone entry, the player (or opponent) who makes each zone entry, and the type of zone entry.
There are 2 types of zone entries that are tracked –
1. A controlled zone entry, where a player carries the puck in or passes it in and thus has control as they enter the offensive zone; or
2. An uncontrolled zone entry – where a player dumps, tips, or otherwise gets the puck into the offensive zone such that they have to chase the puck down in order to regain control.
We often talk about controlled entries simply as “Carry-ins” and uncontrolled entries as “Dumps,” because those are the most common forms of those types (and because of how we track them), but it's important to note other actions fall into these two categories.
The goals of this tracking was to find out answers to multiple questions:
1. What is the value of a controlled zone entry?
2. What is the value of an uncontrolled zone entry?
3. Who are the best players at making controlled zone entries?
4. Who are the best players at preventing opposing controlled zone entries?
5. Who are the best and worst players in the neutral zone overall?
6. Can we split up performance by players and teams into performance in each of the three zones?
7. If so, how repeatable is neutral zone performance, particularly in comparison to performance in the other two zones?
8. Wrapping it up: How important is play in the neutral zone?
What we Found:
We found a number of answers to these questions thanks to the work of trackers for multiple teams, including Corey Sznajder who tracked every game for every team of the 2013-14 season.
First, we found that a controlled zone entry results in more than twice as many unblocked shot attempts (fenwicks) as an uncontrolled entry. The amount for each is roughly .58 fenwicks per controlled entry and .26 fenwicks per each uncontrolled entry, but the exact amounts differ based upon who is doing the tracking.*
*We'll talk about the reasons for this, known as tracker bias, in Part 2.
As a result, when you hear your local color commentator complain their team isn't attempting to dump and chase more when behind in score, remember that uncontrolled entries result in significantly fewer shots (and of course goals) than controlled ones. In addition, research has shown that failed attempts at controlled entries are much less harmful than conventional wisdom suggests, meaning that going for a carry-in instead of a dump-in is likely the more effective strategy in many circumstances.
Second we were able to identify that some players are particularly effective at entering the zone with control than others and that some players take bigger roles at trying to make zone entries than others (and unsurprisingly, forwards take larger roles than defensemen). That said, it was also found, unsurprisingly, that this information on its own wasn't completely useful – because some players may be great at making carry-ins, but may also suck defensively at preventing their opponents from doing the same (an example of this is John Tavares). As a result, knowing who carries in a lot doesn't necessarily tell you if a player is good in the neutral zone – we can best infer that by looking at the team's on-ice neutral zone results while a player is on the ice.
Third Neutral Zone Data has allowed us to split up how much of a player or team's possession #s derive from that player/team's play in each zone on the ice. The way this works is as follows: We look at the neutral zone results of a team and from the average results for each type of zone entry they make and they allow, we can get a score for their neutral zone performance (often called either “Neutral Zone Score” or “Neutral Zone Fenwick”). Essentially this score measures what a team or player's fenwick would be if that player/team had average results in the offensive and defensive zone.
Once we have this statistic, we can look at whether a player/team creates more or less shot attempts than we'd expect from their own zone entries. If they create more, then they're performing better than average in the offensive zone – if they create less, they're below average. Thus we can create an offensive zone score – basically showing the player/team's fenwick they would have with their offensive zone results if their neutral and defensive zone performance was perfectly average. We can do the same thing for the defensive zone (the exact opposite).
Fourth: The creation of Neutral Zone Score, Offensive Zone Score, and Defensive Zone Score led to the most interesting findings about the neutral zone: For individual players, only performance in the neutral zone was repeatable over a half season sample! In other words, if you knew a player's scores in all three zones over a period of time, you'd expect their offensive and defensive zone #s to regress heavily toward average as more time goes on, while their neutral zone #s would at least somewhat remain similar even as more games would be played.
For teams, later research suggested this was not the case: Team Performance in the offensive and defensive zone over a half season is in fact repeatable. Neutral Zone Performance is still the most repeatable of performances, but unlike individual players, teams could repeatably thrive or fail based upon offensive and defensive zone performance, and some teams certainly do so.
In Sum: This suggests that the neutral zone is an extremely important feature of an NHL game and that stats measuring it are similarly important. Teams that win the neutral zone may be the best at repeatedly winning the possession battle, which of course means they more often win the actual battle of winning games. Players who win the neutral zone battle are more likely to put up good possession #s repeatedly than players who don't, because performance in the other two zones doesn't seem to be repeatable. This means of course, that if a player has good or bad possession #s stemming from performance in the offensive and/or defensive zones, you can expect regression to pull them back toward average (or back toward their neutral zone average).
This means that neutral zone tracking is especially important! Unfortunately, NZ Tracking has kind of fallen out of favor due to a lack of guides of how to actually do it. So later this week, in Part 2, we'll go over how anyone interested in neutral zone tracking can do it themselves to find out how their favorite team or player is doing in the neutral zone.

The Star brings you seven tales of the people and places that are a part of the highway's story. This is Part 6.
Highway 7 is changing. When the road was designated a provincial highway in the 1920s, it was a gateway for city dwellers. For the next nine decades, the road grew with Ontario, from its rural routes to industrial highway. Now, with major investment in public transit, Highway 7 is becoming an urban thoroughfare.
“I have four kids,” they say, explaining the size of their Honda Pilot SUV as we buckle up. “Boy, boy, boy, girl.” Aged 15 to 25.
We're in the parking lot of a Thornhill shopping plaza and Martow is about to take me on a tour of the planned dedicated bus lane route they believe will destroy their neighbourhood.
“Stop me if I talk too fast,” says Gila Martow, interrupting themselves to shoot me this warning as I climb into their beige SUV.
As we head east on Centre St. toward the Promenade bus terminal, Martow throws out a scenario she's been using lately to illustrate their frustration: Joe Bus Rider gets on the rapidway in Markham to head west for work, but is baffled when the driver makes an unexpected turn south into Thornhill.
They and their supporters want the rapidway to continue along Highway 7 instead of cutting south, and they argue the money would be better spent on the Yonge subway expansion.
Martow, 51, an optometrist who ran for council in the last municipal election, calls it a “detour” that will disrupt the flow of traffic, force cars onto residential streets and cost more than it's worth. They have been comparing it to the controversial St. Clair streetcar project, which prompted struggling businesses along the midtown corridor to launch a lawsuit against the City of Toronto.
The route in question is only a small part of the Viva bus rapidway that will stretch across Highway 7, connecting the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre with town centres in Richmond Hill and Markham. Martow and a contingent of local residents who have taken up the cause are not against the rapidway itself, but rather the planned route of the dedicated centre lanes through their neighbourhood — from Highway 7 south down Bathurst St. and west across Centre St.
Transit officials with YRT-Viva and the local councillor take issue with their position — in particular, the word “detour.”
“I can just picture this poor guy, yelling at the bus driver and saying, ‘What are you doing? What are you getting off the highway for? We're on Highway 7, what are you doing?' And the (driver's) gonna say, ‘Well, we have to go to the Promenade Mall, there are two old ladies there that want to get on the rapidway.”
“That's a misrepresentation of the facts being tossed about,” Dale Albers, spokesperson for YRT-Viva, told me this week when I used the apparently loaded word in an email. “That route has been operational since Viva first launched in 2005 and serves thousands of people every workday just in that stretch alone,” they wrote back. “The alignment is not new, nor a divergence from an existing route — thus not a detour.”
The route plan is based on an environmental assessment that showed the demand for transit — and the projected future demand — is along Centre St., where there is a great deal of development potential. Along the section of Highway 7 the rapidway will bypass in favour of the Thornhill route, there is very little room for intensification and a lower demand for transit, the assessment found. Albers also points out that the rapidway makes similar diversions off Highway 7 through “residential/commercial urban corridors in Markham and Newmarket.”
At the heart of this dispute is a fundamental disagreement over the identity of this little slice of York Region. Is Thornhill-Vaughan a city or a suburb?
“This is a suburb,” Martow says. “We're getting way ahead of ourselves if we think that in Thornhill, in York Region, people are going to do grocery shopping and take their kid to hockey by bus. Who are we kidding?”
In an effort to get people excited about plans for the new urban streetscape and development that will come with the rapidway, at least one developer called it “the next Yonge Street” and officials have likened it in other ways to a downtown Toronto streetscape. That comparison hasn't gone over well with some Thornhill residents.
“We don't want a downtown Toronto,” says Mark Milunsky, a 19-year-old aspiring urban planner. “That's why we live up here.”
Milunsky, a recent high school graduate, is the newest member of the Beverley Glen Ratepayers Association executive. Together, they and Martow, who is the association's president, have been pushing to have the route changed. They recently convinced local Progressive Conservative MPP Peter Shurman to voice their support for residents.
But it seems unlikely they will get their way. The project is already funded by the province, with construction on Bathurst and Centre Sts. set to begin in 2015 and last two years.
“I appreciate the suburban dream, but the reality is — look around, this a very urban place,” says Alan Shefman, councillor for Vaughan Ward 5, which includes Thornhill. “I guess people really hang on the mythology of the suburbs, but I'm very practical and very pragmatic when it comes to where we live here, and this isn't suburbs. This is an urban municipality.”
Though Shefman has no official say in the plans for Centre St. because it is a regional road, they support the rapidway route.
Here's some context: Shefman and Martow are political foes. Martow ran against them and lost in the 2010 election. They believe they have taken up this cause for political gain; they say it's because they care about their community.
Martow has been highly critical of Shefman for supporting the project when, according to her, nearly all local residents are against it. Shefman says he's spoken to many residents who have voiced their support.
Martow is not against development of the area altogether — in fact, they agree that Centre St. needs a facelift — but their concern is that the rapidway, which will be transformed into light rail in decades to come, will pave the way for density not suitable for the neighbourhood.
“If there is a rapidway being built down here to look like Highway 7, the OMB (Ontario Municipal Board) will say, ‘Whoo, future light rail? Almost a subway? Rapidway? Sounds really rapid. Yeah, build! Thirty storeys, 40 storeys!'”
For their part, Shefman says they are adamant about limiting density along the large chunk of Centre St. between Dufferin St. and New Westminster Dr. The councillor's vision for the street is something similar to Disera Dr., a new and well-designed promenade adjacent to the contentious bus route that features, among other things, a Marble Slab Creamery. It has quickly become a popular strolling destination for locals.
But here's an interesting thing: when asked about their own vision for Centre St., Martow's answer is the same — Disera. In fact, they drive there to show me the street, raving about how great it is. “We're so thrilled with it even though it's one block — they say two blocks but it's really only one block — we walk up and down here all summer long going to Marble Slab.”
Same street. Same vision. Different ideas on how to get there.
Correction: This article was edited from a previous version that said Gila Martow drove an enormous black SUV. In fact, their vehicle is a beige Honda Pilot, which is classified as a mid-sized SUV.

[dropcap color=”#008040″ boxed=”yes” boxed_radius=”8px” class=”” id=””]T[/dropcap]he Delhi Union of Journalists (DUJ) has come out a point by rebuttal on recent Times of India's editorial seeking sops to newspaper industry, while arguing for free market theory in other sectors in the forthcoming Budget. Times of India on its January 19 lengthy editorial argued for various bold steps in the forthcoming Budget, seeking for a free market economy and revolutionary steps from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the same editorial, Times of India claimed newspaper industry and in disarray and argued for allocating many sops to the newspaper industry, propagating falsehoods on demonetization.
The Delhi Journalists Union (DUJ) came out with a detailed statement exposing the newspapers owners' bogus claims.
The Times of India editorial basically argued that due to heavy cost on manpower newspaper industry is suffering and justifying the retrenchment in any organization.
Within two days Times of India's owner Samir Jain and Vineet Jain got a befitting reply from the journalists' community. The Delhi Journalists Union (DUJ) came out with a detailed statement exposing the newspapers owners' bogus claims. The DUJ, the oldest union of journalists, which is essentially a Left leaning one revealed the total income Time Of India which is around Rs.4800 crore per annum and total salary expense comes around Rs.551 crore, which comes to only 11 percent.
[dropcap color=”#008040″ boxed=”yes” boxed_radius=”8px” class=”” id=””]T[/dropcap]he Journalists' Union also revealed that out of the total salary expense Rs.102 crores are spent for just 40 employees of Times of India and out of which high paying staffers, just four belong to Journalism Division. This means that majority chunk of the salary in India's largest newspaper is given to management side and not to journalists, who are supposed to get major pie.
“From a document extracted from the public record, we know that BCCL incurred salary and wage costs of Rs. 551 crore in 2010-11, on “operating revenue” of almost Rs.4,500 crore and “other income” of about Rs. 300 crore. Manpower costs in other words, amounted to just over 11 percent of total revenue for the company. Breaking down the “manpower cost” component reveals that Rs. 102 crore out of the total, i.e., close to 20 percent, is absorbed in remunerations to just 40 employees. This list of 40 includes only four whose function could be identified as journalism.
“BCCL (Times of India's company Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd) have taken on themselves the mission of arguing for press freedom as a public good. We call on them to make their records public and allow a full evaluation of their record of decisions that have violated the public interest,” said DUJ.
Journalists' union also accuses Times of India to squeeze the manpower by wrong campaign on Demonetization affects.

Press Release
A Reply to The Times of India
On the eve of the budget session and state elections the newspaper industry has made out a case for financial sops, including exemptions from the forthcoming Goods and Services tax, and higher government advertisement rates. The pretext is the losses it claims it faces as a result of paying journalists and other employees fair wages. This is a case of killing two birds with one stone: make a killing by getting more money from the government and by denying employees the dues ordered by the Majithia Wage Board.
We are alarmed in this context to see the Times of India, which has set itself up as a battering ram of newspaper industry interests, seek through its editorial pages to delegitimise the wage board process which has been a vital part of the protective legislation for press freedom. We also seriously object to this continuing misuse of editorial pages in the press to argue a one-sided case for newspaper industry owners.
We wish to point out that newspaper houses are increasingly splashing out on gala events and promotions, fashion shows, beauty contests and five-star award ceremonies but are unwilling to pay their employees decent wages. Instead, they are cracking down on trade unions in the industry and resorting to large scale contract employment to bypass the Wage Board. They have even questioned the need for wage fixation machinery and the Working Journalists Act itself. By tradition the Government of India appoints a new Wage Board every ten years; it is time for the next one to be appointed but the employers refuse to honour even the previous Award.
The BJP government's demonetisation decision of November 8, 2016, is now being misused as a pretext for cracking down on employees. We are shocked to see a number of major national newspapers and several regional players, responding with mass retrenchments of journalists and other industry workers. These retrenchments are being done in secrecy, invariably in violation of existing labour laws, in a manner that exploits the economic and financial vulnerability of workers whose livelihoods are at stake. Many of those retrenched are forced to resign and sworn to secrecy in the process, on pain of losing the measly two months' salary they are granted as compensation.
The Times of India in its editorial page article of January 19 (“Indian newspaper industry: Red ink splashed across the bottom line”), makes a case that it is doing the readership a great favour by keeping selling price low. This goes against its boasts, propagated through its own news pages, about the affluence of its readers and their high purchasing power. It also glosses over the role it has played over the years in launching a corrosive “price war” within the newspaper industry, which has forced competition to follow suit, driven many other titles to the wall and destroyed pluralism and diversity in the press.
Managements have been pursuing profit at the cost of the integrity of the industry's basic function of gathering news and presenting it in a credible fashion. The boom and bust cycle of the global economy has therefore impacted an industry that has in its lust for profits, chosen to depend increasingly upon advertisements, rather than seek to expand readership through quality news reporting. This does not mean that it cannot afford to pay legally mandated wages ordered by a government appointed tripartite Wage Board, headed by a retired judge, which went into the industry's finances in great detail before ordering pay hikes. The newspaper management challenged the Justice Majithia Wage Board Award in the Supreme Court but lost. The Award has the stamp of approval of the Supreme Court. However, the majority of newspaper owners have chosen to flout the judgement and have still not paid the awarded wages, let alone arrears.
Now the Award and the notional losses caused by it are being used as an argument to get government support for the industry and shore up private profits. Media owners are feverishly lobbying for tax exemptions for newsprint which would otherwise be done away with under the impending GST regime. Media houses have thrived on this subsidy for decades. To make employees a scapegoat in this tug of war with the government is malicious and unjust.
We would draw attention to only a few instances where the Times of India seek to mislead, contrary to the lofty purpose it embraces of educating. At some point in its spiel, it says that an (unnamed) publicly-listed newspaper company has had “revenue growth” of 4 percent compounded annually since 2011-12, while manpower costs have jumped by “over 58 percent”.
This is a deliberate effort at misleading. If the Times of India wants to make a case of unjust manpower cost escalation, it has to provide a calculation on comparable bases. In the five years since 2011-12, 4 percent compound annual growth would amount in aggregate to about 20 percent. So the comparison against the supposed 58 percent growth in manpower costs is not really as terrible as the figure of 4 versus 58 would suggest.
Secondly, we have serious reasons to question the authenticity of the figures that the Times of India presents, since the newspaper entity remains unidentified.
Thirdly, we also have reasons to doubt if the increase in manpower costs – assuming it is accurately calculated – has anything to do with the basic mission of the newspaper. We would like to see the annual report of Bennett Coleman and Co Ltd (BCCL) – publishers of the Times of India. We believe that it is imperative if the company is making a case for policy intervention, that it should adopt this element of transparency.
From a document extracted from the public record, we know that BCCL incurred salary and wage costs of Rs. 551 crore in 2010-11, on “operating revenue” of almost Rs.4,500 crore and “other income” of about Rs.300 crore. Manpower costs in other words, amounted to just over 11 percent of total revenue for the company.
Breaking down the “manpower cost” component reveals that Rs. 102 crore out of the total, i.e., close to 20 percent, is absorbed in remunerations to just 40 employees. This list of 40 includes only four whose function could be identified as journalism.
BCCL have taken on themselves the mission of arguing for press freedom as a public good.
We call on them to make their records public and allow a full evaluation of their record of decisions that have violated the public interest.
Failing that, we call on the Times of India to honour the basic rules of journalistic ethics and permit journalists' unions the right to reply in its columns.
We also call on the newspaper industry to cease the campaign for a special policy dispensation from the Government that would be corrosive of workers' rights. To argue for this dispensation just on the eve of crucial elections to a number of state assemblies, is to surrender the claim to independence and to further erode the public credibility of the press.

Arsene Wenger believes goalkeeper David Ospina has settled quickly into English football but warned they have not yet won the race to be Arsenal's permanent No1.
The 26-year-old joined the Gunners from French club Nice in a £3million deal last summer following a series of impressive displays for Columbia at the World Cup.
Ospina suffered injury problems which restricted their involvement from the outset but following Wojciech Szczesny's £25,000 fine for smoking in the showers after Arsenal's New Year's Day defeat at Southampton, they have played all three Premier League games since without conceding a goal.
Having kept four consecutive clean sheets in all competitions, Ospina may start to believe they are close to establishing themselves as first choice but Wenger insists Szczesny should still be considered their No1 for the time being.
“David Ospina has had some time to settle because they were injured when they arrived here,” said Wenger. “During that time we could see their dedication, their focus and their quality. He's in a fight with Wojciech Szczesny to start at the moment. Wojciech is the No1 but David has played recently. Can they retain the shirt in the coming games? We'll decide that. I don't forget Emiliano Martinez either, who I rate highly. We have three top goalkeepers and the fight for who starts is going on.
“You have to be consistent if you want to retain the shirt. It can be very difficult to adapt for a goalkeeper when you move to England. In fact, it is maybe the most special and difficult position to get used to. Why? Because there is more freedom here to challenge the ‘keeper than in any other country, which I like.
“It is a big test for a goalkeeper because you need to be committed, brave and not fazed by the challenges you get. The first signs that David has shown are positive but it is not done. Every game is no important for him.”
Wouldn't it be nice if life were like our favorite movies? Romance as passionate as The Notebook, a daily routine as smooth as James Bond's or super human powers like the cast of X Men? Well…that's probably not going to happen to any of us any time soon, but you can still come kind of close if you know where to find the right spots. And by spots, I mean hotels.
Traveling movie buffs, eat your heart out.
The Park Hyatt Tokyo: We featured the Park Hyatt as one of the top 5 hotels in Tokyo, and it's obvious that Sofia Coppola thought pretty highly of it, too. Them film Lost in Translation, starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, is set in this luxurious hotel where the main characters look to discover their true selves.
The Bellagio Resort, Las Vegas: The Bellagio has seen some of the most on-screen time of any hotel in the world. Aside from the obvious Ocean's films, you can find it gracing a whole bunch of pieces of cool cinema — personally, I'd recommend Dodgeball, Head of State, and Knocked Up.
Grand Hotel Pupp, Czech Republic: This hotel was the fictional Hotel Splendide in the Bond film Casino Royale, starring Daniel Craig. In reality, the Pupp is in the Czech Republic in one of Europe's leading spa towns. It's also considered the premiere getaway for stress relief near Prague.
Hotels de Chevaliers, France: In the prequel to Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited, Natalie Portman and Jason Schwartzman star in Hotel Chevalier. This short film reveals a long-term (and, uh, pretty steam) relationship between the two characters and sets the groundwork for Anderson's next feature. From the beginning, the hotel can easily be seen as that shining rock on the hill…of France.
Beverly Wilshire, Beverly Hills: This Beverly Hills Four Seasons is the location for most of Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts getting to see just what the hotel has to offer throughout the film. Some even say you can still see them traversing its long, winding corridors — black stilettos and all — to this day. Yah, we're just kidding.
The Fairmont San Francisco: San Francisco's iconic hotel since 1907, the Fairmont is considered the White House of the West Coast because nearly every president has stayed there. The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, features this hotel as Connery's place to stay throughout the film. Their $12,000 a night, 6,000 square-foot suite even features a grand piano.
A woman told police of their disbelief when they discovered that their "boyfriend" of two years was a female friend, a jury has heard.
The complainant said they thought they were having sex with a man called Kye Fortune, who was recovering from a brain tumour and did not want them to see their scars.
But they claim they eventually discovered it was in fact their 25-year-old friend Gayle Newland, who had persuaded them to wear a blindfold throughout their sexual encounters in which a prosthetic was used.
'Straight away they held their hand down over their face and said 'it's not what you think'...'
Newland, of Willaston, Cheshire, is on trial at Chester Crown Court where they deny five counts of sexual assault between February and June 2013.
The court heard the alleged victim received a Facebook friend request in 2011 from a Kye Fortune who purported to be a half-Filipino, half-Latino young man.
They communicated online and "Kye" later told them they had been involved in a car accident before medics found they had a brain tumour. They were having treatment in hospital and was not well enough to see her, the complainant told police in a video interview.
But the pair spoke frequently on the phone where the complainant described Kye's voice as "high-pitched".

The complainant told the interviewing officer: "He was saying how much I had helped them get through their illness. (He said) it was a sign, we should get married, we should have kids, we were going to do all sorts of things."
During this time, the complainant said they met Newland - who became a "really good friend" and said they knew Kye. Eventually, the complainant and Kye decided to finally meet in person at a Chester hotel, the jury heard.
They told police the only stipulation that Kye made was that they wear a blindfold because they were "anxious about the way they looked" and "could not walk properly" due to nerve and muscle damage.

The woman said "Kye" was in the bathroom when they entered the hotel room and the bed was covered with rose petals and Hello Kitty bears.
The complainant said they put on the blindfold of a sleeping mask and scarf and that a "shaking Kye" came in and said they had signed themselves out of a private hospital in Manchester.
The pair then had sex, they allege, in which Newland is alleged to have used a prosthetic penis before "Kye" said they had to return to hospital.
• Teenage victim of woman who pretended to be man speaks out
• Belgian discovers their wife used to be a man after 19 years
Further hotel visits followed where they said sex took place again before "Kye" visited their flat and finally uncovered the truth, the court heard.
Describing what they said was their last sexual encounter before they went to the police, they said: "When I was having sex I grabbed for the back of their head and my hand got caught on something. It did not feel right.
"I was sat on the bed, they were standing up. Something in my mind said 'pull it (the blindfold) off, pull it off'. I just pulled it off. Gayle was just standing there... I just couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it. Straight away they held their hand down over their face and said 'it's not what you think'."
The trial continues.
[Did you all catch Lord Smingleigh's Introduction to House Rules last week? Naturally, an exploration on making games simpler should be followed with notes on making them trickier…]
No time for a long introduction! Grab your hat, coat, and thrashing-stick and come with me. This time I maunder about some house rules the Gaming Chums use to ratchet up the tension and increase the complexity of games, and possibly to increase the conflict and turn the finest of friends turn into slavering killbeasts*.
I have recently begun playing Pandemic with the Gaming Chums (Quinns, you scoundrel, it was all your fault). It is a rich and deep game, but intensive play has begun to revolve around the same successful strategies now that we're more familiar with the game. Aha, thought I, the time has come to house-rule for complexity! The solution we have begun using is to restrict card-related communication and make it an action like moving, card exchanges, and the like, requiring players to make choices between acting and gathering information. A single action may be spent by the active player to send a message-of-text to another player (with whatever information and questions may be fitted into the typical 160-character length limit imposed by the medium) and receive a single response (containing anything the player desires that can fit into a single text) from that player. We also changed the Dispatcher's special ability to be able to pay an action to speak a text-message's worth of information and questions and receive a similar amount of verbal response from a nominated player, making the Dispatcher a powerful information dissemination role. The normal rules for card exchanges are slightly altered; Giving cards is not affected, but “taking” cards (with the nominated player's consent, of course) requires speaking a location and disease to be specified, and if the player you intend to “take” a card from cannot satisfy one or both of those requirements the action is considered to have failed.
This house rule acts as a little grit in the gears of a game whose steps had become a little too smooth, and suddenly the players are back where they were in the olden days of last month, struggling to hold back the tide of cubes, making agonising choices over how to spend the actions they have. Also the text communication is nicely evocative of a far-flung team of experts instead of chums chatting over a table. It is still winnable, but insufficient or excessive communication can result in global catastrophe. It is important to note though, that other verbal game-related communication is allowed and encouraged – nothing kills a gaming evening's mood quite like sitting silently around a table watching people fondle their phones. If you fear your gaming group might not be able to handle the temptation to twit and book faces while doing so, you might replace texting with the passing of restrictively small handwritten notes.
A slight aside to the above is that when playing Pandemic, we collaboratively name the diseases each game and write them on little paper labels that we hold down with the cure markers. In our last game, Red was Miley Cyrus impersonation, Blue was reverse diarrhoea, Black was wandering beard syndrome, and Yellow was the French unmentionable. At all times we insist on referring to the disease by name, not colour.
Earl Grey attempts to cleanse the world of Miley Cyrus impersonation. Or perhaps he's stealing the cure to ransom to the highest bidder. Never trust feline motives!
Cosmic Encounter is a fine game, and when the port is flowing freely the Gaming Chums use it as a test bed for ways mix it up a bit to keep everyone on their toes. Dealing with the interactions between alien powers is the heart of the game, so our attempts almost always focus on that aspect. Our first success was to issue each player two aliens to each player and allow the player to switch the active alien at the end of their turn. An interesting variation on this was to issue each player an alien at random, then place a random alien card between each player. A player may swap their active alien for the alien card on either side at the end of their turn. In this way their old alien becomes available for the player on that side to claim in their turn, and sometimes alien cards can end up circling the table multiple times.
Keep an eye on the Virus that crushes fleets with contemptuous ease, but fear the guy with the innocent-looking smile.
Our more recent success is to allow the active player to discard their alien and draw a new random alien at the end of their turn, or choose from one of the previously-discarded aliens if they or they so choose, which can cause a seismic shift in the balance of power in the game. These games start out fairly normal, but a player using, say, the military powerhouse that is the Virus can only get away with it for a limited time – the Virus's ship multiplier is helpless against the Losers, who turn defeat into victory, and the Empaths, who can turn a fight into a negotiation. As the game progresses, the pool of available aliens increases and an alien which was dominant a few turns ago can become a liability. Do you discard your alien because it is not ideal for the current situation? Or do you hold on to it because you don't think you'll be able to withstand it if it is held by someone else? The fact that the discarded aliens remain to be resurrected at any moment reduces the impact of the randomness somewhat as the game progresses, and it makes for the rapid formation and dissolution of alliances as the game landscape changes. You might be able to tell that the Gaming Chums consider the highest art of Cosmic Encounter to be the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and form alliances on the fly.
There is an age-old stand-by for making a game more cut-throat: Making the loss or gain of something valuable contingent on the outcome, which is to say, a gentlemanly wager. Poker in all its various lucrative incarnations is a mere trifle if one removes the element of the wager and the profit and loss which can occur throughout an evening, unlike, say, fizzbin**. Money is beneath the notice of gentlemen (also ladies, and cats) so the Gaming Chums use other wagers. Before I go any further, I trust I need not belabour the point that in any game involving wagers of any sort, the rules, victory conditions, and stakes must be understood in advance by all parties, and that in the event of a dispute, a source of binding arbitration such as an uninvolved party must be sought? Also, while it is acceptable to taunt the defeated, the spirit of gamesmanship frowns mightily upon behaviour that discourages rematches and future game sessions.
It is considered uncouth to announce your royal flush with indiscriminate gunfire.
One of my first initiations into the honourable wager was Magic: The Gathering's ante. At the beginning of play, a single (non-land) card was extracted from each deck, and the winner gained possession of both. I had friends who refused to play with ante, but I consider them misguided. The ante made each game feel more like it mattered in the grand scheme of things, and it became a tradition, and then after a while a house rule, to use cards won in ante as much as possible in the next gaming session against the previous owner, to both give them a small chance to win them back, and to taunt them for their previous loss. I faced several losses against a deck constructed solely to flaunt the Black Mana Battery that was once mine, and I responded in kind with the Royal Assassin I took from him.
You might have heard of an obscure little science-fiction show called Firefly. I am given to believe it has achieved a certain degree of popularity. One nice touch that I observed was that in the episode entitled “Shindig”, poker was played not for money or score, but for chores. Chores that needed doing were placed on tokens and distributed to the players, and the final holder of the tokens representing each chore was exempted from having to perform that chore. I find that to be a particularly interesting variation on the traditional wager, as unlike cash, there is only subjective, and no objective, value placed on each wager. One player might consider the token marked “polish silverware” or “cleanse Earl Grey's litter box” to be immensely valuable, while another who does not fear such a task (unlikely on the second example) might consider it to be a low-value token, and play accordingly. This sets up a rather interesting dynamic, where each player must not only evaluate their own cards and chances, but also weigh their personal evaluation of the current pot to establish their current playing stance. In the same way, now the Gaming Chums no longer actively play Magic we use Magic cards as tokens of value for wagering purposes, and each of us has our own opinion of the value of each card, by its rarity, condition, game power, artwork, and sentimental value.
The Gaming Chums of course play for the pleasure and the honour of the competition, but at the end of each gaming session one participant is awarded The Fez in a solemn ritual that I may not speak of to outsiders. The Fez is the symbol of ultimate gaming prowess, and it goes home with the victor. At the next gaming session, the last winner of the Fez wears it proudly***, and is addressed as “Your Fezship”, and it is Their (or Her) Fezship who determines the next wearer of the Fez, often by declaring a particular instance of a game to be a Fez Game. A Fez Game is always highly contested. Other times the Fez is awarded by decree from the Fez holder, for conspicuous gallantry or particularly impressive play.
Next month: Something different. I shall play Mage Wars for the first time, without reading any the rules, and without recourse to a rulebook, against an opponent similarly ignorant, and report back for your interest and edification. Can we negotiate a set of coherent rules between us even as we play? Or will the entire affair devolve into a shambolic mess ending with pistols at dawn? I have no idea, and I intend to find out.

There's a Larry David movie coming to HBO.
Don't ask what it's called. Don't ask what it's about. Larry David will star and executive produce the film. Greg Mottola (Superbad, Paul) will direct.
Beyond that, HBO isn't saying much — except that it's not a Curb Your Enthusiasm movie. And the film is going to occupy David's HBO efforts for the time being, executives say, which means Curb isn't going to return for a ninth season anytime soon.
“It means whatever [for Curb that] Larry wants it to mean,” HBO co-president Richard Plepler said. “He has essentially carte blanche. When they want [Curb] to come back, we'll be thrilled.”
“I don't think he's closed the door to another season of Curb,” fellow HBO co-president Lombardo added.
HBO has aired eight seasons of Curb since 2000 and executives have long given David plenty of production schedule leeway. Last year's eighth season premiered to 1.7 million viewers after a hiatus of almost two years.
Also, remember the Entourage movie? Well that might still happen. HBO executives told critics at TCA that creator Doug Ellin is writing the script. “We'd still have to make deals with the cast and figure out if this is something that makes sense or not,” Lombardo said.
HBO also made a couple of announcements: Girls and Enlightened will return for their second seasons in January. The network is also planning a Rolling Stones documentary featuring current and previous band members.
Romney: It's not torture unless you admit it Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published: Sunday January 13, 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This CNN's Wolf Blitzer assails GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney over their lack of a definite opinion on whether the widely debated interrogation method known as "waterboarding" is torture. Even as competitor and Arizona senator John McCain, along with United States Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, define "waterboarding" as torture, Romney remains strategically undecided. "I just don't think it's productive for a president of the United States to lay out a list of what is specifically referred to as 'torture,'" they respond. Citing "ticking time bomb" scenarios, Romney disagrees with the notion of admitting that a particular practice could violate the Geneva Convention, thereby preventing its utilization by the United States in the event of an urgent need to extract information to, for example, prevent a nuclear attack. Romney touts the element of surprise, which, in addition to the deliberate creation of a legal grey area on what breaches international treaty, leaves a detainee at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing for what acts one can expect an agent acting on behalf of the United States to perform once one is captured. Says Romney, "We have found it wise in the past not to describe precisely the techniques of interrogation that are used here in this country--also, so that people who are captured don't know what might be used against them." The President, Romney concludes, is responsible for orders handed down to an interrogator, but also has the right to determine what is an appropriate interrogation technique to order an agent to perform. The exchange can be viewed below, as aired on CNN's Late Edition on January 13, 2008.
Bryce Harper. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)
Bryce Harper and the Nationals avoided a grievance hearing over their 2015 salary with a deal late Sunday night, when General Manager Mike Rizzo and Harper's agent, Scott Boras, completed the details of a two-year, $7.5 million contract that covers their 2015 and 2016 salaries.
Boras, in New York in anticipation of Tuesday's now-unnecessary hearing, stopped by a New York Supreme Court hearing regarding the longstanding dispute between the Nationals and Mid-Atlantic Sports Network and later explained what happened between the Nationals and Harper, and the star player's absence from NatsFest on Saturday in Washington.
“I'm glad there's a resolution to it,” Boras said of the settlement. “I think both sides think it was fair.”
Harper, Boras and the Nationals had been at odds over how their salary would be determined because of a rare dispute over the contract they signed as a first-round draft pick in 2010. Boras believed Harper had the right to opt out of their prescribed 2015 salary ($1.5 million) and into baseball's lucrative arbitration system. The Nationals contended their contract did not include the ability to opt out because such language had never been included in the deal. Instead, under the settlement, Harper will make $2.5 million in 2015 and $5 million in 2016.
Over the weekend, Harper did not attend the team's annual NatsFest fan rally Saturday, citing “matters out of my control.” General Manager Mike Rizzo said they were “disappointed” in Harper and declared Harper had stayed away because of the pending grievance. In Boras's words, this is why Harper didn't attend:
“The union has witness preparation,” they said. “They have all things you can do to prepare a player for arbitration. And frankly, that proceeding would have been affected by this hearing because all kinds of national reporters and such would have shown up to that. The fan fest purpose would have been, in many ways, certainly interrupted because of the attention Bryce would have had and the amount of press that would have showed up to discuss this matter not what the intentions of the fan fest were. So from a legal perspective and out of respect for the fan fest itself, you didn't want to bring a distraction to that event.”
Asked specifically about Rizzo's comment, Boras said they couldn't address it and felt that Harper handled themselves well throughout this process. As far as any potential animosity created by either side, Boras believes the Nationals and Harper came to a positive agreement for the future. Harper isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2018 season.
“Part of the resolution for both sides is that you resolve something amicably among yourselves so that you continue to work together,” Boras said. “That was achieved.”
Because Harper skipped NatsFest, Boras said they and the Nationals are hoping to plan an event for later this winter in which Harper will come to Washington to meet with fans. Boras said “Bryce wants to do” this.
“We're going to try to work this out with the Nationals, and he's going to try to be there for the fans,” Boras added.

Senator Simon Birmingham's September declaration that Australia would establish a space agency created a buzz across the space sector.
The announcement was unexpected. Few anticipated any government commitment until after Dr Megan Clark's expert panel reported on Australia's space industry capability in March 2018.
Establishing an agency is a sensible decision and rightly has bipartisan support. But the hard work in determining the shape of the agency has only just begun.
In forming the new agency, much has already been said about what it might do. But how the agency is set up will be just as important to success.
My five steps to an effective agency are: include both “new” and “old” space, give the agency actual power, make the most of the space “brain drain” and work cooperatively with the Department of Defence.
Today I'm pleased to announce on behalf of the Turnbull Government that Australia will have a space agency #IAC2017 🛰🚀 pic.twitter.com/2pd9HoVi8f — Simon Birmingham (@Birmo) September 25, 2017
The new pathway to space
The most startling recent evolution in space is that there is more money on the table. Venture capital funding for space projects in each of 2015 and 2016 exceeded the total of all venture capital investments in space since 2000.
Australia has more than 43 small businesses focused on the space sector. This growth has been driven by a rapidly falling cost to participate in space activities. The cost and weight of satellites has plummeted as the technologies that deliver small, affordable smartphones found space applications.
Innovation, competition and ride-sharing on launch vehicles – think Elon Musk's SpaceX and Auckland-based startup Rocket Lab – have reduced per-kilo prices to space, and costs will likely fall further.
In this rapidly changing environment, here are my five recommendations for space agency success.
1. Grow the ‘new space' market
The “new space” market is characterised by projects focused on commercial return, particularly small satellites. This is a fast growing sector with existing companies that can deliver Australian technology jobs and export revenue.
To make the most of this existing pool of potential, the agency should fund widely with small amounts, just enough to prove concepts or encourage commercial participation. It should draw on venture capital in assembling this portfolio, as the CSIRO and the UK Space Agency are doing.
2. Do not neglect ‘old space'
Despite the hype around small satellites and commercial space, Australia should not neglect altogether the “old space” of large, reliable and expensive satellites. These are still the mainstay of the industry, and the training ground from which many startups spring.
Precisely because the work proceeds more slowly, old space offers steady cash flow to complement the precarious financing arrangements of many of the new space businesses. New space companies that can also sell hardware or services to old space companies are particularly valuable.
The path here is clear: the agency should work closely with existing trade programs to help the Australian space industry break into global supply chains, in particular helping business navigate restrictive foreign export and labour laws.
3. Give the space agency ‘teeth'
It is not enough for the agency to develop a paper vision for the Australian space sector; it needs the power to make it a reality.
Historically, Australia's civilian space strategy has been fragmented by a bureaucratic turf war across agencies including CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia and the Department of Industry.
Now state and territory governments are joining the fray. South Australia recently launched a Space Industry Centre, and in October Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Barr visited SpaceX and other aerospace giants on the US West Coast “to discuss opportunities”.
South Australia looks for accelerators and incubators to support space industry startups https://t.co/6gtgX4CApA — Martin HamiltonSmith (@HamiltonSmith) October 25, 2017
Australia's agency needs the authority to impose national strategic discipline. The government could give the agency undisputed policy authority, for example, by making it a small group within Prime Minister and Cabinet. Or the agency could be given purse-string power by allocating the civilian federal space budget through it rather than the existing patchwork of agencies.
Anything less will make the agency a contested and ineffective leader for the Australian space sector.
4. Bring back home-grown talent
There is a wealth of Australians who have gone overseas to pursue space careers. Many were back home for September's International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, and were keen to contribute to the success of the agency.
The federal government should be flexible enough to include these dynamic individuals and accelerate the first years of the agency. For example, somebody like Christopher Boshuizen, the Australian co-founder of space startup Planet – on the path to “unicorn” US$1 billion valuation – would be a great asset working on behalf of Australian space startups.
Such talent would kick-start the late-blooming agency with world-class credibility and instant connections to global activity.
5. Work with Defence
A civilian space agency needs to establish a relationship of mutual respect with the Department of Defence space sector, while each maintains primacy in its own sphere.
Defence has substantial space experience, both directly and through Australia's US alliance. And investments in national security space dwarf civilian spend. For example, Defence recently announced a decade-long program worth A$500 million to develop domestic satellite imagery capabilities.
With the right relationship, Defence would increase access to the agility and innovation of the commercial sector and the civilian agency would benefit from the experience of Defence personnel.
As Senator Birmingham announced Australia's plans to the world's largest civilian space conference (September 2017's International Astronautical Congress), they were speaking to many who have lived through Australia's big talk on space. We've experienced failed launch proposals on Christmas Island and Cape York, and the rise and fall of the Hawke government's “Australian Space Office”.
Birmingham made an announcement on the biggest possible stage. The “how” will be as important as the “what” if we are to make good this time on high expectations.

A star was born, and their name was Robbie Keane.
Here was a man, nay, a boy, with skill that almost defied belief, writes Wolves correspondent Tim Spiers.
They could do things not witnessed at Molineux for decades. Appropriately for an Irishman, their legs moved as quickly as Michael Flatley's.
They took players on for fun, the ball stuck to their feet in such a manner that you questioned whether they had velcro on theirs boots.
And they were 17.
While Keane's impact was a shock to many, those behind the scenes at Wolves had seen it coming.
They had moved to Molineux a year earlier on their 16th birthday, spurning offers from Premier League sides Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the belief they would have a better chance of first team football at Wolves.
Keane continued to impress at moving to Wolverhampton, scoring 36 goals in a single season for the youth team.
Advertising
The Express & Star reported at the time: "At one stage, Keane, although spotted by Irish-based Wolves scout Eddie Corcoran, seemed certain to join Forest after being given a red-carpet weekend in the East Midlands, including a chauffeur and the thrill of meeting Frank Clark's first-team stars in the tunnel before a match against Chelsea.
"But, once they had returned home to consider, Wolves made one final trip across the Irish Sea to try to tempt him.
"They had glimpsed that exciting ability and Graham Taylor backed the judgement of youth development officer Chris Evans and youth coach Robert Kelly.
"Contract in hand, the club finally got their boy, although they had remained adamant they should join them for football reasons, not financial ones.
Advertising
"Perseverance was followed by considerable after-care. Chairman Jonathan Hayward has been spotted at youth matches more than once and, when Evans suggested last week that the parents should be at Carrow Road on debut day, manager Mark McGhee needed little persuading."
The goals themselves were moments of genius - the first an improbably powerful left-footed half-volley on the spin, the second a breathtaking inside flick which left defender Victor Segura on their backside, before poking cheekily through the legs of keeper Andy Marshall and past the despairing dives of two more defenders.
[youtube] [youtube/]
McGhee described their debutant as 'mesmerising'.
"We nearly fell over the balcony when they scored their first goal," Keane's mother Anne said. "I doubt whether the directors' box has ever seen anything like it!"
They took their superstar son out to dinner to celebrate. Keane drank blackcurrant and lemonade.
They scored 11 goals in total that season, 16 in 1998/99, and then two at the start of the 1999/2000 campaign, before Wolves could clip their wings no longer.
Coventry, Inter Milan, Leeds, Spurs, Liverpool, Celtic, West Ham, Villa and LA Galaxy have all been blessed by Keane's talent since, as of course have Ireland, with whom Keane is set for a swansong this summer at Euro 2016.
But Wolves had them first, an unpolished gem with the world at their feet.
Voodoo Economics
Finally…we're back in London. We left at the beginning of April…went to San Diego and Los Angeles…then to Buenos Aires and Salta…then to Paris for a few days.. and now we're back. London is cold and rainy…just like we left it. Not exactly home…but it will do.
But what's this?
The City seems to be winding down. All those hot shots in the financial sector aren't so hot any more. In the space of just ten years, the percentage of GDP generated by the financial sector almost doubled – from 5.5% in 1996 to 10.8% a decade later. But now the whole sector is shrinking…along with bonuses…payrolls…and expense accounts.
And since Britain counted so heavily on the financial high fliers and their money…the whole country seems to have gone into a funk.
Tax revenues are collapsing. Deficits are soaring. The U.K.'s national budget deficit is already at 12%…about even with the United States. But if current trends continue, she'll soon have the largest deficit in the developed world.
But here comes the bad news. Your editor didn't mind when investor and speculators lost trillions. They barely noticed when the U.S. government practically nationalized the largest banks, insurance and automobile companies. They hardly blinked when $13 trillion of the nation's treasure was committed to a foolhardy effort to combat capitalism. But now they are going too far.
In an effort to raise money, the British government is raising your editor's taxes! Yes…your poor editor pays taxes in several countries. And now the Brits are raising their rates to levels that rival those of the highest tax jurisdictions in the world – Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.
The trouble with this strategy is that your editor just bought a pair of Argentine boots. And these boots are made for walking. If these news taxes pinch too hard they – and thousands of other people working, vaguely, in the financial sector – is likely to walk right out of here.
But to where? Ah…there's the rub. All over the world, governments are desperate to get out of the mess they've gotten themselves in. Argentina and Ireland just got handouts from the IMF. Other countries are getting in line. Having spent far too much in the past, they now spend more – hoping that spending will miraculously bring about economic growth. We say “miraculously” because there is no other way to explain it. When economic growth results from saving, investing and hard work you can describe it in terms of ‘cause and effect.' But if you ever get economic growth simply by spending money, you can only refer to it as an act of God…or the devil. Black magic, maybe. Voodoo economics.
Hardly a day goes by without some abracadabra or hocus pocus announcement. The feds bail out the banks on Monday. On Tuesday, they take over the auto industry. By Wednesday, they're passing out money on Wall Street. If any of these tactics result in greater wealth or more output – it will be a miracle.
One question that has so far been avoided by practically all the commentators and well-wishers is this: where's the money come from? In the popular mind, if you can call it that, the government's pockets are infinitely deep. Reach down far enough and you will pull up whatever resources you need. But the fact of the matter is a bit different. In time of war, a government can marshal the resources of an entire nation. People believe they must buy war bonds, collect old metal, use rationing coupons, forego salary increases, pay higher taxes, and sign up for the Home Guard. Every back bends to the job; better that than bending to the lash, people say to themselves.
But the war against capitalism is not getting the same level of popular support. People are not buying “war bonds” so the feds can bail out Wall Street or the City. They're not likely to eat margarine so the bankers can slather real butter on both sides of their bread. And they're not willing to spend less just so the government can spend more.
So instead of asking the whole population to suffer, the feds – both in Britain and back at home in America – have chosen an easy target…the rich!
In the public mind, ‘rich' and ‘banker' are inseparable. Like ‘corrupt' and ‘politician.' What's more, the rich were at the scene of the crime when the financial crisis began. The rich were caught red-handed. It doesn't matter if the ‘rich' man earned their money from doing heart operations or selling vegetables. Every rich person is presumed guilty of the crime of the century. “Tax them!” screams the mob. Tax them! Tax them! Eat them.
And so, it will come to pass that ‘the rich' are taxed. The money will be taken from them and given to…well…the rich. But these will be different rich people – bondholders…bankers…insiders…hustlers and anglers.
Now, we turn to Addison, who is busy deciphering the GDP numbers:
“Well, ‘less awful' it is: The Commerce Department says first-quarter GDP dropped an annualized 6.1%,” writes Addison in today's issue of The 5 Min. Forecast.
“That's a tough number. Wonks, quants and analysts on Wall Street expected an annualized 4.6% decline. But the ‘official' number is still a minuscule improvement over the 6.3% rate for the fourth quarter of last year.
“But lest you should strive to breathe easy, put the two quarters together and you have the weakest six months in the U.S economy since 1957-58. One more quarter of contraction and we'll officially have the longest recession since the Great Depression.
“One caveat: Commerce issues three estimates of quarterly GDP growth, and this is just the first. Expect revisions.
“The GDP numbers form an interesting backdrop for today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. The Fed's “deflation boogeyman” is retreating, for one. Personal consumption grew 2.2% in the first quarter… much better than the 4.9% decline in the previous quarter.
“So what will the Fed do? Predictions in mainstream financial media run all over the map. One says the Fed will hold off on any more purchases of Treasuries and mortgage securities as long as ‘green shoots' (like the housing and consumer confidence numbers yesterday) keep showing up in the economic data.
“Another speculates some sort of loose-money measures are in the offing to fight the economic effects of the swine flu outbreak.
“We're not going to venture a guess. We'll only remind you that in the Fed's fantasy world, interest rates right now would be at minus 5%. And go from there.”
Each weekday, Addison brings readers The 5 Min Forecast, an executive series e-letter that provides a quick and dirty analysis of daily economic and financial developments – in five minutes or less.
And back to Bill with more thoughts:
The Dow fell 8 points yesterday. Oil slipped below $50. Gold slipped too – below $900.
What gives? As far as we can tell, the rally that began in March continues.
While it might peter out any day, we continue to believe that this market intends bloody mayhem…and that it won't stop until it has killed both the bulls and the bears.
The bulls will be killed in the classic way. A strong rally on Wall Street…or a series of minor ones… will lead them to believe that “the worst is over.” They'll get back into stocks after a 20% or 30% advance – hoping to recover what they lost last year.
Then, the stock market will make a new dramatic move to the downside. This will probably happen several times…each time leaving bullish investors with more losses. Finally, the bulls will give up. They will sell stocks…driving prices down and dividend yields up. By the time the bottom is reached, former investors will neither know nor care. P/Es will be scarcely more than 5. Dividend yields will rise above 5%. The Dow will sink to 3,000 – 5,000.
Then, it will be the bears' turn. When stock prices go down, they'll sit smugly with their cash, Treasuries and gold. But gold will not resist the deflationary whirlpool. It could get sucked down violently…or might just float down gently, remaining low for a long time. Either way, the gold bulls will give up. Only the gold bugs will hold on. Cash and Treasuries, meanwhile, will look smart – for a while. Then, suddenly, they will look like the stupidest investment on the planet. In a matter of days…maybe weeks…the dollar could lose half or more of its value. Savers will suffer staggering losses.
No, dear reader, the months ahead will be a challenge. The world economy is telling a story no one has ever read before. Every day we turn the page just to see what happens. We have no idea how the story might develop. It's all guesswork.
Still, when the final chapter is read out…the moral of the story will probably be familiar to us. It always is.
China has increased their gold holdings 75% in the last six years. They recently announced that the gold holdings have been transferred from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) books to the People's Bank of China. PBOC. Our intrepid correspondent, Byron King explains what this really means:
“China is monetizing its gold!
“This SAFE-to-PBOC transfer marks a profound decision by Chinese government leaders. Obviously, the Chinese government has bought gold over the past six years. But in keeping with a nation where youngsters get their Sun Tzu with their mother's milk, the Chinese went through an internal debate over whether to add the gold holdings to the official Chinese monetary reserves. That is, if the gold was not “monetary,” then it was just another nonmonetary investment commodity like iron ore or copper or petroleum.
“But now, with the announcement by the Chinese Central Bank, it appears that the debate is resolved. The gold has been added to Chinese monetary reserves.
“This action by China is part and parcel of an under-the-radar global effort to rehabilitate gold as a monetary reserve asset. Gold has not been a factor in global trade and currency exchange since the late 1960s. But there's a powerful movement afoot in the world to reestablish gold as part of an international monetary system. It's because the U.S. dollar has been so badly mismanaged over the decades. No, you won't read about it in your local newspaper, or even in the standard, mainstream business media. But that movement is out there. It's happening.
“So now the Chinese are primed to begin using gold as a monetary asset. What's the practical impact? I expect to see central banks worldwide start to add gold to their monetary reserves. The floodgates are opening. The PBOC and other central banks from here to Timbuktu are going to become net purchasers of gold in the years ahead. In the future, only central bank suckers and losers will be net sellers of gold. (Take note, IMF.)
“And people who own physical gold, as well as shares in well-managed mining companies, will benefit greatly. Need I say more?”
The plane coming back from Buenos Aires wasn't full. Air traffic is down 11% from a year earlier.
And this was before people began worrying about swine flu.
Today, commentators are fretting about how a serious epidemic would affect the “recovery.” They needn't worry. First, because there is no genuine recovery to worry about. Second, because if a serious epidemic were to hit the world, economic growth would be the least of our problems.
Until tomorrow,

The Daily Reckoning
Everyone will be affected by an unprecedented overhaul of the tax system, Revenue Minister Todd McClay says.
All New Zealanders may once again be required to have some contact with the Inland Revenue Department each year under proposals set out in a discussion document on Tuesday.
Some wage earners in steady jobs may not have had to have any dealings with the tax department since a rule change in the 1990s did away with the need for most people to file tax returns.
But that could change with the completion of Inland Revenue's $1 billion-plus Business Transformation project, according to a discussion paper released by McClay and Finance Minister Bill English.
The paper proposes all New Zealanders might need to check and confirm an online statement to ensure they did not have income that had missed the taxman. For the "vast majority" no other action would be needed, the department said.
It is not yet clear how Inland Revenue would cater for people who did not have access to the internet. However, another discussion paper on digital services said internet kiosks could be one way people could deal with the department.
READ MORE: 'PAYE' plan for company tax
Inland Revenue said some people were currently "cherry-picking" by filing a tax return or requesting a personal tax summary in years when they thought they were due a tax refund, and not doing so when that might mean they had additional tax to pay.
In 2012, 38 per cent of taxpayers - or 1.6 million people - chose not to request an end-of-year check. Inland Revenue said making people look over an annual statement would restore fairness to the tax system and stop people being "forced into a gamble" over whether to request a tax summary.
The change runs counter to the main thrust of the transformation project, which is it to make it simpler for people and businesses to comply with the tax system by helping Inland Revenue deduct the right amount of tax from salaries, dividends and profits through the year.
A new computer system will let Inland Revenue get more of a "real time" view of the income people and businesses receive and the tax they pay. That should mean fewer and smaller tax bills and refunds at the end of the year.
Inland Revenue estimated in 2012 that its Business Transformation programme would cost between $1b and $1.5b and would take 10 years to complete. But McClay said this was the first time the Government had been able to say what it could deliver.
"Bringing everybody back into the system" would become possible because of the better information Inland Revenue would have, they said.
Tax refunds could be automatically paid to people's bank accounts at the end of the year. If there was tax to pay, Inland Revenue could "potentially" automatically collect it by increasing the tax it took from people's future savings and investment income.
The changes would impact tax refund companies which help people claim tax refunds from Inland Revenue. But even if the refund business dried up, McClay said there would be opportunities for the tax advisory profession to offer people advice.
Submissions on the proposals close on May 29, but no changes will kick in soon given the transformation programme is expected to take several more years to complete.
Two separate fires on the site of the abandoned sixties-era Spreepark in Berlin have destroyed a large part of the remaining buildings and scenery. Nobody was hurt.
Fires 200 metres apart were discovered at the site had been a favourite with tourists, trespassers and urban explorers.
Firemen had to for call police assistance after the scale of fires, thought to have broken out around midnight, became clear.
Emergency services were alerted just before 1am after a fire was spotted in the western part of the 5,000 m2 parks, where buildings of a mock-western town were located.
Hurrying towards the scene, firefighters spotted the flames from a distance and called in back-up.
Click here for pictures of the blaze
"Old houses and scenery were burning," the fire service wrote in a statement. Over 100 firefighters were deployed many of them with heavy equipment and breathing masks.
Firemen had difficulty battling the blaze in the remote area, as the nearest water hydrants were situated 1.5 kilometres away.
Police and fire service boats were sent in to help the emergency workers by pumping water over from the nearby Spree river.
"Due to the very difficult water supply situation several police and fire service multipurpose boats were alerted," emergency services said.
The buildings of a fake Western-style town completely destroyed in the blaze, which the fire service said they had put out by 4.30am.
The park in the Plänterwald forest borders Berlin's south-eastern Treptower Park.
Originally opened in the late 1960s in what was then East Berlin as Kulturpark and revamped as Spreepark after reunification, the theme park closed in 2002 after the owners went bust and left the country.
It has since become a cult favourite of trespassers and urban explorers. More recently, tourists have been able to go on tours of the park's rusting old rides.

Bild newspaper reported that Berlin city authorities bought the area this spring and ordered the previous owners to clear it - an order which had so far been ignored.
Police are treating the incident as arson and have launched an investigation.

Cooking dinner, washing dishes, doing laundry: these are just some of the everyday activities a family deals with in their home. Becky Eckle has a family of six to clean up after: their husband Tom, their daughter Samantha, their son Kris, and two ghosts.
The Eckle family has been coping with paranormal activity at their home, on the corner of Urban and South Wells streets, since moving in nearly nine years ago. Becky, a Tyler County native, moved back to the area to be closer to their mother.
“I was born here, I was born in Sistersville,” said Eckle. “I've moved around a lot. I lived in North Carolina for a while. I lived in Parkersburg for a while.”
The Eckles bought the house, traced back to the 1870s, from Walker Boyd in 2000. For the first three years in the home, the family got on just fine with no major commotions.
But after the Eckles began some new renovation work, the former inhabitants made their presence known.
“We started remodeling the bedroom,” said Becky. “We had already done the living room, put drywall up, and then we did the bathroom. My daughter and I weren't here or my son; just my husband was here. They were asleep on the couch and they had made a blowout patch where they had made a hole in the wrong spot to cover it up.
There were little chunks of drywall lying on the floor and Samantha had been playing with them. They stacked them up and they were in the bedroom. When they woke up the next morning, they were thrown at him; they were on them and on the floor beside of him, and nobody else was here.”
From that moment on, the spirits started causing trouble in the Eckle household. Becky's husband wasn't the only one to notice the ghosts. Them daughter Samantha also noticed the new entities.
“Some friends were over, then my little girl (asked) us ‘where's the little boy at that plays with bubby?' I said what little boy? ‘You know, that little boy that plays with bubby.' Bo? ‘No, not Bo. You know, that little boy. They play in bubby's room and sometimes they play in your room. They have red hair and a green shirt.' We all just kind of looked at her; they were probably 3-years-old when they told us that.”
The family believes there are two different spirits: a young boy and an adult male. It's been difficult for Becky to get solid information on the house and its former inhabitants.
“I traced the house back when I traced the property back…but we don't know the exact year the house was built,” said Becky. “If I ever get a chance, I'd like to know. We've asked people, but there aren't a whole lot of older people around anymore that still know. We know a Hedelson lived here; I got that from the courthouse.”
The incidents in the Eckle household are your typical ghost incidents: random noises, creaky floors, moving objects, opening and closing doors, etc. The major encounters only seem to occur when major renovations are going on.
“One night we were all laying in bed; Tom's dad was here helping them work,” said Becky. “All of a sudden seven or eight of my pictures on the wall all came flying off the wall. There's no way even my cat could have done that. It just looked like somebody spread their arms and went right through the wall and knocked all my pictures off.”
The ghosts not only affect physical objects, but also the very temperature of some of their rooms.
“There's one room in the house that always stays cold,” said Becky. “Nobody can sleep in there. We have an electric heater we try to put in there and it will warm up some, but it's not like the rest of the house; it's very cold.”
While some might scoff at the notion of ghosts and spirits, but not the Eckles; they have the pictures to prove it.
“I have a picture of a ghost my daughter took in this house,” said Becky. “It's on my cell phone. They were playing around with my cell phone and as far as I know my cell phone does not take black and white pictures. It's a black and white picture. It was on the wall in the living room; they took a picture of the wall and there it was.”
There are many groups with the ability to measure paranormal activity in a home, such as The Atlantic Paranormal Society (T.A.P.S.) or the Mid Ohio Valley Ghosthunters. Becky hasn't had the chance yet, but they would like to consult with someone.
“We had talked about it and we were going to,” said Becky. “Some of my friends, after Samantha took that picture, wanted us to call T.A.P.S. or someone, but I never got to do that yet.”
For now, the Eckles are content to share the home with their phantom friends. Other than an incident here and there, Becky said that ghost activity is now as routine as cleaning the house.
“Sometimes it will still freak you out,” said Becky. “I was cleaning out the lint catcher in the dryer and I thought, at first, it was my shadow I was seeing, but it wasn't my shadow because it wasn't moving the same direction I was, and that made me come out of the dryer pretty quick. Other than that, it's pretty routine. You just learn to deal with it.”
“They don't seem to be harmful,” added Becky. “Every once in a while I've been touched on the shoulder when I'm in the shower. Other than that they don't seem to be harmful, but everyone is like ‘I can't believe you live in that house,' and I'm like ‘well, they lived here first apparently.'”
UFC featherweight Artem Lobov believes that Khabib Nurmagomedov owes a lot of their Russian following to Conor McGregor, as the Irishman has been one of the driving forces behind the sport going mainstream in the country.
Recently, Dana White said that McGregor is interested in meeting ‘The Eagle' in Russia following their boxing bout with Floyd Mayweather, in an interview with MMAJunkie.com.
‘The Russian Hammer' thinks that MMA is the biggest sport in their homeland at the moment. For that reason, they are confident that a UFC event would be a massive success should it take place.
“It would be absolutely huge,” Lobov told MMA Fighting.
“Every time I go to Russia I get the feeling that (MMA) is the biggest sport in the country right now. It's the coolest sport at the moment. Men and women love it. It's become mainstream and there are a number of reasons for that.
“A personality like Conor's appeals to the Russian people a lot. He's always ready to go, they knock people out and he's tough. Obviously, Fedor Emelianenko is a huge national treasure. The president, Vladimir Putin, is a huge fan of theirs and the sport in general.
“All of these things have made the sport very important over there, and as a result of that, MMA is very popular. When you have a sport that is so popular and a guy like Conor is at the top of their game, that provides the fans with a lot of talking points.  They are the guy that everyone knows over there.”
Lobov frequents Russia for commentary duties having recently signed to be the voice of the Fight Nights Global. They revealed that many Russian fighters are thankful for McGregor raising the profile of MMA.
“When I talk to Russian fighters when I'm over there they are very thankful and complimentary of Conor,” Lobov said. “They see them as one of the main factors behind MMA becoming mainstream in Russia. The pay for most fighters has increased as the popularity of MMA has increased. They are definitely feeling the McGregor effect in the East.”
According to Lobov, with Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup, the nation boasts several of state-of-the-art, all-weather facilities that would be capable of hosting a big UFC event.
It seems likely that Nurmagomedov would be the driving force behind a UFC card in Russia, but Lobov believes that their countryman's fan base was built on the back of McGregor bringing so much attention to the sport.
“It would be very hard to say who would be the bigger draw in Russia between Khabib and Conor. I honestly feel that Khabib is as big as they are in Russia because of Conor McGregor,” Lobov said.
“As I said, Conor is the guy who has made MMA a hot topic in Russia. More and more Russians started watching the UFC when Conor came along. The more they watched, the more they understood it. Then, all of a sudden you get this Russian guy coming along and of course the Russian people put their support behind him.”
Lobov also suggested that a lot of Russian fans are “unhappy” with Nurmagomedov's frequent withdrawals from high profile bouts.
“A lot of people in Russian aren't happy with how Khabib has been behaving with all of their pullouts,” Lobov said, “This isn't a very manly thing to do, not showing up for a fight. In Russia, the people have been brought up tough. It used to be the Soviet Union. The thing everybody thinks of when they think about Russia is how tough the people are.
“When they see a fighter continuously pulling out, that's something that they really don't like. Then they look at a guy like Conor who always shows up and does what they say he's going to do. That really resonates with the Russian public.”
Should the Russian event come to fruition, Lobov expects support to be divided between Nurmagomedov and McGregor.
They said: “If a fight happens between Conor and Khabib in Russia, the support would be divided between them. It would be 50-50.
“There would be a lot of support for Conor. If you factor in the Irish that would travel over, there might be even more people supporting Conor at the event even though it would be taking place in Russia.”
When it comes to jobs, it turns out that our gut feeling was right.
New data released last week showed that the Buffalo Niagara job market last year was stronger than the tepid numbers initially reported in January.
In fact, 2016 was the best year for hiring in the last 17 years. And with hiring on the upswing, wages also are on the rise, giving workers a double-dose of good news.
While the cranes and the flurry of construction made it easy to see that something good was happening in the Buffalo Niagara region, the skeptics among us wanted statistical proof that what we were seeing really was different this time.
And until last week, the numbers sometimes told a very different story from the buzz we were feeling in the community. Those numbers initially said 2016 was just another average year in the Buffalo Niagara region, not much different from any of the previous five years, and not even as good as 2011. And nobody looks back on 2011 as the good old days.
Not anymore.
Newly revised data that the state Labor Department released last week showed that our gut feeling was right. 2016 will go down as having the Buffalo Niagara region's strongest job growth since 1999. It was even a little stronger than 2011.
Even better, with the steady wave of hiring pushing unemployment down to around 5 percent and the state's push to raise the minimum wage driving up earnings for the lowest-paid workers, overall wages are on the upswing, too, rising by 6.1 percent during the third quarter, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week.
More jobs mean more people working. More people working means more people making – and spending – money. Higher wages also mean those workers have more money to spend, making the ripple effect even stronger.
“I think we have to be pretty happy,” said Gary Keith, M&T Bank's regional economist in Buffalo. “We grew better than we thought, which is going to pump more through the economy with those paychecks.”
The revised data showed that Buffalo Niagara added jobs at a 1 percent annual pace last year. That was more than 40 percent faster than the 0.7 percent increase that the original set of job data showed.
The private sector work force – essentially everyone who doesn't work for the government – has grown every month for seven straight years.
But don't get carried away with glee. That's good by local standards, but the Buffalo Niagara job market still isn't growing nearly as fast as the rest of the country, which grew by 1.6 percent last year and hasn't had the pace of hiring dip below 1 percent during any of the last six years.
Even so, 1 percent job growth is pretty good, especially in a region where the population is stagnant. It's a lot easier to add jobs when your population is growing, and that's a big reason why the pace of hiring here almost always is slower than it is nationwide.
“The 1 percent population growth nationally is the difference,” Keith said. “Elsewhere, there's growth among young families. Here, our problem is that we don't have enough babies.”
More people usually means more jobs.
“No, we're not growing as fast as some other areas,” said John Slenker, the Labor Department's regional economist in Buffalo. “But are we growing faster than we were? I think the answer is definitely, yes.”
“The best way to compare Buffalo, N.Y., is to compare it with Buffalo, N.Y.,” Slenker said. “We're different from the Sun Belt. We're different from the West Coast. We are not New York City or Washington, D.C., or Atlanta.”
Those places wouldn't start buzzing about a tower crane rising above downtown. Big construction projects, like HarborCenter, the SolarCity factory and the growth of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus caused a stir here because we hadn't seen anything like it in decades. In other cities, they'd be just another big development project.
“We're outpacing our population growth,” Slenker said. “That's going to attract more workers.”
So why is the Buffalo Niagara job market growing faster? There are a few reasons:
• Our financial services sector is on a roll. Banks like M&T have been expanding nationally, bringing more work to their Buffalo headquarters. The KeyCorp purchase of First Niagara Bank didn't result in the massive job cuts that were feared.
It also helps that the Buffalo Niagara region is a fairly cheap place for banks and other financial services firms to do back office work, especially compared with places like New York City, Boston or Chicago.
Our average wages in the financial services sector are 11 percent less than the national average for the industry. So it's not terribly surprising that financial services firms looking to save a few bucks have noticed, to the point where we now have 11 percent more financial services jobs than the typical U.S. metro area.
The growth has been strong and steady, too. Hiring in the financial services sector has topped 3.4 percent annually during each of the past two years – more than three times the growth rate for the entire region.
• The building boom has helped, pushing construction employment to a 25-year high. But even with the building boom, our construction employment still is 16 percent below the national average.
But because our heavier union representation means that average wages are about 8 percent higher than the U.S. norm, that means that each construction job here packs a bigger economic punch.
• The hotel boom is real. New hotels are popping up across the region. The rebirth of downtown Buffalo has spawned dozens of new restaurants and bars. More tourists have been visiting the region.
Put it all together, and it means robust hiring across the region's leisure and hospitality firms. Hiring grew by 2.7 percent last year, and while those jobs are low-paying – averaging just $455 a week, or 50 percent less than the $890 regional average – the industry's wages still are 19 percent higher than the national average.
Hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector also has been steadily robust, never dropping below 1.4 percent annually during any of the past seven years.
• Our manufacturing base – long the Achilles heel of the local economy – has finally stabilized. Last year was a tough one for factories nationwide, and it wasn't any different here. Manufacturing jobs fell by 0.2 percent, making it one of the few local sectors to decline in 2016.
But the bigger picture is much brighter. After decades of decline, the region's factory employment has been fairly stable – actually it's grown by about 2 percent – since 2011.
“The last recession really buried a lot of the Old Economy,” Slenker said.
Four decades ago, the steel and auto industries dominated the local economy. Not anymore.
As a result, Slenker thinks the region can keep growing at around 1 percent annually, but to do so means bringing more skilled workers into the labor pool, either by attracting them from elsewhere or convincing discouraged workers that they can find a decent job if they start looking again.
“We're running out of skilled labor,” they said. “We need more people with more skills.”
Above all, though, how the Buffalo Niagara economy goes depends on how strong the overall economy is.
It's been eight years since the last recession, and that's a long time to go without a downturn.
“Buffalo has positioned itself to prosper,” Slenker said. “But it's still a case where we depend on the rest of the nation and the rest of the world economy.”
I have always had an interest in astronomy and the cosmos. However, within the last year and a half this passion has grown exponentially. Interestingly, it was a handful of mind-blowing facts that catalysed and nurtured my curiosity. One of these was related to the star Betelgeuse (A.K.A Beetlejuice), which is the star that makes up Orion's left shoulder. This star is 497.9 light years away (this means the light we see today left Betelgeuse when Henry VIII was on the throne of England) and is a red giant star, which means it is towards the end of its life-cycle. This star is big. Incredibly, mind-blowingly big. If Betelgeuse was to magically swap places with the star at the centre of our solar system (the sun), it would completely annihilate Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and it is likely it would reach the orbit of Jupiter. To put this into context, Jupiter is currently 778,500,000 km from the sun. The estimated diameter of Betelgeuse is 1,641,380,000 km! In addition to its epic size, Betelgeuse will also ‘go supernova' (a stellar explosion whereby a star expels most/all of its materia) within the next 1,000,000 years or so. Sadly, it is unlikely that humans will still be around when this happens, but boy would it be a spectacle. You would be able to see it from earth with the same level of brightness as the full moon; it would be visible during the day!
Orion is an amazing constellation; it is easy to find and contains a wealth of astronomical charms. Indeed, Orion's swords, or dagger, is known as the Great Orion Nebula (GON; a nebula is a gigantic interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases- the birthplace of new stars). The GON is just about visible to the naked eye under clear skies (easily visible with even a small pair of binoculars) and is c.1344 light years away (the Anglo-Saxons inhabited Briton when the light we see today left the nebula). The radius of this colossal cloud of gas is a staggering 12 light years (or 113500000000000 km!).
All of the stars that we can see with the naked eye or telescopes are in our galaxy the Milky Way. The Milky Way contains around 400 billion stars and as many planets. The observable universe contains between 100-200 billion other galaxies, each one consisting of hundreds of billions stars. The other fact that caught me hook, line and sinker relates to the Andromeda galaxy (or M31, relating to its ‘Messier' catalogue number). Andromeda is the Milky Way's nearest spiral-galaxy neighbour. As with so many things relating to the cosmos, it is gigantic. At its widest point it is 141,000 light years in diameter (or 1,333,934,510,000,000,000 km) and it contains over one trillion stars; at least double the number of stars than the Milky Way. Andromeda is so large that it appears as a smudgy, white cloud to the naked eye (under dark skies) and even more so with a pair of small binoculars or a telescope. Now we get to the cool stuff. The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years away. This means the light that hits our retinas today left its source before Homo erectus, an early hominid, had even evolved; humans were a long way off entering the scene. You are literally looking back in time every time you look up to the heavens. And the fact you can see these sights with your naked eye or a cheap pair of binoculars blows my mind.
Unlike a large percentage of the other galaxies in the universe that are flying away from us at colossal speeds (because the universe is expanding), Andromeda is flying directly towards us at 110 km a second. It has been mathematically predicted that Andromeda will smash into the Milky Way in 3.75 million years. Again, this will not affect humans because we will definitely be extinct (our sun would have expanded so much that liquid water could no longer exist on Earth), but it would be a most beautiful event, as shown in this model (GIF). Unfortunately, Orion and the Andromeda galaxy are now setting very early in the evening, so we will have to wait until around late November to see them again. But there are plenty of other fantastic sites above, so don't you worry.
As a number of you may be aware, I was recently gifted a 130 mm Newtonian reflector telescope [2]. This was a massive upgrade from my 7×50 binoculars and boy have I been enjoying it. Jupiter was my first target. The largest planet in the solar system and the father to over 60 moons, four of which (the Jovian moons, in order of distance from Jupiter= Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) are easily visible from earth with a pair of binoculars. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and twice the mass of our moon. The composite image below shows the relative sizes of Jupiter's largest four moons as well as some beautiful surface detail.
When seen through a small telescope it is clear to see Jupiter as a large, bright disk, with the four large moons appearing as very bright stars. And if you are really lucky, and the atmosphere is nice and calm[1], two dark red bands will suddenly jump out at you from the surface of Jupiter. It really is an awesome experience seeing this for the first time. When seen with the naked eye, Jupiter just looks like a very bright star; indeed, this is probably what most people think it is. But even using modest equipment you can see this is not true…it is another world; a giant, majestic planet and the king of our solar system. Depending on the time of year, the distance to Jupiter from earth ranges between 588 to 968 million kilometres. This means the light we see through our telescopes left Jupiter between 32 and 54 minutes ago.
My next target was Saturn; the jewel of our solar system. I can distinctly remember the first time I saw Saturn with my own eyes. It really is an incredible moment. It makes you realise that the giant ball of gas and bright rings of ice is actually out there up in the sky. It may appear as a golden star to the unaided eye, but even a small telescope can resolve its rings. It is all well and good seeing the awesome pictures from the Hubble telescope and the Cassini satellite, but seeing it with your own eyes is something special. In fact, when Kerrie saw it for the first time at the Auckland Observatory, NZ, they did not think it was real; they thought somebody had put a mini picture at the end of the scope. If you have not already looked at Saturn with your own eyes, do it as soon as you can, and this is the perfect time of year for it. Look up your nearest astronomy club or ask a friend who has a telescope (I am more than willing to show anybody who is interested)- you will not be disappointed. When you are looking at Saturn you are observing details on a planet that is 1.3 billion km away. Its rings have a diameter of 364,900 km, which is around the same distance from our moon to earth and it would take light just over a second to travel the distance from one edge to the other. Saturn really is an incredible planet.
I don't think this post would be complete without a picture of Saturn as seen through the Hubble Space Telescope, so see below. I know, I know, it is a little bit better than my image. That is because Hubble has a 2400 mm mirror, compared to my 130 mm mirror. Oh, and my telescope is not orbiting above the atmosphere at 560 km above sea level, I suppose that helps, too (I also think the Hubble camera is a bit better than a wobbling 5 mega-pixel smartphone, but I may be wrong). The photo below shows Saturn's equivalent of our Northern Lights, a visual display caused by the sun's solar energy interacting with Saturn's atmosphere.
It does not take much fancy equipment to become awestruck by the night sky. So grab a pair of binoculars and head out to a nice dark sky away from the city; you will not be disappointed. Even the moon, the object that most of us take for granted, gives us some beautiful sights. You can see a fair amount of craters and terrestrial detail on the moon even with your naked eyes! Away from the horribly light-polluted city sky there is a whole new world waiting for you to discover.
Footnotes:
[1] The atmosphere protects us and allows life to evolve and thrive on planet earth. However, to amateur astronomers it is a bugger. It is continually boiling and churning away above our heads, distorting the lovely images through our telescopes (think of the shimmering air above a hot car engine or a cement car park on a hot day). Indeed, it is the atmosphere that makes stars appear to twinkle in the night sky. The photons of light from these distant stars are so weak and feeble that they get bounced around and bullied by our atmosphere (when stars are viewed from the ISS or outer space, they do not twinkle at all; they appear as constant points of light). Consequently, we see very twinkling stars and on hot, turbulent summer evenings. Planets do not twinkle. The light reflected back from these close neighbours is tough and powerful. Thus it simply ploughs through our atmosphere unaltered. If you see a bright ‘star' in the sky that does not twinkle, it is most likely a planet.
Allow one more digression. Planets do not twinkle and they always appear on the elliptic. What is the elliptic, I hear you ask? It is an imaginary line across the sky that the sun, planets and moon appear to move across. It runs from the East to the West; the planets move across the sky in the exact same way that the sun does! So if you think you see a bright star that does not appear to twinkle and it is wildly to the North or South, it cannot possibly be a planet. So there you have it. You will now always be able to identify the planets with your naked eye. I will now give some tips to identifying some of the planets with your naked eye. Venus is closer to the sun than earth, this means that it will always be relatively close to the sun. In other words, we will only see Venus at sunset or sunrise. Venus appears as a very bright star (it is in fact known as the evening or morning star) in the West and just after sunset (or in the East before sunrise, depending on the time of year). Mars is an easy one to spot with the naked eye due to its red appearance. Saturn appears as a faint golden/yellow star. I left Jupiter to last because it is more difficult to identify with the naked eye, so if it does not look like any of the others, it is most likely Jupiter, which appears as a very bright, white star. Unfortunately, Uranus and Neptune are not possible to see with a naked eye (unless you have perfect vision and very, very dark skies), but they are, on average 2.88 and 4.44 billion kilometres away, respectively.
[2] Model: Celestron Astromaster 130 mm MD EQ This entry level telescope is great for budding astronomers. I have been able to see a lot of objects in the sky including the moon, planets, globular clusters, open clusters, binary star systems, and other galaxies. This scope comes with an equatorial mount, which is very important. This design allows the mount to counter the spinning of the earth on its axis. Without this, planets and stars fly across the eyepiece in a number of seconds; you can literally observe the earth spinning on its axis! If you have any questions about the telescope, just comment here.

World Service expansion will also include increased coverage in the Middle East and North Africa as rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera continue to grow
The BBC is set to unveil proposals for a significant expansion of the BBC World Service, including potentially a satellite TV service for Russian speakers and a daily radio news programme for North Korea.
The proposals, which will be announced by director general Tony Hall on Monday, include beefing up the BBC Arabic service to offer more regional content, with increased coverage of north Africa and the Middle East.
The BBC argues that the expansion is about “democracy and the free press” at a time which has seen the rise of big state-sponsored rivals, such as al-Jazeera and RT (previously Russia Today), both of which now have UK operations, and China Central Television.
“This is about Britain's place in the world,” said a BBC source. “It is above the politics of the debates about the BBC's future. It has to be a national priority. Other news outlets are growing globally and many do not share our traditions and values. We have a strong commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news. There should no longer be any no-go countries for the World Service.”
The proposals include looking at a satellite TV service for Russian speakers or ramping up digital presence on YouTube or Rutube, the Russian equivalent, and TV bulletins for neighbouring eastern European states. In addition, the corporation intends to extend its digital and mobile offerings for the Indian and Nigerian markets.
The BBC was forced to take on the £245m annual cost of the World Service, which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, from last year as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement with the government.
In an ironic twist, the BBC is to seek financial support from the government for the expansion. The BBC will offer to match any increase in public funding for the World Service if it can be allowed to more heavily-commercialise its Global News operation outside the UK, which generates more than £100m in revenues annually from sources including advertising and sponsorship.
Earlier this year, the BBC published its Future of News report, which warned the government that cuts to the World Service would reduce the UK's global “soft power” in the face of the growth of rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera.
“The World Service faces a choice between decline and growth,” the report said. “If the UK wants the BBC to remain valued and respected, an ambassador of Britain's values and an agent of soft power in the world, then the BBC is going to have to commit to growing the World Service and the government will have to recognise this.”
The historic stadium deal was done over Memorial Day drinks at the Alfond Inn in Winter Park. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer had a Bloody Mary and a glass of wine and Orlando City founder and team president Phil Rawlins had two glasses of wine.
The impromptu contract they both signed was the $31 bar receipt with the words "Soccer Stadium" and "Parramore" and "Land" scribbled on it.
"One of the easiest and most gratifying deals I've ever done," Dyer said Friday after he, Rawlins and Orlando City majority owner Flávio Augusto da Silva jointly announced that Orlando City will privately finance the construction of its own downtown soccer-specific stadium. "… These are the days that we live for!"
Said a jubilant Augusto da Silva: "We've been having a problem funding the stadium, but we've got a new solution: We'll fund this project 100 percent privately!"
Wait a minute, did I hear that right?
Did I just hear a billionaire sports owner say he's going to pay for their own stadium?
Did I just hear them tell state politicians that he's not going to sit around and wait for them to wade through their bureaucratic red tape and sign off on the $30 million they promised for a new stadium?
Joe Burbank, Orlando Sentinel Joe Burbank, Orlando Sentinel
Did I just hear them tell the city to keep the $15 million it was going to kick in for the new stadium?
Did I just hear them tell the county to keep the $20 million it was going to contribute to the new stadium?
Did I just hear them say that he'll even pay fair market value for the land where the new stadium is to be built?
"Honestly, if they [Orlando City] had asked, I would have given them the land," Dyer said. "By them paying for it — that's a $20 million give-back to the city."
Obviously, the Brazilian-born Augusto da Silva and the English-born Rawlins don't understand how American sports teams do business. In America, sports teams kick and scream and whine and cry and threaten to relocate if their communities don't use taxpayer dollars to build them palatial new arenas and stadiums.
"I guess I didn't understand that," Rawlins cracked when I told them that privately financed stadiums are as un-American as a balanced budget.
Hard to believe a minor-league soccer team came to town just five years ago and has become such a major player in Orlando. Who would have ever thought the Orlando Magic, on a day when they hired beloved former player Scott Skiles to be their next head coach, would have to share the spotlight with an expansion MLS team?
Except this isn't just any expansion team; this is an expansion team that has literally painted the town purple. You can see it everywhere you go — the car magnets, the Kaká jerseys, the supporter groups who transform downtown bars into chanting, gallivanting, hugging, beer-chugging Orlando City pep rallies.
By now, you know the fan phenomenon that has enveloped the city. Orlando City's first game sold out the Citrus Bowl with more than 62,000 fans. Average attendance so far is more than 37,000 per game – second-highest in the league. And as Dyer pointed out Friday, a total of 52,000 fans have come from 64 different countries.
The world's most popular sport is bigger than anybody imagined in the world's most popular tourist destination. Why do you think Orlando City owners have decided to finance the stadium on their own?
It's not just because they want their stadium and they want it now. It's not just because this gives them the flexibility to build a bigger, nicer stadium without the governmental bean counters making sure they stay within budget. Augusto da Silva didn't become a billionaire by being a dummy. They made a fortune by building schools teaching students in Brazil to become fluent English speakers in 18 months.
In other words, they are a quick study. And it didn't take long for them to realize that building their own stadium – and buying and developing the land around that stadium — is a good business move. With a privately financed stadium, Orlando City gets to keep every penny of the profit — naming rights, ticket sales, signage, advertising, concessions, parking, etc.
On the land surrounding the stadium, Orlando City can build its owns bars and restaurants and profit from those as well. And it certainly isn't a stretch to think Orlando City will compete with the City of Orlando for non-soccer events such as concerts. Question: What would be a better venue for the high school state championship football games — a mostly empty 65,000-seat Citrus Bowl or a mostly full 28,000-seat Orlando City stadium?
Hard to believe that one of the most historic, euphoric deals in Orlando sports history was done over a Bloody Mary and a glass of wine.
The best part of all: Central Floridians didn't have to pay a bloody cent.

This postseason, we've seen hitting heroics from players as high-profile as presumptive MVP Kris Bryant and as anonymous as Conor Gillaspie. We've seen duels between aces. We've seen defensive sleight of hand; Javier Báez's tag work may have won the week. Increasingly, though, October baseball is about bullpens. The month's defining moments — both triumphs and mistakes — have hinged on the use or misuse of one- or two-inning weapons: Buck Showalter's failure to call on Zach Britton to extend the Orioles' season; Dave Roberts's slow call to Kenley Jansen in relief of Clayton Kershaw in Game 4 and quick call to Jansen to set up Kershaw's save in Game 5; Terry Francona's willingness to summon Andrew Miller to snuff out or forestall rallies in the fifth and sixth innings; Bruce Bochy's Pyrrhic pursuit of platoon advantages in a season-ending episode of musical mounds.
Related Ranking the Greatest Recent Crimes Against Closer Usage
Relievers threw 36.7 percent of regular-season innings in 2016, easily the highest rate ever. That percentage has risen to 44.3 percent in the postseason, which, if it holds, would be a big increase from last postseason's 39.5 percent. We're not so far away from seeing starters and relievers split October's innings equally, eroding the distinction between the two; Kershaw's signature playoff appearance came while they were moonlighting in relief. Given that trend, it's no surprise that many teams on track for playoff appearances targeted closers at the trade deadline, including Miller, Aroldis Chapman, and Mark Melancon. Not only are relievers shouldering more of the October load, they're also getting outs more effectively than ever, which explains why some analysts recommend that teams let them take on even more work.
Related The Indians Are Reshaping How We Think About Relievers
Things weren't always this way. How did relief pitchers come to dominate our discussions? How have inferior arms who are limited to one trip through the order turned into the studs whose absence we lament and whose presence we celebrate? When did short relievers become so cool?
Today's bullpen usage patterns have been in the works for a while. In fact, reliever use has been on the rise since the beginning of modern baseball history.
As you can tell by eyeballing that graph, though, the rate of increase isn't constant; some periods have seen more rapid reliever proliferation than others. We can pinpoint the peak of the trend toward more relievers by comparing each year's rate of relievers per game to the corresponding rate from a few years earlier.
That circled spike, which denotes the year when reliever use was inflating faster than at any other point in the past 50 seasons, was 1991, when the rate of relievers per game was 22 percent higher than it had been in 1987. Games weren't getting any longer, so for managers to cram more relievers into each game, they had to use each pitcher for fewer outs, on average; the rate of innings pitched per relief appearance was falling faster than it had in any year since the 1940s.
The impetus for that acceleration was a pitcher who spent the first half of their Hall of Fame career in the rotation. In 1988, Athletics manager Tony La Russa converted versatile reliever-spot starter Dennis Eckersley, who'd thrown two innings or more in nearly half of their 1987 appearances, into a specialized weapon who never entered earlier than the eighth and got fewer than six outs in more than 80 percent of their outings. In their new role, Eck nearly tripled their save total, leading the majors with 45. Today's wins-above-replacement stats say they were less valuable to the A's than they had been the year before, but thanks to their higher-leverage assignments, they were perceived to be better, making their first All-Star team as a reliever and finishing second and fifth, respectively, in AL Cy Young and MVP voting. When the closer-equipped A's improved by 23 wins and won a pennant, every team wanted one. Just like that, the more flexible “firefighter” model popularized by Goose Gossage and others was out; in 1989's Major League, the Yankees' closer, Duke Simpson, looks like Gossage but (unlike Gossage) enters with two outs in the ninth. In 1990, the Reds rode their “Nasty Boys” bullpen to a title, and in 1991, relievers recorded 0.54 saves per game, which remains the all-time record.
That same year, 35 miles south of Eckersley's A's, at Atari Games headquarters in Milpitas, California, Mike Hally and Peter Lipson had an idea for an arcade game. It wouldn't look like any arcade game the company had recently published. Although the company had released R.B.I. Baseball in 1987, Atari games at that time tended toward fighting or shooting (Batman, Pit-Fighter, ThunderJaws, Steel Talons) and driving (Race Drivin', Street Drivin', Hydra, Road Riot 4WD). Hally was an Atari veteran who'd worked on classic coin-ops such as Gravitar and Star Wars; Lipson had just finished developing Rampart, a puzzler/fighter, and Shuuz, a video game version of horseshoes. The pair had worked together previously on 1987's Blasteroids, an Asteroids update, but their new collaboration wouldn't feature spaceships or explosions. This one would have an incredibly un-arcadey name: Relief Pitcher.
A few years earlier, it would have had an incredibly un-arcadey concept. But both baseball's expanding pitching staffs and the ebbing arcade market had shifted toward action in smaller bursts. “By the end of the '80s, the business was changing,” Lipson, Relief Pitcher's lone programmer, recalls. “There were more casual games coming that didn't require the huge investment of player time.” Lipson and Hally, the project lead, belonged to an Atari contingent of lifelong baseball fans who played softball together and took frequent field trips to Bay Area games. They wanted to work on a baseball game, but they also wanted to produce something different from its predecessors. “If people get bored, they don't want to play a whole nine-inning game,” Hally says. “So that's when I came up with the idea that you basically start with the game in the eighth or ninth inning with men on base and just all different kinds of scenarios.” (Tell me more, Rob Manfred might say.) Lipson thought the unorthodox structure offered a solution for baseball being poorly suited for, as they say, their “understanding of what made video games work — the pacing/difficulty ramping, the constraints of controls, the need to get quarters frequently, the ability to rank against other players on a high-score table.”
The game evolved through a few permutations during development, from a simplistic bar-top title — the baseball version of Shuuz — to a more fully featured simulator with multiple modes.
Even in its final form, which took Lipson about nine months to program and which included the option to play nine-inning games, the hook remained the ability to role-play as a relief pitcher. Browser-based versions are available here and here. You'll notice that the generic pitcher on the title screen looks a lot like Tom Glavine, which isn't a coincidence. “Our artist (who wasn't much of a fan) used them as a model and didn't change it enough,” Lipson says.
If you select the single-player relief pitcher mode and choose your (unlicensed) teams, you'll hear a familiar digitized voice setting up the scenario: “It's top of the ninth, nobody on, nobody out,” the voice says — a save situation, of course. “You could have an easy early level by starting it with your team in the lead, a few outs already, and no one on base,” Lipson says. “Later levels would have more men on base, fewer outs already registered, and eventually you'd even be trailing in score.”
The voice, and the accompanying likeness, belong to Jack Buck, Cardinals broadcasting legend. Hally and Atari audio guy Don Diekneite were longtime Cardinals fans, and Buck was their dream get for the game. “We said, ‘Man, wouldn't it be great if we could get Jack Buck to come out to Atari and do all the voiceover for the whole game?'” Hally says. “And the marketing department went along with it, called their agent. Their agent said this is how much money they want. [He] showed up at Atari in their red Cardinal suit. They were great.” Although Hally and Lipson gave Buck a script, they didn't want them to stick to it. “We also encouraged them to just wing it and announce a virtual game for a while,” Lipson says. “That's where ‘A foul tip into the stands — it hit a little kid!' came from.” In the era of protective netting, that cringeworthy ad lib would go the way of Madden's animated ambulance.
Although Atari covered Buck's fee, the developers had to cut costs elsewhere, which explains the fake teams (Bashers, Dusters, Speeders, and, uh, Strokers) and players, as well as the unnamed ballparks that look suspiciously like real places (Fenway, Wrigley, and the Astrodome). “I basically just stole the pictures of the ballparks,” Hally says. “I didn't pay for that.” They also named some of the players after Atari employees. “I had the most home runs of any player in the game,” Hally says. “I'm in charge of the project. I might as well use my power to make some power.” Cosmetic compromises (and quirks including an ambidextrous catcher) aside, the guts of the game were ahead of their time. Hally and Lipson invented (and patented) an innovative control scheme that required the player to use three buttons and a joystick for batting, baserunning, and pitching, although their vision was in some ways more ambitious than the technology allowed.
The game, which was later ported to Super NES and the handheld Atari Lynx, made it to market in 1992, when Eckersley again led the majors with 51 saves, this time winning the Cy Young and the MVP Award (the latter of which relievers have been locked out of ever since). Without the save-driven hoopla that fueled those awards, Relief Pitcher wouldn't have happened. “The idea of being a relief pitcher might have been less attractive without the contemporaneous hype around the closers of that era — just like Angry Birds would probably have failed if there wasn't something inherently cool about angry birds,” Lipson adds. “So even if it didn't drive the design, it made it more likely to succeed.” Hally doesn't remember making an explicit link between Eckersley, the rise of the one-inning save, and the premise for Relief Pitcher, but they think there had to be a subconscious connection. “It was part of the time,” they say. “It was like, that's what's going on in baseball, so why not insert it into a baseball game?”
Despite the marketing materials' promise that it would be “the best baseball game ever,” Relief Pitcher wasn't exactly a smash. “I had fun, but I don't think I got much of a bonus for it, and I doubt Atari made much,” Lipson says. “It should have been on every bar top in the country, along with Shuuz. Hell if I know why that never happened.” Maybe America wasn't quite ready for a video game starring a Glavine-rip-off reliever, any more than it was ready for a football game featuring Adam Vinatieri or a basketball franchise that let the player serve as sixth man. But baseball was ready for the reliever's ascendance, and Relief Pitcher — a cultural artifact unearthed from its era's archaeological record — reflects that.
Relievers have benefited from a rebranding effort better than Burberry's, which whitewashed their old identity as washed-up starters and gave them their own renown as high-status specialists who excel in an equally indispensable role. The campaign began with the official adoption of the save stat in 1969, and it's still paying off this postseason, even as the save belatedly loses its luster. You might not have heard of or played Relief Pitcher, but by existing at all, it marked a milestone step in the reliever's transformation from appendix of the pitching staff to larger-than-life leading man — and, to the team that's trailing late, formidable final boss.

Chevy Names Country Singer Luke Bryan Official Brand Ambassador
Today at the 2016 County Music Association (CMA) Festival, Chevrolet announced a new three-year partnership with Luke Bryan, who will serve as an ambassador for the brand on “a variety of projects.” The bowtie brand is also sponsoring Bryan's farm concert tour later this fall.
Recently crowned the CMA Entertainer of the Year, Bryan is perhaps best-known for hits like “That's My Kind of Night” and “Rain is a Good Thing,” the latter a song about the water cycle which explains how “rain makes corn/corn makes whiskey/whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky.” They also have some other popular tunes, like “Drink a Beer” and “Roller Coaster,” but those are the sad, cloying types of country songs, not the “let's drink this whole case of Busch Light WHOOOOOO!” types which I personally prefer.
“Chevy has been a part of our family and a part of our work life on the farm for as long as I can remember,” Bryan said of the partnership. “If you were a Bryan, you drove a Chevy. I am so excited about this partnership and I'm honored to be representing such a wonderful brand.”
Chevrolet is also sponsoring Bryan's 8th Annual Farm Tour, a multi-city tour of rural America set for October, in which Bryan will perform concerts on actual farms in small towns like Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and Prairie Grove, Arkansas. A full list of tour dates can be found at LukeBryan.com.
Bryan teamed with Chevy earlier this year as part of the bowtie brand's #DayItForward campaign, which featured numerous celebrities “paying it forward” on Leap Day. For their part, Bryan chose to recognize the work of firefighters in Franklin, Tennessee:
“Partnering with Luke Bryan is a natural fit for Chevrolet,” said Chevy marketing VP Paul Edwards. “Our customers love country music, and Chevy has always held a special place within the genre.”
“We're proud to build a relationship with an artist as authentic and talented as Luke,” Edwards added.

Qualcomm targets Apple iPhone 8, iPhone X in new patent suit By Mikey Campbell Wednesday, November 29, 2017, 06:33 pm PT (09:33 pm ET)
On the heels of an Apple lawsuit claiming Qualcomm infringes on at least eight patents with its Snapdragon processors, Qualcomm on Wednesday lodged a patent suit against Apple targeting tech found in the latest iPhones.
Filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Qualcomm's complaint claims Apple is in infringement of five patents covering radio frequency transceivers, power efficiency in mobile CPUs, device power management and image enhancement using depth-based data.
Qualcomm is targeting a number of Apple devices with its lawsuit including last year's iPhone 7 series and the latest iPhone 8 and iPhone X models.
The first patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,154,356 for "Low noise amplifiers for carrier aggregation" relates in part to a second asserted patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,473,336 for "Radio frequency (RF) front end having multiple low noise amplifier modules." Both properties discuss methods of enabling communication with cellular carriers.
Specifically, iPhone 7 allegedly includes RF technology that infringes on Qualcomm's amplification and aggregation IP, while iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X each incorporate infringing amplifier designs. Apple's current handsets also infringe on communication methods detailed in the '356 patent.
Qualcomm further asserts Apple's A10 system-on-chip used in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is in infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,063,674 for "Multiple supply-voltage power-up/down detectors." The IP details methods of reducing power consumption in a power on/off control (POC) network like the core and control networks in Apple's A10.
U.S. Patent No. 7,693,002 for "Dynamic word line drivers and decoders for memory arrays" also relates to the A10, specifically SRAM memory unit logic.
Finally, Qualcomm is leveraging U.S. Patent No. 9,552,633 for "Depth aware enhancement for stereo video" against all dual-lens iPhone models, including iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. In particular, the chip company claims its IP covers image enhancements based on data gleaned from depth maps captured by offset camera modules.
Apple's "Portrait Mode," introduced in iPhone 7 Plus and expanded to include "Portrait Lighting" with iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, creates a depth map based on the difference in spatial orientation between images captured by iPhone's two camera modules.
Portrait Mode was initially limited to separating a subject from its background by simulating a "bokeh" effect. Apple's iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X incorporate specialized image signal processors to further enhance images by carefully applying lighting effects on a subject's face or, alternatively, completely removing background data.
Qualcomm demands a court trial and seeks an injunction against infringing devices, as well as the usual unspecified damages and fees.
Today's lawsuit is the latest in a spree of worldwide filings related to Apple and Qualcomm's heated legal battle. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion on claims that the chipmaker withheld royalty payments in retaliation for Apple's cooperation in a South Korean antitrust investigation. Apple in its litigation alleges Qualcomm engages in anticompetitive behavior and questionable patent licensing practices.
Qualcomm fired back with its own series of countersuits, saying Apple's legal crusade is merely a ploy to garner favorable licensing fees.
The Swans landed four new recruits in the last January window and they all made an impact as Clement's team produced a dramatic upturn in form to pull clear of relegation danger.
And the Swans boss reckons something similar will be required this time around as they look to inspire another survival charge.
“I think we can say that our summer window was less successful than we would have liked,” Clement said.
“But our last January window was very successful. We brought in Martin Olsson, Tom Carroll, Jordan Ayew and Luciano Narsingh and they all made an impact.
“They came into the team and made a difference.
“They are the sort of signings we need this January – players who will come in and make an impact, who will make a difference and help us get over the line in games.
“How many games have we lost by one goal this season? How many games have Burnley won by one goal? They have players who will make a difference.
“We don't need squad players. We need players who will come straight into the side.”
Clement is in regular discussions with chairperson Huw Jenkins, the recruitment team and the club's owners as the Swans try to work out how best to bolster their squad.
Despite last winter's successful transfer work, Clement acknowledges that January can be a difficult time to get deals done.
“It's not an easy window to operate in,” they added.
“You can identify your targets, but are they available and are they achievable?
“Does the player want to come? Does the salary fit? Will their current team let them go? It's complicated at this time of year.
“Players will look at where you are in the table. They will want guarantees if you go down about salaries or about being allowed to leave.
“But the advantage we do have is that we were in the same situation last season and we guaranteed survival with a game to go, so we know we are capable of doing it.”
With the UEFA Champions League wrapping up on Saturday, quickly followed by the Coppa Italia and Liga MX finals on Sunday and the Championship playoff final on Monday, the European club season has quickly come to a close. You could curl up in a ball and cry until next August, or you could just watch some slightly less entertaining soccer. Here are all of your options for offseason viewing.
La Liga: One more round to play
The title has already been decided in La Liga, but the battles for fourth place and to avoid relegation have gone down to the final day. Real Madrid and Barcelona both play early on Saturday, while the remaining eight games of the final round will all take place simultaneously, at 3 p.m. ET. Valencia and Real Sociedad are duking it out for a Champions League spot, while the bottom four are separated by just two points.
Argentine Primera: Three rounds remain
Newell's Old Boys tops the table on 32 points, three points ahead of their nearest rivals. There are five teams within six points of them, though only the top three will feel like they have a realistic chance to take the title. River Plate sit on 29 points, while Lanus are on 28. River play at Lanus on the final day, while Newell's still have Copa Libertadores and Copa Argentina to juggle.
Major League Soccer: Regular season ends Oct. 27, then playoffs
Depending on what other competitions they're involved in, MLS teams have already played between 11 and 15 games this season. The New York Red Bulls lead the Eastern Conference, though the Montreal Impact have the most points per game in the East. Out West, FC Dallas is on top in both categories. The playoffs will start during the final days of October or the first week of November. MLS Cup will take place approximately one month after the playoffs begin.
National Women's Soccer League: Regular season ends Aug. 18, semifinals Aug. 24, final Aug. 31
Unlike MLS, all of the NWSL's postseason dates have been announced. Because there are only eight teams participating in the inaugural season, they're already nearly halfway done. U.S. women's national team strikers Alex Morgan and Sydney Leroux are among the five players tied on top of the scoring charts with four goals apiece.
Copa Libertadores: Currently in quarterfinals, final is July 24
South America's premier club competition is still going on. This year's knockout stage seedings resulted in most of the best teams getting packed into one side of the bracket. Whoever emerges out of the top half, with Newell's, Boca Juniors, Atletico Mineiro and Tijuana, should be favored in the final. That's not to say that Santa Fe, Fluminense or Olimpia are pushovers, but the other finalist will have run through an impressive gauntlet just to get there.
Brasileirão: Started Saturday, runs until December
The highlight of the first round of Brazil's top flight was Neymar playing their final game for Santos last Sunday. São Paulo plays in the best fixtures of the next two rounds, hosting Vasco da Gama on Wednesday before playing away to Atletico Mineiro on Saturday.
J. League: Started March 2, ends Dec. 7
It's only feasible to watch the J. League when you come home from the bar if you live in North America, or if you wake up very early in the morning in Europe. But provided you're an American partier or an English early riser, you've got a fun league to watch.
International friendlies
There are always tons of these. The United States plays Belgium on Wednesday, and England is in action earlier in the day as well. Mexico and Italy both play on Friday and there are friendlies throughout next week across the world, including United States-Germany on June 2.
World Cup qualifying: Multiple dates in June
The biggest World Cup qualifying date is June 7, when every confederation but AFC will be in action. Asia has a round of qualifiers on June 4, which coincides with Mexico-Panama. CONMEBOL, CONCACAF and AFC are all in action on June 11, then CONCACAF and AFC play again on June 18. Africa's qualifying dates are much more spread out, but all teams in CAF qualifying play in June.
International tournaments
European Under-21 Championships: June 5-18
Confederations Cup: June 15-30
Under-20 World Cup: June 21 - July 13
CONCACAF Gold Cup: July 7-28
Most European teams will not have any players participating in both the UEFA Under-21 championship and the Under-20 World Cup, as to avoid annoying club managers and wearing out young players. The Confederations Cup is the warm-up tournament for the World Cup and includes the reigning champions of all six confederations, plus the host country and the last World Cup winner. Because Spain is the defending champion of two tournaments, Euro 2012 runners-up Italy will participate. Mexico and the United States are likely to send B teams to the Gold Cup, though the overlap between that tournament and the Under-20 World Cup will force them into tough choices with their best young players.
The UEFA Champions League begins qualifying early in July, but the first round in which most of the remaining teams are good -- the third qualifying round -- begins on July 30. The playoff round starts on Aug. 20, after most of Europe's big leagues have resumed. Schedules are not set for the new seasons of the Premier League, La Liga and the like, but they should be released shortly. Expect the highest level of club soccer to return around the second week of August.

"All you're going to do is hire some weasel who's going to do whatever you tell them to anyway, what's so hard about this?"
Austin, TX — George Ramos, CFO to AcceleCorp, today name Sue the Capybara to be the next CIO of the company.
“We talked to every Yes-man and cost-cutter out there. All of them felt entitled to large base salaries, stock options and hefty bonuses just for meeting cost reduction targets I was setting anyway. It was an off-hand comment from the Chairman of the Board that allowed us to ‘think differently' about this post. Barry said ‘all you're going to do is hire some weasel who's going to do whatever you tell them to anyway, what's so hard about this?'. It was that comment that led us to think bigger. ‘Why stop at a weasel', we asked ourselves. ‘Why not go all the way and hire the largest rodent in the world?'.”
“Of course, Barry was right. We don't want someone to come in here trying to make a mark. We certainly don't want someone who thinks we need ‘world-class IT', whatever that is. All we want is someone to continue to cut costs and do our bidding without question. Sue fits that description to a tee.”
In a press release, Ramos says, “After an exhaustive search of high-priced CIO's and VP's from other companies, I am pleased to announce to our shareholders that we have found a much more economical choice to lead our IT organization to the next level of cost savings. Sue sets the tone for efficiency just through their salary, which consists of grass in the courtyard and the occasional fruit snack. The entire executive team asks our IT organization to take note of just how cost effective Sue already is, saving us hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in normal CIO salary and benefits. At AcceleCorp, we take diversity very seriously. Not only have we hired the first Capybara in the industry, but the first female Capybara.”
However, not all are pleased with the announcement. Bob Jenkins, VP of Email Servers Beginning with ‘E, S and O', expressed concern reporting to an actual rodent. “It's humiliating. I've worked at this company for 15 years and in my time I have made Email Servers Beginning with E, S and O the absolute best in the industry. Way better than my peer Robert Haskins, who is VP of Email Servers Beginning with ‘B, C and P'. Their uptime stinks. I'm ready to run this organization and take us to the next level. I plan to look closely at Cloud before declaring it too immature for our sophisticated use cases. Everyone else is dismissing it out of hand, but I'm willing to go the extra mile and have a charade of an evaluation period!”.
Of the 8 VP's of Email Servers, 6 went on record as opposing the new CIO. 22 of the 25 VP of SAP SubFunction's also opposed the appointment, all citing their vast experience in cost optimization and leadership. The 7 VP's of LDAP Enablement and 18 VP's of the Active Directory Forestry Service all declined to comment on the record.
At press time, Sue had just sent an email to the entire IT organization announcing a sweeping reorganization plan with extensive outsourcing and offshoring in order to realize synergies and align the company's cost structure with competitors. Employees connected to email servers beginning with B, C and P have yet to receive the email.

Hollywood actores are revealing their political allegiances as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Republicans' Donald Trump square up.
And Susan Sarandon and Sarah Michelle Gellar have made somewhat surprising choices.
'I go by issues: I don't vote with my vagina,' Susan, a long-time Democrat, testily said in reply to a question at an event in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday, indicating that they might not support Clinton's bid to become the first female president of the United States.

The 69-year-old actor, who looked years younger in a black dress that showed off their decolletage, was at the Breaking Barriers Luncheon at the Crown Towers Hotel when the subject came up.
They were an ardent supporter of Bernie Sanders' run from Democratic nominee and has said they might not vote for Clinton.
Susan has a daughter, Eva, 31, with Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri, and two sons with their longtime partner Tim Robbins, Jack 27, and Miles, 24.
Meanwhile Sarah Michelle, who usually leans Republican, is definitely not going to vote for Trump. The 39-year-old is backing Clinton for the sake of their little girl, Charlotte.

'I'm incredibly proud to be able to look at my seven-year-old daughter and when they say, "Mommy, one day can I be president?" I can honestly say to her, "Yeah, there's a chance that you could," which is not something that my mother could say to me when I was that age.
'I think it's all about shattering that glass ceiling and understanding that, ya know, we can change the world. Women can, men can, but we all have to work together as a team to do that.'

Sarah Michelle made their case for Clinton at SheKnows Media's three-day BlogHer Conference at the JW Marriott in the LA Live district of downtown Los Angeles on Friday morning in their keynote speech.
And they shared a snap of themselves on stage, saying: 'I had an amazing morning as the opening keynote speaker at #BlogHer16 Thank you to everyone who attended. I love being surrounded by so much creativity. I left feeling really inspired. #foodstirs #blogher @sheknows.'
SheKnows events are described as 'the world's largest celebration of women content creators across social media, video, photos, and the web' on its website.
With climate change concerns never far away and the continual need to keep the nation powered, it is no surprise that innovative forms of energy are constantly being sought.
One proposed by the University of Portsmouth's Professor Carl Ross would see human-made energy islands anchored in the sea surrounding the UK. The concept would both provide additional power to the country and also additional space to house the growing population.
The structures would tap into the power of the wind, tide and sun, and could be towed far out to sea.
Professor Ross said: “One of the problems we are faced with, especially in smaller overcrowded countries, such as those found in Europe and Asia, is the NIMBY syndrome – that is, the Not In My Back Yard reaction of people.
“People very often complain that using these renewable methods of producing energy takes up valuable land space, is unsightly, and causes noise.
“By putting these three renewable energy producing forms on a floating island, we can avoid all these negative points. Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered by water, so we are not ‘losing' dry land – in fact, we are colonising the oceans.
“Once this technology is matured, humans can even start living on the floating island to help counter over-population.
“In 2011 the United Nations announced that the global population has reached seven billion and the momentum of a growing population does not show any signs of slowing down.”
Anchoring the islands
Each island would be tethered to the sea bed by giant tubular pillars that would contain vacuum chambers in their bases. The technology is similar to that used to anchor offshore oil rigs.
Each island would support the generation of energy via wind turbines and solar panels on their surface, with tidal turbines attached below the surface to harness the power of the oceans.
The professor believes that the islands can easily be deployed in coastal regions of the UK, including the deepest parts of the North Sea and possibly even parts of the English Channel. They believe that each island could generate enough energy to power 119,500 homes.
Suffice to say, their installation is not without hurdles, not least of which are the £1.7 billion price tag each would come with, but Professor Ross believes that such an outlay could be repaid within 11 years via lower energy bills.
Parliament will debate today whether US President Donald Trump's planned UK state visit should be blocked after more than 1.8 million people signed a petition against the trip. As MPs deliberate in Westminster Hall, thousands of people are expected to descend on Parliament in a demonstration against the new POTUS.
The action is part of ‘Stop Trump: A National Day of Action', which is calling on people across the UK ‘to take to the streets and reclaim the future'. Marches and events will be taking place all day across the country. In London, the march on Parliament has been organised for 5pm, convening at Parliament Square. So far, around 50,000 people have clicked 'interested' or 'attending' on the event's Facebook page. It follows an emergency demonstration on Downing Street in January, which saw thousands march along Whitehall with only a day's notice.
Today's protest, organised by the newly formed Stop Trump Coalition, is taking place in coordination with 'One Day Without Us' – a national day of solidarity with migrants from around the world who are living, working and studying in the UK – who are also holding a number of events during the day.
To find out what events are taking place near you, the Trump Coalition has put together this handy map. In London, protestors will be able to join a 'flag mob' in Parliament Square from 1pm, where you can wave your country's flag in solidarity with migrant workers and diversity; the Tate and Tate Modern will conduct tours celebrating artworks created or influenced by migrants; and Upstairs at the Ritzy in Brixton will hold a story-telling jam from 7pm asking people to tell their own true tales of migration.
Activists, MPs, writers and comedians, including Owen Jones, Caroline Lucas and Rants N Bants will speak at this evening's march alongside performances from Jacob V Joyce, Aliyah Hasinah, Amina Jama, Caleb Femi and Belinda Zhawi.
The Stop Trump Coalition, which includes names such as Brian Eno, Lily Allen, Frankie Boyle, Paloma Faith and Caitlin Moran, has written a defiant message on the event's Facebook page: ‘We are calling for a nationwide day of action to stand up and say no to the future of hatred, racism and division that Donald Trump is trying to create – and to say no to the disgraceful complicity of Theresa May and the British government in supporting him.
‘With a bit of work we can make this national day of action massive! We have a duty to stand up and be counted.'
'Stop Trump: A National Day of Action' will convene on Parliament Square on Monday February 20 at 5pm.

Planning to travel solo but feeling nervous? Find out what it's really like to travel the world as a solo female traveller.
Since I started travelling, a lot of people have asked what it's like to be a solo female traveller. As a girl, if you tell people you're going off to Mexico or South America on your own, they think you're crazy. They assume it's impossible to go to these places and not end up in Mexican jail, trafficking drugs, or worse!
Before university a lot of friends disappeared off around the world on gap years. It didn't appeal to me, partly because I was so career-focused, but also it seemed very daunting. Then, a few years into my working life, I reached a point when I wanted to see what was out there and gain some life experience.
I booked onto a group tour run by Trek America. In reality, while I did go ‘on my own' in that I didn't go with anyone I knew before, within a few hours of arriving in Mexico I was in the safe hands of an experienced tour leader. As I was working full time and only had limited holidays, it was the simplest way to guarantee I'd see the best places, get from A to B safely, and make some new friends along the way.
Booking to go away for two weeks with people I didn't know was daunting. What if I didn't like them? What if they were all a lot younger or older than me? What if lots of them knew each other already? I had lots of questions! I worried that maybe the group would be all female or all male. The group dynamic could make or break the experience.
A few weeks before, we were invited to join Trek Live – a forum which helped settle some pre-trip nerves. One of the other trekkers was on my flight so we met at the airport and navigated our way through arrivals at Cancun and into a taxi. I also discovered I had a mutual friend with another person booked on the trip. Phew!
Preparing for the trip was exciting. However the first group meeting at our departure hotel was nerve-wracking. It was the first chance to weigh up the other characters I'd be spending the next few weeks with. Would we all get on? It was strange to think in two weeks time I would have shared so many experiences with them. It was comforting to find I wasn't the only solo traveller – in fact a third of the group was in the same position as me.
It was also the first time we met our tour leader Juan – a young guy who reeled off rules and itineraries. They were enthusiastic efficient and had a warm, approachable manner to make us feel at ease.
It's amazing how quickly you get to know people when you're with them 24/7. Although there were different friendships and dynamics within the group, it never felt cliquey. Relationships changed and grew stronger as the tour went on. We held hands as we jumped into a lagoon, made up radio shows in the back of the minibus on a long drive, salsa danced ‘til dawn, invented games that made us laugh for hours, drank a bar in the jungle dry, swam with turtles, ate some amazing food (and one of the most revolting meals of our lives)… these are things that I'll always remember, and have fond memories of!
I returned from the trip and immediately social media sprung into action with 12 new Facebook friend requests, endless photos being tagged, funny comments bouncing back and forth and messages about meeting up. It filled a big gap, as after being in a group for so long, returning to reality again felt a little lonely and dull.
Quite a few of the people on my trip were from London and we soon met up to reminisce. More recently (3 years later) one of the girls from Australia was visiting London for the week and we staged another mini reunion (complete with Mexican food and margaritas!)
Last year I booked a tour to Argentina and Brazil with Contiki (who specialise in group trips for 18-35 year olds). While this was a great adventure, it was very different. There were 24 people booked on it, and they came from Australia, Canada, America and the UK. Around 80% of the people in the group were traveling with people they already knew (mainly in pairs). The larger group felt a little cliquey and there were a lot of big characters. It took a few days just to learn all the names! Personally, I found the smaller group experience more comfortable, but maybe that's just me!
Travelling solo is a really enlightening experience. You can act how you want, no one is judging you or has any preconceptions. I felt my confidence grow and social skills blossom. While friends returned to work after lying by a pool in Spain for a week, I came back with amazing stories of exploring favelas and hanggliding in Rio, seeing monkeys in the Mexican jungles and more. It broadened my horizons, and gave me a new outlook on life. All that, and I managed to avoid ending up in Mexican jail!
Recently I came across this quote which I think sums up what it is to travel solo: “A journey is best measured in friends, rather than miles” (Tim Cahill).

The unknown buyer has been building up the dominant position since at least last week, putting a squeeze on the market.
According to the rules of the London Metal Exchange, the trader must lend out copper if it holds between 50pc and 80pc of the total to maintain day-to-day liquidity in the market. The trader is currently lending at a 0.5pc premium to the cash price.
The premium for spot price copper over delivery in three months' time reached $89 in the middle of this week - the highest in two years.
Stockpiles in London have fallen by more than a third since their levels at the beginning of the year.
LME copper was steady at $8,720 per tonne this morning, having reached a high of $8,732 earlier. A record price of $8,966 was hit in mid-November.
The large position is not the only reason the copper price is high.
There are fears of a shortfall in supply next year, as mining production is not expected to keep pace with rebounding demand following the recession.
Two US investment banks and one UK company also want to launch exchange-traded funds linked to copper, which is likely to suck demand out of the market further.
The Australian Rhino Project is a conservation organisation which is committed to working as part of the collective international fight to protect African rhinoceros from extinction.
The Australian Rhino Project, together with the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia, Orana Wildlife Trust and Taronga Conservation Society Australia, are currently working to expand the population of white rhinos in Australia and New Zealand to maintain a genetically diverse breeding crash that can act as an insurance population should the rhino become extinct in its African homeland.
Since 2010, official figures suggest that 6,925 rhinos have been poached in South Africa. With an estimated remaining population of less than 20,000 white rhinos, the species is becoming increasingly threatened due to poaching. Rhino populations in Asia and Africa have also been heavily impacted by poaching. Poaching has been driven by an illicit demand for rhino horn.
The Australian Rhino Project consists of a team of individuals, supporters and partner organisations who are passionate about ensuring the survival of the rhinoceros. Since the start of the project, the poaching epidemic has only increased in South Africa and the future of the rhino species continues to become more precarious.
We believe that we need to act now, as rhinos may be extinct in the wild in less than 10 years.
Church in Monmouthshire, Wales
St Mary's Priory Church, in Whitecross Street, Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales, is an Anglican church founded as a Benedictine priory in 1075. The current church dates mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1952. It is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail.
History and architecture [ edit ]

Exterior [ edit ]
The priory church was founded by Withenoc (or Gwethenoc), a Breton who became lord of Monmouth in 1075 after Roger de Breteuil, the son of William fitzOsbern, was disgraced for allowing their sister to wed the Earl of Norfolk against the wishes of King William.[1] There is evidence in the Book of Llandaff of an earlier 8th century Celtic church at Aper Menei, which is interpreted to be Monmouth, and it has been tentatively suggested that this may have been on the site of the later priory.[2]
The priory was granted to the Abbey of St Florent at Saumur, and was consecrated in the presence of William fitzBaderon[3] in 1101. It was extended and became the parish church later in the twelfth century. Few traces of the early building remain, other than a short section of Norman wall.[1]
The tower, of Old Red Sandstone with three stages, dates from the fourteenth century. The building deteriorated after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. By 1730, the church was described as ruinous and decayed. Significant rebuilding was undertaken in 1736-7 by Francis Smith of Warwick, who constructed an entirely new nave, but this work has also mostly gone. A new spire rising to a height of 60 metres (200 ft) was provided in 1743, to the design of Nathaniel Wilkinson of Worcester. In the late nineteenth century, the church was almost completely rebuilt by George Edmund Street. Street's structural report of 1879 was dismissive: "it might be said to have no style at all, at any rate it [is] extremely unattractive and uninteresting." Their original intention was complete demolition and rebuilding, but the estimated cost of £22,000 was too high and they were limited to reconstruction, in which the tower and the steeple were retained.
[8] St Mary's Church by E.Heath, in about 1865
The church is by far the tallest building in Monmouth, with the gilded cockerel weather vane some 205 feet above the ground.[9] The spire also has a gilded clock.
Interior [ edit ]
The interior dates from 1882 and was designed to accommodate 1,000 people, but many pews have now been removed. There are two chapels, but these were later additions. The rood was originally plain wood and has only recently been coloured. Part of the rood screen has been moved to the rear of the church to form a narthex. The Lady Chapel contains an English Altar with four riddel posts each with an unusual brass base and wrought iron capital supporting a newly gilded angel. The screen features the ironwork and woodwork of Letheren and Martin (the latter of whom made the Speaker's Chair in the House of Commons and the pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral).
St Mary's Church, 1905
The interior stained glass is mainly by Charles Eamer Kempe, of the 1880s. The Four Rivers of Paradise window is particularly fine, depicting the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates. The window was donated by Charles Henry Crompton-Roberts, of Drybridge House, a local businessman and landowner who was a substantial benefactor to the town.[10] After Kempe's death, their company also undertook the Four Edwards Window on the South wall, completed in 1911. It features Edward VII, a close friend of Lord Llangattock of The Hendre, a local landowner, as well as Edward the Confessor, Edward I and Edward, the Black Prince.[11] In the South aisle is a window designed in 1938 by the church curate, B. F. L. Clarke, showing Gwethenoc, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the church's architects Francis Smith and G. E. Street. The North chapel has screens by William Douglas Caroe. The reredos, a large altar painting entitled The Adoration of the Magi, is by James Watney Wilson, RA, and dates from 1888.[13] The architectural historian John Newman, in their Gwent/Monmouthshire Pevsner, describes it as "large and austere." The church contains several notable memorials, including one to Philip Fisher, architect of the Shire Hall, and Philip Meakins Hardwick, responsible for the monuments on The Kymin.
Interior of the church
The walls of the South aisle display sets of rare medieval tiles. Many were made in Malvern, but recent excavation on Monk Street has uncovered the kiln in which a number of the earlier examples were fired locally. One of the tiles shows the Bohun swan, a swan in chains, the badge of Mary de Bohun, the mother of Henry V who was born in the nearby castle, and another shows the arms of Westminster Abbey.[15]
The fine pipe organ is situated to the left of the chancel and has been recently renovated. The church now hosts a series of organ recitals throughout the summer. The font is of carved Portland stone and green Genoa marble and was installed in the present position in 1982.[11]
The bells [ edit ]
The precise origins of the bells are unknown but earliest records show that in 1673 the church: ".. paid Robert Marshall for staples and locks and keys and the irons for five bells – £1.2.6".
When originally installed the bells were in line with the apex of the nave roof and a substantial amount of their sideways thrust, when rung, was absorbed by the roof. But the demolition of the church in 1736 meant that this support was lost. By 1883 The bells were in need of an overhaul and the bell frame was replaced at a cost of £200. Half of this cost was met by the local lodge of Freemasons (who had paraded in full regalia at the opening ceremony of the new Victorian Church on 2 November 1882).
In 1953 all eight bells were overhauled and re-hung on ball bearings by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. They were rededicated on 1 June 1953. In October 1972 the bells were repaired again. An appeal by the Mayor of Monmouth raised £4,000 but the problem persisted. In 1982, as a result of a £10,000 bequest, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry was commissioned to re-tune and re-hang the bells, at a cost of £22,000, lower down in the tower. They were rededicated on 7 November 1982 and are now rung from a platform above the main entrance to the church.[16]
The eight current bells are as follows:
Bell Diameter (mm) Weight (kg) Note 1 710 246 Eb 2 740 248 D 3 800 305 C 4 865 357 Bb 5 950 510 Ab 6 990 550 G 7 1070 660 F 8 1200 860 Eb
Kelly's Directory of 1901 also mentions ".. a fire bell, recast at the expense of Mr. Job Rees, late captain of the fire brigade."[17] The bell, which originally hung on the outside of the tower, and which was originally cast in 1604, is now on display in the entrance porch to the church.
The graveyard and surroundings [ edit ]
Gravestone of John Renie
At the eastern end of the churchyard, very near the church, is the gravestone of John Renie, their wife and two sons. Renie was a house painter who died in 1832 at the age of 33. The gravestone was Grade II listed on 8 October 2005.[18] It comprises a rectangular carved 285-letter acrostic puzzle. From the larger H on the centre square the sentence "Here lies John Renie" may be read in any direction.[17] It is claimed that the sentence may be read a total of 46,000 different ways.[15] It is likely that Renie carved the stone himself. Writer and cleric Lionel Fanthorpe has suggested that their intention may have been to confuse the Devil, so ensuring Renie their passage to heaven.[19] In fact, Renie's remains lie elsewhere, as the stone was moved from its original position at a later date.[20] Nevertheless, Renie's gravestone is a listed building as is that of Charles Heath who is also buried in the graveyard.[21]
The churchyard walls, railings, gate piers and gates to the south-east of the church were designated as Grade II* listed buildings on 15 August 1974.[22] The wrought iron churchyard gates date from 1759, and the rusticated stone piers with side arches are from the 1830s.
Remains of the monastic foundation are sited on the adjacent Priory Street, including the Prior's Lodging, with a fine fifteenth century oriel window, often mistakenly thought to have a connection with Geoffrey of Monmouth. Geoffrey is believed to have been born in the town around 1100, probably of Breton parents, about the time that the first priory was being built.[23]
In 1851 Monmouth Cemetery was created when Monmouth Council closed St Mary's Churchyard for burials, when decaying human remains started to appear above ground. This was caused by the raised height of the churchyard. Residents in neighbouring Whitecross Street suffered a high mortality rate as a result and unpleasant odours from the churchyard were also evident. [24]
Services [ edit ]
The church is part of the Monmouth Group of Parishes, within the Church in Wales,[25] and holds regular weekly services.[26] The Diocese of Monmouth, the cathedral of which is the Cathedral Church of St Woolos in Newport, is one of the six dioceses of the Church in Wales. On 12 July 2010 a service was held at St Mary's to commemorate the life of local man Charles Rolls, founder of Rolls-Royce Limited, 100 years after their death.[citation needed]

Welcome to the City by the Bay! If you've got a hearty appetite, you're in luck, because San Francisco is a foodie heaven. Whether you're moving to San Francisco or just spending some time in the city, you'll want to hit up these restaurants to get a taste of the city's best food. In no particular order, here are the 8 must-try places to eat in San Francisco.
Ask anyone in this city if they'd recommend Nopa and you're sure to get a resounding “yes”. Located along the trendy Divisadero Street just a block away from the famous Painted Ladies, Nopa serves up artfully-inspired dishes in a two-story setting. While you're there, make sure to try the warm goat cheese with seasonal berries and crostini before you dig into the pappardelle with fennel sausage or rotisserie herbed chicken. Their wine list is no joke either; try a glass or a bottle from one of the nearly 100 different varieties they offer.
Ramen fans will definitely want to hit up Iza Ramen for, arguably, the best ramen in the city. With two locations–one in SOMA and the other in Lower Haight steps away from one of the wackiest SF bars–Iza offers a menu with just a few items on it and, believe us, you'll still have a hard time deciding what to get. Try starting with the garlic edamame or the Karaage Fried Chicken, both crowd-pleasers. Order the regular or spicy Iza Ramen and enjoy the perfectly-crafted combination of noodles, pork, and egg. The Iza Tsukemen is also an excellent choice, and they offer a vegetarian miso ramen, as well.
If you're craving authentic Italian food, but aren't in the market for a $150 meal for two, this is your spot. The Italian Homemade Company has been in North Beach for just under 4 years, but the husband-and-wife-duo has certainly made a name for themselves, expanding to open two additional locations. Along with groceries and homemade pastas to-go, this place cooks up fresh pappardelle, gnocchi, meatballs, and offers a number of sauces made in-house. Not only that, but the Italian Homemade Company offers piadina (plural: piadine), which tastes like a combination of a quesadilla and a handheld pita pocket, toasted to perfection and stuffed with melted cheese and meat. Between the extremely affordable prices and the quality of their food, the Italian Homemade Company does it right.
Foreign Cinema isn't just a restaurant, it's a full dining experience. Grab a reservation for this place, as you'll need one, and, if you're lucky, you'll get a table outside where the restaurant plays a movie on the patio wall. Their ever-rotating menu currently features oysters from some of the highest-rated oyster farms in the country, their famous sesame-fried chicken, and grilled local swordfish. Paired with a glass of wine, their whiskey of the week, or a brunch cocktail, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu at this beloved SF establishment.
Dinner with a view? Say no more. Head to Boulevard, where you can request a table with a view of the Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge. The menu is seasonal, but you can almost always find a dressed up Angus Filet or Wild King Salmon. Their fine American food is served with style and elegance, and the massive wine list provides plentiful options to begin your night.
Located in the trendy Mission District and right next door to Foreign Cinema, Lolinda serves up classic Argentinean dishes, but with a California flair. Rather than the stuffy, traditional steakhouse you might be used to, Lolinda's atmosphere is lively, creative, and fresh, just like its food. Start with one of their two ceviches and try the skirt steak plate with housemade chimichurri or the pork belly with crispy yuca for your main dishes.
San Francisco and good, Southern BBQ aren't exactly synonymous, so the city lucked out when 4505 Meats came to town in 2009. Owner and founder Ryan Farr uses one of the last remaining historic wood-fired barbecue pits to smoke meats to perfection. 4505 does it all: choose from brisket, smoked chicken (bone-in or pulled), pork shoulder, spare ribs, or jalapeño and cheddar sausage. And that's just from the pit. Their menu extends to items like the Frankaroni–crispy fried mac & cheese with a hot dog inside–posole, and a grits and egg vegetarian sandwich. You'll want to come on an empty stomach.
This cozy and intimate sushi spot on 24th Street in quaint Noe Valley is perfect if you want to get a reasonably-affordable meal without sacrificing flavor. Just make sure you're ready to wait in line or put your name down and hit a nearby bar while you wait. What Saru Sushi lacks in size, it makes up for in quality; it's impossible to go wrong with their nigiri or sashimi, and their watermelon roll–spicy tuna and avocado wrapped in cucumber sheet with garlic ponzu–is a crowd pleaser. Try their Popcorn Tuna, a panko-crusted spicy tuna roll with masago, scallions, spicy mayo & a sweet soy glaze, or the chef's specialty tasting spoons which range from seared ankimo with spicy radish, scallions and garlic ponzu to fatty tuna tartare with ponzu, yuzu kosho & shiso.
Is your mouth watering for San Francisco grub yet? Find your next apartment in The City by the Bay and you'll be ready to hit up these beloved SF restaurants in no time.

Even the most bleeding-heart liberal love muffins in the world usually don't have a lot of time or energy for prisoners. If a male comedian tells a rape joke about women, they're lambasted — as they should be — but everyone has a free pass to joke about prison rape. Despite a smorgasbord of studies showing the horrors of solitary confinement and prison life in general, few care about humane treatment of prisoners. There are so many atrocities in the world, that prisoner welfare just doesn't make the sympathy list for most folks. We're all complicit in the dehumanization of convicts.
Well, not all of us. Writer and artist Zander Cannon gets a pass because of their tremendous series “Kaijumax,” now in the middle of its third arc for Oni Press. Despite or perhaps because of its absurd premise — giant Japanese-style monsters on an island prison — “Kaijumax” does more to humanize real-life convicts than any recent piece of popular culture. Improbably, this absurd series is one of the most socially relevant and psychologically rich comics on the shelf.
Advertisement:
Cannon's inspiration for the series was Ultraman: a bonkers Japanese TV show from the 1960s in which the titular hero fought a different massive beast each week. Cannon took this insane series in a logical direction: What would society do with the likes of Megalon and Mothra? Cannon's answer was a twist on the idea of a monster island, which they transformed into a gargantuan version of HBO's Oz: a prison that's a little like Gotham's Arkham Asylum but with Godzilla instead of the Joker.
The series — which Cannon writes, illustrates, colors and letters — began in 2015 and is currently in the third “season” of a six-season arc. “Kaijumax,” at first glance, looks very much like a children's comic with bright colors and inventive monster designs. In fact, Cannon said in an interview with Salon, the comic often is placed in the children's section of comic-book stores — but, man, that's a mistake as big as Cannon's characters. This series is adult squared, not just for content, but for depth and complexity.
Cannon has created an ensemble series where just about every character, monster or human, prisoner or prison doctor, is given layers and purpose. The closest to a lead is Electrogor, a plutonium-spawning monster whose facial expressions and body language are the saddest since Charlie Brown. Electrogor has reason to be upset, since they aren't captured for any crime, but just for being a giant monster. The poor big guy was apprehended while gathering food for their children, who are now on their own, presumably hungry and also vulnerable in a world full of monster-hunting police and non-parental monsters. Meanwhile, Electrogor is stuck in Kaijumax, where corrupt guards, warring gangs and available drugs all conspire to break their spirit.
One of the most harrowing events in the series involves a monster-on-monster rape. This violation, which is taken seriously in all its horror and consequences, is one of the first signs that “Kaijumax” has more to offer than great art and a wacky premise. Cannon said in an interview with Salon, “I couldn't back off and make it light” — the rape needed to be treated with “gruesome seriousness.” Cannon understands where people are coming from when dismissing prison rape, but they see the flaws in that mindset: “You think, oh, it's happening to that murderer, or that drug dealer . . . but some prosecutor who's just trying to put away every black pot dealer, you end up with a whole different situation.” Kaijumax is the epitome of “a whole different situation,” and by shifting a real-life atrocity into an unreal world, it makes that next prison rape joke harder to hear or tell.
The second issue of the second arc is a high point, depicting a frighteningly true-to-life example of police brutality and a cover that elevates the racial subtext into text. On that cover, a kaiju carries a lunchbox, making their way to their crappy job, which is the best available for an ex-con (or “ex-mon” as wordplay-happy Cannon puts it). This stereotypical monster, towering over buildings, is usually seen smashing them, and you can see why he'd want to from signs displayed throughout the city: “NO KAIJU PERMITTED,” "KAIJU ENTRANCE IN BACK,” “WE SERVE HUMANS ONLY” and “NOW HIRING HUMANS ONLY.” A restaurant sign proclaims “WE SERVE KAIJU TAKEOUT ONLY.” Of course, from a logistical standpoint, cramming a massive monster into a restaurant would be impossible, but Cannon spins pure absurdity into strong commentary.
But never fear, this series is far from preachy or pretentious. Other examples of prison life are played more humorously, though not disrespectfully. For example: the rectal search. Comic books have delved into the multiverse, the Negative Zone, the Phantom Zone and the microverse, but until now they've never gone inside the pooper of a Godzilla type. The necessity of such an exam is pretty clear: a kaiju could have a whole armory smuggled up the wazoo. This is another example of Cannon following their premise to its logical extremes, logistically or psychologically.

That balance — which Cannon describes as “half silly, half tragic,” is what makes the series work. Cannon originally intended to stay more on the silly side of things, but admitted, “I'm not able to do that. I think of myself as being a pretty sunshine-y person, but all my stories tend to get a bit melancholy.” That melancholy elevates this series to the level of heartrending drama. Cannon strikes a balance between out-sized insanity and psychological depth by focusing on character and the fallout of “what being unwanted, being shunned, does to an individual.” Cannon said he's mostly interested in portraying the psychological fallout of issues such as racism and police brutality: the depression, drug addiction and PTSD. Cannon's commitment to the psychological reality of their unreal world makes this series hit hard, and the cartoony visuals make it go down smooth.
“Kaijumax” could have been an enjoyable guilty pleasure — like other creator-owned titles with insane premises such as “Grizzly Shark” or “Shirtless Bear-Fighter” — but those series can't be compared to “Oz” and “The Wire.” Kaijumax can. Cannon's unreal world of lizzas (monsters) and squishers (humans) is a carnival mirror reflecting our world. This comic is a unique and humane triumph.
On Chicago's south side, a sprawling new factory is making toxin-free soap for Method . Built on a former brownfield, it doesn't look much like a traditional manufacturing plant. Instead of smokestacks, a massive wind turbine and solar trees sit in the parking lot. And on the roof, is the world's largest rooftop greenhouse.
The farm–at 75,000 square feet, bigger than a city block–is run by Gotham Greens, which first launched greenhouses in Brooklyn on top of a former bowling alley and on a Whole Foods that stocks greens from the roof downstairs in its produce section. Now they've decided to expand and open the largest urban farm of its kind in the world.
“I think we've been able to prove this model that commercial scale local agriculture can be done profitably,” says co-founder Viraj Puri. “There's this growing consumer demand for locally-grown produce in terms of quality, nutrition, there's all the other macro trends we're seeing in places like California with the drought, and long distance transportation. So it seemed to us if this model is successful in New York City, why can it not also be successful in large metropolitan areas?”
In Chicago, where frigid winters mean that produce is often shipped from thousands of miles away, the new greenhouse will help supply more than a million pounds of leafy greens and herbs to local stores every year.
It isn't the only urban farm in the area; nearby, a former packing plant turned into a vertical farm a few years ago. But that farm, like many others launching in cities, runs on artificial light. Gotham Greens argues that isn't ideal for plants.
“The results are overwhelmingly superior when growing under natural lighting, in terms of crop quality, crop consistency, and yield,” says Puri. The company is participating in a study with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that it says will back up those claims.
Of course, using natural light instead of hundreds or thousands of LEDs also saves energy. The new greenhouse can run on fully on renewables. It has advantages over traditional farms as well; it reuses all of the water used to irrigate the crops, doesn't need pesticides, and takes a fraction of the land.
LG is planning to show “advanced robot technologies” at CES 2017 next week to showcase new innovations in artificial intelligence. The robots aren't your run-of-the-mill smart toasters or vacuum bots either, with some being designed for public use outdoors. If you're getting visions of K-2So, you're probably on the right track.
There looks to be three new AI bots on the way, one for use at home, serving as a “smart home gateway” and personal assistant for owners: think, I, Robot. Another model “will demonstrate new capabilities for tending to one's yard and garden”: think, The Lawnmower Man.
The third, and perhaps most interesting type of robot LG has lined up includes “models designed for commercial use in public spaces such as airports and hotels to help improve the traveler's experience”: think, Johnny Cab in Total Recall.
OK, maybe my robot analogies are a little off, but we're inching ever closer to a world where we all have our own personal robot assistants to mow the lawn, make pancakes, carry our luggage and generally do the crap we don't want to do.
LG's new robots will be able to “navigate complex environments and decipher the most efficient and effective path to accomplish tasks, making people's lives easier at every touch-point.” Bring on the Ex Machina future, but let's hope they don't go all Eva/HAL-9000/Skynet on us.
Do you want an AI robot assistant in your house? Or are you still a little freaked out by the prospect of intelligent robots?

The real small house in the meadow is well hidden two steps from the bustling Kifissia in the center of Athens Greece. The environment totally countryside: garden, bohemian, lakes and animals.
There live Sotiris and Fouli Georgakopoulou who have a lot to remember from a happy life of almost three decades in the house of fairy tale.
“As an unmarried couple, we were people in the center, we stayed in an apartment with the minimal necessary furniture in Lycabettus. When the family started to grow up, we wanted a house of spit … to look like country house, to have a garden, to smell the soil, to have animals. We found this here in Paradise of Amaroussion, a large estate, with a house near a cliff, and a garden with herbs one and a half meters high.
Since then, the house has grown as the family grows, and we continue to build, shred, add, change. We have been living for 25 whole years, just as our daughter, who brought them here a 35-day-old baby. Think that we did all this and continue without our home even belonging to us, we are staying with rent.”
We almost made it from scratch. We changed the interior layout, made insulations and all the technical work, we used some of the old materials. We added sherds that give a lot of light and the feeling that you are completely in the nature, we built in the big garden three houses, one stone, one wooden and one brick, we built a pool, a lake, a playground with a pit … and not one, but two wonderful tree houses.
Your home gets unexpected colors, tasteful furniture, and objects, lots of imagination … Have you worked with an interior designer?
All the technically-functional was edited by my man who is an architect, with the rest I took care of – although I have no relationship – I love the decoration.
How is it to live in a story of fairy tales in the center of the “harsh” city?
First is a luxury. Although it gives the feeling that we are in the far countryside – until a few years ago, imagine, around us was a field of sheep – it is at a hub and is ten minutes from the center. On the other hand, it is introverted, and that can hide the “trap” of isolation. But it's nice in the city center to know that everything is for us “little house on the prairie.”
Describe us a “daily” day of the house …
The house “wakes up” at 7.30 in the morning. From that time onwards people are coming – you suddenly discover that Sotiris junior (the 14-year-old younger son) has brought their three friends, is constantly cooking, in the evening we almost never go out, we spend hours together in the conservatory and according to the family habit, something new we make, we deal with animals …
And a day of celebration?
The day for us is when the children are gathered, who now have these own children, our grandchildren. Then we lay a large table, adorned with the best, a whole ritual. The celebration wants banquets, spoons, good food, wine and loved ones.
What gives soul to a place?
People. Always.
What is your favorite style of decoration?
In seasons and according to the phases of life I have passed through all. The environment also plays a big role. Previously, before we got married, the apartment in the center was almost empty. This again here is like a farm, country to say?
And your favorite color combinations?
A! From colors, we have it all! We continuously change and paint walls and furniture. Besides, all colors in the spectrum are combined.
What will be your next home purchase? What are you missing?
Now I'm not getting any more, I most thank give! In the past, with my husband, we were gathering glasses, glasses, glasses … and enough dishes, even from our trips we were carrying. But our old furniture also transforms them, we paint them, we change their use. Of course, we have a great collection of computers, the whole family is a fan of technology.
Which is the busiest point in the house?
The conservatory that gathers either us or all of us at some point. And the garden in the summer.
We also see a lovely cat and an even more wonderful dog. How do call them? Are they in harmony? Are there other animals in the house?
The cat is Mozart and the dog is Charlie, and they are very dear. There are other dogs, including chickens, ducks, rabbits, parrots, other birds, fish in the pond, and my son's hamster.
Tell us that there is a vegetable garden too?
Of course, and it nourishes the family! We have spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, rocket, and all the vegetables in the summer. And still, there are lemon, orange, pear, pomegranates, peach trees, almonds, mulberries, arbors.
Where and how do you imagine your after ten years?
In a country. As soon as the younger child goes to study, I could go even further. In a province, on an island to see the sea … somewhere near nature. The fact that the house is not ours is something that frees us, we can more easily redefine our lives.
What is the best compliment you have for your home?
The best compliment our children do it to us. Although they have grown up and have traced their own paths, they always return home here, near us, they are their paradise.
Case Continues Against Yolo County to Secure Right to Self-Defense
BELLEVUE, Wash. and SAN CARLOS, Calif., Oct. 25 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and the Calguns Foundation have dismissed their case against Sacramento County, California and its Sheriff, John McGinness, after the Sheriff modified their handgun carry permitting policy. Law-abiding Sacramento County residents may now successfully apply for permits to carry handguns by asserting self-defense as a basis for carry permit issuance. A one-year residency requirement has been eliminated, as has policy language that tied self-defense to arbitrary geographic factors.
While Sacramento County has changed its policies, other counties still fail to recognize that self-defense is a legally sufficient reason for issuance of a handgun carry permit. The litigation will continue against Yolo County and its Sheriff, Ed Prieto, on behalf of SAF, Calguns, and Davis resident Adam Richards. Additionally, this past March, Calguns supporter Brett Stewart unsuccessfully asserted self-defense as a basis for seeking a carrying license from Sheriff Prieto. The Sheriff's written policy states that "self protection and protection of family (without credible threats of violence)" are insufficient reasons to exercise Second Amendment rights. Mr. Stewart will seek to join the litigation as a plaintiff in this case, now styled Richards v. Prieto.
"We are very happy to have been able to work with Sheriff McGinness to assist Sacramento County in revising their policies and practices," said Gene Hoffman, Chairman of the Calguns Foundation. "Over the past year, more than 30 of our law abiding members and supporters have received licenses to carry firearms with 'good cause' statements that are simple variations of self-defense. Even though the Sheriff is retiring at the end of the year, both candidates to replace Sheriff McGinness have publicly stated their support for Second Amendment rights and that they consider self-defense a compelling reason for issuance of gun carry permit."
"The Second Amendment Foundation will continue working with the Calguns Foundation and keep funding attorney Alan Gura's lawsuits in California until everyone's firearms civil rights are fully protected," added SAF founder Alan Gottlieb. "Together, we will see many more legal victories."
For those who wish to apply for a CCW permit, the Calguns Foundation maintains an informational portal to assist applicants in all 58 California counties as part of its recently announced Carry Licensing Compliance and Sunshine Initiative. The Sacramento County page has details on the actual procedure and successful good cause statements and is available at http://bit.ly/CGFSacCarry
The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation's oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms. Founded in 1974, the Foundation has grown to more than 650,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.
The Calguns Foundation (www.calgunsfoundation.org) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization which serves its members by providing Second Amendment-related education, strategic litigation and the defense of innocent California gun owners from improper or malicious prosecution. The Calguns Foundation works to educate government and protect the rights of individuals to acquire, own, and lawfully use firearms in California.

PLATTSBURGH — Donald Trump will hold a rally in Plattsburgh on Saturday, the Clinton County Republican Committee announced Tuesday evening.
“I got a call this evening informing me Donald Trump is coming to Plattsburgh on Saturday,” wrote Clinton County GOP County Chair Don McBrayer on the group's Facebook page. “The exact time and location is still in flux, but we're working on it.”
“Trump's people will be handling everything in the way of media, crowd control, etc,” McBrayer continued.
McBrayer said Executive Vice Chair John Zurlo will meet Trump as the committee's representative.
“I'm certain the final details will be all over the media within a day,” McBrayer wrote. “By then, we will know exact details.”
A Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking confirmation.
New York has become the epicenter of the presidential race this week before voters head to the polls for the primary on April 19.
On Monday, Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigned in the Capital Region, while Sen. Ted Cruz made an appearance in Scotia last week.
Former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, who represented New York in the Senate from 2001-2009, appeared in Cohoes earlier this month.
While none have stumped in the North Country, Trump held a rally in Burlington in January. Kasich also held several events in the state before voters handed Trump a 2 point victory over the Ohio governor in the March primary.
The real estate developer's rallies continually draw thousands of supporters.
Only two venues in Plattsburgh could accommodate a crowd that size: SUNY Plattsburgh and the city-owned Crete Memorial Civic Center.
“We're hearing some conflicting reports about where and date and time,” said Steve Peters, the city's superintendent of recreation, on Wednesday.
“We're going to do everything we can to expose our residents to this national political process."
A Plattsburgh City Police rep said the department found out about the pending visit on Wednesday morning.
"There will be planning and we will keep the media apprised," said the spokesperson.
A Monmouth University poll released last week said 52 percent of likely Republican primary voters in New York support Trump. Kasich drew 25 percent; Cruz, 17 percent.
At 58 percent, Trump has more than half the vote in New York City and Long Island. The number drops to 52 percent upstate and to 47 percent in Western New York.
“If this result holds in every single congressional district, Trump will walk away with nearly all of New York State's delegates,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.
The Empire State's 95 GOP delegates are allocated proportionately.
None of the three remaining GOP candidates have locked up enough delegates to clinch the nomination.
While Rep. Elise Stefanik, the district's federal representative, has refrained from endorsing a candidate, former Rep. John Sweeney joined the Trump campaign earlier this month.
And while the candidate themselves isn't scheduled to appear, Sanders supporters have a series of downtown events planned for Saturday afternoon, including a march and a stable of activities at Trinity Park.
Organizers said a Trump visit will not alter their plans.
"Let's not let this distract us from our main goal which is helping Bernie beat Hillary in the New York State primary on April 19th," wrote Adam Guillette, a coordinator for the Upstate NY for Bernie Sanders group, on Facebook. "If we want to protest Trump, let's double our efforts for canvassing in the morning at the Koffee Kat and double the size of our march to support the candidate who will easily beat them by double digits!"
We'll update this story as more details become available.

It was 1997 and I was sitting in a terribly run-down apartment in beautiful Allston, Massachusetts. A typical late night of viewing source and teaching myself HTML followed a day of packing CDs at a local record label for peanuts (hence the run-down apartment). I'm sure you can relate.

One triumphant night, I pumped my fist in sweet victory. I'd just successfully coded my first JavaScript image rollover. Remember those?
I still remember the amazement of seeing a crudely designed button graphic I'd cobbled together “swap” to a different one when hovered over by the mouse. I barely had a clue as to what I was doing at the time, but making something on the page successfully change, dynamically, was, well…magical.
We've come a long way over the past decade in regard to interaction and visual experience on the web. Historically, technologies like Flash and JavaScript have enabled animation, movement, and interaction effects. But recently, with browsers rolling out support for CSS transitions and transforms, some of that animation and experience enrichment can now be comfortably moved to our stylesheets.
My first JavaScript rollover back in 1997 took me several nights of head scratching, many lines of code that seemed alien to me at the time, and multiple images. CSS3 today enables far richer, more flexible interactions through simple lines of code that thankfully degrade gracefully in the browsers that don't yet support it.
We can start to use CSS3 transitions right now as long as we carefully choose the situations in which to use them. They certainly won't replace existing technologies like Flash, JavaScript, or SVG (especially without broader browser support)—but they can be used to push the experience layer a notch higher. And most importantly, they're relatively easy to implement for the web designer already familiar with CSS. It only takes a few lines of code.
Tail wagging the dog
Initially developed solely by the WebKit team for Safari, CSS Transitions are now a Working Draft specification at the W3C. This is a nice example of browser innovation being folded back into a potential standard. I say potential since it's merely a draft today. However, Opera has recently added CSS transitions support in version 10.5 and Firefox has pledged support for version 4.0. In other words, while it is a draft specification and evolving, it's stable enough for Opera and Firefox to be taking it seriously and adding support for it. Most importantly, CSS transitions are no longer proprietary Safari-only experiments.
Let's take a look at how transitions work, shall we?
What are CSS transitions?
I like to think of CSS transitions like butter, smoothing out value changes in your stylesheets when triggered by interactions like hovering, clicking, and focusing. Unlike real butter, transitions aren't fattening—they're just a few simple rules in your stylesheet to enrich certain events in your designs.
The W3C explains CSS transitions quite simply:
CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration. This smoothing animates the changing of a CSS value when triggered by a mouse click, focus or active state, or any changes to the element (including even a change on the element's class attribute).
A simple example
Here's a simple example, where we'll add a transition to the background color swap of a link. When hovered over, the link's background color will change, and we'll use a transition to smooth out that change—an effect previously only possible using Flash or JavaScript, but now possible with a few simple lines of CSS.
The markup is a simple hyperlink, like so:
<a href="#" class="foo">Transition me!</a>
Next, we'll add a declaration for the normal link state with a little padding and a light green background, followed by the background swap to a darker green on hover:
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; } a.foo:hover { background: #690; }
Figure 1: The normal and :hover state of the link.
Now let's add a transition to that background color change. This will smooth out and animate the difference over a specified period of time.
Figure 2: Here we can see the smooth transition of light green to darker green background.
For the time being, we'll use only the vendor-prefixed properties which currently work in WebKit-based browsers (Safari and Chrome) to keep things simple. Later, we'll add vendor prefixes for Mozilla and Opera.
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition-property: background; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s; -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease; } a.foo:hover { background: #690; }
You'll notice the three parts of a transition in the declaration:
transition-property : The property to be transitioned (in this case, the background property)
: The property to be transitioned (in this case, the background property) transition-duration : How long the transition should last (0.3 seconds)
: How long the transition should last (0.3 seconds) transition-timing-function : How fast the transition happens over time (ease)
Timing functions (or, I really wish I'd paid attention in math class)
The timing function value allows the speed of the transition to change over time by defining one of six possibilities: ease , linear , ease-in , ease-out , ease-in-out , and cubic-bezier (which allows you to define your own timing curve).
If you slept through geometry in high school like I did, don't worry. I recommend simply plugging in each of these timing function values to see how they differ.
For our simple example, the duration of the transition is so quick (just a mere 0.3 seconds) that it'd be difficult to tell the difference between the six options. For longer animations, the timing function you choose becomes more of an important piece of the puzzle, as there's time to notice the speed changes over the length of the animation.
When in doubt, ease (which is also the default value) or linear should work just fine for short transitions.
We could simplify the declaration significantly by using the transition shorthand property:
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease; } a.foo:hover { background: #690; }
Now we have a much more compact rule that accomplishes the same result.
All of this wonderful transitioning works just fine in WebKit browsers, but what about the others?
Browser support
As I mentioned earlier, transitions were initially developed by WebKit, and have been in Safari and Chrome since version 3.2, but Opera supports them as well in version 10.5 and support has been promised in Firefox 4.0. Because of that present and near-future support, it's important to add the appropriate vendor prefixes so that our transitions will work in more browsers as support is rolled out.
Building the full transition stack
Here's a revised declaration, adding the -moz and -o prefixes as well as the actual CSS3 transition property. We're putting the non-prefixed property last in the stack to ensure that the final implementation will trump the others as the property moves from draft to finished status.
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease; -moz-transition: background 0.3s ease; -o-transition: background 0.3s ease; transition: background 0.3s ease; } a.foo:hover { background: #690; }
With that stack, we'll be smoothing out that background color change in current versions of Safari, Chrome, and Opera, as well as future versions of any browser that chooses to support it.
Transitioning states
I remember being slightly confused when I first started playing around with CSS Transitions. Wouldn't it make more sense if the transition properties were placed in the :hover declaration, since that's the trigger for the transition? The answer is that there are other possible states of an element besides :hover , and you'll likely want that transition to happen on each of those without duplication.
For instance, you may want the transition to also happen on the :focus or :active pseudo-classes of the link as well. Instead of having to add the transition property stack to each of those declarations, the transition instructions are attached to the normal state and therefore declared only once.
The following example adds the same background switch to the :focus state. This enables triggering the transition from either hovering over or focusing the link (via the keyboard, for example).
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease; -moz-transition: background 0.3s ease; -o-transition: background 0.3s ease; transition: background 0.3s ease; } a.foo:hover, a.foo:focus { background: #690; }
Transitioning multiple properties
Let's say that along with the background color, we also want to change the link's text color and transition that as well. We can do that by stringing multiple transitions together, separated by a comma. Each can have their varying duration and timing functions (Figure 3).
Figure 3: The normal and :hover states of the link.
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; -moz-transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; -o-transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; } a.foo:hover, a.foo:focus { color: #030; background: #690; }
Transitioning all possible properties
An alternative to listing multiple properties is using the all value. This will transition all available properties.
Let's drop all into our simple example instead of listing background and color separately. They'll now share the same duration and timing function.
a.foo { padding: 5px 10px; background: #9c3; -webkit-transition: all 0.3s ease; -moz-transition: all 0.3s ease; -o-transition: all 0.3s ease; transition: all 0.3s ease; } a.foo:hover, a.foo:focus { color: #030; background: #690; }
This is a convenient way of catching all the changes that happen on :hover , :focus , or :active events without having to list each property you'd like to transition.
Which CSS properties can be transitioned?
Now that we've successfully transitioned the background and color of a hyperlink, there are many other CSS properties that can be transitioned, including width , opacity , position, and font-size . A chart of all the possible properties (and their types) that can be transitioned is available from the W3C.
Why not use JavaScript instead?
You might be wondering, with not all browsers supporting (or at least promising support for) CSS Transitions, why not use a JavaScript solution to handle the animation? Popular frameworks such as jQuery, Prototype, and script.aculo.us have enabled animations via JavaScript that work cross-browser for some time now.
It all depends on how crucial the transitions are to the experience. I'm stressing here in this little book that you can embrace the simplicity and flexibility of CSS3 if you choose the appropriate parts of the user experience to apply it: enriching the interactions that happen on the page. Quite often, the animation of these interactions when handled by CSS Transitions aren't integral to the brand, readability, or layout of the website. Therefore, a few simple lines of CSS to trigger a simple animation that's native to the browsers that support it (rather than tapping into a JavaScript framework) seems like a smart choice. And one I'm glad we have at our disposal.
Be smart, be subtle
Like all shiny new tools, it's important to use transitions appropriately. One can easily go overboard adding transitions to everything on the page, resulting in some sort of annoying, pulsating monster. It's key to decide where transitions rightfully enrich the user experience and when they are just extraneous noise. Additionally, making sure the speed of the transition doesn't slow down an otherwise snappy action from the user is crucial. Use with care and caution.

Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. Jeremiah 29:1-7
On the day after the national election, we held prayer services at Washington National Cathedral. We had planned the liturgy knowing that whatever the election's outcome, half of the country would feel exiled in their own land. I preached from the prophet Jeremiah, who knew well the spiritual terrain of exile. I invited those gathered to pray the Prayer of St Francis. And I said that if asked, Washington National Cathedral would host an interfaith inaugural prayer service in January.
As that day approaches, many in our church and in our land question Dean Hollerith's and my willingness to host an inaugural prayer service for one whose behavior and words have been so offensive and divisive. We also have been asked why we accepted the invitation for the Cathedral choristers to sing at as part as the musical prelude to the inauguration when so many other artists and performers, on principle, declined that invitation.
First, I want to acknowledge the anger and disappointment that our decisions have engendered. And to say that I'm listening, because the spiritual principles that move many of you to protest are essential for the work that lies ahead. While I do not ask you to agree, I simply ask you to consider that we, too, acted on spiritual principles. Those principles, while they may seem to conflict with yours, are also essential for the work that lies ahead.
The first spiritual principle, which always characterizes the Episcopal Church at its most faithful, is that we welcome all people into our houses of prayer. We welcome all because we follow a Lord and Savior who welcomes all, without qualification. Welcoming does not mean condoning offensive speech or behavior; it does not mean that we agree with or seek to legitimize. We simply welcome all into this house of prayer, in full acknowledgment that every one of us stands in the need of prayer.
The second spiritual principle that informs my decision is that in times of national division, the Episcopal Church is called to be a place where those who disagree can gather for prayer and learning and to work for the good of all. I am alarmed by some of Mr. Trump's words and deeds and by those who now feel emboldened to speak and act in hateful ways. Nonetheless, I believe in the power of God to work for good, and the capacity of our nation to rise to our highest ideals. As President Obama said in their last speech, our nation's future will be determined by our resolve to “restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.” I ask the people of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington to join me in dedication to that purpose, in faithfulness to Christ and as ones who cherish the gift of democracy.
Finally, Dean Hollerith and I decided to host an interfaith prayer service and to accept the invitation for the Cathedral choristers to sing before the inauguration itself as a gift. At a time when emotions are raw, we hope to offer a few moments of spiritual solace and the healing gift of transcendent beauty. We also want the nation to know that we are still here, as people of hope. While the inauguration is a civic rather than a religious ceremony, it is also an occasion for prayer and an opportunity to offer the balm of beauty. Please be assured that participation in the inauguration is entirely voluntary for individual members, and that the choir has worked diligently and sensitively to prepare its younger choristers and their parents for this event.
Even as we pray and work for common purpose, know that I understand how much is at stake in this moment and the importance of our collective witness. We are called to pray and sometimes to protest. We are called to seek reconciliation, but never at the expense of justice.
The New York Red Bulls haven't truly found their stride this season, at least compared to their excellent campaigns of recent years, and head coach Jesse Marsch is ready to bring in summer reinforcements.
The RBNY head coach made that clear in an in-depth appearance on the MSG Networks' Red Bulls Insider Podcast, telling host Kristian Dyer that the club is shopping for “an impact guy” to bolster the attack and possibly a “difference-maker” at center back.
While expressing faith in current attacking standouts like Sacha Kljestan, Gonzalo Veron and Mike Grella, Marsch noted that New York are “looking to add another attacking player, a guy that we think can come in and be an impact guy.”
“I don't know yet,” they added when Dyer playfully asked for a name. “We've got a few that we're looking at. But we're working hard and know that we need to add one more big piece. And then we're looking for a center back, which you and I have talked about enough in the past couple months. So hopefully we can find a way in this transfer window to make a couple big additions to help our team."
The Red Bulls currently sit in mid-table in the Eastern Conference with a 6-7-2 record and a -6 goal differential. Their previously-prolific attack has gone quiet, with just 15 goals in their first 15 games, a number which ranks fourth-worst in MLS at present.
“We've got a good group of guys, but I think we need to bring in some difference-makers,” said Marsch. “It'll be a guy that is younger and fits the way we play.
“...We have a little bit more flexibility from an international perspective. We have some money to spend, we have roster spots. So we'll have to make some additions, and we'll just try to calculate what those are and how to do it in a way that best sets up our team to make a real strong push at the end of the year.”
WASHINGTON -- Members of the House Intelligence Committee are declining to stick up for their colleagues' anti-Muslim allegations, saying that their conduct is unbecoming of someone in their position with access to classified information. None, however, is going so far as to call for them to give up their seat on the committee.
"We have a small committee, we work hard together, it's a very bipartisan committee and we deal with national threats," said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. "This does not help our committee at all."
Last week, committee chair Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), a former FBI agent, similarly dismissed the members' allegations that the Muslim Brotherhood may be infiltrating the U.S. government.
"That kind of assertion certainly doesn't comport with the Intelligence Committee, and I can say that on the record," they told USA Today.
Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Thomas Rooney (R-Fla.) and Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) recently wrote letters to the inspectors general at five federal agencies asking them to investigate the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their most high-profile target was Huma Abedin, a top aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They alleged that Abedin may have ties to the Brotherhood through their family.
Bachmann, Rooney and Westmoreland are all members of the Intelligence Committee and therefore have access to classified information.
"Given our access to sensitive information, I also believe members of the Intelligence Committee have a special responsibility to exercise caution in making statements about national security concerns," said Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), a member of the committee. "The only reasonable action for the authors of these letters to take would be to withdraw their requests."
"The unfounded allegations made by some members of the Intelligence Committee against Huma Abedin are deeply disturbing -- and damaging to the committee's work and its reputation. The authors discredit themselves and are deserving of no further comment," added Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).
The progressive group People for the American Way has called on House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to remove Bachmann from the Intelligence Committee.
“Members of the House Intelligence Committee are entrusted with classified information that affects the safety and security of all Americans," said PFAW President Michael Keegan. "That information should not be in the hands of anyone with such a disregard for honesty, misunderstanding of national security, and lack of respect for their fellow public servants."
Boehner, however, has indicated no desire to reconsider their position.
"I don't know that that's related at all," they said when reporters asked them last week whether they would remove them
Ruppersberger declined to give their opinion on the matter, saying the decision rested with Boehner.
"I don't really want to get into that because it's not my call," they said. "I just know I'm concerned about the comments. I think that those of us in leadership have said that the comments were not factually correct, and we think that it was not the right thing to say. It was wrong. You don't want to discriminate against any American. If the allegations in there [their letters] were true, believe me, we would be dealing with it -- our law enforcement agencies would be dealing with it."
Bachmann has maintained that their concerns have been "distorted." On Tuesday, Gohmert called their critics "numb nuts."
Lawmakers aren't the only ones thinking their five colleagues are fabricating conspiracy theories -- the Muslim Brotherhood is also confused.
Ahmed Al Nahhas, an activist and leader of the Brotherhood in Egypt told the GlobalPost that the allegations were "ridiculous."

The Iceland international is happy at Swansea City.
Iceland's Gylfi Sigurdsson reacts
Swansea City midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson has been discussing their links with Everton this summer.
The Iceland international, who had an excellent summer at the European Championships with their nation, was heavily linked with a move to Goodison Park to join the Ronald Koeman revolution.
Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson
It was reported by The Telegraph in July that Everton were ready to pay up to £25 million to snap up the Iceland star.
But whilst Everton succeeded in luring Ashley Williams from South Wales the Icelander stayed put.
Everton's Ashley Williams reacts after goal effort is cleared off the line by Stoke City's Peter Crouch
Speaking to The Telegraph today they discussed this transfer rumour, suggesting they are more than happy where they currently are:
“You say you try not to pay too much attention but of course you are aware of what is going on. And your friends are asking you all the time: ‘Are you going to sign for Everton?' But I'm really happy here.
“I'd been discussing a new contract with the club for quite a while. It got delayed because of the Americans coming in to take over. Once that was done, there was no reason why I would want to go.”
Iceland's Gylfi Sigurdsson shoots at goal
Everton of course were ambitious in the transfer market. As well as Williams they snapped up Yannick Bolasie and Idrissa Gana Gueye – whilst they nearly managed to sign Arsenal and Tottenham newbies Lucas Perez and Moussa Sissoko respectively.
But Sigurdsson was simply not going anywhere and proved just that by signing a new deal with the club at the start of August.
Now they will be focusing all their attention on keeping Swansea in the Premier League comfortably this season.
Some voters have met Clinton's campaign with skepticism; they want a woman, just not this woman. But the gender gap explains why they make perfect sense
Did it have to be Hillary Clinton for president? Yes. Here's why
The US is the closest it's ever been breaking the 240-year male stronghold on the presidency. Though American women have made some political gains during that period, there has only been one woman so far with a real chance of smashing that glass ceiling: Hillary Clinton.
And yet some women, especially young women, have greeted Clinton's historic candidacy with muted enthusiasm.
“I want there to be a woman president, of course,” said Maria Alcivar, a graduate student at Iowa State University and reluctant Clinton supporter. “I just don't see why it had to be her.”
Across the country over the last 18 months, several women have expressed similar sentiments: a wish that the potential first female leader was someone less flawed and less polarizing.
Because women have higher and harder barriers to clear, the women that win need to exceed expectations Adrienne Kimmell, Barbara Lee Family Foundation
Experts say there is no predictable route to the presidency for a female candidate, not least because the trail is still being blazed. But there is a case to be made that the first woman to get this close to the presidency would probably look a lot like Clinton: a nationally recognizable figure with an extensive résumé and close proximity to power.
“There's a saying, the first into battle needs to wear the most armor,” said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which studies women running for executive office.
They continued: “Because women have higher and harder barriers to clear the path to executive office, the women that win need to exceed expectations – so by comparison they tend to be more qualified than their opponents.”
A 2011 study identified what the researchers called the “Jackie (and Jill) Robinson effect”, a reference to the first African American player in Major League Baseball. Robinson broke baseball's color barrier in 1947 and by no coincidence, according to the theory, they remain one of the best players of all time.
The study found that female lawmakers outperform their male colleagues, introducing more legislation and delivering more financial projects to their home districts. This, the researchers suggest, is the result of underlying gender discrimination, which narrows the prospective pool of female candidates down to only the most qualified, talented and politically ambitious.
Women who ran before Hillary Clinton: 'I cannot vote, but I can be voted for' Read more
“One of the reasons it's taking so long to elect a woman president is because very few women have actually run for president,” said Jennifer Lawless, the director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. The first may have been Victoria Woodhull in 1872, nearly 50 years before women won the vote, and 136 years before Clinton's first competitive campaign in 2008.
The gender gap leaves a very narrow pipeline to the top, Lawless said. The most common route to the US presidency is through the Senate or a governor's mansion, which greatly narrows the pool of prospective female candidates, since there are currently only 20 women serving in the 100-strong US Senate, 84 members of congress (19%) and six female governors.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic member of congress from Colorado who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 1987, has spent a lot of time over the last 18 months thinking about what has changed for women since they first entered Congress in 1973.
“Sexism is a lot harder to pinpoint than it was but it's clearly still there,” they said.
When Schroeder first arrived in Congress they faced questions from their male colleagues about how they managed to raise two small children while being a lawmaker. On one occasion they snapped back: “I have a brain and a uterus and I use both.” They were also advised never to wear green. It apparently was not a power color.

Research shows that women who run for elective office win at comparable rates to men. Party trumps gender at the ballot box. That is to say, male and female voters overwhelmingly support their party's candidate, regardless of gender.
In an analysis of 2010 House races, female candidates received as many votes as male candidates of the same seat status (incumbent, open seat, challenger), according to a study by Kathleen Dolan published in their 2014 book, When Does Gender Matter? Women Candidates and Gender Stereotypes in American Elections.
And yet women seeking to run for office still encounter barriers their male counterparts do not. Studies show they are less likely to express interest in a political career and more likely to doubt their ability to run. Women are less likely to put themselves forward and need to be recruited to run for office, research suggests.

Ivy Taylor, the mayor of San Antonio, said they did not start their career expecting to run for public office. After encouragement from their husband and community leaders they decided to try for a seat on the city council in 2009.
“I felt qualified but not ready, if that makes sense,” Taylor said of their decision to run. “It took some time for me to get used to the idea because I didn't think of myself as a politician but then I came to understand that elected office was an extension of my commitment to working with people in order to create a better future.”
Taylor is one of only 19 big city mayors, according to a 2016 report by the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance of the 100 largest US cities. Of the top 15, only San Antonio has a female mayor.
Experts and political groups involved in recruiting women to elective office say that having a female president – whoever they are – will open doors for women at every level of government, regardless of party. In some cases, even the prospect of a Clinton presidency has already helped.
“It is not a coincidence that we have a [high] number of Democratic women running in competitive Senate races in the same year we have Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket,” according to Muthoni Wambu Kraal, the senior director for state and local campaigns at Emily's List, which has been helping elect pro-choice women since 1985. “She was a powerful recruitment tool.”
A 5.0 earthquake struck southeast of Los Angeles International Airport this evening, causing significant shaking across Southern California. [Update: Quake was downgraded to 4.7.]
The temblor hit about 8:30 p.m. a mile from the South Bay community of Lennox.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, but authorities said they were receiving numerous calls about the temblor.
A 3.0 aftershock occurred a few minutes later near Lennox.
Check out the USGS quake map.
Update at 8:58 p.m.: The temblor started about 8.4 miles below the surface, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in the Lennox area said china fell off shelves, but there were no reports of more serious damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department is on "emergency quake mode" as a precaution.
It's unclear what fault the quake struck on. The Newport-Inglewood fault, which has produced several powerful temblors, runs through that general area.
Updated at 9:10 p.m.: An initial assessment by the Los Angeles Fire Department found "no major structural damage, no serious injuries," according to spokesperson Brian Humphrey's Twitter feed.
Updated at 9:20 p.m. : At the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lennox station, deputies said the shaking was brief but intense. "It was pretty strong but over in about 10 seconds," said Lt. Kent Wegener. "There are no [immediate] reports of damage. At this point, we are checking all the critical facilities and getting our ducks in a row."
Los Angeles County Fire officials also said they had not received damage reports in residential or industrial areas, including the coastal refineries.
Update at 9:35 p.m.: KCAL interviewed moviegoers at a shopping mall in Redondo Beach who said the quake shook the screen and caused some ceiling tiles to fall. But firefighters said there was no serious damage or injuries. KCAL also reported numerous burglar alarms going off and some people cutting themselves on glass.
Updated at 9:50 p.m.: In Hawthorne, firefighters were called to Chadron Avenue, near Crenshaw Boulevard, where a light pole was damaged during the earthquake. One man also suffered a heart attack, but it was unclear whether that was connected. “Luckily, nothing major so far,” said Hawthorne Police Lt. Michael Ishii.
The earthquake was “a bit deep,” said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough – originating 8.4 miles below the surface. “That tends to make it less sharp – less of a jerky, abrupt motion,” Hough said. As a result, most of the region felt the quake largely as a rolling motion, though some closer to the center felt more of a jolt.
Lucy Jones, seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said the earthquake appears to be consistent with a rupture on the Newport-Inglewood fault. (She said the quake was too small to break the surface, so they can't definitively identify faults.) Jones said this fault isn't typically thought to be capable of producing a major quake like the San Andreas fault. But it was responsible for the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, which measured about 6.3 in magnitude. The Long Beach quake was about as big as seismologists expect from this fault, they said.
"There have been numerous magnitude 3s on it over the years, a cluster of them in the 1980s," they said. "In general, it's an active area."
The quake was initially logged as a magnitude 5 by automatic sensors, but as more data came in, seismologists downgraded it to a magnitude 4.7. It also had an aftershock with a magnitude 3.1 about six minutes later. So far, Jones said, 12,000 people have reported feeling the shaking, including some people in San Diego. They were not surprised at the number of people reporting because the quake shook a pretty densely populated area.
Nothing about the quake or its aftershocks looked unusual, they said. "It's a real garden variety California earthquake so far."
What's notable about it is location with respect to people.
They said the most similar earthquake to this one was a temblor that shook the Inglewood area in 1920, and that one was classified as a "minor damaging shock."

The results of this prospective cohort study involving 31 925 men, 18 yrs of follow-up, and 3839 PCa cases offer additional evidence of a role for ejaculation frequency in the etiology of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease. The absolute difference in PCa rate between ≥21 and 4–7 EPM was 2.39 cases/1000 person-years for frequency at age 20–29 yr, 2.20 cases/1000 person-years for frequency at age 40–49 yr, and 3.89 cases/1000 person-years for frequency in the year before questionnaire distribution.
An initial report published in 2004 for this cohort found that more frequent ejaculation was related to a lower risk of total PCa, with the strongest associations for higher frequency in the year before questionnaire distribution [8x[8]Leitzmann, M.F., Platz, E.A., Stampfer, M.J., Willett, W.C., and Giovannucci, E. Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer. JAMA. ; 291: 1578–1586
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (78) | Google ScholarSee all References][8]. With an additional decade of follow-up, we demonstrate that ejaculation frequency at three different time points during adulthood is associated with statistically significant modest reductions in risk of total PCa. The association with frequency at age 20–29 yr became more pronounced with additional follow-up, while the associations with frequency at age 40–49 yr and in the year before the questionnaire remained statistically significant but were somewhat attenuated. Taken together with the fact that strong inverse associations remained after excluding men diagnosed in the first 4 yrs of follow-up, the updated results are unlikely to be strongly influenced by the effects of undiagnosed disease on ejaculation frequency.
Importantly, our findings were robust to adjustment for time-varying factors such as BMI, physical activity, and diet that differed with ejaculation frequency and that have also been associated with PCa and its progression [5x[5]Wilson, K.M., Giovannucci, E.L., and Mucci, L.A. Lifestyle and dietary factors in the prevention of lethal prostate cancer. Asian J Androl. ; 14: 365–374
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (61) | Google ScholarSee all References][5], as well as other factors associated with PCa risk in this cohort. Because men in the higher ejaculation frequency categories had some exposure patterns that might put them at higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to other causes—higher BMI, greater alcohol consumption, and more frequent history of smoking and sexually transmitted infections—we were concerned that the reduction in PCa risk we observed in this group might be attributable to premature death from other causes among men who may have had undiagnosed PCa. Thus, a strength of our study is the consideration of a model for semi-competing risks. From this model, the increase in risk of death by age 80 yrs among men with the lowest ejaculation frequency is 3.8%, while the reduction in PCa risk is 2.2%. By comparison, men reporting ≥13 EPM have an increase of only 1.8% in the risk of dying from other causes by age 80 yrs, while their decrease in PCa risk is 3.8%. Thus, in both cases the reduction in PCa risk may be partly explained by premature death due to other causes, but the reduction among men reporting high ejaculation frequency seemingly cannot be explained by this effect alone.
Several important limitations of our study should be noted. Ascertainment of the exposure relied on reporting of sexual activity in the past. This may introduce measurement error, particularly in the reporting of frequency at age 20–29 yr. However, the use of an anonymized questionnaire may have resulted in more accurate reporting of sexual behaviors than a one-on-one interview [17x[17]Fenton, K.A., Johnson, A.M., McManus, S., and Erens, B. Measuring sexual behaviour: methodological challenges in survey research. Sex Transm Infect. ; 77: 84–92
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (307) | Google ScholarSee all References][17]. Previous studies suggest that the validity of data on sensitive information is further improved by: (1) an understanding among participants that their data will be kept confidential, most likely true in this large ongoing cohort in which men had already responded to at least one and potentially two previous questionnaires; and (2) the avoidance of implying a “normal” response category [18x[18]Tourangeau, R. and Yan, T. Sensitive questions in surveys. Psychol Bull. ; 133: 859–883
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (945) | Google ScholarSee all References][18]. Most importantly, however, the data were collected prospectively, preventing differential misclassification (ie, recall bias). Thus, our results can be considered conservative estimates of the true association.
While the utilization of a large prospective study has numerous advantages, the clinical information available for men at the time of their PCa diagnosis is more limited than in clinical settings. Thus, we are not able to distinguish very low-risk disease from low-risk disease in subgroup analyses. The abundance of data on potential confounders is an advantage of working within the well-annotated HPFS cohort, but we still cannot rule out residual confounding by other lifestyle factors. Furthermore, our cohort consisted primarily of Caucasian men and the frequency of ejaculation may vary across populations. However, the results may still be generalizable to other men, as we would not expect a true biological association between ejaculation frequency and PCa to differ by race or ethnicity.

Previous studies are primarily retrospective case-control studies, raising concerns about recall bias, especially given that erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and decreased libido are common consequences of both PCa and its treatment [31x[31]Saitz, T.R., Serefoglu, E.C., Trost, L.W., Thomas, R., and Hellstrom, W.J.

Support Care Cancer. ; 18: 715–722
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (20) | Google ScholarSee all References]. Moreover, few previous studies have considered ejaculation frequency per se, with most utilizing proxies of sexual activity, such as age at first marriage, marital status, number of sexual partners, and number of children. Few previous studies have examined associations according to tumor grade or stage despite their particular importance for PCa; spurious associations with more favorable disease may result from confounding by early detection. We do, in fact, find that the inverse association with overall PCa is driven by low-risk disease, which could indicate that more sexually active men might undergo less screening and follow-up testing. This alternative explanation for our findings is especially plausible given the potential resulting side effects of PCa and its treatment on sexual function. However, PSA screening history and biopsy utilization after elevated PSA were quite similar across the ejaculation frequency categories. Moreover, the results were consistent even when we restricted the analysis to a screened cohort and PSA history was taken into account. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out residual confounding by screening or post-screening biopsy behaviors.
Our results identified suggestive but not statistically significant associations between higher ejaculation frequency in the year before the questionnaire and both advanced and lethal PCa. However, the findings appear to be driven by men diagnosed in the period immediately following the questionnaire. The attenuated association in sensitivity analyses excluding men diagnosed in the first 4 yrs of follow-up, together with the fact that these suggestive positive associations were only found for ejaculation frequency in the year before the questionnaire distribution and not at younger ages, is consistent with men with undiagnosed aggressive PCa experiencing symptoms that promoted more frequent ejaculation. While we are not aware of any literature supporting ejaculation for relief of PCa symptoms, it nonetheless seems unlikely that these suggestive associations with advanced and lethal disease reflect causality.
In addition to the prostate stagnation hypothesis [7x[7]Isaacs, J.T. Prostatic structure and function in relation to the etiology of prostatic cancer. Prostate. ; 4: 351–366
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (55) | Google ScholarSee all References][7], a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain an inverse association between ejaculation frequency and PCa. More frequent ejaculation may influence the function of peripheral-zone epithelial cells, hindering the metabolic switch from citrate secretion to citrate oxidation known to occur early in prostate tumorigenesis [33x[33]Costello, L.C. and Franklin, R.B. The clinical relevance of the metabolism of prostate cancer; zinc and tumor suppression: connecting the dots. Mol Cancer. ; 5: 17
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (214) | Google ScholarSee all References][33]. Alternatively, more frequent ejaculation may reduce the development of prostatic intraluminal crystalloids, which have been associated with higher risk of PCa [34x[34]Svatek, R.S., Karam, J.A., Rogers, T.E., Shulman, M.J., Margulis, V., and Benaim, E.A. Intraluminal crystalloids are highly associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma on concurrent biopsy specimens. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. ; 10: 279–282

Abstract | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (28) | Google ScholarSee all References]. Higher ejaculatory frequency may be linked to lowering of psychological tension and central sympathetic nervous system suppression, which could dampen the stimulation of prostate epithelial cell division [36x[36]Newman, H.F., Reiss, H., and Northup, J.D. Physical basis of emission, ejaculation, and orgasm in the male. Urology. ; 19: 341–350

The powerful Palestinian Islamist group Hamas is calling for a fresh uprising against Israel after US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Trump reversed decades of US policy to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.
In a speech in Gaza, leader Ismail Haniyeh said "We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy."
"We have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalem and threatens Palestine," they continued.
A "day of rage"
Haniyeh, who was elected the group's overall leader in May, urged Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs to hold rallies against the US decision on Friday, calling it a "day of rage".
"Let December 8 be the first day of the intifada against the occupier."
"United Jerusalem is Arab and Muslim and it is the capital of the state of Palestine, all of Palestine," they said, referring to territory including Israel as well as the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
A withdrawal and a boycott
Haniyeh also called on Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to withdraw from peacemaking with Israel and on Arabs to boycott the Trump administration.
"It should be announced that the so-called peace agreement was buried, once and for all, and that there is nothing called a partner for the Palestinians in peace."
How is Hamas viewed internationally?
The group, which has fought three conflicts with Israel since 2007, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US and Israel.
It does not recognise Israel's right to exist and its suicide bombings helped spearhead the last intifada, from 2000 to 2005.

Richard Ashcroft, the lead singer of tumultuous '90s rock savants, The Verve, recently released their new solo album These People. It's their first effort since 2010's United Nations Of Sound and their fifth solo album overall.
Many may not be familiar with Ashcroft's solo work and consider The Verve to be a one hit wonder citing the ubiquitous “Bitter Sweet Symphony” from 1997. They might be surprised to learn that Urban Hymns, the album from which “Bitter Sweet Symphony” was taken, sold over 10 million records worldwide. It also spawned two other U.K. top 10 singles, “The Drugs Don't Work” and “Lucky Man” although neither cracked the U.S. Billboard Top 100.
In addition to Urban Hymns, The Verve have three studio albums. A Storm in Heaven (1993), A Northern Soul (1995) and Forth which was released in 2008 after the band took a nine year hiatus. Unfortunately, and despite the superlatives that fans and critics throw around about each, these albums and the tracks contained therein don't get enough credit because they lack a song like “Bitter Sweet Symphony” to get people's attention, though. And that's a wrong we'd like to help right by offering our take on the 10 best tracks from The Verve (off their four studio albums) that you probably didn't hear on the radio. Songs that may make you a convert.
KINSHASA (Reuters) - United Nations peacekeepers killed seven rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday as part of operations to tamp down rising inter-ethnic tensions in the area, the U.N. mission said on Friday.
South African troops from the U.N. Force Intervention Brigade fired on members of a primary Kobo and Nande militia after they tried to prevent aid workers giving out food to Hutu civilians in a displacement camp in the town of Buleusa in North Kivu province, mission spokesperson Charles Bambara said.
Eleven other militiamen were wounded while the rest fled, Bambara added. The U.N. troops suffered no casualties.
The U.N. intervention in Buleusa follows a week of surging tensions between Hutus and the Kobo and Nande communities after rumors spread that members of the FDLR, a Hutu militia with officers implicated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, had infiltrated displaced persons camps.
Nande and Kobo militiamen killed at least four Hutus and burned hundreds of their huts in Buleusa on Monday, according to Samuel Ntaota, a spokesperson for the local Hutu community.
Ethnic rivalries, foreign invasions and competition for mineral-rich land have stoked persistent conflict among eastern Congo's dozens of rebel groups over the last two decades, costing millions of lives.

Police have arrested one person in West Bengal for posting "defamatory" remarks about a Trinamool Congress councillor on Facebook. Rohit Passi, a small time contractor in Jalpaiguri's Malbazar town was arrested on Friday night after a complaint by local Trinamool councillor Pulin Golder.
Golder, a Trinamool councillor from ward no.12 of Malbazar municipality had filed a police complaint on Friday stating that Passi's Facebook post was intended to defame them and their party in the area.
"The post said that I was a blot on the face of our area. This was an insult for me and my party. I decided to file the police complaint as it was aimed to tarnish my image," said Golder.
It all began with Rohit posting a comment on Facebook about the death of their friend Gurdeep Singh. Singh had died in December last year following a brawl with some locals after a bike accident. Gurdeep's family allege that they died of brain haemorrhage after being hit on the head with a helmet. The main accused, a local Trinamool worker was arrested in the case, while two others are absconding.
On Friday, Rohit was accompanying their friend's family for the hearing at Jalpaiguri district court. At the court, Rohit claims they saw Trinamool councillor Pulin Golder escorting the parents of the accused in their own car. Demoralised with the incident, they went home and shared their disappointment on social media.
Rohit wrote on Facebook, "Today I saw a local Malbazar leader at the court. Not sure, if we can call them a leader or an actor. One who is such an expert in switching political loyalties. They were escorting the accused's parents in their own car. Such people call themselves leaders. They never felt the urge to stand beside the victim's family but are keen to stand by the accused in court. This is such a shame for our society. We won't tolerate any politics over death."
Acting swiftly on the Trinamool councillor's complaint, Rohit was picked up from their residence and arrested within two hours of their comment on social media. Interestingly, they had not named any leader or political party in their post.
"Suddenly police officers came to my house and forcefully picked me up. They didn't even give a chance to speak," says Rohit adding that the Trinamool councillor was themselves present at police station with their men and openly threatened them infront of the police.
"I was taken to the OC's room where Malbazar SDPO was themselves present. They refused to listen to me and I was put in the lock up," they add.
The district police has however refuted Rohit's claim. Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Akash Magharia said, "This is not connected to the Facebook post. They were arrested under CrPC Section 107 to maintain peace and tranquillity in the area."
Echoing the police, Trinamool spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien said, "Some local channels distorting news without checking facts. Deliberate distortion? No one in Malbazaar has been arrested for a Facebook post."
Though out on bail, Rohit says they are scared after such open intimidation and threat by the ruling party councillor. "I'm scared and I hope the police provides me protection. This is an open attack on my freedom of expression," says Passi adding that they will consider moving an appeal before the Human Rights Commission.
Remember, a professor from Kolkata's prestigious Jadavpur University Ambikesh Mahapatra was also arrested in 2012 for circulating a photo spoof on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Frank E. Corrente, a former city employee convicted in the “Operation Plunder Dome” case, is entitled to pension benefits from their first time working in City Hall, the state's Supreme Court found.
In a ruling issued Friday afternoon Chief Justice Paul Suttell affirming three Corrente-related decisions from the state's Superior Court.
Corrente will now be able to collect their monthly pension of $1,852.61 based on their first City Hall salary.
The decision closes the book on more than 20 years of pricey court battles. Since the city became involved in the case in 2008 it spent $233,610 in legal fees, according to a summary of costs obtained by The Providence Journal through Access to Public Records Act request.
Corrente, 88, worked as Mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr.'s director of administration in the 1990s. They stayed in that job for almost 10 years and when they retired in 1999, they received a monthly pension benefit of $5,881.30 based on a gross salary of $91,656.58, according to court documents.
In 2002, they were convicted on racketeering and corruption charges that muddled their right to that money. A jury found that Corrente, recently featured in the hit podcast “Crimetown,” took payoffs while working for Cianci from a businessman working undercover for the FBI.
But before joining Cianci's City Hall team, Corrente worked as a financial specialist in the controller's office starting in June 1967. They were promoted to the city controller position in 1981, and retired in April 1987. At that time they were awarded a monthly pension of $1,852.61 based on a gross salary of $42,098.45.
Justices ruled on three issues Friday:
— They denied an appeal from Corrente who wanted, at minimum, a tax credit for the money they already paid to the government for the pension that was revoked. Corrente is being represented by John B. Harwood, former speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives.
— In the same vein, justices upheld a decision by the Retirement Board, represented by Raymond A. Marcaccio, who argued that Corrente should not receive the credit because there is no evidence that any taxes were taken from their pension payments from 1999 to 2002.
— The justices denied a cross appeal from Mayor Jorge Elorza and the city, represented by John D. Plummer. Plummer argued Corrente was not entitled to either pension and had requested a new Superior Court trial.

Puerto Ricans are migrants not immigrants, Spanish and English, domestic yet foreign — as we like to say on Code Switch, it's complicated. A hundred years ago this week, Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens by law with the passing of the Jones Act. Since then, they've had a complicated and fraught relationship with what it means to be American. Shereen traveled to Holyoke, Massachusetts to explore what the Jones Act has meant to Puerto Rican identity on stateside in the last century. Holyoke has the highest ration of Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. - nearly 50% of residents there have Puerto Rican heritage. An earlier version of this podcast stated that Myriam Quiñonez has three children. They have two.
Auto giant Ford is planning a new assembly plant south of the U.S. border, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, and will sharply increase factory output from Mexico just months after signing a labor deal.
Citing people familiar with the matter, The Journal reported that Ford will add half a million units of annual capacity from Mexico starting in 2018, which is double the amount it built in 2015. The new assembly complex will be based in San Luis Potosi, and Ford will expand an existing facility near Mexico City, the publication added.

The move may heighten the debate over cheaper foreign labor. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Manufacturing labor costs in Mexico are approximately 1/5 of those in the United States. In November, Ford signed a new labor contract that gave factory workers higher wages. A Ford spokesperson did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment.

Fifty-nine-year-old marathon swimmer Marilyn Korzekwa still has what it takes to break records.
The Hamilton psychiatrist recently became the first Canadian to swim the 32 kilometres across Cape Cod Bay, from Plymouth to Provincetown, Mass. The swim retraces the voyage of the Mayflower pilgrims in reverse.
Korzekwa is the oldest woman and the ninth person — preceded by eight Americans — to accomplish the crossing. They completed the journey on Aug. 11 in 13 hours and six minutes.
“Although the biggest challenge was expected to be the tidal current, which circulates in a counter-clockwise direction around the relatively shallow bay, it turned out that the high waves in the last 10 kilometres were a bigger challenge,” said Korzekwa.
“Although the biggest challenge was expected to be the tidal curren...it turned out that the high waves in the last 10 kilometres were a bigger challenge.”
Also of concern, they said, was a great white shark, which was spotted a few weeks before the swim and resulted in the closure of several beaches.
Korzekwa said they greased their arms and legs in black-and-white stripes of zinc oxide to resemble a snake, which sharks avoid. They also had the Shark Shield electrode dangling from the accompanying kayak.
For Korzekwa, the highlight of the Cape Cod Bay swim was being wished, “Godspeed” by their namesake, the legendary Marilyn Bell DiLascio at the start of the marathon. DiLascio was the first person to swim across Lake Ontario in September 1954.
“She drove from New York to be present on White Horse Beach at 4:54 a.m. — five hours — to see me off,” said Korzekwa. “I was thrilled.”
Through the Cape Cod Bay swim, Korzekwa hopes to raise $10,000 for Sashbear, a registered charitable organization the funds borderline personality disorder education programs.
Korzekwa adds the Cape Cod Bay crossing to a string of marathon swimming accomplishments, including swimming Lake Ontario in both directions, being the oldest woman to complete the 20-kilometre swim around Key West, Fla., swimming the big four Muskoka lakes, being the oldest Canadian to swim the San Pedro Strait from Catalina Island to the mainland of California, completing the Triple Crown of marathon swimming — the English Channel, Catalina and Manhattan, being the first person to swim between three provinces and being the first Canadian and oldest woman to swim Cook Strait in New Zealand.

No, shut up. Most of the world doesn't sit in front of their browser all day. If they do, it is IE 6 at work that they are not allowed to upgrade. Browsers suck for these kinds of things. Their stuff is already in folders. They just want a folder. That syncs.
"But," you may say, "folders are so 1995. why not leverage the full power of the web? With HTML 5 you can drag and drop files, you can build intergalactic dashboards of stats showing how much storage you are using, you can publish your files as RSS feeds and tweets, and you can add your company logo!"
No, shut up. Not a single person on Earth wakes up in the morning worried about deriving more value from their Windows Live login. People already trust folders. And Dropbox looks just like a folder. One that syncs.
"But," you may say, "this is valuable data...certainly users will feel more comfortable tying their data to Windows Live, Apple Mobile Me, or a name they already know."
"But," you may ask, "so much more you could do! What about task management, calendaring, customized dashboards, virtual white boarding. More than just folders and files!"
Isaac Hall:
As a co-founder of Syncplicity, a service that competes with Dropbox, this question has been on my mind for years. We launched within a few weeks of Dropbox, we had multi-folder synchronization & read-only sync, and we were a few years older than the Dropbox kids. I'm very proud of the service we put together and am happy to see the service shift towards businesses, yet Dropbox kicked butt. Here's why:
Before launching their service, Dropbox created a video that had tons of geeky references. It showed off a product that wasn't finished and had a few flaws. It showed a binary diff sync of an image... binary diff is great, but it only works if the file isn't compressed. So, it only works on bitmaps and who the heck is sync'ing bitmaps? The video spread quickly and got their name out before anyone heard of our company. Instead of making our own video, we were upset that binary diff wouldn't do anything for JPEGs or other compressed formats that consumers tended to use. Who the heck is sync'ing images saved from Microsoft Paint?
Next, we had issues getting the press excited at launch. We built a fantastic Windows client. 3 years ago, everyone was running Windows. (Actually, I had a Mac and wrote all my code in a Parallels VM on my Mac. It always made me a little sad that we didn't have a native Mac client for a long time. Thankfully, the company has a Mac client today.) We were so excited to show the press, yet they all had Macs. Walt Mossberg wouldn't write about our product because it was PC only. Months after we hired our PR agency, we found out that they had never even used our product... because they too only had Macs. It's pretty hard to pitch a service when you haven't used it.
For a while, we couldn't believe Dropbox was so viral while we weren't. We opened our beta so anyone could sign up while people had to beg for a Dropbox invite. The closed beta worked incredibly well for Dropbox. We opened up our beta at the insistence of our PR agency -- "No way the New York Times will write about you if you have a closed beta". (It turned out that the NYT also doesn't write about you if you're PC only.) If your service is really popular, having a closed beta helps you create pent up demand and control the number of users joining on a regular basis so you can scale the backend appropriately.
In the end, it really came down to one incredibly genius idea: Dropbox limited its feature set on purpose. It had one folder and that folder always synced without any issues -- it was magic. Syncplicity could sync every folder on your computer until you hit our quota. (Unfortunately, that feature was used to synchronize C:\Windows\ for dozens of users -- doh!) Our company had too many features and this created confusion amongst our customer base. This in turn led to enough customer support issues that we couldn't innovate on the product, we were too busy fixing things.
After I left Syncplicity, I ran into the CEO of Dropbox and asked them my burning question: "Why don't you support multi-folder synchronization?" Their answer was classic Dropbox. They built multi-folder support early on and did limit beta testing with it, but they couldn't get the UI right. It confused people and created too many questions. It was too hard for the average consumer to setup. So it got shelved.
If you're starting a new company, the best thing you can do is keep your feature set small and focused. Do one thing as best as you possibly can. Your users will beg and beg for more functionality. They will tell you their problems and ask you to fix it. My philosophy is that they're right if their feature request is right only if it works for 80% of your customers. Until you have a lot of resources, stay focused on your core competency.
The best part about having a simple product is that it's easy to sell & easy to support. If your product is too complicated, you'll spend all day on customer support & bug fixing. I've been there -- it's no fun.
In closing, I want to give props to my previous Syncplicity co-workers. They worked their butts off competing against Dropbox. They're crazy smart and we built a great service together. They're still working on it and they've got a great business solution. As for Dropbox... Drew, Arash and the rest of the team are absolutely brilliant. Their success is no accident. File synchronization is incredibly difficult. Building a product that millions of consumers can easily understand without RTFM is even more challenging. They're my inspiration for my current company.
If you want to understand more, read everything you can about the lean startup movement. And have at least one seriously amazing product person on your staff if that's not you.
Another election day in the US is rapidly approaching (Tuesday, Nov. 8—mark your calendars!). Millions of Americans will take to the postal system or head out to local polling places in order to file physical ballots, but why is that custom still in place despite our increasingly connected and mobile society? To that end, we're resurfacing our close examination of e-voting around the world from the last election cycle (November 4, 2012).
I live in one of the most wired parts of the United States—the San Francisco Bay Area—but for the presidential election, I've already voted by mail. On a piece of paper. From the comfort of my living room. Between folks like me who vote by mail and everyone else who votes by marking paper in some way, we comprise about two-thirds of all American voters. Approximately 25 percent of all Americans, however, will use paperless and electronic voting machines to cast their ballots on November 6.
Around the world though, these percentages don't hold. An increasing number of countries are beginning to tackle e-voting with gusto. Estonia, Switzerland, Spain, Brazil, Australia, India, Canada, and a handful of other countries have all held elections through the use of electronic voting machines in recent years.
E-voting in the US While many developing countries are expanding the use of voting technology, many computer scientists, cryptographers, and public policy analysts worldwide are coming to the same conclusion already decided upon in the US: unverified e-voting devices are unreliable at best and dangerous at worst. Read more about the debate stateside in Timothy Lee's piece, " While many developing countries are expanding the use of voting technology, many computer scientists, cryptographers, and public policy analysts worldwide are coming to the same conclusion already decided upon in the US: unverified e-voting devices are unreliable at best and dangerous at worst. Read more about the debate stateside in Timothy Lee's piece, " Paper prophets: Why e-voting is on the decline in the United States ."
E-voting was supposed to solve many of the problems inherent in traditional paper voting: it's difficult for illiterate people to vote, it's difficult to get physical paper out to all corners of a country (voters abroad can submit their ballot much more easily), tabulating the results takes too much time, physical ballot stuffing or ballot swapping can occur with little or no verification. With an electronic ballot, it's also, of course, easier to tweak ballots in other languages or to make them available to blind or deaf voters. As recently as August 2012, advocates in Pakistan and the Philippines called for the expansion of e-voting in their respective countries.
Currently, there are four major types of e-voting around the world that are worth keeping an eye on: Brazil's homegrown direct recording electronic (DRE) setup, Australia's open-source software, Estonia's Internet voting, and a Spanish startup's efforts to expand what's been called "crypto-voting." Each of these approaches has its own unique set of problems, but the primary obstacles they present for many voting officials and computer scientists is their lack of ability to verify source code and expense.
From dictatorship to e-voting in just over a decade
Surprisingly, Brazil has one of the world's oldest electronic voting systems, dating way back to 1996. While Brazil certainly is a vibrant (and huge, at 195 million people) democracy, it's a rapidly developing country—you do know it's the B in BRIC, right? Brazil has gone through significant economic and political change in recent decades. It wasn't until 1985 that the country was rid of its military dictatorship, yet, just over a decade later, the country had implemented a locally designed and produced electronic voting system.
As recently as 1996, the country still had 15 percent of the country that could not read or write. That meant a significant portion (over 23 million Brazilians at the time) of the country were effectively disenfranchised from voting.
The DRE machine, known locally as an urna, is about the size of two or three stacked hardback books, and it has a small screen on one side with a keypad on the other side. The machine displays a list of candidates, along with their pictures and the numbers associated with them. Voters use the keypad to type in their preferred number—the device only allows one number to be pressed at a time.
Voters then receive a printed stub confirming that they or they voted. Each DRE device has two flash cards, which store a digital record of the vote count. The cards are removed at the end of the election and the vote totals are sent electronically to the Regional Electoral Office, where national vote counts are tallied within just several hours.
"Nowadays we have 450,000 digital ballot boxes in Brazil," Antonio Esio from the Regional Electoral Office in São Paulo, told the BBC in 2008. "We are making more each year because the number of voters is increasing around six percent every election."
Before the electronic system, voters were required to hand-write the complete names of the candidates and their parties—something many illiterate people were unable to do.
"By adopting it, you are enfranchising voters who might be disenfranchised by complicated ballots," Tiago Peixoto, a Brazilian researcher with the ICT4Gov program at the World Bank, told Ars.
However, by 2002, some critics in Brazil countered that by relying on an electronic device, there was little actual voter verification. To use industry parlance, there was no way to verify that the vote was cast as intended and counted as it was cast. So printers were added, which showed the vote on a piece of paper protected behind plastic. Two years later, Brazil eliminated the printers, as they were too costly. The printers were slated to be back (Google Translate) for the 2014 election, but they have since been suspended a second time.
By 2008, the entire software running on the DRE machines was rewritten by developers contracted by the Brazilian Superior Electoral Court. Six months prior to any election, people who have been accredited by the Court are allowed to come in-person, "in an environment controlled by the Superior Electoral Court," where experts can examine the source code, under a nondisclosure agreement.
Diego Aranha, a professor of computer science at the University of Brasilia, was one such expert. But, they said, they and their team were only given five hours in which to examine millions of lines of code—nowhere near adequate to perform a proper audit.
One major flaw they found was that the digital votes are randomly shuffled, as a way to provide extra security while in storage. However, the algorithm to provide that randomness is given a non-random seed: the timestamp.
"I made this assumption because I know how many times people have got this wrong," they told Ars. "They used a really, really bad pseudo-random number generator available: the seed was a timestamp in seconds. This is mission-critical software! This is our software for our democracy."
Despite these problems, so far, Brazil has used its DRE system in its various iterations for nearly two decades without any major political dispute over their use.
In an academic paper published in a forthcoming book, Aranha concluded: "The necessity of installing a scientifically sound and continuous evaluation of the system, performed by independent specialists from industry or academia becomes evident and should contribute to the improvement of the security measures adopted by the voting equipment."
Looking inside the black box Down Under
"It's a black box." So goes the common refrain from computer scientists and cryptographers who work on electronic voting. In other words, no one can be completely certain the computer code running on a given device does exactly what it's said to. Worse still, no one can ever know the software running on the voter's computer is precisely the same version of the software that was initially certified.
But for over a decade, the Australian Capital Territory has figured out a way to solve this problem (in use across a handful of voting locations): just make the software open source. The software runs on older PCs running Linux and offers ballots in 12 languages. There are also ballots available for illiterate, blind, or deaf voters.
Each voter receives a barcode that is read by a scanner attached to the computer. Once the code is scanned, it resets the software to be ready to receive a vote. Once the ballot is complete, the card is swiped a second time to cast that ballot. The barcodes are not connected to an individual voter, but the software is designed to only allow one vote per voter. The votes are counted electronically, digitally signed, and sent to a server on a local network.
"We wanted to make it something that people would find trustworthy," said Phillip Green, the electoral commissioner for the territory, in a recent interview with Ars.
"We've likened it to a normal election process where if you're doing it by hand, everything is available to scrutiny," Green said. "We shouldn't have a black box, where you don't know what it does. Open source code was the way to solve the transparency issue. So we get the code audited by a professional company and they're looking for areas in the code that what comes in doesn't come out and that there's nothing in there that would allow someone to maliciously change votes."
In addition, there's a software keylogger making sure what's typed in actually matches the votes that were recorded, as a way to prevent fraud. Green added the IT faculty at the Australian National University in Canberra use the source code frequently as a security auditing exercise for its students. This system has run more or less without any problems since 2001.
But if it's so great, why don't other states and territories Down Under use it? There's no real reason, but like in the United States, state and territory voting laws and regulations are set at the state level. The ACT has chosen to go open-source, and there's nothing stopping the country's bigger states, like Victoria or New South Wales, from doing the same.
The decision largely has to do with size and expense. The ACT, Australia's smallest territory by population, is home to about 365,000 people. (My home city of Oakland, California is bigger!) Only about two-thirds of the population are voters. Nationally, the country has around 15 million voters—so ACT voters represent less than three percent of all voters nationally.
"There's no practical reason why it couldn't work these, but it's a hardware [question]," Green added.
"We're getting out of our system cheaply by borrowing hardware. We're part of [the] ACT government computer system and we get monitors that are coming off refresh cycles. We either get the new ones before they get them or the old ones coming off; we're borrowing monitors. We get out of it pretty cheaply by trying to find cheap and innovative ways, and because we've only got five voting locations, we can get away with that. [Other states] might want 50 to 60 sites, and would have difficulty borrowing equipment. It's several thousand dollars per machine by the time you get the hardware together."
Still, despite the success of the open-source e-voting setup, Green says its days may be numbered. Even though they have their doubts about the security and openness of Internet-based setups, they believe that it, not open-source e-voting, will "be the way of the future." After all, Internet-based systems can reduce the cost of hardware by allowing people to just use their own computers.
"We're looking at it for 2016," they said in a resigned tone.
The auto industry has been one of the few truly bright spots in the US economy since the financial crisis.
After a terrifying crater during the worst of the panic—albeit with a brief spike induced by the “cash-for-clunkers” program — car sales have crawled back to something like normal. And updates on auto sales from the big carmakers Oct. 2 showed Ford Motor and Chrysler Group expect to sell cars at the fastest pace since the financial crisis struck. Good news, right?
FactSet Crawling back. Auto sales (blue) and monthly percentage change (yellow).
Besides the general fear induced by the crisis, which prompted many to hold off on purchases of cars, a big reason why car sales collapsed was because the pipeline of cash to would-be car buyers was completely broken. Important players in channeling the money US consumers needed to buy cars, like GMAC—which had its roots as the in-house credit arm of General Motors but later got into mortgage-making and other lending—were tottering. Eventually, the US government launched an unprecedented intervention in the market, propping up both Chrysler and General Motors as well as their financing arms to the tune of $81 billion.
We're in a much better position now. And thanks, in part, to the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep interest rates low, rates for new car loans from banks are down to record lows. More good news, right?
FactSet / Federal Reserve
And in an interesting development, cash is starting to flow from investors to car buyers with lower credit scores. More good news… right…?
If the idea of buyers with poor credit scores getting loans easily sounds familiar, that's because it is. Yes, we're talking about “subprime” again.
Global investors are desperate to find investments that pay them a decent rate of interest, or “yield.” Because subprime borrowers are riskier, the investments built around their loans do supply that higher yield. Increasingly, investors are liking the sound of that. And subprime auto bond deals have been picking up steam. Analysts at S&P think that some $15-17 billion could flow into new subprime auto bonds this year, up from $11.9 billion in 2011 and not too far off from the $15.3 billion seen in 2007, before the crisis struck.
Standard & Poor's Cash is flowing into fresh subprime auto bond deals.
Part of the reason that investors are willing to buy subprime auto bonds—effectively lending money to higher-risk borrowers—is because the risk doesn't seem too bad. The loss rate on these loans is down a lot from the pain investors felt back at the peak of the crisis.
Moody's Losses on subprime auto bonds don't look so bad, at least compared to the worst of 2008.
Still, historically the pattern is that complacency about losses and competition between lenders leads them to make loans at interest rates that are too low to borrowers that are too risky. We're already seeing the average credit scores and interest rates on subprime auto deals fall. And Barclays analysts have noticed that recently subprime auto loans have seen an uptick in loans going bad—although so far, at least, they don't think it's anything major to worry about.
Barclays Losses on subprime auto bonds ticked up in September.
Given that a significant chunk of the US car-buying public has credit scores that would put it in the subprime bucket — through mid-September it was 24.4% of used car sales and 11.5% of new vehicle sales went to subprime buyers—the fact that more and more cash is flowing through to those buyers is a good thing—at least for the short term.
But the auto industry is kind of like a microcosm of the US economy as a whole. Just getting the system moving again is the goal for now. But in the longer term the US has to do some real soul-searching about whether offering easy credit to riskier borrowers creates more problems than it is worth.

is one of the major Hindu festivals dedicated to god Shiva. Mahashivratri means the “big night of Shiva”, it is celebrated during Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi in the Hindu month of Phalgun or 13th or the 14th night of the new moon, corresponding to February-March in Gregorian calendar. The festival is celebrated on the night. Lord Brahma (Creator), Lord Vishnu (Preserver) and Lord Shiva (Destroyer) are the Hindu Trinity gods worshipped by Hindu people.. It is also believed that Lord Shiva performed the Tandava Nritya on this day. The great holy festival of MahaShivaratri holds special meaning for the Hindu ladies. It is believed that any lady who pray to Goddess Parvati also known as 'Gaura', the giver of 'suhag' for good husbands, marital bliss and a long, prosperous married life."Shankar", "Mahesh", "Neelakanth", "Bholenath", "Shambhu Kailasheshwar", "Umanath", "Nataraj", “trimbakeshwar” are a few of the many names of Shiva.In Mahabharata, Bhishma, while resting on the bed of arrows referred to the observance of Maha Shivaratri by King Chitrabhanu. The story is as follows There was a time when King Chitrabhanu of Ikshvaku dynasty, who ruled Jambudvipa observed fast with their wife, the day being the day of Maha Shivaratri. The sage Ashtavakra came to the king's court and asked the purpose of theirs observing the past. King Chitrabhanu explained that they got the gift of remembering the incidents of their previous life.The King said to the sage that they were a hunter in Varanasi known by the name of Suswara. They killed and sell birds and animals to earn their livelihood. One day when they were roaming through the forests in search of any animal, due to darkness of night, they were unable to return home, so they took shelter and climbed over a tree. It was a Bael tree. They shot a deer previously on that day and they bundled and tied it to a branch on the tree. They were kept awake throughout the whole night because of hunger and thirst. They were worried and shed profuse tears at the thought of their poor wife and children who were also starving and anxiously waiting for them to come. Just to pass away the time, they started engaging themselves in plucking the Bael leaves and dropping them onto the ground.He returned home the next day, sold the deer, bought some food for the whole family. As they were about to break their nightlong fast, a stranger came and begged for food. The hunter served the food first to the stranger and then they had their own.He saw two messengers of Lord Shiva at the time of their death. They came to conduct their soul to the abode of Lord Shiva. They learnt only then the great merit they had earned by the unconscious worship of Lord Shiva Shankar during that night of Maha Shivaratri . They came to know by the messengers that there was a Shiva Lingam at the bottom of the tree. The leaves they dropped fell on the Shiva Lingam and their tears fell onto the Lingam and washed it. Moreover, they had fasted all day and all night. Thus, the story's conclusion was they unconsciously worshiped the Lord, lived in the abode of the Lord Shiva and enjoyed divine blessings for long ages and now they have been reborn as Chitrabhanu.is a powerful healing mantra which benefits the reciter of all physical and mental ailments. This divine mantra gives peace to the heart, mind and body and acts as a nectar for the Soul. Sages had recited thisMantra since long.OM.

But critics warn that the changes could result in the tracking of children from poor and minority families into classes that are less likely to prepare them for four-year colleges, and, ultimately, higher-paying careers.
“What we all know is when you leave it up to kids and schools, the poor kids and kids of color will be disproportionately not in the curriculum that could make the most difference for them,” said Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group that advocates for racial minorities and low-income children.
Texas is currently an outlier in both the number of exit exams it requires students to pass and the number of courses its default high school curriculum prescribes.
Legislators raised the number of high school exit exams to 15 from 4 in 2007, a year after they passed a law to automatically enroll all high school students in a curriculum that mandates four years of English, science, social studies and math, including an advanced algebra class. (Students may enroll in a less rigorous course of study with the permission of their parents.)
Texas now requires more than double the number of end-of-course exams used in any of the eight states that currently mandate that students pass such exams, according to the Education Commission of the States. And only two other states and the District of Columbia set similar graduation requirements, according to Achieve, a nonprofit organization that works to upgrade graduation criteria.
O.J. Simpson will be turning 70 on Sunday, July 9, 2017. It could be their last birthday behind bars. The football legend, now most famous for once having been accused and later acquitted of killing two people, is spending their birthday at the Lovelock Correctional Center, about 90 miles east of Reno, Nevada, after having been sentenced to nine to 33 years for a string of felonies committed in Las Vegas in 2007. Simpson was admitted to the facility in December of 2008, and they are facing their first parole hearing later this month.
The idea of O.J. Simpson being released from prison is likely to shock many people who believe they are guilty of killing their ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and their male companion, Ron Goldman, in June of 1994. The events that ensued shortly after that date were the center of a media circus. After famously speeding down the highway to evade police in a white Bronco driven by their friend, Al Cowlings, the trial that ensued, dubbed at the time the “trial of the century,” resulted in Simpson being acquitted of the murders due largely to a botched investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and the expert defense of Simpson's legal team.
Many Americans were shocked and appalled at the verdict due to what many feel to be overwhelming evidence of their guilt. Regardless, Simpson remained a free man for over a decade after the trial, even further angering those who were certain of their guilt by authoring a book titled If I Did It in 2006, in which Simpson detailed what they called a “hypothetical confession” for the murders.
The anger that much felt for O.J. Simpson was rekindled in 2007 when news broke that Simpson was involved in a situation in the hotel room of a Las Vegas casino in which Simpson led a group of armed men on a mission to retrieve sports memorabilia from two men Simpson alleged stole the items from him. According to USA Today, the trial resulted in a conviction for Simpson on a string of felonies, including first-degree kidnapping, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit a violent crime. Simpson received a sentence of nine to 33 years and many celebrated what they saw as a criminal who once got away with a horrendous crime finally facing some justice.

Now, just a few short weeks before O.J. Simpson's parole hearing on July 20, 2017, at least one person with close knowledge of the case is saying that Simpson is likely to be paroled. According to Fox News, retired Clark County DA David Roger, who won the 2008 conviction against Simpson, believes that there's a good chance the parole board will set O.J. Simpson free.
“Assuming they didn't do anything bad on the inside, I think nine years is a pretty good stay for their charges,” Roger said. “Obviously he'd be on parole and would have to toe the line with parole officers. But I don't know if granting them parole would be out of line here.”
While O.J. Simpson does have some supporters, it's safe to say that their parole would cause quite a bit of outrage among the many people who feel they once got away with a pair of brutal murders. The American justice system, however, does not view a past acquittal as a valid reason to deny parole, and O.J. Simpson could be a free man before they see their next birthday.

Jeremy Corbyn and their team are said to be mobilising behind Rachel Holliday for the Copeland by-election
Tomorrow the deadline closes on nominations for Labour's candidate in the upcoming Copeland by-election in Cumbria. That's the by-election caused by sitting Labour MP Jamie Reed's pre-Christmas announcement that the atmosphere within their party had become so toxic they could no longer stand it, and was moving to a job at the nearby Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant instead.
As a result – and as I reported last week – Labour's warring tribes are drawing up their battle-lines.
Jeremy Corbyn and their team are mobilising behind their favoured candidate, Rachel Holliday, a local health campaigner.
Meanwhile, Labour moderates are putting their own efforts behind former Dunfermline MP Thomas Docherty, the man who memorably described Labour's Scottish 2010 election campaign as ‘self-immolation for dummies'.
So unwittingly – or given their well known antipathy towards their leader, entirely wittingly – Jamie Reed has triggered a nuclear chain reaction.
Their departure has opened up a contest in one of Labour's most marginal seats, (majority 2,564), at a time when Corbyn's personal approval ratings and Labour's national poll ratings are experiencing their own psephological China Syndrome.
With the Tories inserted by the bookies as favourites to claim the seat for the first time since 1931, defeat would throw Labour into fresh turmoil, and in turn pile even more pressure on to Corbyn's embattled leadership.
Normally, this would leave the party with only one viable option. Find out which candidate Corbyn wants to select, work out what campaign strategy they want to pursue, then do precisely the opposite.
But these are not normal times for the Labour Party, or for British politics in general. And the moment has come for desperate measures.
In Copeland, Labour needs to stand squarely behind Jeremy Corbyn. It needs to select their candidate. It needs to run a campaign based unashamedly on Corbyn's own principles. In short, it needs to let Corbyn be Corbyn. Or, as one Labour MP said to me: ‘We need to let Copeland be Corbynite.'
Since Corbyn's victory in the second of what are fast becoming Labour's annual leadership elections, Labour moderates have settled on a new strategy.
They have decided they will kill them with apathy. There will be no more co-ordinated agitation. There will be no more high-profile rebellions. There will not even be much public criticism.
Dan Hodges says In Copeland, Labour needs to stand squarely behind Jeremy Corbyn
‘You don't know what it's like,' one former Shadow Cabinet member told me just before Christmas, ‘every time I go on TV I have to make a conscious effort not to say anything bad about him. It's destroying me.'
Maybe. But it's also working. Deprived of a Blairite Fifth Column to mobilise against, Corbyn is operating in a political vacuum. Unable to turn on their enemies within, and incapable of landing any significant blows on their opponents without, they are slowly suffocating – with the result that it is now former loyalists such as Len McCluskey who are raising questions about their future.
So in Copeland Jeremy Corbyn should go for broke. And they should be allowed – indeed encouraged – to go for broke. Rachel Holliday appears to be a good, local choice – their inexplicable affection for Corbyn not withstanding – and was recently awarded the accolade Cumbrian Woman of the Year for their work with the homeless. They have earned the right to carry their hero's banner.
Then Corbyn should demonstrate the political courage and principle that their supporters consistently tell us are the mark of the man.
They should make a series of high-profile visits to the constituency – not the solitary trip currently scheduled. They should remind local people of their long-standing commitment to nuclear disarmament, and opposition to the modernisation of the Trident fleet.
Most importantly of all, they should proudly repeat the statement contained in their first leadership manifesto, in which they proclaimed: ‘New nuclear power will mean the continued production of dangerous nuclear waste and an increased risk from radioactive accident and nuclear proliferation.'
Admittedly, this would represent a high-risk strategy. And not all Labour MPs are willing to embrace it.
Seasoned by-election fixers Andrew Gwynne and John Ashworth have already been despatched to the seat to effectively act as human shields, insulating Labour's campaign from excessive contamination by their leader – a move that has not exactly endeared them to some of their colleagues.
‘Corbyn's team are using puddings like Gwynne and Ashworth to be the shop window in Copeland,' says one grizzled veteran of the 1980s struggle against Militant.
‘And then, of course, they will have co-ownership of the defeat.'
Maybe they will. Or perhaps Corbyn could upset the odds, and lead their party to a game-changing political triumph.
But either way, it would at least represent a defining moment.
And that's what Labour desperately needs. A moment of decision.
Up until now, the Corbynites and moderates have been engaged in a phoney war. Actually, a private war. MP v MP, activist v activist, member v member.
The voters – the people who in whose name this conflict is supposedly being waged – have been completely excluded from the debate. So in Copeland, Corbyn should have the courage to finally let them in.
It is a marginal seat, but still a Labour seat. Yes, Labour are doing badly in the polls, but incumbent governments rarely seize opposition seats mid-term.
If the Corbynites still have faith in their man – and if they still have faith in themselves – then here is the opportunity to put it to the test.
Corbyn should demonstrate the political courage and principle that their supporters consistently tell us are the mark of the man, says Dan Hodges
Can Corbynism at least hold the line? Is there any evidence, any at all, that its leader has any chance of pulling their party out of its death spiral?
I think the answer to that question is ‘no'.
I think if Labour run in Copeland on a Corbynite manifesto they will lose, and lose heavily.
Just as I think that if Labour runs on a Corbynite manifesto nationally they will lose, and lose heavily.
But this is Corbyn's chance to prove me wrong. To prove all their critics wrong.
So go for it, Jeremy. Go to Copeland, and go nuclear.
The admission by the Bank of England's chief economic forecaster Andrew Haldane that they and their colleagues experienced a ‘Michael Fish moment' over their gloomy Brexit forecasts has been met with an angry response from many Brexiteers.
But one senior Out campaigner will have viewed it with quiet satisfaction. Michael Gove was vilified for their contention ‘people have had enough of experts', but Haldane's comments have provided them with a degree of vindication that has not been overlooked in Westminster.
‘The more we get economists lining up to eat humble pie, the more I think perceptions about Michael might start to shift,' one Minister tells me. ‘And if that happens, I don't think a Cabinet return is totally out of the question.' Michael Gove and Boris Johnson together again around the Cabinet table? There might be a hurricane on the way.
People have been asking why Jeremy Corbyn has been maintaining a mysterious radio silence over the past few days. But I now have the answer.
He's been preparing for next week's high-profile relaunch as the Left's Donald Trump with a trip to Mexico. Apparently Labour's leader spent the New Year with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, fiery Left-wing candidate for the Mexican presidency in 2018.
According to Obrador: ‘We talked extensively about the beautiful dream of realising a world government based on justice and fraternity.'
Corbyn's relaunch is in Essex. They should try that line down there.
Jeremy Corbyn's revolving-door policy towards their front bench appointments has caused consternation among Labour MPs. But I understand this concern has now spread to the opposite side of the House. At a recent meeting of the Home Affairs team, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill vented their frustration to Home Secretary Amber Rudd.
Whether one likes it or not, US President Donald Trump almost always ends up being in the news, and not always for the right reasons. And things are clearly no different this time. On December 1, Michael Flynn, former US national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia. They also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and help them delve deeper into the actions of Trump's inner circle before they took office in January.

In response to this, White House lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement, where they tried to distance Trump from the entire controversy. However, even though no account was wrongly tagged this time, the lawyer's statement is generating a lot of laughter on social media. And the reason was the choice of font: Comic Sans.
Yes, you read that right! A screenshot of the statement was shared by Sahil Kapur, a reporter at Bloomberg, with the caption, “Trump's lawyer Ty Cobb: ‘Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.'” But it was the font of the statement that attracted the attention of the people on social media. It bewildered everyone so much that people had to confirm this wasn't a joke. One asked Kapur, “Did they really do this in comic sans”, and when the reporter confirmed, there was no end to the jokes.

While someone wrote, “When you want to channel the President's mind, Comic Sans! I would've personally used Dingbats,” another, imagining how things might have unfolded, wrote, “The president's attorney opened Word, went to the font tab, scrolled past ARIAL and CALIBRI, and said ‘This is the font I want.

An undated photo of Armando Garcia, 17, who was fatally struck by a ricocheting bullet as deputies shot and killed a dog that had attacked a deputy in Palmdale.
A 17-year-old boy was fatally struck by a ricocheting bullet as deputies shot and killed a dog that had attacked one of the deputies Thursday morning in Palmdale, according to authorities.The incident occurred about 3:47 a.m. near an apartment complex in the 38500 block of 10th Street East, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.Deputies at the scene said they initially responded to a report of loud music at a party. As they were conducting an investigation, a 60 to 65 pound pit bull "aggressively charged" at deputies and a bit one of them on their left knee. The deputy was not seriously injured.The dog was restrained by a person at the scene, but as deputies awaited paramedics, the animal got loose again and charged at the deputies, authorities said. At that point, two deputies shot at the pit bull from a 5- to 7-foot distance, and the dog went back to the rear of the apartment complex and into the carport area.Deputies followed the dog in an attempt to corral the animal and prevent any other attacks. When they got to the carport area, deputies found the teen on the ground suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest.Deputies rendered aid until the boy was transported to a local hospital, where they died, sheriff's officials said.The 17-year-old was identified by their aunt as Armando Garcia."He was trying to stop the dog from attacking the cops, and they shot both of them, I guess," said Nick Perez, a friend of Garcia.Sheriff's officials gave additional details about the incident at a news conference."We believe that when the individual came out from behind the building, which was approximately 40 feet away from where the shooting occurred, they may have been struck by one of the skip rounds," sheriff's Capt. Christopher Bergner said. "It is what we're calling an extremely, extremely unfortunate incident at this time."The same deputy who was bitten was also struck by a "skip" round, sheriff's officials said. They were treated at a medical center and released.Homicide Bureau detectives responded to the scene, where a section of 10th Street was closed.Local residents said pit bulls are often seen running loose in the neighborhood."Every house on this left-hand side has pit bulls," neighbor Michelle Robinson said as they pointed toward some nearby homes. "Sometimes I'll stop and wait until the owner comes and gets it away from me."Garcia's mother, Roberta Alcantar, said their son wanted to change their lives around."He wanted to change their little brother's life around. They wanted to go to school, college and better himself. They said they were done with their past life," they said.Aunt Amber Alcantar said their nephew died trying to save a dog that wasn't even his.The pit bull's owner said their dog was just excited and did not mean any harm. They said their pet was "a big dog with a baby's mind."LASD officials said deputies had responded to the area at least four times for loud music and gang activity in the past two months.Sheriff's officials said based on the pit bull's condition, it will be euthanized.Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the sheriff's department at (323) 890-5500.
The DDoS attacks, which overwhelmed servers and thereby denied Internet access to legitimate users, collectively required tens of millions of dollars to mitigate. The attacks began in December 2011, and by September 2012 were occurring on nearly a weekly basis. On certain days, hundreds of thousands of customers were cut off from online access to their bank accounts.
According to court documents, one of the hackers who helped build the botnet used in some of the attacks received credit for their computer intrusion work from the Iranian government toward completion of their mandatory military service requirement. Other defendants have claimed responsibility for hacking servers belonging to NASA and for intrusions into thousands of other servers in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Israel.
Since the attacks, the FBI and the Department of Justice have worked with the private sector to neutralize and remediate the botnets. The Bureau also conducted extensive outreach to Internet service providers to assist in removing the malware from affected servers. Through these efforts, more than 90 percent of the threat has been successfully eliminated.
“By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyberattacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior,” Comey said. Referring to the fact that the defendants are currently out of U.S. reach, they added, “The world is small, and our memories are long. No matter where hackers are in the world and no matter how hard they try to conceal their identities, we will find ways to pierce that shield and identify them. That is the message of this case.”
In addition to targeting the U.S. financial sector, one of the defendants repeatedly gained access to computer systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York in 2013. Although the defendant never gained control of the dam, their access allowed them to learn critical information about the dam's operation, including details about gates that control water levels and flow rates. The breach underscored the potential vulnerabilities of the nation's critical infrastructure to foreign hackers and could have posed “a clear and present danger to the public health and safety of Americans,” said Attorney General Lynch.

Binary diff/patch utility
These programs were originally named bdiff and bpatch, but the large number of other programs using those names lead to confusion; I'm not sure if the "bs" in refers to "binary software" (because bsdiff produces exceptionally small patches for executable files) or "bytewise subtraction" (which is the key to how well it performs). Feel free to offer other suggestions.
bsdiff and bspatch use bzip2; by default they assume it is in /usr/bin.
bsdiff is quite memory-hungry. It requires max(17*n,9*n+m)+O(1) bytes of memory, where n is the size of the old file and m is the size of the new file. bspatch requires n+m+O(1) bytes.
bsdiff runs in O((n+m) log n) time; on a 200MHz Pentium Pro, building a binary patch for a 4MB file takes about 90 seconds. bspatch runs in O(n+m) time; on the same machine, applying that patch takes about two seconds.
Providing that off_t is defined properly, bsdiff and bspatch support files of up to 2^61-1 = 2Ei-1 bytes.
Version 4.3 is available here with MD5 hash e6d812394f0e0ecc8d5df255aa1db22a. Version 4.2 is available in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD ports trees as misc/bsdiff, in Darwinports as devel/bsdiff, and in gentoo as dev-util/bsdiff. It has also been made into a Python extension module, and there is a Windows port available.
The algorithm used by BSDiff 4 is described in my (unpublished) paper Naive differences of executable code; please cite this in papers as

A far more sophisticated algorithm, which typically provides roughly 20% smaller patches, is described in my doctoral thesis.

They were found guilty of collaborating with the now banned Muslim Brotherhood group and producing false news that damaged Egypt's reputation and sentenced to between seven and 10 years in prison. From left, jailed journalists Baher Mohamed, Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste in a Cairo court in March 2014. Credit:AP Mr Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed have continued to deny the charges, saying instead they were simply reporting the news during a tense time in which Egypt was undertaking a massive security crackdown on any form of protest or dissent. In chaotic scenes outside the court, the journalists' families faced the agonising prospect that their loved ones would spend yet more time in prison fighting for justice. Mr Greste's parents, Juris and Lois, said they had mixed emotions about the news of a retrial.
"We truly cannot believe that … Egypt wants to put themselves through this again. "This was always on the cards," Juris said, "but even though we have learnt not to expect anything, or expect the unexpected, we did expect a little bit better than this." While it is positive that the court found problems with the original case, Lois said "we don't have any details ... I am disappointed, I would have hoped for something a bit more than this". The ongoing thawing of relations between Egypt and Qatar, the tiny oil-rich nation that owns Al Jazeera and has been openly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood – a group now listed as a terrorist organisation in Egypt – is seen as a positive sign for the Al Jazeera journalists. "I hope the reconciliation efforts between Qatar and Egypt continue because the fate of my brother and their two colleagues rests on this," Adel Fahmy, Mohamed's brother, said.
"They are all professional, award-winning journalists who have nothing to do with any outlawed group … they should not be caught in the middle of this conflict between these two nations." And while the families were disappointed the court was unable to grant the journalists bail, their lawyers were more positive about the outcome. Mohamed Wahby, lawyer for Greste and Baher Mohamed, told Fairfax Media they expect the new trial will begin within a month and that it will be a speedy process. "This decision means that the first court was wrong, this court corrected their mistake," they said. "This is the best outcome we could have hoped for because if this decision wasn't made, then the original decision would have been absolute."
A spokesperson for Al Jazeera English said "Baher, Peter and Mohamed have been unjustly in jail for over a year now." "The Egyptian authorities have a simple choice – free these men quickly, or continue to string this out, all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world. They should choose the former." The international campaign calling for the release of the journalists has continued to grow, with support coming from the White House, the Australian, UK, Latvian and Canadian Governments and more than 150 rights groups including Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect Journalists. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Fairfax Media: "We are currently working through the implications and options with our diplomatic representatives in Cairo". The media were prevented from observing the appeal process, but outside the court Negad El Borai, a lawyer for Al Jazeera English's Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, said it was significant that the special prosecutor themselves had signalled major problems with the original trial.
"It was incorrect of the original court to assume that because the three worked for Al Jazeera that they were members of the Muslim Brotherhood," they said. They were also alleged to have been members of a terrorist organisation – the Brotherhood – yet lawyers pointed out that their arrest in December 2013 preceded the listing of the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation by the Egyptian authorities. Australian ambassador Ralph King, who attended the appeal with Mr Greste's parents, said: "We had very serious concerns about the first trial, so it's very encouraging that a retrial has been ordered – we hope this trial will be fair and transparent. "Still, we maintain that journalists never be on trial."
Late Sunday evening while attending a DraftKings event, former Chicago Fire player Hunter Jumper let dozens of scathing criticisms of the soccer club fly in a series of tweets. They became the latest in a line of players to publicly call out the Fire's club culture in the last year. Jumper revealed shocking details about the coaching staff during Frank Klopas' tenure, owner Andrew Hauptman, the culture in the locker room, training and concussion protocols, and the club's management structure. Perhaps most surprising, the Twitter feed took the form of an open discussion with fans and media members. It all began with what looked like a simple (yet still surprising) comment in reply to Last Word on Sports Senior Editor Jeff Krause.
https://twitter.com/JumpaHoo/status/643192123219701761
Hunter Jumper was a defender who played in Chicago from 2012-2014 under Frank Klopas. They were on the roster last season under Frank Yallop as well, but did not appear, after their career was derailed by health problems which were not soccer-related. A full collection of the tweets can be read at the Chicago Fire Confidential blog, which is a must-follow news source for anything Fire related.
There are lots of brilliant nuggets of insight in this unprecedented set of tweets. There are also some truly disturbing accusations that Jumper levels at the team. Perhaps most shocking is the suggestion that Michael Videira's career was ended (“His life is ruined!” Jumper said) due to playing with concussions under Klopas (Full disclosure: Jumper responded to this writer's question when giving this information).
Other highlights include Jumper defending owner Andrew Hauptman's passion (something already misconstrued by many on the #cf97 twitter hashtag) but heavily criticizing their management and front office/technical staff hires. “if you entrust (sic) the wrong people to run your company, you will lose every time” Jumper said. They also mention that Hauptman personally texts players, something which may be surprising to a fan base that hasn't heard anything from the owner directly for quite some time.
A major takeaway from this whole episode is that there is now another voice joining Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass in criticizing the Front Office structure of the Fire. Jumper claims that Hauptman does want to win and does care about players, but is hampered by poor management between the levels of ownership and game day staff. This is interesting considering Kass and others have called for the club to hire a President with a soccer background, clean up the confusing management structure, and clarify where the buck really stops in the FO.
Jumper also describes a dysfunctional club culture where decisions on playing time came from unclear or inappropriate sources, (“Haha I literally started laughing when I heard who was making the final decisions on players/playing time”) trainers refused to sit or speak with coaches at meals, players were constantly told they were in danger of losing their jobs, and coaches, technical staff, and ownership blamed each other for the problems on the field without taking responsibility.
Of course, this is not the first time a former player has spoken out about problems in Bridgeview.
After leaving the Fire for Montreal this January (to rejoin Klopas), Bakary Soumare unleashed their own critique of the Fire, invoking the imagery of the pitch at Toyota Park which was destroyed by concerts and poor groundskeeping during the 2014 season.
“I played in Chicago in 2007, when it was a big club that always won, that always made the playoffs. I saw the decline from that time to today when it comes to the staff, the squad, the club itself, the stadium, all the way to the grass. The grass represents the club. That's what the club has become, alas. Chicago is my home. It always will be. But the club has really fallen from when it used to stand.”
Soumare's comments at the time seemed to rally fans around the Fire, and they were apparently good bulletin board material, as Chicago beat the Impact 3-0 in their next meeting. But Soumare is not alone.
Another former player, Chris Rolfe, went on record on D.C. United Central, and called the Fire organization “stale”, saying they had stayed for too long in Chicago.
(Paraphrased) "Said they were probably at CHI for too long, organization was a stale for a long while, & they should've left sooner." (2/2) #cf97 — Jeff Krause (@DFBJeff) July 27, 2015
Rolfe's comments stung because they were always a fan favorite in Chicago. But what hurt even more was seeing the amazing form they captured almost immediately after joining D.C.. Players like Rolfe, Baggio Husidic, Dan Gargan, and Quincy Amarkiwa have enjoyed extremely good runs of form after leaving the Fire.
Quincy Amarikwa was recently interviewed on Extra Time Radio, an MLS league podcast. When asked why they were also able to enjoy immediate success after leaving the Fire, they said the following:
“That's been sort of (the story) over the course of my career. Being told that, OK, you get your opportunity so you better take advantage of it, otherwise we'll move on to someone else. So, I've been kind of prepped for that over the course of my career. And when Dom (Kinnear) brought me in, they told me he's bringing me in to play minutes and not be a roster filler player…having that peace of mind and understanding of what I was brought here to do allowed me to play my game…and that's all you need.”
While this doesn't seem like much, it is interesting when viewed in juxtaposition to this tweet:
https://twitter.com/JumpaHoo/status/643253702351003648
Amarikwa and Rolfe are players who thrive on confidence, something apparently in short supply in the Klopas locker room. It appears that for the first time, Amarikwa was told they would be given a chance to succeed, and they delivered.
Even Bulgarian Fire legend and former Barcelona player Hristo Stoichkov got in on the action this year, saying on a live Univision discussion about the rapidly improving MLS; “Yes, everyone is growing except my team Chicago Fire. Everyone slips away from them.” It's worth noting that even after all these years, and all the terrible results, a player with Champions League experience still calls the Fire “my team.” There is not a shortage of passion among current or former players of the club, something that should give supporters some comfort.
Still, this type of open, on the record criticism from active and former players is troubling. At this point, it would be downright shocking if the league and the Fire ownership were not aware of major problems inside the organization. While the Soumare, Rolfe, and Jumper comments look bad, they are just a peek behind the curtain, and are not an unbiased representation of the club. But, if even a small fraction of Jumper's comments have merit, they are extremely damning. While there is not much left to play for on the field this season, there appears to be plenty of work to be done off the field in Chicago.

CHAPTER TEN
CRAZY KUBRICK Kubrick's decision to allow a documentary film to be shot on the set of The Shining was an unprecedented departure from their usual ultra-secretive work policy. The resulting 35 minute film has led many film critics to reach a variety of mistaken assumptions about Kubrick's personality. Based upon this documentary Kubrick has been described as “camera shy”, “impatient”, and “demanding”, but the factor that seems to be universally forgotten is that Kubrick personally approved the content of the documentary film. Are we really to believe that Kubrick would take great efforts throughout their career to avoid public attention – rarely giving interviews, not travelling outside of Britain to make films – yet would suddenly bare their soul on set in front of a rolling camera? Are we to believe that they would approve a final edit of this behind the scenes documentary that would further fuel rumours of them being difficult to work with? I've read several Kubrick biographies and, while many cast and crew members have expressed difficulties in working with Kubrick, they very rarely describe them as having emotional tantrums or making degrading comments to people on set. They were renowned as being calm and rational even when spending days repeatedly filming a single shot. Their ability to frustrate people tended to be based more upon their lack of open communication and their obsessive attention to detail that required endless takes of the most seemingly arbitrary shot. So why did they so thoroughly break their own codes of practice in allowing documentary footage to be shot on The Shining? Well, the first thing to note is that Kubrick had full control over the documentary. All of the behind the scenes footage was shot by their daughter Vivian so trust wouldn't have been an issue. Kubrick could rest assured that the footage would be safely stored away where only they and Vivian could access it. Another factor is that if Kubrick was even remotely concerned with dispelling negative industry rumours about themselves then they would have made sure to conduct themselves more professionally on camera and to make sure the most self-complimentary footage made it into the final edit. Without realizing it, many film critics and biographers have accidentally identified Kubrick's motive for releasing this documentary. Time and time again they have described their edgy behind the scenes behaviour as being comparable to the film's main character Jack Torrance. One of the biographies I read (sorry, I can't recall if it was the one by John Baxter or Vincent Lobrutto) even claimed that there were running jokes on set about the similarities in appearance and behaviour between Jack Nicholson's character and Stanley Kubrick. My theory is that Kubrick was deliberately creating this character parallel between themselves and Jack, both in the documentary and among their crew in general. Consider the following: Kubrick is seen typing away, just like Jack Torrance does in the film. They appear frustrated, short-tempered and domineering - like Jack.
They swear and raises their voice - like Jack.
MEXICO CITY — On a bright day in January, a handful of demonstrators gathered in front of the gleaming mirrored panels of the Mexico City stock exchange, scribbling protest slogans on placards.
“THE OUTRAGED OF THE WORLD UNITE!” one banner announced.
Across the street, a lone police officer looked on. Pedestrians hardly looked up from their Blackberries as they passed the camp.
This is Mexico's Occupy movement, almost four months in and struggling to maintain momentum. The "Outraged" as the occupiers call themselves, have 1,500 followers on Twitter, but only a few dozen active supporters.
Occupy World: Is Romania next?
Mexico, after all, is caught up in the middle of the war on drugs, a bloody fight that has claimed at least 47,000 lives since 2006, according to government figures. People have rallied instead behind the “No More Blood” anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia, a poet whose son was murdered by gang-members.
By contast, Mexico's Occupy protesters, who focus on poverty and workers' rights, have failed to win many followers. The movement has been entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians.
“We have social networks,” said Jonas Gonzalez, a skinny art student. “But we haven't been able to take advantage of them because of a shortage of personnel, a shortage of people who stay here,” they added.
Most of the tents lined up on the sidewalk were empty.
Occupy World: What does OWS say about America?
“We have one Carlos Slim and millions of poor people,” said Guadalupe Maya, a fashionably dressed psychology student who was sitting in the encampment's main tent.
Carlos Slim, a Mexican telecoms industry magnate, is the richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of $63 billion. By contrast, about a fifth of Mexico's population subsists in extreme poverty.
The problem for the Occupy movement is that even though Mexico continues to struggle with ongoing problems of inequality and poverty, in the last fifteen years, an unprecedented number of young Mexicans have joined the country's middle class.
Most young people aren't taking to the streets to protest Carlos Slim. They just want to buy their cell phones.
According to one study from INEGI, Mexico's data center, in 1991 there were only 150 thousand cell phones in use in Mexico. By 2010 there were 90 million cell phones in use. A similar explosion has occurred in car ownership, web browsing and email use.
While many Mexicans complain about the weak points in their country's economy and the corruption in their government, most people in the country reserve their most vitriolic criticism for the recent wave of violence. People would rather see a return to the status quo than a revolution. At anti-violence rallies, a popular slogan is “out with the inept, in with the corrupt.”
The violence, once mostly contained in the pressure cooker along Mexico's northern border, is now bursting out in an increasing number of cities and towns throughout the country, even singeing the capital city. Violence is emerging as a serious problem in cities from the agrarian state Michoacán to beach-side vacation destinations like Acapulco and Veracruz.
In the “Occupy” encampment in front of the stock exchange, I saw a sign that said “NO + [Blood],” hanging near the tents, a message from Sicilia's anti-violence movement, a protest that has mobilized thousands of supporters in cities across Mexico. Under the words “sign here,” dozens of supporters had scribbled their names in black magic marker.
With its simple message, Sicilia's campaign has won widespread backing. The poet was even granted a meeting with Mexico's President, Felipe Calderon.
The Occupy movement, by contrast, isn't trying to work with the president. “Our dialogue isn't for the government, it's for the people,” Maya said.
“I hope no other country suffers with the same democracy we have here,” they said, pressing their fingers together.
Behind her, there was a hand-written placard that said “THE STATE CAN ONLY SUSTAIN ITSELF THROUGH CRIME.”

The Washington Post never fails to neo-liberalize anything remotely progressive, radical, or supposedly predicated on activism. On January 22, the Post ran an article originally titled “At the Women's March, it's the men who mattered most.” The Post then stealth-edited the headline to “At the Women's March, men mattered too,” but the content remained the same, despite no editor's note or explanation for the headline change added to the article.
The editorial praised men's participation in the women's march, claiming they're the most important part, ignoring the millions of women who participated and the feminist issues that the march was supposed to elevate. Why did the women bother showing up if the men were the most important part? Men don't need to be praised, and certainly not in a context of women's rights.
The author even acknowledged many weren't there to support the women's march, but to protest Donald Trump, hijacking the march to insert their own preferred agenda. Celebrities and Democratic Party politicians also exploited the march as a publicity stunt to bolster their image while ignoring the feminist issues this march had an opportunity to illuminate. It was the Post's second gaffe in regards to the Women's March; several weeks ago they mistakenly published a male symbol on the cover of their express publication about the march.
The Feminist Current's Meghan Murphy explained why making concessions to make men feel comfortable and included in feminism, specifically in regards to the Women's March, is problematic in addressing feminist issues. “Rather than confront the backlash head on, they've catered to it — altering their language and aims in a way that dances around the problem. Women are not targeted by men walking alone at night, in their homes, at work, in bars, or in any of the other myriad of places women are attacked, harassed, and raped, because they are passive, wear high heels, have long hair, wear dresses, or behave in other ‘feminine' ways, but because they are female. Female children are not prostituted or abused by adult men because they identify with ‘femininity,' but because of the sex class they were born into. Girls are feminized, not ‘feminine' by choice or because of some kind of internal, unchangeable personality flaw that turns them into victims.”
It is not women who should be adapting or making concessions to make men feel included or comfortable with feminism. It's the other way around. If men need praise and admiration to be receptive toward feminism, it defeats the purpose.

(San Diego, CA, September 26, 2016)—Today, the mother of a transgender teenage boy who was admitted into Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego (RCHSD) for inpatient care filed a lawsuit against the hospital for discrimination against their son.
Katharine Prescott took their 14-year-old son, Kyler Prescott, to RCHSD in early April 2015 for suicidal ideation and for treatment of their serious self-inflicted injuries following an incident of transphobic harassment by their peers. The hospital was aware that Kyler was a transgender boy and Katharine made clear to hospital staff that their son must be treated as male for all purposes. But during their stay, hospital staff repeatedly addressed Kyler—who came out to their family as transgender at 13 and whose gender markers were legally changed to male—as a girl.
Twenty-four hours into their 72-hour stay, and after several failed attempts by their mother to correct the discrimination by the hospital, the hospital's psychiatrist determined that despite their serious mental health issues, Kyler should be discharged early from RCHSD rather than remaining for the full 72 hours. About five weeks later, on May 18, 2015, Kyler died by suicide.
Katharine is represented by Transgender Law Center, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and attorneys at Foley & Lardner LLP. The complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, states that RCHSD violated federal and California laws by discriminating against Kyler based on their sex (including their gender identity) and based on their disability, and that the hospital engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices by claiming that it was experienced in treating transgender patients, when in fact it discriminated against Kyler and made their condition worse.
“When my son was in despair, I entrusted Rady Children's Hospital with their safety and well-being,” said Katharine Prescott. “Hospitals are supposed to be safe places that help people when they're in need. Instead of recovering at the hospital, Kyler got worse because staff continued to traumatize them by repeatedly treating them as a girl and ignoring their serious health issues. It's painful to speak out, but I want to make sure no other parent or child ever has to go through this again.”
Studies show that when transgender children are unable to live consistently with their gender identity, they experience high rates of depression and self-harming behaviors, including suicide. The consequences of disaffirmation of one's gender identity and discrimination are dire for transgender youth: they experience depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidal ideation at two to three times the rate of their non-transgender peers.
“Transgender children in crisis must be able to seek help without having to fear discrimination from the very medical providers who are supposed to care for them,” said Transgender Law Center Executive Director Kris Hayashi. “What happened to Kyler is heartbreaking and must not be allowed to happen again.”
“Deciding to admit your child for inpatient hospital care is one of the most difficult things a parent can face,” said Amy Whelan, Senior Staff Attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights. “Hospitals have a great responsibility to provide care to all children who need it and Rady utterly failed to do that in this case.”

In-house movements have been a hot topic as of late, especially from non-Swiss countries. The latest news (no, not Bremont) comes out of Austria. That's right, Austria. Just like Christopher Ward, Habring2's dynamic duo, Maria and Richard Habring are marking their 10th anniversary with an in-house movement.
If you're unfamiliar with Habring2, you may recognize a certain innovation from master watchmaker, Richard Habring. He's the brains behind IWC's Doppelchronograph, which has become one of the highlights of their new brand. Since their launch, Habring has only improved upon the Doppel, as it's now on its third iteration. Until now, the Habring2 line has relied on ETA movements, which makes the recent news from the five-person operation even more impressive.
The new movement, dubbed the A11, is likely the first to be designed, manufactured, and assembled in Austria. According to Habring2, the A11 will be a manual wound movement with a sub-seconds dial at the 9:00 position. At 30-millimeters wide and 4.2-millimeters thick, we've confidence Habring2 can not only power proper, classically sized watches, but also leave enough room to build modules on top. Although they'll utilize Carl Haas hairsprings, Habring2 will be making their own escapement in-house – by hand! This, of course, is in addition to hand finishing of the bridges, plates and other embellishments. Rounding off the movement stats is a solid 48-hour power reserve, nearly enough juice to get you through a whole weekend.
Habring2 has made it clear this initiative isn't just to bolster their catalog, but also to create jobs. They plan to use the power of humans, versus machines, and increase their already dominant watchmaking prowess within Austrian borders. They currently have the largest watchmaking apprenticeship program in Austria, and as you can imagine, this undertaking will only serve to strengthen that position. It's quite refreshing to see a brand take on more than a healthy balance sheet. Hopefully other watchmakers will take note and follow suit, or at least feel a bit guilty – we have to start somewhere.
It appears we'll learn a lot more on September 16th, when Habring2 reveals the A11 fully, and likely in an inaugural timepiece. After that, you can expect their in-house escapement to find its way in to every Habring2 watch. We're damned excited about this innovation, as we've long considered Habring2 a great value, and an underrated watchmaker. Here's to hoping for a successful launch and a deserved increase in notoriety.

Hours after the announcement of a fourth season renewal for the USA Network drama, Mr. Robot closed the book on season three, undoing much (though certainly not all) of the damage Rami Malek's Elliot has wreaked over the course of the series. Though there's no taking back Stage Two ( at least not yet ), Elliot found a way to undo the Five/Nine Hack, the massive cyberattack they and their fellow fsociety cohorts executed at the end of season one. With a single push of the button, and with an assist from a reconciled relationship with Mr. Robot (Christian Slater), Elliot completely changed the status quo of the world in which the show exists.
The common greeting among Mr. Robot fans, "Hello, friend," doesn't feel entirely appropriate given the ghost from the past who just walked back into Elliot Alderson's life… but hello, just the same.
But moments after undoing the hack, and immediately following the finale's closing credits, Elliot's earliest adversary resurfaced: Fernando Vera (Elliot Villar), the drug dealer who escaped from jail with Elliot's assistance back in the first season, only to repay our hero by killing their girlfriend Shayla (Frankie Shaw). Vera disappeared into the night following Shayla's death — the most brutal act on Mr. Robot up until that point — never to be seen or heard from again, until the final post-credits scene of season three, in which Vera surprised Darlene (Carly Chaikin) outside of Elliot's apartment.
How will the return of Elliot's worst personal nightmare impact the show moving forward? What will the future of Mr. Robot look like now that the Five/Nine Hack has been reversed? And how on Earth will creator Sam Esmail continue to direct every single episode of Mr. Robot as the series pushes on, now that a fourth season has been formally ordered, on top of their directorial commitment to Amazon's Homecoming as well? For those answers and more, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Esmail for their take on past, present and future of Mr. Robot, and beyond.
In the past, you have talked about envisioning Mr. Robot as a five-season arc. Exiting season three and heading into season four, does that plan remain intact?
Honestly, I've always said it's four or five seasons, and I've said that because I think it's somewhere in between. Whether that means the next two seasons are two short seasons, or it could technically still be two full ten-episode seasons, we're still kind of figuring that out. It's something the writers' room and I take very seriously. We never want to feel like we're treading water. Hopefully it fits into two more seasons, but we're trying to figure out that number.
Before season three aired, you compared Elliot's journey to Return of the Jedi, and used the word "disintegration" as a keystone for the season. Do you have a similar word and pop culture touchstone in mind for season four?
Well, I can't go into any of the Star Wars prequels… (Laughs.) It's weird. I think it might still be a continuation of Return of the Jedi. I kind of look at seasons two and three as two halves of the second act of this whole story. As we go into the next season, it's really this reenergized and renewed Elliot with a mission on what they want to do now and with a clarity we've never seen before. I think that jives with Return of the Jedi.
Season three ends with Elliot reversing the Five/Nine Hack, or at least beginning that process. How will that change the show moving forward, tonally?
It brings the show back to its initial promise of Elliot wanting to take down the guys behind the scenes who are manipulating society. The journey between seasons one to three has been about discovering who the real culprits are. The hack was merely a distraction that was co-opted by these people, and it's finally been revealed and exposed to Elliot. In a weird way, the next season will return back to that initial premise of the show and have Elliot be motivated by that, with this new clarity.
Every season ends with a post-credits scene that at least partly defines the next season. This year ended with the return of the "Savage Traveler" known as Fernando Vera, one of Elliot's oldest enemies. Is season four the season of Vera?
I don't want to give away any spoilers, but Vera definitely plays a critical part in the next season.
How long have you known exactly how Vera would fit back into the story? Did you have their comeback in mind as far back as when Mr. Robot was planned as a feature film?
No, because in the feature, there was no Vera. They were definitely a product of the adaptation to a TV series. In features, with characters, you have to be careful and you have to streamline them as much as possible and be focused in on the major players. For Vera, he's more of a character that I think can only be impactful on a TV show, especially with the way they disappear and reappears. That impact really hits you more when you're on a long-running series and you have all of that time to let the audience feel the gravity and weight of theirs return.
Does Vera's return signify the idea that even as the show's scope has expanded, the next season will narrow its focus?
Absolutely. That's essentially the pivot we're trying to make at the end of this season, that narrowing of focus. The first words Elliot said to us in the pilot were about that top one percent. By the end of this season, they finally realize who they are and they want to target them. At the same time, I've always said this show is about Elliot's internal and emotional journey. Vera hits that button, given the huge loss Elliot suffered in the first season — and really, I would say their only true connection we've seen in the show, their connection with Shayla. This absolutely brings clarity to Elliot's mission moving forward into the next season.
Season two was told across twelve episodes, while season three (and season one) was told across ten episodes. Do you have a preferred episode length for the series?
Because every season is so idiosyncratic and specific to that stage of where we're at in the story, I don't think all of the seasons fit one size. The good thing we do in the writers' room, with the support of the network, is we let the creative dictate those decisions. It's all about how much story we have to tell and how efficient we can be at telling that story. That's always the ultimate decision.
You have two seasons under your belt in which you directed every single episode. Are you still sane, for one, and will you continue to direct every episode moving forward?
I'm definitely insane. (Laughs.) But there are no plans for me changing that method. I guess the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing and expecting different results, right? So I'm going to keep repeating this. There are no plans for me vacating the director's chair.
Season three's fifth episode was presented in a single continuous shot. Looking forward, do you have ideas for how to top that episode in terms of form? Is it even possible?
It really comes from the episode, and the story we're trying to tell in the episode. We never look at anything from the outside, asking ourselves what challenge we can bring to the story this season in terms of format, and then retrofitting a story into it. The challenges always come from where the story needs to go and has to go. What's the best way to tell that story? Usually, because I have such an inventive and creative crew and writers' room, we pick the hardest way to tell that story possible — but all because we get excited by the prospect of challenging ourselves and knowing that's ultimately going to be the best way to tell that story. It tends to get decided in the writing phase, and the episodes tend to tell us how they want to be told. I look back and I notice a pattern where once every season, we do some sort of real format-breaking thing. But it's honestly never intentional. It's honestly never premeditated. It just always ends up being this one episode that wants to break the rules. Now it's fun, especially at the start of a season in the writers' room, thinking about which episode that's going to be.
Elliot and Robot's relationship, or lack thereof, was a huge focus of the season. They are finally speaking again as of the finale. What were your goals in terms of the two sides of Elliot Alderson this season, which culminated in the reveal that as much as Robot exists within Elliot, there are traces of Elliot existing inside of Robot as well?
We're continually evolving that relationship. Whenever I talk about Elliot's emotional journey, it really is about this relationship with Mr. Robot, that needs to face its reckoning at some point. The ending of this season pivots them to working together as a team for the first time in a genuine way. There's this realization that they are pieces of one whole, and it's something we haven't quite seen before, especially given the tumultuous relationship they had together in season two, and then here in season three when they didn't speak with each other for basically the entire season. We've now finally brought them to a point where they can work together as a team — and dare I even say, integrate.
Bobby Cannavale's Irving walks away from the season alive, but also seemingly walks away from the Dark Army, at least for now. Will they return as a series regular next year?
I'll leave it at this: I loved working with Bobby. They did such a phenomenal job, beyond my expectations, playing Irving. It was really fun to write for him. Nothing's set in stone yet, but I would be excited to work with them again.
And you're already working with them again soon, as he's starring in your Amazon series Homecoming.
Yeah, absolutely. He's a brilliant actor. Any chance and opportunity I have to work with them again, I'm going to take it, obviously.
How does Homecoming factor into your schedule in terms of what's next for Mr. Robot?
Going back to what I said earlier, I'm going to have to plead insanity again, because I honestly have no idea yet. (Laughs.) I just know that I'm probably going to be working every single day for the next year. I hope I can come out of it as a sane person at some point. It's a 2018 shoot, and we're in prep right now. Production begins early sometime early next year.
What did you make of the Mr. Robot season finale, and what are your expectations now that Vera is back in the mix? Sounds off in the comments below, and keep checking THR for more Mr. Robot news.
HOW is Sarah Palin's claimed "thanks, but no thanks" opposition to the "bridge to nowhere" any different from Hillary Clinton's account of dodging bullets in Bosnia? The answer: the press coverage. Over on their blog, James Fallows is comparing the two falsehoods and wondering why the press relentlessly pointed out the speciousness of Mrs Clinton's story, while it considers Ms Palin's claim a "controversy". "In Governor Palin's case, the more often they have repeated the story, the more abashed the press has seemed about pointing out its falsity," says Mr Fallows. The exact opposite was true in Mrs Clinton's case. Will it take a video of Ms Palin poring over blueprints of the bridge (perhaps with Sinbad at their side) before the mainstream press gives them equal treatment?
Update: One possible benefit of all this is that it appears to be close to making Paul Begala's head explode.
Update II: I expected some pushback in comments on whether or not Ms Palin's statement is a falsehood, so let me explain how I see it. What is true is that once Congress declined to specifically fund the bridge to nowhere, Ms Palin opposed going ahead with it using state funds. Bravo. But in their speeches they say, "I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' for that Bridge to Nowhere." That's simply not true. When Congressional funding for the bridge was on the table, as Ms Palin campaigned for governor, they supported it. So, as Mr Fallows writes, it might be more accurate for them to say, "I said 'Yes, please!' until the Congress said 'Sorry, no.'"
Ice Cream Maker Buying Guide
There is one main factor when it comes to choosing an ice cream machine for your home and that is whether you get one with its own compressor or one without. The price difference between these two types of machines is significant. Let's take a closer look so you can best determine which is better for your kitchen.
The Compressor
The main advantage of getting a machine with compressor is convenience. Compressors are what deliver the cold temperatures to the bowl that are needed to make ice cream. This is how your refrigerator and freezer work.
Convenience
Machines that do not have a compressor typically require you to freeze the bowl for up to 24 hours before making ice cream. You will have to plan ahead for your craving. One way around this is to create room in your freezer and keep your bowl in their full time. Of course, this restricts the amount of room in your freezer for other things.
When using a machine that has its own compressor you can completely skip this step. Whenever you get a craving you can mix your ingredients, add it to the machine, and have delicious desserts in a few minutes. The time savings are a tremendous positive and it is the main reason to go this route. You can also make multiple batches back to back with ease.
Weight
Another factor to keep in mind is that machines that contain a compressor are also going to be significantly heavier. If you do not have room on your countertop then getting it in and out of a storage cabinet is going to be quite the chore. These types of ice cream makers are best served staying on your kitchen counter.
Budget
If you are on a tight budget and only plan to make the occasional batch of gelato or ice cream then getting a less expensive machine without a compressor is going to make the most sense. However, if you can afford to indulge your cravings then having a machine that can satisfy your sweet tooth on demand is going to be a real and tangible advantage in the kitchen.
Cleanup
This is usually an overlooked aspect of buying any small kitchen appliance, but it is something to be aware of nonetheless. Even though most of the home ice cream machines on the market today are relatively easy to keep clean, this is one area to pay attention to before buying. Not too many machines have dishwasher safe parts, so a quick wipe down with a damp cloth or sponge will be required. It is also best to clean your machine right after use before the ingredients have had a chance to dry.
Ice Cream Consistency
One small note to add is that is important to have realistic expectations about the consistency of the ice cream that most homemakers produce. Store bought brands typically have additives and stabilizers that give it a firm texture, but home machines produce more of a soft serve product.
Some owners like to use heavier cream but most just stick the finished ice cream in their freezer for an hour or so to firm it up. Knowing what to expect can reduce any unwanted disappointment.
Wholesome Ingredients
One of the advantages of making homemade ice cream for your family is that you are in control of the ingredients. You can make it as healthy or as decadent as you wish. If you look at the ingredient list on a store bought brand you may not recognize what a few of the names are. However, when you get to create your own ice cream, gelato, frozen yogurt or sorbet at home you are completely in charge. Not only can it bring the whole family together but it can actually be a healthier experience.
Nothing brings people closer like the anticipation of ice cream. Hopefully this guide will help you find the best ice cream maker for your family and friends to enjoy the pure sense of goodness that a delicious frozen dessert can provide.
"It's real easy to get up on a team like that and just coast through the game but we didn't," said Demeritte, the Braves' No. 9 prospect . "We ended up tacking on some more, putting our foot on their throats and keeping it there and that's what we try to do."
MESA, Ariz -- Travis Demeritte hit a two-run home run, tripled, scored three runs and drove in three to lead a Salt River Rafters offensive barrage in a 17-2 rout of the Mesa Solar Sox in Arizona Fall League action Monday at Sloan Park.
MESA, Ariz -- Travis Demeritte hit a two-run home run, tripled, scored three runs and drove in three to lead a Salt River Rafters offensive barrage in a 17-2 rout of the Mesa Solar Sox in Arizona Fall League action Monday at Sloan Park.
"It's real easy to get up on a team like that and just coast through the game but we didn't," said Demeritte, the Braves' No. 9 prospect. "We ended up tacking on some more, putting our foot on their throats and keeping it there and that's what we try to do."
Hitting in the leadoff position, Demeritte was a part of a Salt River lineup that pounded Mesa's pitching staff for 20 hits including seven extra-base hits. All nine starters collected at least one hit, and seven Rafters had multiple hits.
• Gameday
D-backs No. 11 prospect Dawel Lugo had four hits in six plate appearances for Salt River and drove in two runs while scoring twice. Left fielder Dustin Peterson (Braves' No. 18) and No. 62 overall prospect Brett Phillips (Brewers' No. 7) both notched three hits, with the latter also scoring three runs and driving in three as the Rafters snapped Mesa's four-game winning streak.
It was Demeritte who got things rolling. Coming into Monday's Halloween matchup, the 22-year-old had slashed .250/.311/.375 in 13 games, with two doubles, one triple, one homer and four RBIs.
They added to their stat sheet beginning in the top of the third inning.
A wild pitch from Miami Marlins farmhand James Buckelew moved Rafters designated hitter Christin Stewart (Tigers' No. 3) into scoring position ahead of Demeritte, who hit a line-drive triple into the gap to push across the Rafters' first run. A Phillips single brought Demeritte home and JaCoby Jones (Tigers' No. 9) followed up with a single of their own to score Phillips and extend the Rafters' lead, 3-1.
"I was just looking for a good pitch to hit," Demeritte said of their triple. "I wanted to set the tone for the team and I ended up doing so. We ended up rolling today.
"Something about seeing that leadoff man on base does something for the team, and that's what I try to be. I try to be a catalyst and help us get off to a good start."
• Braves in AFL: Demeritte, Peterson transition to new positions
They grounded out in their second at-bat in the fourth inning but connected on a two-run homer to left field, their second of the Fall League, in the top of the sixth to drive in Grayson Greiner (Tigers' No. 26) and further the scoring gap, 6-1.
Demeritte wasn't finished seeing home plate yet, though, as Lugo would bring them in on a ground-ball single to left field, putting the 17th nail in the coffin for the Solar Sox.
Originally taken by the Texas Rangers with the 30th overall pick of the first round in the 2013 Draft, Demeritte was dealt to the Braves on July 27 in exchange for pitchers Lucas Harrell and Dario Alvarez.
Overall, Demeritte, a 2016 SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game participant, hit .266/.361/.544 with 28 home runs, 70 RBIs and 17 stolen bases in 123 games between Class A Advanced High Desert and Carolina.
Meanwhile, Demeritte's confidence continues to grow with their output so far in the Arizona Fall League.
"My biggest takeaway from being here knows I can compete with the best," they said. "Being out here with these guys, you know you're probably going to see most of them in the big leagues next year, or the year after. It's a confidence thing for me, knowing I can play alongside these guys and play at the next level with them."
1.Tactics
Everton opened up in a 4-2-3-1 with Drenthe and Coleman tasked with pressing Newcastle's fullbacks to cut out the supply line to their wingers. Heitinga was given the nod to continue in defence despite Distin being fit. Newcastle deployed their orthodox 4-4-2 with Marveaux pitched in on the right and Guthrie keeping their place with Tiote on the sidelines.
2.Woeful Start
A calamitous start for the Blues and specifically Jonny Heitinga who put through their own net following a communication breakdown with Tim Howard. This meant that for the 10th game running the Blues had failed to keep a clean sheet. Again the source was from a cross, this time Simpson was allowed time and space to whip in from the right and the Dutchman miscued into their own net. With the momentum Newcastle currently have, giving them such a gimee goal was criminal.
3.Newcastle defending from front
Newcastle's work ethic and organisation was there for all to see. Best and Ba led from the front throughout and it was this pressing that led to goal number two. Ba chased down a Jageilka back pass leading to Howard making a rash kick into touch due to Ba's pressure. From the subsequent throw in Ryan Taylor was able to take flight and plunder an unstoppable half volley into the top corner. Ba won more headers than any Newcastle player and you really wonder why Distin didn't start given the aerial presence Ba brings to the table and the fact our other key men in terms of aerial duels (Cahill & Fellaini) were not able to start due to injury and suspension.
4.Hoofball?
Our approach was to try and expose Newcastle's high -ish defensive line with long balls over the top from Jagielka aimed between Ryan Taylor and Coloccini. In total Jags made 24 long passes. To put that into context Colocinni hit 7 and was Newcastle's biggest user of the long ball. Jags hit a 45% accuracy with these punts and to be fair some of them were pinged really well – notably putting Saha clear 1 on 1 with Krul (above) which the Frenchman wasted – albeit the ball was on their weaker right foot. In total we made 100 passes more than Newcastle and played more passes into their 18 yard box.
5.Weaklinks
Danny Simpson may have the standard issue EPL tattoo sleeve but their awareness is distinctly championship level. The former Man Utd ressie's slack defending gave us a way back into the game on the stroke of half time when they allowed Rodwell to run off them and dart a great header into Krul's net from a superb Drenthe delivery. This was during our best spell of the game either side of halftime, with Saha hitting a post and then Gosling blatantly handling Saha's goal bound shot after the break.
6.Rodwell Marginalised
In the first half Jack Rodwell was amongst our top performers, finding time and space to link defence to attack pinging 23 passes in the process, scoring a goal and going close with another header. In the second half though Pardew seemed to instruct their charges to press them more and for their strikers to cut off the angles for Everton's defenders to feed him. They did so superbly. Rodwell was completely anonymous in the second period, making a feeble 7 passes and not getting anywhere near the opposition goal.
7.Missed Chances
In recent games we have not been creating lots of chances but you couldn't level that at Moyes men in this fixture. Our creativity and passing incision was good with 60% of our chances coming inside Newcastle's 18 yard box compared to Newcastle's 33%. Again Drenthe was our most creative player, laying on 3 chances for teammates. Our finishing though was anything but clinical – Saha hit the post but missed when clean through, whilst Drenthe should have done better with another chance.
8. Coleman CANNOT play left wing
Moyes tactic of switching their wide men had limited results. The Irishman's poor first touch is often exposed when defenders press them – compare this to last week against Man Utd who regularly stood off them and allowed them to run at them. They struggled over on the left especially when Gutierrez moved over to that side of the pitch. Moyes surely can't make this mistake again as it was painful to watch at times. Drenthe and Coleman both made some really hash tackles at times when it would have been better to jockey, committing a total of 7 fouls.
9. Attack v Defence
The last 30 minutes was basically an attack v defence exercise. Buoyed by the goal we set out to get the equaliser whilst Newcastle had retreated a fair bit and seemed intent on holding what they had, confident their well drilled backline would repel whatever we threw at them. They played 2 banks of four in close proximity and closed the space down well.
10. Final thought
Overall this was a frustrating day at the office for the Blues. We created plenty of chances but it was a familiar tale of woe in terms of missed opportunities. The league table makes grim reading but we are only 3 points worse of than this stage last season when we took 7th spot in the final standings. Credit to Newcastle, they didn't create much but their defensive setup as a team was heroic and despite what the media may say they deservedly sit 3rd in the table.

California lawyer's Las Vegas party costs nearly $100,000, time in jail and civil suit
California lawyer Robert Pearman was given the chance to allow their Las Vegas transgressions to stay in Las Vegas, but they declined.
Now Pearman, 45, is facing charges of malicious destruction of property after an alleged drunken party led to nearly $100,000 in damage to an Encore luxury room, according to a police report.
But not just any room. According to the report, Pearman was booked into room 2401, a 5,829-square-foot, two-story, three-bedroom, deluxe apartment with a pool table, whirlpool and treadmill, among other amenities.
Pearman, who lives in Encino, Calif., reportedly was staying in the luxury apartment on March 30 when Encore security called Metro Police for assistance with a disruptive guest.
When Metro Police investigated, they found Pearman, who “appeared intoxicated given their gait, manner of slurred speech and prominent odor of alcohol emanating from their person,” according to the police report.
The officers also found five women, who all said they had been partying with Pearman and staying in the apartment.
The room, according to police, was in complete disarray. Broken glass was strewn everywhere; food was smeared on the walls, floors and drapes; furniture was knocked over; and the officers noted damage to chairs, pillows, six lamps, a book about Michelangelo, a speaker and a decorative vase.
Encore staff, factoring in labor and other expenses, calculated the damage at $96,270.
Pearman, when contacted by police, took full blame, or credit, for the mess.
“I take full responsibility for what happened here. We were partying,” they said, according to the police report.
“I did all of this. I am responsible for all of these people. Let my people go,” they continued.
While deflecting blame from their cohorts, they also lashed out at Encore staff.
Pearman announced that they were an attorney and that they would “depose Steve Wynn and make this place Napalm.”
Napalm is a thickening and gelling agent mixed with petroleum and used in incendiary devices.
According to police, Encore staff offered to let Pearman pay for the estimated damage on the spot and said they would not press charges, but they declined.
Pearman was then arrested and booked into the Clark County Detention Center and has been released pending a court appearance in Las Vegas Township Court.
Wynn Las Vegas, which operates the Wynn and Encore, has filed civil charges against Pearman in district court.
