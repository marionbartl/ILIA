Comic Book Men is an American reality television series which aired on the AMC network from 2012 to 2018. It is set at Kevin Smith's comic book shop, Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, in Red Bank, New Jersey.
Production history
Filmmaker Kevin Smith was drawn to television through his love of podcasting, through which he says he realized his true calling: telling stories with words rather than pictures. His website, SModcast.com, features a number of podcasts, including I Sell Comics!, hosted by Mike Zapcic and Ming Chen, and Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!, co-hosted by Walt Flanagan and Bryan Johnson. The latter was the inspiration for Comic Book Men. Brian Quinn, the third co-host of Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!, was unable to be featured in the series due to the conditions of his contract for the TruTV series Impractical Jokers.
NJ.com reported in July 2011 that AMC was interested in the TV show that was being developed by Smith, which was set at Smith's store, and described as "Pawn Stars for geeks". The series would be part of AMC network's active entry into reality television. AMC decided to pick up the show to follow The Walking Dead. The working title was Secret Stash, before it was finalized as Comic Book Men.
The first season ran for six one-hour episodes, the premiere of which aired on February 12, 2012, following the return of The Walking Deads second season.
On May 9, AMC announced that Comic Book Men was renewed for a second season of 16 half-hour episodes. Season 2 premiered October 14, 2012, initially following the third season of The Walking Dead with its first 8 episodes; the second 8 episodes spearheaded AMC's new "Real Original Thursdays" lineup along with two new series, Freakshow and Immortalized. On its new night, it initially aired at 9:00 PM EST (with repeats at 10:30PM and 12:00 Midnight EST), but after a month was moved to 10:00PM EST with a repeat episode airing at 10:30 PM (and repeats of both episodes at 1:00AM and 1:30AM EST, respectively)
AMC commissioned a third season in April 2013. Season 3 premiered October 13, 2013, following the third season of Talking Dead.
A fourth season was commissioned in March 2014. It was also announced that guest cast member Robert Bruce would be the focus of a companion series that will follow him as he searches for collectibles at sales, auctions and flea markets across the country. AMC announced in October 2014 they were cancelling all unscripted shows except for Comic Book Men and Talking Dead and, as a result, Bruce's show did not progress past the pilot stage.
Season five was confirmed on June 7, 2015, premiered on October 18, 2015, and ran through 2016.
In May 2016, Smith confirmed that the series was renewed for a sixth season. It began on October 23, 2016.
A seventh season was confirmed in May 2017 by Kevin Smith.
On June 24, 2018, Kevin Smith confirmed the show was cancelled.
Cast
Kevin Smith – The owner of the store, and a filmmaker and author whose films include Clerks, Chasing Amy and Red State, and whose books include My Boring-Ass Life. Smith has been a comic book fan since he was a child, and has gone on to write such comic book series as Daredevil, Green Arrow, and Batman: Cacophony.
Walt Flanagan – Smith's friend since high school, and the manager of Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash since 1997. Flanagan has also appeared in small roles in Smith's films, and is a comic book artist himself, having illustrated Smith's miniseries Batman: Cacophony and Batman: The Widening Gyre. He co-hosts the podcast Tell 'Em Steve-Dave! with Bryan Johnson and Brian Quinn. Kevin Smith helped him propose to his wife Debbie, referenced in the episode "Stash-teroids."
Mike Zapcic – Zapcic is described as having an "encyclopedic knowledge of every issue of every comic known to man", which he utilizes at Secret Stash, where he began working in 2000. He co-hosts the podcast I Sell Comics! with Ming Chen, and lives in Long Branch, New Jersey with his wife, Julia and their sons, Mitch and Daniel.
Bryan Johnson – A longtime friend of Smith's, who, while not officially an employee at Secret Stash, can often be found behind the front counter. Like Flanagan, he has appeared in a number of Smith's films. In 2000, he wrote, directed, and starred in the movie Vulgar, which was based on the clown cartoon featured in the intro of Smith's film, Clerks, and which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He has also written comic books, including Karney and War of the Undead, both of which were illustrated by Walt Flanagan. He co-hosts the podcast Tell 'Em Steve-Dave! with Walt Flanagan and Brian Quinn.
Ming Chen – Chen first met Smith through the fansite he created in dedication to Smith in 1995, which led to Chen being hired to create the View Askew Productions website. Today he continues to work on all of Smith's online properties, and is the technical expert at the Stash. He co-hosts the podcast I Sell Comics! with Mike Zapcic, and in his free time he does website work for two non-profit organizations: Street Poets Inc. and the Kenny Gordon Foundation.
Episodes
Companion podcast
Comic Book Men is a companion television show to Award Winning podcast, titled Tell 'em Steve Dave and the lesser known 'I Sell Comics, which is hosted on the SModcast network. During the first season of I Sell Comics, some podcast episodes were pre-recorded during the filming of the show, while others were recorded live on the SModco Internet Radio station (S.I.R.) directly following the first airing of an episode, allowing the audience to participate by calling in to the show. For the show's second season, the episodes were all recorded in the Secret Stash and hosted by Ming Chen, occasionally joined by some of the others from the show including Walt, Bryan, Mike, and frequent series contributor (and "pop culturalist") Rob Bruce.AMCTV.com
Reception
As of December 2012, Metacritic scores the first season 55 out of 100 based on 7 professional TV critics. Ellen Gray of The Philadelphia Inquirer remarked, "Comic Book Men may not be as complicated as Rubicon, but it's smarter than it looks at first." Mike Hale of The New York Times opined that the series is an authentic portrayal of post-collegiate American life, and concluded, "It's diverting, a little sad, a little boring, full of geeky macho posturing and ultimately pointless, much like a Wednesday afternoon in a comic-book shop." David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle called the show an "amusing geekfest".

L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd is an English contract law case, concerning the right to terminate performance of a contract.
Facts
Wickman alleged that wrongfully terminated their contract for Wickman to visit carmakers to market Schuler's panel presses, as their sole representative for four-and-a-half years, even though Wickman had failed to make visits. Clause 7(b) said, ‘It shall be a condition of this agreement that [Wickman] shall send its representatives to visit [the six largest UK car manufacturers of the time] at least once in every week for the purpose of soliciting orders for panel presses.' Clause 11 said either party could end the agreement if the other was in material breach and did not change its behaviour on 60 days' notice. Mr Wickman failed to make any visits at the start. This was waived by Schuler at first, but then when Wickman was making some but not all the visits, Schuler terminated. Wickman sued, alleging Schuler was not allowed to terminate.
Judgment
The House of Lords held by a majority that Schuler was not entitled to terminate, and held clause 7(b) to be not a condition. Clause 7 was to be read with clause 11, so that notice would need to be given to remedy the situation, and if notice and 60 days to change was not given, then clause 7 would not be breached. Only after 60 days without compliance would ‘rescission' (i.e. termination) be allowed. Lord Reid said the following.
Lord Morris, Lord Simon and Lord Kilbrandon concurred.
Lord Wilberforce dissented, holding that Schuler should have been able to terminate.

Chon (sometimes stylized as CHON) is an American progressive rock and math rock band from Oceanside, California. Their music is largely instrumental with only a few songs containing vocal performances. The band consists of Mario Camarena (guitar), Erick Hansel (guitar), Esiah Camarena (bass) and Nathan Camarena (drums).
History
Early career
Since 2008, they have been releasing demos via internet. In 2010, the band began a brief hiatus, but reunited in 2011 to record two new songs, "O.G." and "Breathe". They returned in 2013 with the release of their debut EP entitled Newborn Sun. In 2014, Chon released their second EP, entitled Woohoo! and embarked on two consecutive nationwide tours with Animals as Leaders.
Debut and departure of Pelisek
In December 2014, Chon signed with the record label Sumerian Records, and announced they would be releasing their debut full-length album the following year. On February 5, 2015, the band announced their debut full length titled Grow would be released in March 2015. On March 5, the band premiered their song Can't Wait from the album via Red Bull. They released the album on March 24. Eight days prior the band embarked on a 27 date tour supporting Circa Survive. On December 16, 2015, Chon announced their first full US headlining tour, titled the Super Chon Bros Tour, with accompanying bands Polyphia and Strawberry Girls. They sold out every single show on the tour. Chon was also an opening band during the Sonic Unrest Tour, featuring headliner Periphery, and bands Sikth and Toothgrinder.
On November 8, 2015, Chon stated via their Twitter feed that they parted ways with Drew Pelisek due to 'artistic differences'. It was also confirmed by Drew on a personal account.
Second album and onward
They recorded their second album Homey with Anthony Crawford on bass. Since Pelisek's departure, Chon has had 3 touring bassists, including original bassist Esiah Camarena, who played bass during the Journey's Unplugged tour. Esiah has returned as a permanent member of the band following his attendance on the Robot With Human Hair Vs. Chonzilla tour with Dance Gavin Dance.
On June 7, 2019, Chon released their third full-length self-titled album, under Sumerian Records.
Equipment
Chon endorses Ibanez guitars and Overdrive Straps guitar straps. Guitarist Mario Camarena currently plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the MAR10, which is based on an Ibanez AZ series prototype in pink with a white pickguard. Earlier, he used the pink prototype in addition to a white Ibanez AZ prototype that went on to become a regular AZ Prestige model, as well as an Ibanez RG652fx with a custom floral print (including a black version of Yoshi, which Mario uses as his main character in the video game Super Smash Bros.), and an Ibanez S5521Q. He could also often be seen playing a custom Ibanez RG created by Seth Hollander.
Before Chon's "Homey" album, Mario used a Vox AC30 tube amplifier and a Fender Super Sonic but has now switched to a Matchless amplifier. Erick Hansel primarily plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the EH10, which is based on the Ibanez AZ series. Earlier, he used a dark blue Ibanez AZ prototype, an RG652FX with a custom paint dip, an RG321MH (on early albums and performances), and an Ibanez Talman Prestige. Recently, Erick has been seen with either a Vox AC30 or a Matchless amplifier. Chon's early work was known to largely shun the use of effects pedals, but the band has since started experimenting heavily with pedals during the writing process for Homey.
Musical style and influences
In the early days the band were influenced by metal bands such as Necrophagist and post-hardcore band The Fall of Troy, but the band have also listed pianists such as Hiromi Uehara, Tigran Hamasyan, and Alex Argento as influences in their sound. Chon's music was noted for its use of complex harmony with heavy emphasis on extended chords, as well as the odd time signatures and polyrhythms typical of the progressive rock genre. Their second album, Homey, saw the band incorporating elements of trip-hop and electronic music, which can be heard in tracks such as 'Nayhoo.'

Aurélien Taché (born 26 May 1984) is a French politician who was elected to the French National Assembly on 18 June 2017, representing the department of Val-d'Oise.
He was elected in 2017 as a member of La République En Marche! (LREM) but left the party in 2020, and joined the short-lived Ecology Democracy Solidarity group, then The New Democrats.
Political career
In parliament, Taché serves on the Committee on Social Affairs, where was his parliamentary group's coordinator from 2017 until 2018, and the Finance Committee. In addition to his committee assignments, he is part of the French-Tunisian Parliamentary Friendship Group and the French-Ukrainian Parliamentary Friendship Group.
Led by Taché, Hugues Renson and Matthieu Orphelin, around 20 members of the LREM parliamentary group established a sub-group in late 2018 with a "wish to express a humanist, social and ecological sensibility and to better raise citizens' concerns"; the initiative was widely interpreted as the launch of a left-wing faction within the group. In May 2020, he joined seven lawmakers in leaving LREM to join the new Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity group, depriving the president of an outright majority and raising pressure for more left-wing policies. and joined the Ecology Democracy Solidarity group. By June, he and five other ex-LREM deputies announced establishment of #Nous Demain, a "humanist, ecologist and feminist" political movement. He then joined The New Democrats.
Political positions
Taché was considered a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron.
In May 2018, Taché co-sponsored an initiative in favour of a bioethics law extending to homosexual and single women free access to fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) under France's national health insurance; it was one of Macron's campaign promises and marked the president's first major social reform of his five-year term.
In early 2018, Taché was one of several LREM members who joined an informal parliamentary working group on Islam set up by Florent Boudié in order to contribute to the government's bill aimed at better organising and supervising the financing of the Muslim faith in France. In 2019, he was one of five members of the LREM parliamentary group who joined a cross-party initiative to legalize the distribution and use of cannabis.
Ahead of the Green movement's primaries in 2021, Taché endorsed Éric Piolle as the movement's candidate for the French presidential election in 2022.
Controversy
In October 2019, Taché publicly criticized his fellow LREM member and Minister of Education Jean-Michel Blanquer in an interview with Le Point over the latter's opposition to a woman's right to wear a hijab when accompanying school children. As a consequence, Blanquer issued a complaint against Taché at the LREM leadership and asked for a sanction to be imposed on him.
In April 2021, Taché was denied access to the international zone of Charles de Gaulle Airport when he wanted to meet a group of Algerian nationals who had been stranded at the airport for a month and a half because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Big Spring State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Toboyne Township, Perry County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park is on Pennsylvania Route 274, southwest of New Germantown. Big Spring State Park is a hiking and picnic area. A partially completed railroad tunnel in Conococheague Mountain is a feature of the park.
History
The area surrounding Big Spring State Park is now largely a wild area. This was not the case in the 19th century. One of the first businesses at the foot of Conococheague Mountain was a tannery. This tannery was in operation from the early 19th century until 1860. The tannery was converted into an axe handle factory in 1871. The Perry Lumber Railroad, a narrow gauge railway also operated in the area. It hauled lumber to tanneries, barrel manufacturers and charcoal furnaces.
The abandoned railroad tunnel is a remnant of the lumber era that dominated the economy of much of Pennsylvania in the 19th century. The Newport and Shermans Valley Railroad extended its line into the Big Spring area in an attempt to connect with the Path Valley Railroad on the other side of Conococheague Mountain in Franklin County. This tunnel was left incomplete and stands as a reminder of the lumber/railroad era.
Although the railroad may have failed in its effort to tunnel through the mountain, the tracks remained. These rails were used to transport picnickers into the area during the early 20th century. The current facilities at Big Spring State Park were built during the Great Depression in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It was formally opened in 1936.
Recreation
Big Spring State Park offers recreational opportunities to those interested in picnicking and hiking. The pavilions built by the CCC and picnic tables are available in many areas of the park. A one-mile trail leads to the abandoned railroad tunnel in Conococheague Mountain. The park also serves as a trailhead for the Iron Horse Trail in Tuscarora State Forest.

USS Pamanset (AO-85) was a acquired by the United States Navy for use during World War II. She had the dangerous but necessary task of providing fuel to vessels in combat and non-combat areas.
She was laid down as MC hull 1264 by the Marinship Corp., Sausalito, California, under a Maritime Commission contract on 30 March 1943, launched on 25 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. B. Murray, acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 30 April 1944.
World War II operations
Following shakedown, Pamanset sailed for Pearl Harbor and duty with the Pacific Fleet during the final months of World War II. Departing Pearl Harbor on 24 July 1944, she steamed to the Marshall Islands, then to the Admiralty Islands where she spent the next several months refueling units of the 3rd Fleet. She continued her support of the 3rd Fleet during the Western Caroline and Philippine Islands engagements in the fall of 1944 as well as during the Formosa and China coast attacks early in 1945. Refueling operations in very heavy seas in January 1945, resulted in injuries to several of her crew. Pamanset arrived off Iwo Jima on 26 February and participated in that campaign until returning to Ulithi on 2 March, thence proceeding to San Pedro, California, for extensive repairs. She was underway again on 4 June for the Western Pacific and serviced the 3rd Fleet in various fueling areas until the end of the war.
After extensive operations in support of the occupation fleet in Japanese home waters, she departed Yokohama, Japan, on 8 November for San Francisco, California, where she decommissioned on 18 March 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 March and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 11 October.
Transferred to MSTS
Reacquired on 10 February 1948, she was assigned to Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) on 1 October 1949, as USNS Pamanset (T-AO-85), manned by a merchant crew. After necessary fitting out and trials, she added to her wartime record by rendering valuable service during the Korean War. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) Reserve Fleet on 24 February 1956, reinstated again on 26 June for MSTS contract operations, then struck on 26 September 1957.
Disposal
The ship was sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on 3 May 1966 and renamed Seatrain Florida. She was subsequently lengthened using part of the midsection of another T2 tanker, the Fruitvale Hills, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and palletized cargo, intermodal containers, vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in March 1967 Seatrain Florida, IMO 6119807, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in October 1974 and on August 8, 1978, her name was changed to just Florida. The ship was retired and broken up in 1986.

John Granville Woolley (February 15, 1850 – August 13, 1922) was an American politician, lawyer, and public speaker who served as the Prohibition Party's presidential candidate in 1900.
Biography
John Granville Woolley was born in Collinsville, Ohio, on February 15, 1850, to Edwin C. Woolley and Elizabeth Hunter Woolley. In 1871, he graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University and the University of Michigan in 1873 and later gained admission to the Illinois bar. He was elected City Attorney in Paris, Illinois, in 1875 and became Prosecuting Attorney of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1881. Two years after entering private practice in New York in 1886, Woolley, a reformed alcoholic, began a career of public speaking around the country. On January 31, 1888, he joined the Prohibition Party in New York City and later that year Clinton B. Fisk offered him a job to practice corporate law, but he rejected the offer.
During the 1896 presidential election there were attempts to draft him for the Prohibition presidential nomination, but he chose not to run. During the 1900 presidential election he ran for the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination and with the support of Hale Johnson, the party's 1896 vice presidential nominee who withdrew shortly before balloting, was able to narrowly defeat Silas C. Swallow for the nomination with 380 delegates to 320 on June 28, 1900. Woolley, along with Henry B. Metcalf, placed third in the popular vote with over 209,000 votes. In 1903, he received a single vote for Illinois's senate seat.
In the 1900s he was successively editor and part-owner of The Lever in Chicago and of the journal into which it merged, The New Voice, national organ of the Prohibition Party, founded in 1899. Woolley made two tours of Europe in 1901 and 1905 to speak for Prohibition. On January 4, 1913, he announced that he was leaving the Prohibition Party due to its vote totals continuing to decrease with every presidential election.
In 1922, he was commissioned by the World League Against Alcoholism to study prohibition in multiple countries, but died from a heart attack in Granada, Spain, on August 13, 1922.

Jack Van Dyke (born in 1912, died in 1991) was a sailor from the Wisconsin, United States, who became the second president of the International Soling Association (1973 - 1975).
Van Dyke started his sailing career in 1917 as a 5-year old bilge sailor on his father's A-Scow. From that time on he sailed when ever possible. After WOII he became attracted to sailing in the Star. In 1954 he became North American Champion in that class. When he was sailing 5.5 Metre in 1968 he became interested in the new International Soling class and soon he became an Soling sailor. In February 1971 he stepped into the executive committee of the ISA. During his term as president he accomplished the following:
A completely new Constitution for the ISA
Yearly revisions and improvements to the class and measurement rules in order to maintain the one-design character of the Soling
New championship rules for the Worlds and European and other Continental Championships
The regulair publication of Soling Sailing, the magazine of the ISA.
Van Dyke graduated from Princeton University in 1934.

The flag of Sicily (; ) shows a triskeles symbol (a figure of three legs arranged in rotational symmetry), and at its centre a Gorgoneion (depiction of the head of Medusa) and a pair of wings and three wheat ears.
Description
The flag is characterized by the presence of the triskeles in its middle, the (winged) head of Medusa and three wheat ears, representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily, The triskelion symbol is said to represent the three capes (headlands or promontories of the island of Sicily), namely: Pelorus (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); Pachynus (Passero, Syracuse: South); and Lilybæum (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle from the historical three valli of the island.
The flag is bisected diagonally into regions colored red, the colour of Palermo and yellow, the colour of Corleone. These are the two cities that started the revolution of the Sicilian Vesper. The flag was used during the medieval revolution of the Vespers.
History
The Triskeles-with-Gorgoneion symbol is found in antiquity, depicted on coins minted in Syracuse in the 4th century BC.
The emblem was included in the design of the Army Gold Medal awarded to British Army majors and above who had taken a key part in the Battle of Maida (1806).
It was used in combination with the Italian tricolore in the Sicilian revolution of 1848.
It was at this time referred to as "the sign of the Trinacria", Sicily being referred to by its ancient name,
Trinacria ("having three headlands"). The name had been revived during the Aragonese period of the Kingdom of Sicily following the Sicilian Vespers (1282).
Apparently from this use, Trinacria came to be re-interpreted as a name for the symbol itself.
The diagonal division in red and yellow goes back to 1943, when it was used by the separatist movement led by Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile.
The addition of a pair of wings to the head of the Gorgon is modern (1848), the three ears of corn were added in the 1940s.
A gonfalon combining the coats of arms of Norman Sicily, the Hohenstaufen emperors and the Aragonese kingdom of Sicily with the triskeles emblem was adopted by the Sicilian Regional Assembly in 1990. The present design became the official public flag of the Autonomous Region of Sicily on 4 January 2000, after the passing of an apposite law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools, city halls, and all the other places in which Sicily is represented.
Kingdom of Sicily
The Kingdom of Sicily was a state that existed in the south of the Italian peninsula and for a time the region of Ifriqiya from its founding by Roger II of Sicily in 1130 until 1816. It was a successor state of the County of Sicily, which had been founded in 1071 during the Norman conquest of the southern peninsula.
First flag
Manfred, King of Sicily, crowned King of Sicily in 1258, changed field of the coat of arms of Hohenstaufen family from gold to silver. In 1266 Manfred was killed in the Battle of Benevento, and Sicily was occupied by the French under the command of Charles of Anjou. The banner was lowered, but the black eagle from Swabia on a white background appeared on Sicilian flags for centuries.
Second flag
Charles I used the standard of the House of Anjou. The Angevins lost power on the island after the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. Thereafter the old Kingdom of Sicily was centred on the mainland, with capital at Naples, and although informally called 'Kingdom of Naples' it was still known formally as 'Kingdom of Sicily'. Thus, there were two "Sicilies" — the island kingdom, however, was often called "Sicily beyond the Lighthouse" or "Trinacria", by terms of a treaty between the two states.
Third flag
The next king of the Sicily island was Peter III of Aragon of the House of Barcelona. Since Peter III was Manfred's son-in-law, he restored the coat of arms with the black eagle and added four red stripes on a yellow background from his own coat of arms. Until 1296, the coat of arms and the banner derived from it were usually quartered.
Fourth flag
In 1296, the quartering of the Swabian and Aragonese arms was changed to the Saint Andrew's cross, with stripes at the top and bottom, and with eagles on the right and left. The function of the flag also changed gradually: initially it was a banner of war later it became a flag raised by Sicilian merchant ships. Perhaps by mistake, due to its rather complicated design, this flag was often depicted with shoulder positions swapped (eagles up and down and stripes right and left).
Fifth flag
In the 17th century, the design was significantly simplified: the white fabric was crossed by four horizontal stripes alternating red and yellow, above and below two small black eagles (in a more modern style). The flag probably survived until 1800 - or at least no later than October 2, 1817, when the Sicilian flags were abolished - though it continued to appear on the cards for many years. The logo of the separatist party "Free Sicilians" alludes to this flag.
Royal Sicilian Regiment
The Royal Sicilian Regiment was a light infantry regiment recruited from Sicily that served with the British Army during the Napoleonic wars, from 1806 to its disbandment in 1816.
Modern
Sicilian revolution
On 27 May 1848, Trinacria, a symbol of freedom in the pre-Roman period and during the uprising of Vespers, was placed at the center of the Italian tricolor and was adopted by the Sicilian Parliament as the symbolic flag of the island.
Separatist movement
After Operation Husky Sicilian separatists created two organizations: party MIS and paramilitary Voluntary Army for the Independence of Sicilyit.
Vespro flag
The first MIS flag closely resembled the current flag of Sicily, although it had many variants. MIS stopped using it around 1946, but the flag did not disappear.
EVIS flag
EVIS flag consists of Senyera and the blue canton with Trinacria. The flag symbolized the group's very pro-American position. When the EVIS disappeared after the war, the flag was taken over by MIS, which strengthened the separatist symbolism.
Region of Sicily
Sicily adopted its first official flag in 1995. The difference from the current flag was that there was a coat of arms instead of a Trinacria. The coat of arms consisted of four fields: 1 Hauteville family, 2 Manfreds eagle, 3 Trinacria and 4 Red Bars. The flag changed in 2000 to the current design.

Louisiana Highway 425 (LA 425) was a state highway in Louisiana that served East Baton Rouge Parish. It spanned in a south to north direction, and was located completely within the city limits of Baton Rouge. It is known as Staring Lane.
Route description
LA 425 provided access from Highland Road to Perkins Road. It met LA 30, which used Highland Road at the time, and continued north to LA 427, known as Perkins Road. It met the now-defunct LA 949, which used Hyacinth Avenue. Hyacinth Avenue was once a portion of Perkins Road.
It was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
Staring Lane continue to exist today as a locally maintained road, but extensions were later added its southern end. Staring Lane currently ends at LA 42 (Burbank Drive) since an extension was built in 2011. Construction is currently going on to widen Staring Lane to four lanes; this project is slated for completion in September 2013. Other plans in the works include extending Staring Lane to LA 30 (Nicholson Drive).
History
The state highway was established in the 1955 renumbering. The road was turned over to city control in 1961. The number for LA 425 was reused for the extension of US 425.

Divers Institute of Technology (DIT) is a private, for-profit educational institution for the training of commercial divers and located in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1968 in Seattle, Washington, Divers Institute of Technology is located on the North end of Lake Union near Gas Works Park in the Wallingford district.
The seven-month program consists of 900 hours, including dive time. There are twelve classes per calendar year, with a new class starting each month. From July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2007, the average number of students per class was 23, with a retention rate of 90%. It is estimated that 10% of the students are women.
Divers Institute is one of only two dive schools in the U.S. to grant students the Canadian Standards Association Unrestricted Surface Supplied Air Diver Certification, issued by the Diver Certification Board of Canada, allowing graduates to dive internationally.
History
Divers Institute of Technology was founded in 1968, by John Manlove, U.S. Navy (Ret.), and Leiter Hockett, a local shipwright and underwater construction contractor. The school was situated on barge #41 of the Lake Union ship canal. The program initially consisted of 14 weeks of training, increasing to 16 weeks in 1975. Its goal was “to ensure that all apprentice divers hold the essential, core skills necessary to compete in the commercial diving industry, whether it's in the inland or offshore sector.”
The 1970s and 1980s saw a rising need for repair to U.S. inland infrastructures, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and port facilities. In response to this industry demand and to changing technologies, Divers Institute broadened its curriculum to incorporate the unique requirements of the inland diving community. Subjects such as Non-Destructive Testing and hazardous materials handling were integrated, the welding and cutting programs were expanded, and the new technology of hydraulic tool training was added.
In June 1985, barge #41 sank. Instructors and students spearheaded the salvage effort to retrieve equipment and records, while the school continued to operate on a full-time schedule. Divers Institute was relocated onshore along the Lake Union ship canal in 1990, where it began training on the current seven-month program schedule.
Throughout its history, the ownership of Divers Institute has had a significant effect on its development. Letier Hockett, one of the school's founders, sold his holdings to Jack Blispinghof, who became instrumental in obtaining accreditation from the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC). In 1975, Blispinghof sold to Chuck Litzo. Litzo and original founder John Manlove then increased the program from 16 to 26 weeks of training, allowing Canadian students to qualify for financial aid. In 1985, Manlove and Litzo sold the school to John Ritter, U.S. Navy (Ret.) and Norval Duncan in 1985, who expanded the program yet again, from 26 to 30 weeks.
In 1998, Divers Institute was purchased by its current owners, Bruce Banks and Jack Ringleberg, who have sought to update the school's training and facilities, with the mission "to provide advanced technical training that produces the most qualified, skilled professionals in the constantly evolving underwater marine industry." Banks is a retired U.S. Navy Commander and President of Jamestown Marine Services, Inc in Groton, Connecticut. Ringleberg is also U.S. Navy (Ret.) and PE President of JMS Naval Architects and Salvage Engineers, in Mystic, Connecticut.
In September 2003, Divers Institute of Technology was audited by the Diver Certification Board of Canada (DCBC) and found to be in compliance with CSA 275.4. This certification is fully recognized by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) of the United Kingdom and the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS), and all other diving and national certifying regulatory agencies having reciprocity agreements with the aforementioned authorities. Divers Institute is the first diving program in the U.S. to reach this goal.
In March 2011, campus relocated to a newer facility at the north end of Lake Union, in the Seattle neighborhood of Wallingford.
Campus
Divers Institute of Technology's training facility is located in the Seattle neighborhood of Wallingford, in the Northlake area on the north end of Lake Union. Dock and land-based facilities provide protected moorage for floating classrooms and submerged diving projects. All on-campus dives are conducted in natural underwater environments.
Portions of the training program require students to dive at greater depths, and in a variety of visibility and temperature conditions. These dives are conducted under instructor supervision at various locations around the Puget Sound. For the deep dives series required for international certification, students are taken out on the school's 63-foot diving vessel, which is equipped with a multi-place decompression chamber.
Training
The 900-hour program includes training in the following subjects: physics, basic dive medicine, CPR, First Aid, hyperbaric chamber, dive suit components and operation, rigging, instruction in inland and offshore diving, HazMat procedures, underwater welding, hydraulic tools, salvage, SCUBA, open water deep dives, and introductory mixed gas/saturation diving.
Upon completion of the program, graduates may earn the following certifications, if they meet the requirements set forth by each certifying authority while in school:
Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Unrestricted Surface Supplied Air Diver Certification, issued by the Divers Certification Board of Canada (DCBC)
First Aid, CPR, Oxygen provider, A.E.D. and Blood Pathogens Certification
Hazardous Waste Materials (HazMat) 80-hour OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 and WAC 40-hour HAZWOPPER Certification
SDI Open Water SCUBA Certification
Kirby Morgan Hat Operator Certification
API Rigger; Chevron USA API 2D (RP2D) (REV-6) Certification
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) certificate
Faculty
A significant number of the instructors at Divers Institute of Technology are former U.S. military. In 2008, of the 19 instructors on staff, 14 were veterans: nine U.S. Navy (Ret.), three U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.), one U.S. Army (Ret.), one U.S. Air Force (Ret.).
Three instructors reached the rating of U.S. Navy Master Diver prior to retirement: Gary Chancellor, Director of Training; Frank LaQue, Director of International Programs; and Hy Spalding, instructor.
Instructor Willy Wilson, U.S. Navy (Ret.)
Accreditation
DIT is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC). This commission is listed by the U.S. Department of Education as a nationally recognized accrediting agency under the provisions of Chapter 33, Title 38, U.S. Code and subsequent legislation.
In the media
In 2000, 20th Century Fox commissioned Divers Institute of Technology to assist in the production of Men of Honor, the story of the U.S. Navy's first African-American Master Diver, Carl Brashear. Technical support was provided for filming on location in Portland and Rainier, Oregon. Several cast members, including Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Robert De Niro trained with DIT faculty and staff in the summer of 1999 on the Seattle campus. The actors and crew were taught about the historic Mark V dress (common in Brashear's time), and its operation. Prop and set directors for the film borrowed over 200 items from Divers Institute, including helmets, Mark V umbilicals, canvas suits, dive knives, and dive station equipment.
Divers Institute of Technology has also been asked by the U.S. Coast Guard and local law enforcement to assist in investigations. In February, 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard asked DIT to assist in an inflation test to evaluate the condition of a life raft from the fatal sinking of the fishing vessel Katmai in October, 2008.
Divers Institute of Technology Executive Director, John Paul Johnston is frequently consulted for articles in popular press regarding the commercial diving industry, including the national job market and specialization within the field.

Freakin' Funky Fuzzballs is a top-down puzzle video game written by Ian Currie and Robert Koller for DOS and published by Sir-Tech Software. In it, a fuzzball must navigate several maps and avoid the "enemy."
Gameplay
There are two different kinds of worlds, fall-out maps and static maps. In fall-out maps, tiles change colors when stepped on and disappear when they turn blue. In static maps, the tiles change from dark to light pink.
In each case, the objective of each level is to find the proper number of keys or keycards to open the exit to the next level. The keys are buried under tiles and can only be revealed by stepping on the tiles.
In addition to keys, there are an assortment of other items-

Kitzbühel (, also: ; ) is a medieval town situated in the Kitzbühel Alps along the river Kitzbüheler Ache in Tyrol, Austria, about east of the state capital Innsbruck and is the administrative centre of the Kitzbühel district (). Kitzbühel is one of the most famous and exclusive ski resorts in the world. It is frequented primarily by the international high society and has the most expensive real estate in Austria. The proximity to Munich has made it a preferred location for vacation homes among the German elite.
Geography
Kitzbühel is situated in the Kitzbühel Alps between Zell am See and Innsbruck. It lies in the Leukental valley on the Kitzbüheler Ache river.
The town is subdivided into the municipalities of Am Horn, Aschbachbichl, Badhaussiedlung, Bichlach, Ecking, Felseneck, Griesenau, Griesenauweg, Gundhabing, Hagstein, Hausstatt, Henntal, Jodlfeld, Kaps, Mühlau, Obernau, Schattberg, Seereith, Siedlung Frieden, Am Sonnberg, Sonnenhoffeld, Staudach, Stockerdörfl and Zephirau.
The neighbouring municipalities are Aurach bei Kitzbühel, Jochberg, Kirchberg in Tirol, Oberndorf in Tirol, Reith bei Kitzbühel, St. Johann in Tirol and Fieberbrunn.
Kitzbühel's historic centre is mainly car-free and hosts a large selection of luxury shops, cafés and fine dining restaurants.

History
Earliest people
The first known settlers were Illyrians mining copper in the hills around Kitzbühel between 1100 and 800 BC.
Around 15 BC, the Romans under Emperor Augustus extended their empire to include the Alps and established the province of Noricum. After the fall of the western Roman Empire, Bavarii settled in the Kitzbühel region around 800 and started clearing forests.
Middle Ages
In the 12th century, the name Chizbuhel is mentioned for the first time in a document belonging to the Chiemsee monastery (where it refers to a "Marquard von Chizbuhel"), whereby Chizzo relates to a Bavarian clan and Bühel refers to the location of a settlement upon a hill. One hundred years later a source refers to the Vogtei of the Bamberg monastery in Kicemgespuchel and, in the 1271 document elevating the settlement to the status of a town, the place is called Chizzingenspuehel.
Kitzbühel became part of Upper Bavaria in 1255 when Bavaria was first partitioned. Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria granted Kitzbühel town rights on 6 June 1271, and it was fortified with defensive town walls. During the next centuries the town established itself as a market town, growing steadily and remaining unaffected by war and conflict. The town walls were eventually reduced to the level of a single storey building, and the stone used to build residential housing.
When Countess Margarete of Tyrol married the Bavarian, Duke Louis V the Brandenburger, in 1342, Kitzbühel was temporarily united with the County of Tyrol (that in turn became a Bavarian dominion as a result of the marriage until Louis' death). After the Peace of Schärding (1369) Kitzbühel was returned to Bavaria. Following the division of Bavaria, Kufstein went to the Landshut line of the House of Wittelsbach. During this time, silver and copper mining in Kitzbühel expanded steadily and comprehensive mining rights were issued to her that, later, were to become significant to the Bavarian dukedom. On 30 June 1504 Kitzbühel became a part of Tyrol permanently: the Emperor Maximilian reserved to himself the hitherto Landshut offices () of Kitzbühel, Kufstein and Rattenberg as a part of his Cologne Arbitration (), that had ended the Landshut War of Succession.
However ,the law of Louis of Bavaria continued to apply to the three aforementioned places until the 19th century, so that these towns had a special legal status within Tyrol. Maximilian enfeoffed Kitzbühel, with the result that it came under the rule of the Counts of Lamberg at the end of the 16th century, until 1 May 1840, when Kitzbühel was ceremonially transferred to the state.
An inscription in the Swedish Chapel dating to the Swedish War states ("The Swedish knights came as far as here but no further.")
18th century to modern day
The wars of the 18th and 19th century bypassed the town, even though its inhabitants participated in the Tyrolean Rebellion against Napoleon. Following the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, Kitzbühel once more became part of Bavaria; it was reunited with Tyrol after the fall of Napoleon at the Congress of Vienna. Until 1918, the town (named before 1895) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 in the Tyrol province.
When Emperor Franz Joseph finally resolved the confusing constitutional situation, and following completion of the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway in 1875, the town's trade and industry flourished. In 1894, Kitzbühel hosted its first ski race, ushering in a new era of tourism and sport.
Kitzbühel also had the good fortune to remain undamaged from the ravages of the First and Second World Wars.
Since the year 2000 the town has been a member of the Climate Alliance of Tyrol.
In October 2019, a 25-year-old man in Kitzbühel shot and killed his ex-girlfriend, her family, and her new boyfriend after a dispute at a restaurant.
The town's demographic evolution between 1869 and 2017 is shown in the list to the right.

Sport
Kitzbühel is one of Europe's best-known winter sports resorts, situated between the mountains Hahnenkamm adjacent to the southwest and to the northeast. The Hahnenkamm hosts the annual World Cup ski races, including the circuit's most notable single event, the downhill race on the notable Streif slope. Introduced in 1937, the northeast-facing Streif is among the world's toughest downhill courses, if not the most, and is infamous for an abundance of spectacular crashes. In 1959 the Austrian Alpine Ski Championships took place from 27 February to 1 March.
Each summer Kitzbühel also hosts an ATP tennis tournament on clay, the Austrian Open.
From 2007 to 2011, ITU Triathlon World Cup races took place at the local Schwarzsee lake.
The Kitzbüheler Alpenrallye is an annual festival of historic automobiles, first held in 1988. The first trip of the United Buddy Bears was 2004 to Kitzbühel, following by the first trip into the "big wide world" – when they went to Hong Kong and many other metropolises on all five continents.
Since 2003, Kitzbühel has been hosting an annual Snow Polo event in January.
Tourism
Together with the pistes and ski lifts in neighbouring Kirchberg in Tirol, Jochberg and by the Thurn Pass Kitzbühel is one of the largest ski regions in Austria. With around 10,000 hotel and guest house beds, Kitzbühel and its neighbours have an unusually high density of guest accommodation.
Holidaymakers in Kitzbühel have 56 cableway and lift facilities and 168 kilometres of slopes available to them, as well as 40 kilometres of groomed cross-country skiing tracks. Of note is the relatively new 3S Cable Car, the cable car with the highest above-ground span in the world.
In summer there are of mountain bike paths and of hiking trails.
Other attractions include six tennis courts and four golf courses, the Kitzbühel swimming pool, Austria's only curling hall and the bathing lake of Schwarzsee.
Kitzbühel primarily caters for the high end of the tourist market, as many celebrities and the jet set come here, especially during the international races on the Hahnenkamm.
Together with eleven other towns Kitzbühel is a member of the community Best of the Alps. KitzSki, Kitzbühel's main ski lift operator, has managed to defend the title of “World's Best Ski Resort Company” for the seventh time in a row at the 2020 World Ski Awards.

Pulse was an entertainment channel focusing on eSports as well as American extreme sports, classic films, and mixed martial arts; it was broadcast in the United Kingdom on British Sky Broadcasting. It ceased operation in March 2009.
Coverage of eSports
The channel was re-branded from XLEAGUE.TV, an eSports channel. Several time-shift channels were available during the time of air - Pulse +30, Pulse +45 and Pulse +1. Pulse +30mins was the first one to be closed down, on 24 November 2008. Pulse +1 was the second, which closed down on 9 November 2008 and was replaced with HiTV. Two days later on 11 November 2008, a second timeshift, Pulse +45mins, was closed down, which suddenly fell off the air. However, it did later return on 24 November 2008 after Pulse +30mins closed down. The Pulse +30mins EPG slot was replaced by OBE TV. Pulse was removed from the Sky EPG on 10 February 2009. Pulse +45mins was replaced by Rural TV on 2 March 2009.
It featured coverage of eSports and, in this respect, it differs from other examples of video game programming in the country, such as Cybernet, which had a broader remit, to cover video games in general. The channel is closely paired to its own self-titled website. The online resource encourages community discussion, while also serving as a platform to organise tournaments and invitational events, some of which may later be screened, on the channel, via its flagship programme, The Match.
While the televised matches regularly feature members of recognised, successful gaming clans such as Team Dignitas, and individual victors of major gaming tournaments including Shaun "Apollo" Clark. Xleague.tv also encourages enthusiasts and non-professionals to get involved in the community (and thus, potentially, The Match) through the game-specific clubs and leagues set up in a way that ensures that players of like strength compete together.
History
The channel started in May 2007 as X League.tv, but in February 2008, it was revealed that the channel had entered into an agreement with US men's entertainment channel MavTV, who had provided the niche sports content, and the channel would be re-branded as Pulse, which would be made up of separately branded XLEAGUE.TV and Mav blocks, with- according to Digital Spy- XLeague are in talks with other providers to provide further programming blocks.
On Monday 25 February 2008, the Xleague.tv channel was rebranded "Pulse". The channel still retains all the Xleague programmes and website, prior to the rebranding.
WebTV Beta
A YouTube-style section of the website that allows users to upload their videos. Its main focus is on Machinima, voice-over movies using video games to animate their scenes.

Svensk Luftrafik (SLA, SLAB, Svenska Lufttrafikbolaget) was a Swedish airline based in Stockholm. The company was founded on 7 February 1919, its first flight running on the 7 August 1920. Flight operations of the company were terminated in 1921,
SLAB operated air-mail services in co-operation with Deutsche Luft-Reederei, a Lufthansa precursor, and operated a regular passenger service Copenhagen–Malmö–Warnemünde. In 1921 the company built the Lindarängen seaplane airport (Lindarängens flyghamn) in Stockholm and started regular services to Reval, (later known as Tallinn, capital of Estonia) with a Junkers F.13 and two Savoia S-16 flying boats. The fleet also included 10 LVG C.VI aircraft from the German Luftverkehrsgesellschaft, of which only two remained airworthy after the liquidation of the company.
Lindarängen airport was sold to the City of Stockholm after the dissolution of Svensk Luftrafik in 1923 and remained in operation until 1952.
During the first half of 1920, the later German Nazi-Leader Hermann Göring was employed as a pilot with the company and on February 21, flew Count Eric von Rosen to his estate Rockelstad where Göring met his first wife, the Swedish national Carin von Kantzow.

Géza Révész (Siófok, Hungary, 9 December 1878 — Amsterdam, Netherlands, 19 August 1955) was a Hungarian-Dutch psychologist of Jewish heritage, and is regarded as one of the pioneers of European psychology.
Life
Révész was born in the Siófok, Hungary, a town located at Lake Balaton, where his father owned a famous vineyard. He studied law in Budapest and received his doctorate in 1902, when he finished his dissertation entitled Das Trauerjahr der Witwe.
Révész continued his studies at various German universities, including in Göttingen. While in Göttingen, he studied psychology with Georg Elias Müller, with whom he completed his doctorate and his thesis Über die vom Weiß ausgehende Schwächung der Wirksamkeit farbiger Lichtreize in 1905. During this time, Révész also became friends with phenomenological psychologists David Katz, Gustav Kafka and Edgar Rubin, who all played a role in the emergence of Gestalt psychology.
In 1906, Révész returned to Budapest, and went to work at the University of Budapest. He was assistant to the Austrian physiologist Franz Tangl. The late psychologist Imre Hermann was his assistant there. Révész worked at the university as an experimental psychologist. Initially, he was involved in the hearing. In 1913, he proposed observing pitches for a two-component model. From 1909 to 1915, he studied musical prodigy Ervin Nyiregyházi. Révész was also a professor of psychology during his time at the University of Budapest.
In 1920, at the invitation of Gerard Heymans, Révész left Hungary for the Netherlands. At the University of Amsterdam, he was appointed as private teacher and began his research into the sense of touch. Along with Philip Kohnstamm, Révész ran the psychological-pedagogical laboratory, but this did not last long due to lack of funds.
In 1932, Révész was awarded a full professorship in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Amsterdam. In that capacity, he was a promoter of Adriaan de Groot. With David Katz, Révész founded in 1935 the journal Acta Psychologica on. In 1933, he opened his own psychological laboratory, with 40 rooms and an auditorium, which was unprecedented at that time in Europe. He worked there with Philip Kohnstamm, with whom he fled the Netherlands in 1938 because the growing situation in Germany.
Révész died at the age of 76 in Amsterdam. His work on the psychology of music is still relevant today. The filmmaker/photographer Emile Moerkerken was a staunch supporter of Révész.

Subinvolution is a medical condition in which after childbirth, the uterus does not return to its normal size.
Presentation
Symptoms
The condition may be asymptomatic. The predominant symptoms are:
Abnormal lochial discharge either excessive or prolonged
Irregular or at times excessive uterine bleeding
Irregular cramp like pain is cases of retained products or rise of temperature in sepsis
Signs
The uterine height is greater than the normal for the particular day of puerperium. Normal puerperal uterus may be displaced by a full bladder or a loaded rectum. It feels boggy and softer upon palpation.
Presence of features responsible for subinvolution may be evident.
Causes
Predisposing factors
Grand multiparity
Overdistension of uterus as in twins and hydramnios
Ill maternal health
Caesarean section
Uterine prolapse
Retroversion after the uterus becomes pelvic organ
Uterine fibroid
Aggravating factors
Retained products of conception
Uterine sepsis, endometritis
Factors
Persistent lochia/fresh bleeding
Long labor
Anesthesia
Full bladder
Difficult delivery
Retained placenta
Maternal infection
Diagnosis
Definition
When the involution is impaired or retarded it is called subinvolution. The uterus is the most common organ affected by subinvolution. As it is the most accessible organ to be measured per abdomen, the uterine involution is considered clinically as an index to assess subinvolution.
Management
Antibiotics in endometritis
Exploration of the uterus in retained products
Pessary in prolapse or retroversion.
Ergometrine so often prescribed to enhance the involution process by reducing the blood flow of the uterus is of no value in prophylaxis.

Joseph Jiel-Laval, real name: Joseph Marie François Laval or Pierre-Joseph Laval, (26 November 1855 – 26 February 1917) was a French cyclist.
Life
Jiel-Laval grew up in Angers. His rode his first race in 1876 on a Penny-farthing for the Véloce-Club d'Angers. The following year he settled in Bordeaux and opened a bicycle shop, initially called Vélocipèdes Jiel-Laval, later Cycles Jiel-Laval. The nickname Jiel originated from the initials of his name Joseph Laval. In Bordeaux he founded the Veloce Club Bordelais and was one of the founders of the Ligue française d'éducation physique. In France, he was one of the most prominent cyclists.
In May 1891, Jiel-Laval finished fifth at the first edition of Bordeaux-Paris. On 6 September of the same year he started on a Clément bicycle at the first edition of the 1200-kilometer race Paris-Brest-Paris. First, he led an hour ahead of Charles Terront, but could not hold this because he had to take a break due to exhaustion. Terront's manager H.O. Duncan, however, instructed his rider to drive around the hotel where Jiel-Laval was sleeping in order not to be seen by his companions. When Jiel-Laval woke up, he learned that Terront was two hours ahead of him. Charles Terront ended up winning in 71 hours and 37 minutes, Jiel-Laval finishing second in 80 hours four minutes.
Jiel-Laval died in 1917 at the age of 61. The funeral speech at the funeral was held by well-known journalist Maurice Martin. A year later, his widow left the bike on which her husband lost Paris-Brest-Paris to the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The city of Bordeaux named the Rue Jiel Laval after him.

The British Stammering Association (BSA), trading as STAMMA since 2019, is a national membership organisation in the United Kingdom for adults and children who stammer, their friends and families, speech and language therapists and other professionals. It became a charity in 1978 and is based in London. The mission of the charity is to support anyone who stammers in the UK and tackle the stigma, ignorance and discrimination that people who stammer face so that they can live their lives in full and with dignity. It describes stammering as a neurological condition and estimates that up to 3% of adults in the UK have a stammer.
Organisation
The association's chief executive, since June 2018, is Jane Powell. The chair, since 2021, is Joanna Gaukroger.
President and patrons
The organisation's president was Brian Dodsworth, who died in 2021.
Stamma's patrons are: broadcaster and former MP Ed Balls, former Scotland international rugby captain Kelly Brown, author Jonty Claypole, Dame Margaret Drabble DBE, former MP and MSP John McAllion, David Mitchell, author of Black Swan Green, actor, rapper and podcaster Scroobius Pip, Arwel Richards, novelist, poet, playwright and presenter Owen Sheers, Jon Smith and Baroness Whitaker.
Previous patrons have included Nicholas Parsons CBE and Jonathan Miller, both now deceased.
International links
The British Stammering Association is a member of the European League of Stuttering Associations and the International Stuttering Association. At its World Congress in Brazil, the International Fluency Association awarded the IFA Consumer Award of Distinction 2009 to the British Stammering Association.
Scotland
The association had a Scottish branch, BSA Scotland, which was founded in 2004 and is now closed. It was a focus for Scottish campaigns, events and support services as well as to engage with the Scottish Parliament.
Advice, information and support
The association operates a helpline, webchat and email support service, and offers information leaflets for parents of children under 5, primary and secondary school children, young adults and adults who is a stammer and teachers. It can also signpost callers to their local NHS Speech and Language Therapy Service. Those who stammer can also use the helpline to practise phone conversations or share how they are feeling.
Research and publications
Between 2004 and 2005 the association published a research journal, Stammering Research, which was edited by Professor Peter Howell of University College London. In 2010 the association produced research showing that children with signs of stammering are more likely to overcome the problem if they receive help before they reach school age.
The Association produces a variety of information resources.
The British Stammering Association published a magazine, Speaking Out, which ended in 2014. The spring 2011 issue included an article in which BSA member Richard Oerton recalled his own experiences with King George VI's speech therapist Lionel Logue who is featured in the film The King's Speech. An interview with Neil Swain, voice coach for the film, was published in the summer 2011 issue. The spring/summer 2012 issue included an interview with the actor Charles Edwards, who played George VI in the West End stage version of the film.
Campaigns
The association has campaigned for several years to eradicate misleading advertising claims made by stammering treatment providers. Some claim, for example, that they can "cure" stammering − but it is not possible to "cure" a stammer, in the accepted medical sense of the word. Accordingly, the BSA believes such claims not only give false hope to those who stammer − but also give people who don't stammer the false impression that stammering can easily be rectified. Respectable healthcare companies carry out independent trials on large numbers of people, over long periods of time, before claiming any benefit for their products or services. The campaign has been conducted by, firstly, encouraging treatment providers who are making doubtful claims to provide supporting data and, if they cannot do so, to moderate those claims; and, secondly, in cases where the treatment provider has not co-operated, the association has reported their advertisements to the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), who have investigated the claims and, if they prove to be unsupportable, have instructed them to remove the offending advertisement and amend any future claims. As from 1 March 2011, the ASA, and thus the association, have also been able to act against misleading claims made in editorial copy on websites. Following a complaint by the association, on 13 July 2011 the Advertising Standards Authority issued an adjudication against a website which said: "Discover how to stop stuttering with stammering cure that works".
BSA's then chief executive Norbert Lieckfeldt, who has described stammering as "the hidden disability", said the charity had received calls from members who said people were asking them about their stammer for the first time, because of The King's Speech. The film had created a "good opportunity" for people to talk about stammering. He said: "Suddenly it has become a thing that can be talked about, which is very important for us...For those people who are engaged in conversations about it, their situation will have changed for the better."
The association criticised comedian Lenny Henry for his opening sketch for the 2011 Comic Relief, during which he spoofed the film and grew impatient with Colin Firth's portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech.
In 2007 the association's then chair, Leys Geddes, strongly protested to the YouTube website about their classifying, as comedy, videos showing people struggling to speak, including three which he said appeared to be "malicious and stereotypical". YouTube replied that the videos did not violate its terms of use. Geddes has now posted his own video on YouTube, arguing for greater understanding for those who stammer. Speaking in support of the association's stance, Labour MP Kate Hoey said: "For many people, particularly youngsters, stammering is not a joke – we need to ensure that help and support is given as early as possible and, most of all, we need to educate the public to understand the impact it has on people for the whole of their lives".
In May 2012, the association criticised a headline and story on the front page of The Sun mocking newly appointed England football manager Roy Hodgson's rhotacism.
Commenting on the media coverage of Ed Balls' stumbling over his response in the House of Commons on 5 December 2012 to the Autumn Statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Norbert Lieckfeldt said: "The experience of a lifetime of stammering gives an edge to a personality, something to rub against, and I'd prefer that over smooth glibness any day. This is also the advice we at the British Stammering Association would give to anyone who stammers who is considering a career in politics".
Under the new leadership of Jane Powell, the charity launched a major new campaign, STAMMA, in 2019 which aimed to give the public an insight into what it means to stammer, dispel stereotypes and encourage people to take stammering seriously. To coincide with International Stammering Awareness Day on 22 October 2019 a nationwide advertising campaign was launched, with STAMMA being promoted on outdoor advertising spaces across the UK.
Employers Stammering Network
Launched on 9 May 2013 with a reception in the House of Commons hosted by The Rt Hon Ed Balls (who was then an MP), the Employers Stammering Network, an initiative of the BSA and employers, aims to create a culture where people who stammer can achieve their full potential. In 2018, leading members with their own active networks included the Civil Service, the Defence Stammering Network and EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young). As the initiative matured, the Employers Stammering Network was in contact with supporters in some 150 organisations and over 50 change-makers in a range of work settings.
Find The Right Words
The "Find The Right Words" campaign was created by VMLY&R for Stamma, and launched in October 2020. It highlights the problems caused by negative language used in relation to stammering and asks people to change perceptions of those who stammer.
Articles on the English-language Wikipedia featuring famous or notable people who stammer or stammered were reviewed, and edited by members of STAMMA to correct information that failed to adhere to a neutral point of view.
The campaign includes digital advertising and a social media activity, and a video narrated by one of the charity's patrons, Scroobius Pip, who said:
Apple's "woozy face" emoji
Early in June 2021, STAMMA investigated instances where, when the word "stammering" was typed into certain Apple devices, the "woozy face" emoji was suggested, causing offence to many in the stammering community. The woozy face emoji, with a wavy mouth and a closed eye, was added to Apple's roster in 2018 and is supposed to depict being drunk, dazed, infatuated, or tired and emotional.
STAMMA logged a complaint with Apple on 16 June and asked for a response, pointing out that stammering can be seen as a disability under the Equalities Act 2010, as for many people it can severely impair day-to-day functions and for adults is lifelong. As such, the linkage between stammering and the woozy face emoji could constitute harassment under the Equalities Act.
STAMMA issued a press release in which its CEO, Jane Powel,l stated: "This is demeaning and damaging. Stammering is how some people talk. Treating it as a joke is stigmatising. It can leave people embarrassed about how they sound, bullied and ashamed which can affect their mental health, careers and relationships."
It was picked up by the Metro newspaper in the UK, as well as bplatforms which covered Apple internationally. STAMMA were contacted by supporters around the world and worked with the International Stuttering Association and VivaVoce Assoziatione in Italy, plotting a coordinated international campaign, with a petition on change.org.
On 2 July 2021, STAMMA received word that Apple had released iOS update 14.7, which stopped the woozy face emoji from appearing when typing the word stammering. STAMMA are still waiting for a formal response from Apple.
No Diversity Without Disfluency
STAMMA started a campaign in October 2021 to get more people who stammer on TV, radio and film. They set up a change.org petition at www.stamma.org/petition which to date has received over 20,000 signatures. It is currently working with stammering associations in the US and Australia to adopt the campaign in their territories. The campaign was picked up by Ofcom, who said, "We applaud the work to raise awareness of stammering and encourage broadcasters to take notice".

Stephen (often rendered as Latin Stephanus) Kim Sou-hwan (; May 8, 1922 – February 16, 2009) was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and the former archbishop of Seoul, South Korea. Having been an iconic figure in South Korea's bloody and tumultuous transition from military rule to democracy, he was widely respected across all sections in South Korean society.
Early years
He was born in Daegu, modern-day South Korea, and attended high school in Seoul. He studied philosophy at Sophia University in Tokyo from 1941 to 1944, and at Catholic University of Korea in Seoul from 1947 to 1951, when he graduated. After serving briefly as a parish priest in Andong and then as a secretary in the Archdiocese of Daegu, he traveled to Germany to study sociology at Münster University from 1956 to 1963.
Career
Kim was raised to the rank of cardinal-priest of San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle by Pope Paul VI in the consistory of April 28, 1969, having become the archbishop of Seoul in 1968 after being the bishop of Masan since 1966. At the age of 46, he was the youngest member of the College of Cardinals at that time. He received the Mugunghwa medal in 1970, and participated in the two conclaves of 1978.
During Park Chung-hee and his successor's military dictatorship of the '70s and the '80s, the Korean Catholic Church under Kim's leadership was highlighted as a focal point of South Korea's democratization movement.
In 1998, Cardinal Kim retired as the archbishop of Seoul, shortly after serving as president-delegate of the Special Assembly for Asia of the World Synod of Bishops. On the death of Franz Koenig in 2004, he became the senior member of the college in terms of service, as he was the first of the three surviving members elevated in 1969 on the list of that consistory. However, Kim was ill at the time, and in the ceremonies of the sede vacante on the death of Pope John Paul II, the duties of protopresbyter (senior cardinal priest) were instead carried out by Eugenio de Araujo Sales, another 1969 cardinal who was Kim's junior as cardinal but senior as a priest and as a bishop.
Having reached the age of 80 in 2002, he did not participate in the ensuing conclave as he was no longer eligible to vote in papal elections. Cardinal Kim did arrive for the papal inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI and there he did discharge the duties of the cardinal protopresbyter.
Death
From 2007, Kim's health gradually deteriorated, and he was seldom seen in public, the last time being the 2008 Christmas Midnight Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral. He died in Seoul on February 16, 2009, from respiratory problems. During a four-day lying in state period some 400,000 Catholic mourners were said to have filed past his coffin in the city's Myeongdong Cathedral. He was buried on February 20. As per his will, he donated his organs, and the Cardinal's eyes were quickly used in two successful cornea transplants.

The Irish Museums Association (IMA) is an all-Ireland professional membership body dedicated to the promotion and development of museums.
History
The Irish Museums Association grew out of the Ireland branch of the International Council of Museums in 1977, established by a voluntary executive committee led by James White, director of the National Gallery of Ireland (1964–80), to protect the interests of Irish museums. In 2004, it registered as a operating as a non-profit company limited by guarantee and hired its first member of staff. Dr Audrey Whitty, head of collections and learning at National Museum of Ireland is the current chair of the governing board of directors, replacing William Blair, director of collections at National Museums NI in 2020. Former chairs also include Brian Crowley, museum curator at Kilmainham Gaol (2013-2017), Paul Doyle, registrar at National Museum of Ireland (2011-2013) and Dr Marie Bourke, keeper and head of education at National Gallery of Ireland (2006-2011).

MultiClet is an ongoing innovation project for a microprocessor that claims to be the first post von Neumann, multicellular microprocessor, breaking the paradigm for computing technology that has been in place for more than 60 years. There have been attempts in the past to shift away from the von Neumann architecture. Under MultiClet a 4-cellular dynamically reconfigurable microprocessor is implemented.
History
In April 2013, the Russian company Sputnix signed an agreement for joint development of the MultiClet microprocessor.
In January 2014, an announcement is made that the FreeRTOS operating system has been ported to the MultiClet microprocessor, this demonstrates that the microprocessor potentially can perform tasks that makes it suitable for real products.
In April 2014, the Kickstarter project Key_P1 MultiClet: Your Powerful Digital Guardian, failed to raise sufficient funding.
Since June 2014, the MultiClet microprocessor is reportedly under test in real space conditions onboard Sputnix's microsatellite TabletSat-Aurora.
In March 2014, Multiclet present first multicellular dynamically reconfigurable microprocessor in Inatronics 2014.
Financing
Since 2004 more than 300 million roubles has been provided for the project by the Danish venture fund Symbion Capital and the Bortnik Fund. In 2009 there was an unsuccessful request for co-financing by Rusnano. In 2010 it was reported that more than 1 billion roubles would be needed in total before any actual production could take place. In 2011 the MultiClet company, currently responsible for the development of the microprocessor was founded with a capital of 323 million roubles.
In August 2014, a financial request for 80 million US dollars from the Russian-Chinese Investment Fund (RKIF) was made in order to develop a MultiClet based computer.
Technical concept
As opposed to the traditional multi-core processor architecture each individual cell in the microprocessor can communicate with each other, without the need to store intermediate results in memory registers. This removes the concept of assembly language instructions with sequential dependence, in favor of realizing a high level programming language directly on the computer hardware. The smallest indivisible unit is a set of instructions described in the triadic language. Each triad can describe an operation between references to other triads, rather than references to the current contents in memory registers. The result of the sequence of triads is evaluated when selected, e.g. when an operation to write the result to a memory register is issued.
Potential benefits
The multicellular microprocessor architecture makes it easier to perform parallel execution because the need to access intermediate memory for each operation is eliminated, thus each cell can operate independently until the result is needed. The microprocessor can operate with reduced performance if one or more of the microprocessor cells become non-functioning. The dynamic reconfiguration of the microprocessor, in case of permanent failures makes it ideal for operation under harsh conditions such as in space applications.
Realization of all operations within each statement, without memory involvement improves computing power by 4–5 times and reduces the microprocessor energy consumption by up to 10 times.
Criticism
July, 2012, a critical view was posted on a forum which discusses potential challenges related to scaling of the technology. The main obstacle would be the high level of communication required between the different cells of the multicellular architecture and its implementation using CMOS semiconductor process technology below 180 nanometers.

Mong Ton Township or Mong Tong Township is a township of Mongsat District in the Eastern Shan State of Myanmar. The capital town is Mong Ton. It borders Mong Pying Township to the north, Mong Hsat Township to the east, Mong Nai Township and Mong Pan Township to the west and Thailand to the south. Loi Hkilek mountain is located in the area. It has two townships. They are Pone Par Khem, and Mong Hta. At Mong Ton township, live in Shan, Lahu, Lisu, Wa, Burma, and Chinese.
Recent history
Given its location near the border with Thailand and internal conflict, the Burmese army has the important IB277 military base just outside the main town. There are five Burmese army battalions in Mong Ton town alone. Trafficking of narcotics is a major problem in Mong Ton and Burma is the number two opium producer in the world after Afghanistan, and one of the leading producers of amphetamines in South East Asia. The Free Burma Rangers have alleged that the army is involved in the production and trafficking of narcotics in order to profit from the trade in opium, heroin and amphetamines. Opium is cultivated and it is not only processed for trade abroad it is also consumed by some local villagers and has created drug addiction problems.
Mong Ton has had a turbulent and unstable history, with conflicts between the Shan State Army-South (SSA-S) and the Burmese Army, although the problem is worse in the Kyethi, Mong Kung, and Laihka Townships. In Mong Ton and Mong Hsat Township, the SPDC has demanded the removal of some UWSA military outposts and the Burmese Army is exerting more pressure on Lahu militias to conscript more soldiers and prepare to fight both the SSA–S and the UWSA. The SPDC supported three basic military training courses for the Lahu militia in Mong Ton during 2009.

The Absalom was a wooden ketch that was wrecked at the Macleay River bar at Trial Bay, New South Wales in 1863.
History
The Absalom was built for the timber trade, and W. Pickett was to be her commander. She spent the early years of her career traveling to the Shoalhaven. By 1857 she had moved to include Wollongong. She spent much of 1858 traveling to Brisbane Water.
During 1861 she made trips to the Shoalhaven and Moruya River. During one of these trips, she came across two crew members of the Cambrian Packet, which had sunk in a squall off Port Aiken. The ship's master, Edward Jones, and a seaman named Dalton kept themselves afloat for over an hour before they were rescued by the Absalom, which returned them both to Sydney.
Wreck
By 1862, the Absalom was trading in the Macleay River, with J Fraser as master. On 29 March 1863, she was attempting to beat out of the river, but missed stays and ran upon the South Spit at the Heads, and in a few minutes went to pieces. Mr McKenzie, the pilot of the area, was quickly in his boat, and rendered all the assistance that could be given. All hands were saved, but the vessel and cargo, consisting of more than six hundred bushels of maize, were totally lost.
The crew were returned to Sydney by the Woolloomooloo. The Absalom was uninsured, and belonged to Mr J Hubbard.

The 2023 Castilian-Manchegan regional election will be held on Sunday, 28 May 2023, to elect the 11th Cortes of the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha. All 33 seats in the Cortes will be up for election. The election will be held simultaneously with regional elections in at least seven other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.
Overview
Electoral system
The Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha are the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Castilian-Manchegan Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president.
Voting for the Cortes is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over 18 years of age, registered in Castilla–La Mancha and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Castilian-Manchegan people abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as "begged" or expat vote (). The 33 members of the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which includes blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats are allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara and Toledo, with each being allocated an initial minimum of three seats and the remaining 18 being distributed in proportion to their populations.
The use of the D'Hondt method may result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude.
Election date
The term of the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha expires four years after the date of their previous election. Elections to the Cortes are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, setting the election date for the Cortes on Sunday, 28 May 2023.
The president has the prerogative to dissolve the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements are met: namely, that dissolution occur neither during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances will not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remains of their four-year terms. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the candidate from the party with the highest number of seats is to be deemed automatically elected.
Parliamentary composition
The table below shows the composition of the parliamentary groups in the Cortes at the present time.
Parties and candidates
The electoral law allows for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.
Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which will likely contest the election:
Opinion polls
The tables below list opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll.
Voting intention estimates
The table below lists weighted voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of "don't know" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 17 seats are required for an absolute majority in the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha.
Voting preferences
The table below lists raw, unweighted voting preferences.
Victory likelihood

Alexander Stewart (c. 13751435) was a Scottish nobleman, Earl of Mar from 1404. He acquired the earldom through marriage to the hereditary countess, and successfully ruled the northern part of Scotland.
Biography
He was an illegitimate son of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, known as the Wolf of Badenoch, and probably Mairead inghean Eachainn.
Alexander held the Earldom of Mar and the Lordship of the Garioch jure uxoris, in right of his first wife Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar (died 1408). Alexander's marriage to Isabella followed his capture of Kildrummy Castle, and Isabella with it, in 1404 after having attacked her husband, Sir Malcolm Drummond, brother-in-law of King Robert III, holding Sir Malcolm captive where he died. Thus, Isabel was forced to marry the man who murdered her husband and live the last four years of her life as a captive. Alexander forced her to execute a charter (12 August) settling the reversion to the earldom on himself and his heirs. This act she is believed to have revoked in September, but on marrying him, on 9 December 1404, she granted him the earldom for life, the king confirming this on 21 June 1405. These events shocked the kingdom and Alexander only escaped punishment because he was a close relation to the Royal Family. His possession of the Earldom was later regularized in 1424 by grant of his cousin, King James I.
He was a strong supporter of his uncle, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, who was then ruler of the kingdom as regent for his brother King Robert III of Scotland. Robert had been badly injured when he was kicked by his horse. Alexander led the so-called "Lowland" army, in fact that of the north-east and eastern Highlands, against Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles, at the bloody and indecisive Battle of Harlaw in 1411, which Domhnall fought to gain his inheritance to the Earldom of Ross.
Unlike his father, who had been unable to keep the peace in the fractious north-east, Alexander, Walter Bower says, "ruled with acceptance nearly all of the north of the country beyond the Mounth". He achieved this not by using different methods from his father but by his ability to keep his cateran forces in check and to use them to protect his extensive lands when needed; the result was that the lowland areas of Aberdeenshire and Moray were protected.
Alexander sat on the jury of 21 knights and peers that convicted his first cousin, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, and two of his sons of treason in 1424, leading to their execution and the virtual annihilation of the Stewarts of Albany.
Marriages and children
Alexander's first marriage was to Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar (died 1408). Mar had seized his title by forced marriage to the countess following his capture of Kildrummy Castle in Aberdeenshire in 1404. These events shocked the kingdom and Alexander only escaped punishment because he was a close relation to the Royal Family. His possession of the Earldom was later regularized in 1424 by grant of his cousin, King James I.
Alexander later married Marie van Hoorn, daughter of Willem, Lord of Duffel, in 1410. He died without a legitimate male heir and so the Earldom of Mar reverted to the crown.
He had two illegitimate children:
Thomas, who married Elizabeth, the widow of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan, who was daughter of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas and Margaret Stewart, Lady of Galloway
Margaret, who married Lachlan Maclean of Duart.

The Honeywell Center in downtown Wabash, Indiana, United States, is located southwest of Fort Wayne, Indiana. It's a block-long arts complex featuring the Ford Theater, Clark Gallery, and Eugenia's Restaurant. The Ford Theater presents Broadway, rock, country, classical, and comedy performances.
The Honeywell Center is operated by The Honeywell Foundation, Inc. The foundation was established in 1941 by Wabash native Mark C. Honeywell - a developer of the thermostat and automatic controls for heating systems.
Building of the Center began in 1940 but was delayed until 1952 due to the shortage of labor and materials needed for World War II. The Center's gymnasium was informally opened November 19, 1947; however, the entire facility was completed in 1952 and included a roller rink and several meeting spaces.
In 1994, a addition expanded the Honeywell Center to include the 1,500-seat Ford Theater, Eugenia's Restaurant and an art gallery. The Center has 14 rooms, for parties between eight and 1,500 people.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The Hotel Turkey is a historic hotel located in Turkey, Texas, United States that originally opened in 1927. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 1991.
The two-story reddish-brown brick prairie school designed structure was built by H. B. Jordan to take advantage of the extension of the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway to the town of Turkey. On June 12, 1927 the building was partially complete when a tornado leveled it. Construction resumed shortly thereafter, and Hotel Turkey opened for business in November 1927.
The hotel was located just three blocks from the train depot and provided a meeting room to the traveling salesmen of the day to display their wares to the townspeople. The hotel also became a social center for the community as dances, banquets, and meetings of social and civic organizations took place in the dining room and lobby.
The building has had several owners through the years but has operated continuously since it opened. In September 1988, Scott and Jane Johnson purchased and renovated Hotel Turkey. The hotel then had 14 patriotic, western or movie themed rooms such as the Gone With the Wind suite.
In July 2015, the Hotel Turkey was purchased and re-established by Pat and Tina Carson of Turkey. They have made numerous renovations and continue to do so.
The hotel traditionally hosts the musicians who come to Turkey for the annual Bob Wills Day celebration on the last Saturday in April. George W. Bush, while still governor of Texas, once stayed at the hotel.

HMC Sentinel was a patrol ship operated by the Border Force in the role of patrolling the waters of the United Kingdom. It is a Vosper Thornycroft 'Island Class' vessel and was commissioned in 1993.
History
HMC Sentinel entered service in 1993 with what was then HM Customs and Excise (HMCE). HMCE merged with the Inland Revenue in 2005, and the cutter fleet became part of the newly founded HM Revenue and Customs. In 2008, the fleet transferred to the UK Border Agency and then to UK Border Force, both established to maintain the UK border, and it operated as the oldest vessel in the UK Border Force's fleet of five cutters. HMC Sentinel was decommissioned July 2013 in Portsmouth, Hampshire. She was offered for sale in 2015 and has now been sold (2018). Currently listed as a private vessel registered in Mongolia and was seen in Plymouth, Devon, on the
19 October 2018 flying the Mongolian flag.
Prefix
From the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise into HM Revenue and Customs on 18 April 2005, customs cutters changed their prefix from "HMRC" (Her Majesty's Revenue Cutter) to "HMCC" (Her Majesty's Customs Cutter). Following the transfer to the UK Border Agency this was shortened to the present "HMC" (Her Majesty's Cutter) and a new livery was applied to the fleet.
Propulsion
The cutter is fitted with twin Caterpillar diesel engines (Caterpillar 3516B DI-TA elec Diesel Engines 4,176 kW; 5,600 hp) and a Perkins CV8M600 Diesel Engine.

Ulisses Soares (born 2 October 1958) is a Brazilian religious leader and former businessman who serves as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He has been a general authority since 2005 and served as a member of the church's Presidency of the Seventy from January 2013 until his calling to the Quorum of the Twelve in March 2018. He is the LDS Church's first apostle from South America. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Soares is accepted by the LDS Church as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Currently, he is the junior and fifteenth most senior apostle in the church.
Early life and education
Soares was born in São Paulo, Brazil, the son of Apparecido Soares and Mercedes Carecho Soares. He is of Amerindian and European descent. His family joined the LDS Church when he was six, after learning of the church from an aunt who had joined. The LDS branch they first attended met in a rented space above a bakery, and Soares has spoken of fond memories of the smells of baking bread wafting into sacrament meeting. Soares was baptized at age eight. Soares was present at a meeting in 1966 when the LDS Church's first stake, both in Brazil and in South America, was organized. Soares was called as a youth Sunday School teacher by his bishop when he was 15-years-old.
For three years prior to his mission, Soares worked in both the payroll accounting departments of a company to save money to serve as a missionary. He attended evening classes in an accounting high school during this same time. Beginning in early 1978, Soares then served as an LDS Church missionary in the Brazil Rio de Janeiro Mission. The mission then included all of Brazil north and west of Rio de Janeiro, including Fortaleza where Soares would later dedicate a temple. His mission president was Helio da Rocha Camargo. When Soares began his mission there was no temple in Latin America. When a temple in São Paulo was dedicated in late 1978, Soares was given permission to leave the mission and to receive his temple ordinances, including the endowment, in January 1980.
Soares was educated in Brazil, receiving a bachelor's degree in accounting and economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo in 1985. He also received an MBA from the National Institute of Postgraduate Study.
Career
Prior to being called as a general authority, Soares was employed as the director of temporal affairs for the LDS Church's Brazil South Area. At the time of his call as a general authority, he was working on a special assignment for the church's Presiding Bishopric in Salt Lake City. He had worked for Pirelli Tire Company and other multi-national corporations as an auditor and accountant. He was convinced by Donald L. Clark to take a job as a senior auditor for the church. After Clark was appointed as a mission president, Soares replaced him as director of temporal affairs.
LDS Church service
Soares has served in the LDS Church as an elders quorum president, counselor in a bishopric, member of a stake high council and regional welfare agent. In 1995, Soares was appointed the first president of the São Paulo Brazil Cotia Stake. Soares served as president of the Portugal Porto Mission from 2000 to 2003.
General authority seventy
In 2005, Soares became a member of the LDS Church's First Quorum of the Seventy. In his first talk at a general conference in October 2005 he emphasized that the gospel is about people not programs. He has served as a counselor and as president of the church's Brazil South Area and as a counselor in the Africa Southeast Area. While in the later position, he lived in South Africa and oversaw church operations in about 20 African nations, including Mozambique and Angola with their officially Portuguese speaking status. On 6 January 2013, Soares became a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, replacing Walter F. González. In that capacity, Soares had responsibility for the church's North America Southeast Area, along with the Idaho and North America Central areas. While serving in that assignment, Soares participated in the dedications of the Meridian Idaho, Fort Collins Colorado, and Star Valley Wyoming temples. In September 2017, Soares accompanied Neil L. Andersen to organize the church's 100th stake in the Philippines.
Quorum of the Twelve
On 31 March 2018, Soares was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He and Gerrit W. Gong were sustained to fill the vacancies created from the deaths of Thomas S. Monson and Robert D. Hales. He was widely reported as one of the first two "non-white" members of the Quorum of the Twelve and first Latino apostle. The appointments of Soares and Gong was called the church leadership's "most significant nod to global diversity since the 1978 revelation on the priesthood" by LDS studies scholar Patrick Q. Mason. Marcus Martins, an LDS expert in sociology and a native of Brazil, said that the call of Soares showcased the potential for international service of many Brazilian members of the LDS Church.
The first major tour Soares did as an apostle was to multiple countries in western Africa. He traveled with Neil L. Andersen, and their wives, to Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, and the Ivory Coast. As of June 2018, he is assigned to serve on the church's missionary executive council. He is also serving as a member of the church's human resources committee and as the apostle with responsibility for the church's Africa West and Central America areas.
In 2019, Soares dedicated the church's Fortaleza Brazil Temple in June and the Arequipa Peru Temple in December. Also in December 2019, Soares was a speaker at the First Presidency Christmas Devotional. Along with all members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, he participated in the dedication of the Rome Italy Temple in March 2019, along with accompanying Dallin H. Oaks in the dedication of the Barranquilla Colombia Temple in December 2018. Also in 2019, Soares visited an immigrant welcome center and the Texas Central Foodbank to review the operation aid being given by the church and to show general support. In September 2019, Soares presided at a "Face to Face" worldwide broadcast for young adults, along with Craig C. Christensen, a general authority seventy. The event originated from the campus of Brigham Young University, with questions answered in Spanish, Portuguese, and English to generate international participation in the event. This was the church's first worldwide broadcast which originated using multiple languages.
In February 2020, Soares did a multi-country ministry tour of Central America, during which he visited the president of Guatemala and the leader of Costa Rica's legislature.
In July 2020, Soares spoke in the church's first Youth Music Festival.As of October 2020, Soares is serving as an advisor to the committee working on revising the church's hymn and children's song books.
In February 2021, Soares participated in the church's first ever worldwide broadcast to Primary children. In March 2022, he and his wife participated in Family Discovery Day, part of the church's annual RootsTech conference, to share their life stories, family history, and the history of the church in Brazil.
Personal life
Soares married Rosana Fernandes Morgado in the São Paulo Brazil Temple in October 1982. They served as missionaries in the Brazil Rio de Janeiro Mission at the same time, but did not meet until they were both at a stake dance in São Paulo. They have three children.

Omega (originally, Delerium Tremens) was a former settlement in Nevada County, California, United States, first populated in 1850 by a single miner, J.A. Dixon, working a claim during the California Gold Rush. The town was located east-southeast of the present-day unincorporated town of Washington, California. A sister town, Alpha, located at what is now the site of the historical Omega Hydraulic Diggings, was about north of Omega. In the mid 1850s, following the introduction of hydraulic mining operations nearby, the town prospered. Omega had a post office (which operated from 1857 to 1891), and needed to convert a residence into a jail in late 1858.

AGS‑40 Balkan is a Russian 40 mm caseless automatic grenade launcher and successor to AGS-17 and AGS-30, introduced and adopted by the Russian military.
Design
The AGS-40 uses 40 mm CL (caseless) grenades with a range of 2,500 m (compared to the 30 mm grenades with range 1,700 for AGS-17 and 2,100 for AGS-30) and a rate of fire of 400 rounds per minute, with short burst (5 rounds), long burst (10 rounds), and continuous fire modes. The weapon is usually equipped with a tripod and a PAG-17 2.7× telescopic sight; it can also have back-up iron sights installed.
A unique feature of the AGS-40 is a detachable seat that allows for more stable shooting using the weight of an operator.
Ammunition
Caseless high-explosive-fragmentation 40 mm 7P39 grenades.
7P39P and 7P39U practice rounds
Development
Development of the AGS-40 started in 1980 but stalled after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the subsequent economic decline in Russia. However, the project was revived in the early 1990s under the codename "Balkan", and was put into operational evaluation in 2018. State tests have been successfully completed and the weapon has been recommended for introduction into service as of March 2021. The first serial batch was delivered in January 2022.
AGS-40 can be installed on armored vehicles. The AGS-40 can be integrated with Kalashnikov MBDU remote weapon station.

Jean Price-Mars (15 October 1876 – 1 March 1969) was a Haitian doctor, teacher, politician, diplomat, writer, and ethnographer. Price-Mars served as secretary of the Haitian legation in Washington, D.C. (1909) and as chargé d'affaires in Paris (1915–1917), during the initial years of the United States occupation of Haiti.
In 1922, Price-Mars completed medical studies which he had given up for lack of a scholarship.
After withdrawing as a candidate for the presidency of Haiti in favor of Stenio Vincent in 1930, Price-Mars led Senate opposition to the new president; he was forced out of politics. In 1941, Price-Mars was again elected to the Senate. He was secretary of state for external relations in 1946 and, later, ambassador to the Dominican Republic. In his eighties, he continued service as Haitian ambassador at the United Nations and ambassador to France.
Négritude movement
Price-Mars championed Négritude in Haiti through his writing, which "discovered" and embraced the African roots of Haitian society. Price-Mars was the first prominent defender of vodou as a full religion complete with "deities, a priesthood, a theology, and morality." He argued against the prevailing prejudice and ideology which favored European cultures from the colonial period and rejected non-white, non-Western, elements of the cultures of the Americas. His nationalism embraced a Haitian cultural identity as African through slavery.
Price-Mars' attitude was inspired by the active resistance by Haitian peasants to the 1915 through 1934 United States occupation. He deplored the elite's abandonment of the tradition that had emphasized the nation's achieving independence from French colonialism, but he took pride in the conduct of the poor. He attacked the elite for their "inability to promote the welfare of the Haitian masses."
Collective Bovarysme
He coined the term collective bovarysme to describe the elite as identifying with their partial European ancestry while denouncing ties to their African legacy (in Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary, Emma Bovary is anxious to escape from social conditions which define her, but which she deprecates). He noticed that the elite were composed almost exclusively of people of mixed ancestry, descended from former free persons of color, who embraced their "whiteness." Most Haitians were more exclusively African in descent. His disdain for the elites spread beyond their racial purity of "bovarysme".
He believed they had unfair economic and political influence. He understood that their power base in the state system relied heavily on the taxation of crops, especially of coffee, the chief export, grown by the peasants who had come to the country's defense when the elites had abandoned it to protect their own interests.
He also attacked the elites' role in Haitian education. The elite believed they needed to civilize the masses. Price-Mars wrote frequently about educational programs. He examined the "intellectual tools" available in Haiti and challenged the elite to promote progress among the masses because of their advantage of position.
He ultimately came to embrace Haiti's slavery history as the true source of the Haitian identity and culture. He admired the culture and religion developed among the slaves as their base for rebelling against the Europeans and building a Haitian nation.
Collective bovarysme was also used to describe predominantly black Dominicans that denied their African roots in favor of their Spanish ancestry. During the Dominican Independence War, many pro-independence Dominicans looking to gain support from Europe and the United States did not see themselves as black. They viewed the conflict as a war between whites and blacks, or between the "civilized" and "barbaric".

KHDR (96.9 FM) is a radio station that is licensed to Lenwood, California. KHRQ (94.9 FM) is a radio station that is licensed to Baker, California. Both stations are owned by Heftel Broadcasting and together they broadcast an active rock format with the branding "Drive 96.9/94.9". KHDR and KHRQ serve the High Desert of California, specifically targeting travelers along the Interstate 15 corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
History
KHDR first signed on in 2002.
In 2004, KHWZ (100.1 FM) in Ludlow, California broke from the Highway Country trimulcast and switched to "The Drive". KHWZ went silent on February 25, 2011.
In early 2017, parent company KHWY, Inc. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the Highway Stations — KHDR and KHRQ, plus The Highway Vibe (KRXV, KHWY, KHYZ) and Highway Country (KIXW-FM, KIXF) — were put up for auction. Heftel Broadcasting won the auction with a $620,000 bid, with Educational Media Foundation having offered $525,000 for just KRXV and KHYZ.
In 2018, the Drive stations switched formats from mainstream rock to adult hits. On December 26, 2020 at midnight, KHDR and KHRQ flipped to active rock, keeping the Drive branding and adopting the tagline "Everything That Rocks". The first song played under the new format was "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" by AC/DC.
Syndicated programming on KHDR and KHRQ includes, as of February 8, 2021, The Woody Show weekday mornings. The Drive stations are affiliates of the Vegas Golden Knights radio network.

Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto (, ; born September 27, 1973) is an Israeli-Moroccan Orthodox rabbi who leads a global organization called . Based in Ashdod and New York City, he is a Kabbalist. Globes business journal named him in 2012 as one of the ten wealthiest rabbis in Israel.
As part of a series of legal issues, he pleaded guilty in September 2014 to bribing a high-ranking Israeli police officer. He was sentenced on May 12, 2015, to one year in prison, and to pay a fine of 1 million shekels. He began serving his prison sentence on February 16, 2016. After his release, he became the Chief Rabbi of Morocco in 2019.
Biography
Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto was born in Israel to Moroccan parents. On his father's side, he is the great-grandson of Chaim Pinto, a Moroccan sage; on his mother's side, he is the great-grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, also known as the Baba Sali.
Pinto graduated from Ashkenazi Lithuanian yeshivas, and studied under Ashkenazi and Hassidic rabbis. Pinto was also influenced by Satmar Hassidism and its teachings.
Pinto speaks Hebrew, and does not know English. Around 2008, Pinto moved to New York City for medical treatments. He then spent time in New York City and Ashdod, where he ran the Shuva Israel yeshiva. After his release from prison in 2017, he settled in Morocco.
Rabbinic career
Pinto is a rabbi and religious leader. Prior to extensive legal issues, he had a following as a spiritual leader and is a Kabbalist. He is said to be the descendant of rabbinical dynasties that reportedly have the potential to work miracles. Pinto has many followers from the Israeli expatriate community in the U.S. and has been described as "a rabbi to the rich and famous".
When he was in his 20s, Pinto founded Shuva Israel, a yeshiva in Ashdod, Israel. As founder he oversees an organization that includes two yeshivas in Ashkelon, one in Kiryat Malachi, three in Ashdod, and one in Rishon LeZion, with a total of 500 students to be rabbinical
students in training. The organization also has two schools for girls in Ashdod and a training school in Ashkelon. One of the Israeli locations provides money for living expenses to 180 widowed women. Several yeshivas or religious schools located in the United States and Israel and sponsors a charitable organization that provides food for Israeli families in need. Pinto's center in Ashod has four synagogues that serve more than 1,200 worshippers, a yeshiva with over 300 full-time students, and a soup kitchen that provides 3,000 meals a day. Pinto has also established a network of yeshivas in Israel, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York in the U.S.
In October 2010, Pinto led thousands to Silistra, Bulgaria, for an annual pilgrimage in homage of Eliezer Papo. During his stay in Bulgaria, Pinto held a meeting with 80 Jewish American businessmen, asking them to invest $5 billion in the Israeli economy.
In March, 2020, Pinto called upon the Jews of Morocco and the global Jewish community to comply with governmental regulations intended to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, in response to reports of Orthodox Jewish Haredi communities around the world defying restrictions on their traditional lifestyle.
Business career
Pinto has extensive connections in the real estate community in New York, including an executive with Metropolitan Real Estate Investors and one with Ilan Bracha of Prudential Douglas Elliman. His followers include Jay Schottenstein (chairman of the American Eagle Outfitters clothing company) and real estate mogul Jacky Ben-Zaken. Pinto has been characterized as "something between a guru and a Hasidic rebbe" and as a "mystically inclined" Kabbalist with an interest in the esoteric elements of the Jewish tradition". Although Pinto has no formal business background, a number of prominent Israeli and Jewish-American businessmen have visited him for consultation, including talk-show host Donny Deutsch; jeweler Jacob Arabo ("Jacob the Jeweler"); former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Prominent non-Jews who have consulted with Pinto include New York City politician Michael Grimm and basketball player LeBron James. Pinto has said that he does not consider his help to be advice, saying instead that "It's more of a blessing". Politicians and businessmen who have visited Pinto in Israel include Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, former Bank of Israel governor Jacob Frenkel, and Israeli soccer star Guy Levy. Because of Pinto's influence, he has been called the "rabbi to the business stars", and was described by Yoel Hasson, a Kadima member of the Knesset, as having connections and influence with a number of people in Israeli politics.
According to an article in the Globes business journal, in June 2012, Forbes Israel named Pinto as one of the 10 wealthiest rabbis in Israel, "with a fortune of NIS 75 million" "based on organizational holdings" such as "charitable activities and properties".
Political career
In 2010, a reception held for Pinto was attended by an Israel Defense Forces major general and five cabinet members. In January 2011, Pinto met with opposition leader Israeli politician Tzipi Livni in Tel Aviv. In December 2010, Pinto condemned an open letter endorsed by 50 Israeli rabbis which encouraged Jewish community members to avoid renting or selling property to non-Jews. Pinto believed that the letter would provoke racism against Jews in Israel and abroad, making it difficult for them "to live in New York or anywhere else in the world".
Legal problems
In September 2011, Pinto's father-in law, the chief Rabbi of Argentina, Shlomo Ben Hamo, retracted accusations of money laundering against Pinto in the Jerusalem District Court. The father-in-law said the retraction was "part of an arrangement made for legal reasons and to preserve domestic tranquility". Under the terms of the agreement, Pinto was required to pay NIS 3.4 million for two apartments purchased by his father-in-law, in the Gold housing complex in Jerusalem, with funds that were allegedly obtained from Pinto.
On October 12, 2012 Pinto was reported to be under investigation for money laundering. He was released on bail and placed under house arrest for a bribery attempt of an Israeli police official involved in the investigation. On September 17, 2014, Pinto was indicted on charges of attempting to bribe Ephraim Bracha of the Israeli national police in an attempt to gain information about the ongoing investigation of the financial activities of Hazon Yeshaya, a charitable organization Pinto heads. Bracha had reported the bribery attempt to his superior, Maj. Gen. Yoav Segalovich, and was ordered by Segalovich to pretend to accept the bribe. In February 2015, the Supreme Court upheld Pinto's plea agreement under which he would serve a maximum of one year in jail and become a state witness. He returned to Israel on April 14, and pleaded guilty the next day to bribing Bracha. Judge Oded Mudrick found him guilty of bribery, attempted bribery, and obstruction of justice. Bracha, who was cleared of any wrongdoing, committed suicide on July 5, 2015 after being subjected to a prolonged campaign of defamation. Pinto was sentenced on May 12, 2015, to one year in prison, and must pay a fine of 1 million shekels. Appeals of the prison sentence on the basis of ill health were declined on January 5 and February 8, 2016. He arrived at prison on February 16, 2016, after a brief stay in an Israeli hospital to check on and treat his medical conditions, including cancer. On August 3, President Reuven Rivlin rejected Pinto's appeal for clemency. His appeal for early release due to ill health, initially granted on September 19, was later overturned by the Lod District Court on September 26. He was released from prison on January 25, 2017, upon completion of his sentence.

El Salvador sent a delegation to compete in the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil from 7 to 18 September 2016. This was the country's fifth successive appearance in the Summer Paralympics since debuting at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. The Salvadoran delegation to Rio consisted of one athlete, powerlifter Herbert Aceituno, who qualified for the Games through his world ranking of 13th and his participation was confirmed by the International Paralympic Committee in August 2016. He failed to lift in three attempts during the men's 72 kg tournament and was therefore not ranked in the final standings by the judges.
Background
El Salvador first appeared in Paralympic competition at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. The nation has entered every edition of the Summer Paralympics since, making Rio their fifth time competing in the quadrennial multi-sport competition, but has not yet appeared at the Winter Paralympics. At the close of the Rio Paralympics, El Salvador has not medalled at the Paralympic Games. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Herbert Aceituno, a powerlifter, was the only athlete sent by El Salvador to Rio and his participation was confirmed by the International Paralympic Committee on 14 August 2016. He travelled with his coach Jorge López to Rio de Janeiro on 30 August. Aceituno was selected as the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Powerlifting
Computer technician Herbert Aceituno was 30 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics and he was making his debut in the Paralympic Games. His disability is congenital; he was born with the bone growth disorder achondroplasia that causes dwarfism. Aceituno automatically qualified for the Games because of his world ranking of 13th that he attained at a 2016 IPC Powerlifting World Cup event in Rio de Janeiro. This meant he became the first Salvadoran athlete to participate at the Paralympics through standard qualification procedures. He trained at Pavilion 5 of Riocentro to prepare for the Games. Before the Games, Aceituno said that he was excited to represent his country at the Paralympics and aimed to be within the top ten and improve his world ranking position. On 11 September, he participated in the men's 72 kg tournament. Aceituno ran out of time to lift on his first try and he could not do so in his next two attempts. He therefore went unranked by the judges in the competition.

The Tornado outbreak of April 2–3, 1999 was a series of tornado touchdowns that occurred on April 2–3, 1999 from Kansas to Louisiana. The most powerful tornado occurred in Caddo Parish and Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where an F4 tornado killed 7 people and injured 107 others. Damages from the outbreak were estimated to be near $13.7 million (2006 USD). A total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed across the southern Great Plains during the two-day event.
Tornado event
The first series of tornadoes touched down on April 2 across Oklahoma causing mostly minor damage to some structures.
The strongest tornadoes of the outbreak took place across the Arklatex region during the afternoon hours, where the strongest and lone killer tornado of the outbreak took place. At 3:52 PM, a supercell thunderstorm spawned a tornado over Cross Lake, north of Shreveport Regional Airport. The tornado moved northeast. In Caddo Parish the tornado damaged 66 buildings. In Caddo Parish, damages were estimated at nearly $1.6 million (2006 dollars). At 4:01 PM, the tornado entered Bossier Parish as an F4 tornado. In Bossier Parish, 227 buildings suffered major damage or were destroyed. An additional 162 buildings were damaged. Damages in Bossier Parish are estimated at near $6.7 million (2006 dollars). The tornado dissipated about eight miles northeast of Benton. In all, 7 people were killed and 102 were injured. The tornado was on the ground for about 20 miles. It reached a maximum width of 200 yards. It was Louisiana's deadliest tornado since February 21, 1971, when 10 people were killed east of Delhi.
Three additional tornadoes touched down beside the Caddo-Bossier Parish tornado. These tornadoes injured 1 person and caused up to $6.6 million in damages. Heavy damage was reported near Logansport, Summerfield and Athens heavily damaging several residences.
Weaker tornadoes (rated either F0 or F1) touched down across most central and northern Arkansas into Missouri as well as in eastern Texas. 4 people in total were injured in two separate tornadoes near Ben and Mammoth Spring with isolated damage to some structures and also to trees and power lines. The outbreak ended just before 6 PM on April 3.

Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918 – 30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential filmmakers of all time, and is well known for films such as The Seventh Seal (1957), Wild Strawberries (1957), Persona (1966), Cries and Whispers (1972), and Fanny and Alexander (1982).
Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. From 1953, he forged a powerful creative partnership with his full-time cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Björnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and numerous films from Through a Glass Darkly (1961) onward were filmed on the island of Fårö. His work often deals with death, illness, faith, betrayal, bleakness and insanity.
Philip French referred to Bergman as among the greatest artists of the 20th century. Mick LaSalle compared Bergman's significance in film to that of Virginia Woolf and James Joyce in literature.
List of accolades
Terrence Rafferty of The New York Times wrote that throughout the 1960s, when Bergman "was considered pretty much the last word in cinematic profundity, his every tic was scrupulously pored over, analyzed, elaborated in ingenious arguments about identity, the nature of film, the fate of the artist in the modern world and so on." Many filmmakers have praised Bergman and some have also cited his work as an influence on their own:
Andrei Tarkovsky held Bergman in very high regard, noting him and Robert Bresson as his two favourite filmmakers, stating: "I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman." Such was Bergman's influence, Tarkovsky's last film was made in Sweden with Sven Nykvist, Bergman's longtime cinematographer, and several of Bergman's favoured actors including Erland Josephson. Bergman likewise had great respect for Tarkovsky, stating: "Tarkovsky for me is the greatest director."
Alejandro González Iñárritu while entering the Berg-man compound (Bergman's house) on the remote island of Fårö for a documentary called Trespassing Bergman stated "If cinema was a religion, this would be Mecca, the Vatican. This is the center of it all."
Bertrand Tavernier stated: "Bergman was the first to bring metaphysics — religion, death, existentialism — to the screen ... but the best of Bergman is the way he speaks of women, of the relationship between men and women. He's like a miner digging in search of purity."
Nuri Bilge Ceylan
Steven Soderbergh
David Lynch
Wes Craven
Pedro Almodóvar
Jean-Luc Godard
Robert Altman
Adoor Gopalakrishnan
Olivier Assayas
Francis Ford Coppola stated: "My all-time favorite because he embodies passion, emotion and has warmth."
Guillermo del Toro said: "Bergman as a fabulist — my favorite — is absolutely mesmerizing."
Asghar Farhadi
Todd Field stated: "He was our tunnel man building the aqueducts of our cinematic collective unconscious."
Federico Fellini said: "I have a profound admiration for him (Bergman) and for his work, even though I haven't seen all of his films. First of all, he is a master of his métier. Secondly, he is able to make things mysterious, compelling, colorful and, at times, repulsive."
Woody Allen has referred to Bergman as "probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion picture camera". He said, "For me it was Wild Strawberries. Then The Seventh Seal and The Magician. That whole group of films that came out then told us that Bergman was a magical filmmaker. There had never been anything like it, this combination of intellectual artist and film technician. His technique was sensational." Allen has credited Bergman with inventing "a film vocabulary that suited what he wanted to say, that had never really been done before. He'd put the camera on one person's face close and leave it there, and just leave it there and leave it there. It was the opposite of what you learned to do in film school, but it was enormously effective and entertaining."
Krzysztof Kieślowski stated: "This man is one of the few film directors — perhaps the only one in the world — to have said as much about human nature as Dostoyevsky or Camus."
Stanley Kubrick stated: "I believe Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica and Federico Fellini are the only three filmmakers in the world who are not just artistic opportunists. By this I mean they don't just sit and wait for a good story to come along and then make it. They have a point of view which is expressed over and over and over again in their films, and they themselves write or have original material written for them." Kubrick praised Bergman as "The Greatest film-maker, unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization."
Ang Lee stated: "For me the filmmaker Bergman is the greatest performer of all...", "He (Bergman) is like God to me. I will take inspiration. I won't dare to imitate"
François Ozon
Park Chan-wook
Éric Rohmer stated: "The Seventh Seal is the most beautiful film ever."
Marjane Satrapi
Mamoru Oshii
Paul Schrader stated: "I would not have made any of my films or written scripts such as Taxi Driver had it not been for Ingmar Bergman. What he has left is a legacy greater than any other director. I think the extraordinary thing that Bergman will be remembered for, other than his body of work, was that he probably did more than anyone to make cinema a medium of personal and introspective value."
Martin Scorsese said: "I guess I'd put it like this: if you were alive in the '50s and the '60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make films, I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman. You would have had to make a conscious effort, and even then, the influence would have snuck through."
Steven Spielberg stated: "His love for the cinema almost gives me a guilty conscience."
Satyajit Ray stated: "I have great admiration for Bergman...It's Bergman whom I continue to be fascinated by. I think he's remarkable. I envy his stock company, because given actors like that one could do extraordinary things."
André Téchiné
Liv Ullmann
Lars von Trier, in reference to having once sent Bergman a letter, jokingly said, "I have seen all his movies, he is a great source of inspiration to me. He was like a father to me. But he treated me in the same way he treated all his children. No interest whatsoever!"
Legacy accolades in popular culture
A Bergman-themed parody spoofs the allegory of cheating death (Bergman's The Seventh Seal) in the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live season 1 (ep. 23, 24 July 1976). The sketch, titled "Swedish Movie", is somberly narrated in the third-person by a Swedish-speaking Death (Tom Schiller) with English subtitles scrolling. The baleful voice-over dialogue, revealed to be emanating from the apparition of Death personified, imposes upon dreamily preoccupied lovers Sven (Chevy Chase) and Inger (Louise Lasser) who send a not-so-silently jeering Death out for pizza.
Monty Python's The Meaning of Life includes a sketch based on The Seventh Seal in which middle-class weekenders at an isolated farmhouse are visited by The Grim Reaper.
A television spoof of Persona appeared in an episode of the Canadian comedy series SCTV in the late 1970s. SCTV later aired another Bergman parody, this time of Scenes From A Marriage that featured actor Martin Short portraying comedian Jerry Lewis as the star of a fictional Bergman film called Scenes From An Idiot's Marriage.
Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey includes a further spoof on the theme of playing games with Death from Bergman's The Seventh Seal. Bill and Ted are set to play a game with Death. Rather than chess, they play checkers. When Bill and Ted win, Death challenges them to the best of three match, wherein they play Battleship and other games from popular culture.
The Muppets franchise had a spoof of Bergman's style in a segment entitled "Silent Strawberries" from the TV special, The Muppets Go to the Movies.
In Season 2 Episode 2 of Welcome to Sweden, Jason Priestley asks to meet Ingmar Bergman.

The spot-winged antshrike (Pygiptila stellaris) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is monotypic within the genus Pygiptila. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
The spot-winged antshrike was described and illustrated by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1825 and given the binomial name Thamnophilus stellaris. The current genus Pygiptila was erected by the English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1858.

Fulton County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of Kentucky, with the Mississippi River forming its western boundary. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,813. Its county seat is Hickman. The county was formed in 1845 from Hickman County, Kentucky and named for Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat.
Allied with Tennessee by trade and culture, white Fulton County residents were largely pro-Confederate during the American Civil War. Forces from both armies passed through the county during different periods of the conflict. Because of imprecise early surveying of Kentucky's southern border, Fulton County is divided into two non-contiguous parts. An exclave on the peninsula in the Kentucky Bend of the Mississippi River can be reached only by road through Tennessee.
History
The rural county was not organized until 1845, from a portion of Hickman County. It was named for Robert Fulton, inventor of the steamboat. Hickman, Kentucky was designated as the county seat. The county was developed for agriculture, which was originally dependent on slave labor. Area farmers had ties to Tennessee planters, and shipped produce down the Mississippi River, which formed the county's western border. They supported the Confederacy, while Kentucky maintained official neutrality as a Border State.
During the post-Reconstruction period, there was considerable racial violence by whites against blacks in Fulton County; they exercised terrorism to re-establish and maintain white supremacy. Whites lynched 20 African Americans here from 1877 to 1950; most were killed around the turn of the 20th century. This was by far the highest total of any county in the state, more than ten times the total in many other counties. Five men were lynched from 1883 to 1917, for alleged rape, assault, barn burning, and robbery and murder.
After the Civil War, some African Americans became landowners in the county. A notably egregious lynching was that on October 3, 1908, in Hickman of David Walker and his entire family by 50 Night Riders. This may have been part of anarchic violence that was directed at blacks arising from the "Reelfoot Lake Uprising", but it also appeared that whites coveted Walker's land. Walker and his wife, an infant in arms, and three children were shot multiple times; the eldest son burned to death in their farmhouse; seven in total were killed on the night of October 3, 1908 in Hickman. Walker owned a 21 1/2 acre farm; his white neighbor took it over after the killings, and later sold it to another white man. One of the latter's descendants continues to own the rural land.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (11%) is water.
About of the county is separated in a peninsula from the rest of the state by an oxbow of the Mississippi River, known as the Kentucky Bend or New Madrid Bend, after the city in Missouri on the north side of the river. Travelers going there have to pass into Tennessee by road (there is no bridge from Missouri) and then go north to reach the Kentucky Bend exclave. The lowest point in the state of Kentucky is located on the Mississippi River in Kentucky Bend in Fulton County, where it flows past Kentucky and between Tennessee and Missouri. It is expected that over time, the river will cut across the short neck of the peninsula, cutting it off entirely from Kentucky, with land gradually filling in behind it to connect it to Missouri.

The Drawing Lesson, or the Living Statue () is a 1903 French short silent film by Georges Méliès. It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 470–471 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a scène Louis XV à trucs ("Louis XV-era scene with trick effects").
Plot
In an ornate outdoor scene, a painter comes upon a decorated sculptural niche with a small fountain. Admiring the view, he sets up his easel and goes off to collect his art students. A moment later, a merry prankster comes upon the scene, and begins doing magical tricks, turning a barrel into a pedestal, a ball into a miniature sun, the sun into a woman's head, and a handkerchief and jacket into her dress. Soon, in front of the niche, he has completed a statue of a woman in classical garb.
The painter and his students return, and are pleasantly surprised to find the statue there. As the painter bustles around the woman, she comes to life and steals the hat from his head. Then she transforms into an enormous fountain, into which the laughing prankster douses the painter.
Production
Méliès plays the prankster in the film, which uses a wide range of special effects, including substitution splices, multiple exposures on a black background, dissolves, and a cascade of real water. Méliès reused the motifs of the sun and the woman's head in his film Alcofrisbas, the Master Magician later that year.

Gian Francesco Albani (26 February 1720 – 15 September 1803) was a Roman Catholic Cardinal. He was a member of the Albani family.
Albani was born in Rome, the son of Carlo Albani, Duke of Soriano; his grand-uncle was Pope Clement XI (Gianfrancesco Albani). Furthermore, two of his uncles Annibale Albani and Alessandro Albani were cardinals, and was himself uncle of cardinal Giuseppe Albani (with whom he was, for two years, concurrently cardinal).
In October 1740 he was made Protonotary apostolic, quickly followed by being made the vicar of the patriarchal Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in March 1742. Later in the same year, in November, he was made president of the Papal chamber; and also cleric of the Apostolic Chamber less than a year later (September 1743). He further became relator of the S. C. of Indulgences and Sacred Relics in 1743.
On 10 April 1747 he was made cardinal deacon and was given the deaconry of San Cesareo in Palatio on 15 May. He went on to receive the subdiaconate (November 1747) and the diaconate (31 March 1748). He acted as Cardinal Protector of the Kingdom of Poland in the Roman Curia. In 1758 he participated in the Papal conclave.
He went on to the presbyteral order on 12 February 1759 with the titulus of S. Clemente; and the episcopal order on 21 July 1760 as bishop of the suburbicarian see of Sabina. He further opted for the see of Porto e Santa Rufina on 17 March 1773 and having become Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, received in addition Ostia and opted for Velletri on 18 December 1775. He further participated in the Papal conclaves of 1769, 1774–1775, and 1799–1800. He was also made archpriest of the patriarchal Liberian basilica and Prefect of the S. C. ceremonial.
His political orientation appeared to be pro-Austrian, anti-French and, with the French invasion of the Papal States in 1798 he absconded to Naples, before moving to Venice where the Papal conclave of 1800 took place. He died in Rome on the 15 September 1803—his funeral was held in the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella, Rome and was buried in the patriarchal Liberian basilica.

Jackson Hole Airport is a United States public airport located seven miles (11 km) north of Jackson, in Teton County, Wyoming. In 2019, it was the busiest airport in Wyoming by passenger traffic with 455,000 passengers. During peak seasons of summer and winter, Jackson Hole has nonstop airline service from up to 16 destinations throughout the United States. The airport is served year-round by Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines and seasonally by Frontier Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.
Jackson Hole Airport is the only commercial airport in the United States located inside a national park, in this case Grand Teton. (The Provincetown Municipal Airport in Massachusetts is on land leased from the National Park Service, but it is not in a national park.)
History
The airport was created in the 1930s as the best place to put an airport in Teton County. The airport was declared a national monument in 1943 and merged with Grand Teton National Park in 1950. The runway was extended to its current length in 1959. President John F. Kennedy landed in an Army helicopter here on September 25, 1963. In the 1960s and 1970s a runway extension to to allow jets was considered; the National Park Service successfully opposed it. In the late 1970s jets began using the existing runway. The area is noise sensitive and the airport allows no jets louder than stage III. The airport is a popular mating ground for the rare sage grouse.
The original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) was the first carrier to serve Jackson Hole, which began in 1959 with routes to Denver, Salt Lake City, and Billings using Douglas DC-3s, Convair 340s, and the Convair-580. This was later upgraded to the Boeing 737-200 series aircraft shorty before shutting down in 1986 due to the Airline Deregulation Act. Other than some commuter airlines that briefly served the airport, Frontier had the only service until Western Airlines began flights to Salt Lake City in 1983 using Boeing 737-200s. Since then the airport really took off and has also seen service by Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Horizon Air, Big Sky Airlines, and Southwest Airlines in the past as well as many other commuter carriers.
The airport once had an unusual terminal resembling a pioneer log cabin. The terminal was completely rebuilt between 2009 and 2014. The new terminal, designed by Gensler, still blends with the unique surroundings of the national park with exposed wood, fireplaces, and nature photography throughout. The park limited the height of the terminal building to 18 feet. The terminal design received an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 2014. In the spring of 2021, construction began on relocating the pre-security Café to baggage claim. Doing this gave check in counter space for Allegiant Airlines. Allegiant left the airport due to small flight loads and the inability to reliably turn a profit at the airport, but returned in the summer of 2021 with seasonal service to four destinations. The next phase of construction will modernize and expand the TSA checkpoint and give more gate space to American Airlines. In the spring of 2022 when the airport is closed, construction will commence on rebuilding Jedediah's restaurant and adding two more gates.
Facilities
Jackson Hole Airport covers ; its one runway, 1/19, is 6,300 x 155 ft (1,920 x 47.2 m) asphalt.
Jackson Hole Airport is noise sensitive and bans older, noisier aircraft with stage-II engines.
Due to a short runway at high altitude, the largest aircraft seen regularly at the Jackson Hole Airport is the Boeing 757-200 operated by Delta Air Lines on flights to Detroit and Atlanta. Other aircraft typically seen include the Airbus A319, A320, Embraer 175, and the Bombardier CRJ700. Due to these conditions, Jackson Hole Airport does not typically see stretched versions of aircraft such as the Airbus A321 or Boeing 737-900, as they become weight restricted when taking off.
The airport currently has eleven hard stand gates and three baggage carousels. Jackson Hole Airport does not have jet bridges so passengers board aircraft via ramps. The airport terminal has a restaurant and gift shop post security as well as a cafe by the baggage claim area. The airport is served by Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise and National rental car companies. Dollar, Hertz, and Thrifty offer shuttle service from the airport to in-town rental cars.
Jackson Hole Airport is one of 16 airports that employs its security screeners under contract with the Transportation Security Administration's Screening Partnership Program. Screeners are employed by the Jackson Hole Airport Board rather than TSA.
Airlines and destinations
Statistics
In the year ending December 31, 2019 the airport had 27,325 aircraft operations, average 75 per day: 37% general aviation, 29% air taxi, 33% airline and 1% military. 21 aircraft at the time were based at the airport: 17 single-engine, 2 multi-engine, and 2 jet.

Dominador Ilano Mangubat (June 24, 1903 – November 19, 1980) is a Filipino medical doctor and statesman who served as appointed provincial governor of Cavite during the Third Republic of the Philippines. He served from May 1954 to December 31, 1955. After the national election of 1953, President Ramon Magsaysay installed Mangubat mayor of Cavite City and later appointed as governor in May 1954.
Mangubat never ran for political office, a businessman and a physician by profession his accession into politics were partly due to his popularity among the Caviteño as a doctor apart from being descended to a Spanish Era Prominent clan of Cavite Mangubat's capacity prompted President Magsaysay to install Mangubat mayor of Cavite City and then as Provincial Governor of Cavite, serving the unexpired term of Governor Camerino, who had a case before the court.
Trece Martires became a City during his Governorship
Under the city charter, the Governor of Cavite is a ex-officio mayor of Trece Martires; then-Governor Dominador Mangubat was installed as the city's first chief executive
Early life and education
Dominador Mangubat was born to Municipal President (Mayor) Isidro S. Mangubat and Damasa Ilano, on June 24, 1903 in Dasmariñas.
He was the eldest son of the couple and a descendant of Spanish era Dasmarinas Gobernadorcillo Leon Garcia Mangubat
The Mangubat family of Cavite owned the Maritime transport vessel "El Vapor Mactan" a cargo ship based in Cavite used to transport military hardware and soldiers from the Cavite Arsenal to the military fort in Zamboanga, and Jolo since the foundation of Fort Pilar in 1635. During the US regime the Mangubat family maritime transport business was converted into a fishing fleet.
Mangubat completed his elementary level studies in Imus, Cavite and attended the high school of the University of the Philippines in Manila for his secondary studies. Mangubat then attended the University of Santo Tomas where he finished his pre-medical course with the degree of Associate in Arts.He completed his medical studies at the College of Medicine of the same university where he graduated in 1930. He passed the examination by the Board of Medical Examiners on the same year.
Career
The Cavite Medical Society had Mangubat as one of its organizers. Mangubat was elected as vice president of the medical organization during its first meeting. During World War II, when the Japanese occupied the Philippines, he joined the resistance movement as an executive officer with the rank of Major and serve as the head of the Medical Corps to the 4th Infantry Regiment headed by his close kin Col. Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong of the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces (FACGF) with General Mariano Castañeda as Division Commander.

Jovito Evangelista and became a prisoner of war by the Japanese for 2 months after that he was release from Muntinglupa Rizal prison camp.
Dr. Mangubat went back to his ranch in Dasmariñas, where he continued to provide food and medicine as supplies, storing firearms for the guerrillas and treating wounded troops. He went on aiding the guerrillas until the arrival of the American forces in January 1945 and this provided the vital tactical advantage to the 4th Infantry Regiment FACGF in liberating the town of Dasmarinas and the province of Cavite from the Japanese occupiers.

The a2 Milk Company Limited (previously known as A2 Corporation) is a dual listed NZX and ASX 50 public listed company that commercialises intellectual property relating to A1 protein-free milk that is sold under the a2 and a2 Milk brands, as well as the milk and related products such as infant formula.
History
The a2 Milk Company is the successor of A2 Corporation Limited, a New Zealand company founded in 2000 by Dr Corran McLachlan, who was researching health effects of A1 beta-casein, and Howard Paterson, who was one of New Zealand's richest men, a significant dairy farmer, and a stakeholder in Fonterra, a dairy cooperative. The company commercialised a genetic test to determine whether a cow will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market A1 protein-free milk.
Initially, A2 Corporation focused on dairy farm breeding programs to develop herds that would produce only A1 protein-free milk. However the launch of A1 protein-free milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had protected contracts under New Zealand law with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms. Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights, Paterson led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks. The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports. The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand to issue statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.
A2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch A1 protein-free milk under its a2 and a2 MILK brands in New Zealand at the end of April 2003. In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died. In July, Paterson was found dead in his hotel room during a business trip at the age of 50, and a month later Dr Corran McLachlan died of cancer at the age of 59. In New Zealand it is illegal to make health claims about a food product without providing scientific evidence and registering the food as a medicine, and in November 2003 the New Zealand Commerce Commission advised that A2 Corporation Ltd and its licensed producers of A1 protein-free milk had agreed to amend the health claims in their promotional material following a warning from the commission. By end of 2003 the weakened A2 Corporation had withdrawn the litigation against Fonterra and negotiations had resumed.
The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into administration in October and was liquidated in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars. A NZ$1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled. A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A1 protein-free herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.
In December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to Fraser & Neave, a food marketing giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million. A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser & Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses. A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.
Between 2004 and 2006, A2 Corporation business continued to grow. In response, Dairy Australia (the national association of the Australian dairy industry) and market competitors such as Parmalat have consistently stated that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.
Reconsolidation and succession as The a2 Milk Company
In 2006, A2 Corporation was on a sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser & Neave. In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled. In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.
Commercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of A1 protein-free milk were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and yoghurt made with A1 protein-free milk went on the market in Australia in April 2010 under the a2 and a2 MILK brands.
In February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents per share.
In December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board, and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses. It listed in March 2013.
In 2015, A1 protein-free whole milk powder and A1 protein-free ice cream products were launched. For the 2014–2015 Financial year, The a2 Milk Company reported its Australian and New Zealand segment revenue grew by 40% vs pcp; and sales on a2 infant formula increased by 650%.
In December 2017 the company announced that in the summer of 2018 Geoffrey Babidge, who had been nearing retirement age, would step down and Jayne Hrdlicka would take over as CEO; at that time she was CEO of a subsidiary of Qantas. She took over in July 2018. At that time the company was experiencing strong growth via sales in China and had ramped up spending to further increase Chinese sales and to expand the US market. Hrdlicka resigned as CEO in December 2019, after her husband was found to have a kidney tumour. On her departure Geoffrey Babidge returned, as interim CEO.
In August 2020 David Bortolussi was appointed CEO and managing director.
A2 milk
The a2 Corporation claims that milk containing A1 proteins is harmful, but a 2009 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) review of scientific literature found there was insufficient evidence to prove that bioactive peptides in standard milk have a negative effect on health.
A1 and A2 beta-casein are genetic variants of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one amino acid. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the US, Australia and New Zealand. A genetic test, developed by the A2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces the A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the a2 Milk Company to license milk producers once proven their cows produce only A2 beta-casein protein in their milk, to the exclusion of the A1 beta-casein protein type.
Intellectual property
A2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on genetic tests to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning potential adverse health consequences of standard milk.
By 2012 A2 Corporation had developed a worldwide suite of intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets, and patents covering products, the genetic test and methods to develop A1 protein-free producing herds, as well as methods to check the protein content and fatty acid content of milk, dietary supplements with A2 beta-casein, and even therapeutic uses of A1 protein-free products.
The a2 Milk Company continues to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, including trademarks and patents. The a2 Milk Company also invests in targeted research and development associated with the benefits of the A2 protein. In September 2017, it was reported that the a2 Milk Company got approval to keep selling its products in China.
Markets
New Zealand and Australia
Sales of A1 protein-free milk in Australia and New Zealand boosted significantly following 2007, after the publication of a book, Devil in the Milk by Keith Woodford, about A1 beta-casein and its perceived dangers to health; the book prompted the New Zealand Food Safety Authority to propose again reviewing the science to address consumer concerns that milk containing both the A1 and A2 proteins might be harmful. It asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to undertake such a review. The EFSA report, released in 2009, found that "a cause and effect relationship is not established between the dietary intake of BCM7 (beta-casomorphin-7), related peptides or their possible protein precursors and non-communicable diseases".
The a2 Milk Company launched an infant formula in New Zealand and Australia in September 2013 and an A1 protein-free thickened cream was launched in January 2014 under the a2 and a2 MILK brands.
A2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited effective April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.
In 2014 Lion, a beverage and food company that operates in Australia and New Zealand and is owned by Kirin, relaunched its Pura Milk product with a new label stating: "Naturally contains A2 protein."
The a2 Milk Company announced in November 2014 that it had begun the application process for a dual listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in a bid to open its register to Australian investors and boost the liquidity of its shares. The company successfully listed in Australia on 30 March 2015.
United States
In August 2003, The a2 Milk Company exclusively licensed patent and trademark rights to US-based Ideasphere Incorporated (ISI) to market A1 protein-free products in North America. ISI acquired Twinlab in September 2003, followed by another string of acquisitions in the dietary supplement market. In June 2005, ISI and A2 Corporation agreed to form a joint venture, a2 Milk Company LLC.
In April 2007 A2 Corporation announced a deal in which the joint venture would license rights to the Original Foods Company, whose branding the A1 protein-free product would carry, and in which the product would be sold in several midwestern states through the Hy-Vee supermarket chain.
In A2 Corporation's 2009 Annual Report, the company announced that the joint venture had regained all rights to the US market through a settlement with the Original Foods Company. In 2010 The a2 Milk Company bought out more than 99% of ISI's share in the joint venture.
The a2 Milk Company is the owner of US trademarks that include the term A2 and/or A2 MILK for milk and other diary related products, including a trademark for "a2 MILK." The a2 Milk Company announced in 2018 that it now had around 9,000 stores in its distribution network in the United States that sell its a2 and a2 MILK branded products.
United Kingdom
The a2 Milk Company formed a joint venture with a major British milk supplier, Müller Wiseman Dairies (MWD), in November 2011 to process, market and sell its A1 protein-free products in Britain and Ireland. In June 2014 The a2 Milk Company reported it had 20 dedicated farms supplying milk for processing in the UK. In its first year the milk recorded £1 million in sales through 1,000 stores. On 1 January 2014, The a2 Milk Company exited its joint venture with MWD by acquiring MWD's stake for a "nominal" amount.
In October 2019, the a2 Milk Company announced that it had decided to "discontinue a2 milk in the UK" and its products would only be available until the end of November 2019.
China
The first consignments of The a2 Milk Company infant formula – a2 Platinum were sent to China in 2013. Exports to China have increased dramatically following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal.

Florence Magruder Gilmore (pen name, Florence Gilmore; February 13, 1881 – September 13, 1945) was an American author and settlement worker. She was a frequent contributor to the Catholic press, and wrote several novels.
Personal life and education
Florence Magruder Gilmore was born in Columbus, Ohio, February 13, 1881. Her father, James Gillespie Gilmore (1854-1904), was a senior member of the firm of Gilmore & Ruhl, St. Louis, Missouri. Through her father, she was connected with the prominent families of Blaine, Ewing and Sherman, in the U.S. Her mother was Florence (Magruder) Gilmore; through her mother, the was connected with some of the well-known families of Scotland, including Clan MacGregor.
Her siblings were a brother, Edward M. Gilmore, and two sisters, Reverend Mother Mary Gilmore, superior at Villa Duchesne, and Mother Frances Gilmore, Academy of the Sacred Heart, who were both Catholic nuns.
Gilmore attended Sacred Heart Convent school, Omaha, Nebraska, and Maryville College (now Maryville University), St. Louis, Missouri. In 1936, Gilmore received an Honorary B.Litt. from Maryville College.
Career
Gilmore was engaged in doing settlement work under Catholic organizations in St. Louis.
She was a member of the staff of The Catholic Columbian (weekly), and a contributor to many periodicals, Catholic and non-sectarian. These included America, Extension, Benzinger's, Messenger of the Sacred Heart, Rosary, Leader , Ave Maria, St. Anthony Messenger, The Sign, The Missionary, Catholic World , and Atlantic Monthly.
Gilmore published at least three novels with B. Herder of St. Louis, A Romance of Old Jerusalem (1911),
Dr. Dumont (1911), and The Parting of the Ways (1914). In The Parting of the Ways, Gilmore tells the story of two youths whose association was interrupted by the different educational plans of their parents. The one receives a Catholic education, and his faith is the center of his life. The other attends secular schools, and his faith drops into the position of an accident. The story is allowed to point its moral by the simple unfolding of the plot without any offensive insistence.
There were several translations from French for Maryknoll, such as For the Faith, Martyr of Futuna, and Two Vincentian martyrs. Her poetry was included in the American Book of Verse.
Death
After a major operation, Florence Magruder Gilmore died in Columbus, Ohio, September 13, 1945.

Sound System is a box set collection by the Clash released in September 2013. The box contains the band's studio albums (but excludes the post-breakup album Cut the Crap) newly re-mastered by Mick Jones, with a further three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both Don Letts and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, plus an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' fanzine and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and a poster. The boom box packaging was designed by Paul Simonon. The set was released simultaneously with 5 Album Studio Set, which contains only the five studio albums, and the greatest hits package titled The Clash Hits Back.
In a September 2013 interview, Mick Jones announced the box sets and hits package will be the final time he works on anything involving the Clash and their music. "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark," Jones said.
Remastering
Mick Jones said, "The concept of the whole thing is the best box set ever. Re-mastering's a really amazing thing. That was the musical point of it all, because there's so much there that you wouldn't have heard before. It was like discovering stuff, because the advances in mastering are so immense since the last time [the Clash catalogue] was remastered in the 90s."
All the music has been remastered from the original tapes, Jones said. "We had to bake the tapes beforehand – the oxide on them is where the music is, so if you don't put them in the oven and bake them, that all falls off, because they're so old."
Bassist Simonon highlighted a guitar line on "Safe European Home", from the band's second album Give 'Em Enough Rope, saying he'd never even heard it before. "It's probably some session musician, while I was asleep," Jones joked.
Reception
PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III wrote "The initial interest may come in the fact that the packaging looks like a classic Boom Box emblazoned with 'THE CLASH' in a military stencil with the overall box decorated in a Combat Rock reminiscent camouflage. This is definitely a visual treat for Clash fans to add to their mantle."
Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said "It takes a band as myth-saturated as the Clash to live up to a career-summing box as ambitious as this one. But Joe Strummer and his crew of London gutter-punk romantics fit the bill."
The Telegraph's Patrick Sawer wrote "The tracks, remastered by the band's guitarist Mick Jones and Tim Young (who won a Grammy for his work on the Beatles 2006 Love album), sound fresh as ever, crisper even. Jones, the official muso of the band, said that during the remastering process he discovered guitar lines he couldn't remember and previously buried instrumental details certainly stand out – along with Strummer's biting ad-libs."

The Mud Springs Station Archaeological District, which includes the Mud Springs Pony Express Station Site, near Dalton, Nebraska, has significance dating to the mid-19th century. The Pony Express station at Mud Springs, staffed by U.S. soldiers, was attacked by Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribesmen during February 4–6, 1865, in what became known as the Battle of Mud Springs.
In 1966, the site of the Pony Express station was a plot. Part of the present area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as Mud Springs Pony Express Station Site, and the listing was expanded to and renamed on the register in 2011. It has also been designated Nebraska historic site 25MO72.
Brief History
Mud Springs Station, a Native American territory in the olden times, served as a Pony Express site in 1860-61. It was named after the springs found at the opening of a canyon that divided Lodge Pole Creek and North Platte River Valleys, Dalton, Nebraska. The station served travelers en route the dry and arid trail from the Lodge Pole Creek to Oregon.
In 1859, Mud Springs Station saw the coming of crude houses and a stage station for coach service, the movement called as Pony Express. But its life proved short-lived and in, 1861, abruptly ceased. But, as a legacy, a transcontinental telegraph station was established at Mud Springs Station and a daily stage coach service continued its service.
The telegraph station, that served till 1876 proved a savior for Mud Spring Station, when an attack by the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians in the Battle of Mud Springs was thwarted by a SOS telegraph sent to US troops and the subsequent arrival of reinforcements to counter the attack. Today, as the last vestige of the Mud Spring Station, a stone monument, inlaid with a bronze Pony Express plaque, stands at the historic site.
Currently, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, originally, the Pony Express Station site was donated in 1939 to the Nebraska State Historical Society, by the then site-owner, Mrs. Scherer.

Maternal healthcare in Texas refers to the provision of family planning services, abortion options, pregnancy-related services, and physical and mental well-being care for women during the prenatal and postpartum periods. The provision of maternal health services in each state can prevent and reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality and fetal death.
The maternal healthcare system in Texas has undergone legislative changes in funding and the provision of family planning and abortion services, in relation to other states in the United States. The system in Texas has also received attention in regards to the state's maternal mortality ratio, currently the highest in the United States. Maternal deaths have steadily increased in Texas from 2010, with more than 30 deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births in 2014. The diverse demography of Texas has been identified as one factor contributing to this mortality rate, with mortality being higher among ethnic minorities such as African-American and Hispanic women. In 2013, Texas legislation established the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force to begin investigating the causes of the maternal mortality rates in the state as well as suggesting ways in which it could be reduced or averted.
Family Planning Services
In the late 1900s, the importance of family planning services captured the attention of healthcare professionals and policymakers. The recognition that unintentional pregnancies had adverse health outcomes for mothers and increased costs of maternal and infant care coupled with ethical considerations led to the passage of Title X in 1970 and the creation of federal- and state-funded family planning programs. Under Title X funding in Texas, family planning organizations participate in the 340B drug-pricing program, which reduces contraception costs by 50–80%. Under Title X regulations, clinics are also allowed to provide confidential family planning services to adolescents.
Contraception and Screening
In 2007, the Health and Human Services Commission of Texas established the Women's Health Program (WHP), a Medicaid waiver program that received 90% of its funding from the federal level. The Program provided family planning services for women from the ages of 18–44 whose incomes were 185% below the federal poverty level. In September 2011, the program served ~119,000 low-income women. In December 2011, the state of Texas established legislation that excluded family planning providers affiliated with abortion services, such as Planned Parenthood clinics, from the WHP. As a result, the federal government ruled this as a violation of federal law, and in March 2012, discontinued federal funding for the WHP. The WHP was then replaced with a program that was 100% funded by revenue from the state of Texas.
The exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP was found to be associated with a reduced use of contraception by clients. After the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP, the claims in Planned Parenthood clinics for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) reduced by 35.5% and the claims for injectable contraceptives reduced by 31.1%. After the exclusion, there was also found to be an increase in childbirth covered under Medicaid from 7.0% to 8.4% in the counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates.
In addition to the Women's Health Program, from September 2010 to August 2011, the Texas Department of State Health Services allocated $49.3 million in funding to private, public, and Planned Parenthood affiliated clinics through Title X, V, and XX funding to provide family planning services.
In September 2011, preceding the exclusion of programs from WHP, the state of Texas reduced its family planning funding from $111.0 million to $37.9 million through the removal of Title V and Title XX block grants. The funds were re-allocated away from family planning providers to other state and federal programs. With the remaining funding, family planning programs were organized into a 3-tiered system, with public agencies and federally funded health centers (tier 1) being prioritized over agencies that provided family planning services as a part of primary care (tier 2) and those that specialized in the provision of family planning services (tier 3).
The reduction of the budget for family planning services and the creation of three-tiered program was associated with the closing of 82 family-planning clinics, with one third of the clinics being Planned Parenthood affiliates. Without subsidized aid, fewer clinics were able to afford contraception, and as a result, reduced access to IUDs and implants for patients. Clinics also began to reduce their service hours. With the loss of funding, clinics lost their participation in the 340B drug-pricing program, which had reduced contraception costs from 50 – 80%. Clinics also lost their exemption status from a Texas law requiring parental consent for provision of family planning services to adolescents. Family planning organizations reported a 41–92% reduction in clients after the reduction and reallocation of family planning funding.
The changes in family planning funding and exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP did not seem to affect screening and counseling services. Services such as cervical cancer screening, chlamydia and gonorrhea screening, and HIV testing continue to be offered at private and public clinics.
Prenatal and Postpartum Care
Prenatal care is a form of preventative health care that aims to reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality and fetal defects and death. Women's access to prenatal care services is dependent on and can be limited by their socioeconomic status or region of residency. One study conducted in 2010 through interviews of low-income women living in San Antonio, Texas, showed how those with limited education or in singly inhabited houses initiated prenatal care services later in their pregnancies. The women reported "service-related" barriers as the number one reason for not initiating prenatal care services.
Postpartum care is the provision of healthcare services upon delivery and mirrors prenatal care services. Postpartum care is offered both for the physical and mental repercussions that may result after delivery. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System is one way of gauging the mental health of women after delivery, and is used by hospitals in the state of Texas. In 2003, Texas passed the Postpartum Depression to Pregnant Women Act, requiring healthcare professionals to equip women with information on accessing organizations that provide counseling and postpartum guidance. This act also urged the consideration of insurance coverage and other economic factors in providing women with postpartum care.
Regarding one area of postpartum care, a study conducted in 2014 surveyed women living in Austin and El Paso, Texas on their preferred method of contraception six months after delivery and compared it with their current contraception use. The surveys found that while women preferred to use LARC methods of contraception, they were unable to use or access them at the time. Postpartum contraception has been deemed an integral part of the maternal healthcare system, especially because 61% of all unwanted pregnancies occur for women who have undergone delivery at least once.
Maternal Mortality
According to the World Health Organization, maternal mortality is defined as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy." The maternal mortality rates in Texas have been a source of concern as well as much discussion. From 2000 to 2010, the maternal mortality rate in Texas increased from 17.7 (for every 100,000 live births) to 18.6. It must be noted that during this period, in 2006, Texas included the consideration of pregnancy on its death certificate. However, this was not seen to visibly affect the maternal mortality rates in the ten-year time period. After 2010, the maternal mortality rate doubled, exceeding 35 between 2010 and 2014 and remaining higher than 30 in 2014.
In the US, from 1987 to 2009, the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths included hemorrhage, sepsis, and hyperintensive disorders. From 2006 to 2009, these causes changed, with cardiovascular conditions accounting for more than a third of pregnancy-related deaths.
While research is ongoing on the causes of maternal mortality in Texas, maternal mortality in the US has been linked to chronic health conditions in women. Cardiovascular conditions were shown to account for at least one third of pregnancy-related deaths. Behavioral factors, such as smoking, overdoses, and suicide have also shown to be present in a high frequency during the period of pregnancy and postpartum period. Similarly, depression and anxiety have been prevalent in women during the postpartum period. In Texas, African-American women are at the highest risk of maternal death.
In 2013, the Senate Bill 495 passed, leading to the establishment of the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force to assess the factors contributing to maternal death in the state and suggest measures to reducing its incidence. In the 2016 Biennial Report, the Task Force identified cardiac event, drug overdose, hypertension, hemorrhage, and sepsis as being the top five factors contributing to maternal death in Texas. Since opioids are the most common method of drug abuse in Texas, the Task Force has initiated the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Prevention Pilot to reduce the incidence of this syndrome in newborns resulting from maternal opioid use. The Task Force is also working toward extending the number of days after delivery to which a woman in the Healthy Texas Women program can access health services.
Other initiatives the Task Force has worked on include The Texas Collaborative for Healthy Mothers and Babies, which enables the delivery of postpartum health services to women while raising awareness of maternal and infant mortality. Other programs such as Someday Starts Now and Preconception Peer Education, work to raise community awareness of maternal morbidity and mortality, and are specifically targeted to minority populations of childbearing age. The Task Force is planning to allocate Title V funding to these programs and thus strengthen community health and awareness of maternal mortality and morbidity.

FutureQuake Press output
Though FutureQuake was ostensibly open to any form of submission from anyone who chose to do so, there were certain forms and themes to which the comic adheres. As an anthology, the stories often featured a moralistic 'twist' at the end, much in the same style as EC Comics's science fiction and horror comics like Weird Science and The Vault of Horror, as well as 2000 AD's Future Shocks. However, the stories were not necessarily bound by this.

Reviews
With 48 pages, this issue boasts nine multi-page and five one-page strips and art contributions from industry professionals Arthur Ranson, Stewart McKenny, Inaki Miranda and Eva de la Cruz, as well as published authors and other overseas contributors. There are some striking strips concerning the fate of alien abductees, how unfunded superheroes support themselves, the burden of bureaucracy on crime fighters, and a breakthrough in temporal research. – Comics International, about FQ #4
ZINE OF THE MONTH. Don't be fooled by its relatively simplistic cover – Futurequake is an excellent 'zine with a great selection of standalone strips, ranging from the darkly dramatic ("Domestic Bliss") to traditional sci-fi themes with a comedy twist ("Fortunate Son"). There's real talent [in] both the writing and the art – check out the single-pager "Wrecks" for an example of a short but superbly-told story – and brilliant SF ideas abound. – SFX, March 2006, about FQ #5
It will run for quite a while and go from strength to strength – Comics International 192
Futurequake #6 (£A4, £3.50), inspired no doubt in part by Tharg's Future Shocks but owing more, I think to SF short fiction and US pulp comics, is a delight. Well deserving its status of SFX Fanzine of the Month – Down the Tubes
The cover and opening strip, Triumph of the Will, by Ed Berridge, Richmond Clements and fine artistic talent Andy Finlayson, make this a must for WWII superhero completists. Gray Wilkinson and Bolt-01 collaborate on a destiny-charged tale with an ironic twist; Arthur Wyatt and Peter Anckom do a nice line in military subterfuge; while several other strips deliver twists so oblique it that their meaning isn't immediately apparent – Comics International, about FQ #6

A stylistic departure for small press sci-fi comics – Comics International 192
This very pretty stripzine boasts a broad selection of different art styles, although despite the name, only a few strips make use of the Japanese aesthetic. The highpoints are "Cyborg Butterfly" – reminiscent of Yukito Kishiro's Battle Angel Alita – and the somewhat more Westernised "Wildcards", which parodies Power Rangers and Godzilla and the super robot genre and is very funny with it, too! – SFX, about MangaQuake #2
A generous page count allows the two longest strips room to . Cyborg Butterfly by Sonia Leong, features beautiful art, but substitutes sentiment for characterisation. Mongoose McCloud's Wildcard Taskforce Robo-Guardians, on the other hand, goes all out for fun, with cheeky Jack of Clubs slipping in some filthy remarks about his team-mates. The five shorter strips are all charming in their own way, with The Stunt, and Squandered Eden telling complete stories with admirable economy – Comics International, about MangaQuake #2

Reviews
All the strips are beautifully drawn, but not all have an inevitability or necessary logic to them. Hence the most satisfactory story is Adrian Bamforth's The Other Side, which delivers an unexpected twist that doesn't make the reader wonder why it happened – Comics International
the execution is superb and, with each strip taking just the right amount of time to deliver its impact, and they're all nicely tied together too – SFX Magazine

Audra Marie Lindley (September 24, 1918 – October 16, 1997) was an American actress, most famous for her role as landlady Helen Roper on the sitcom Three's Company and its spin-off The Ropers.
Life and career
Audra Lindley was born into Los Angeles show business. Her father, Bert Lindley, was a film and stage actor. Lindley got her Hollywood start as a stand-in. This progressed to stunt work, and she eventually became a contract player with Warner Bros.
In 1943, she went to New York in her mid-20s to work in theater. Among her many Broadway plays during her long career were: On Golden Pond, Long Day's Journey into Night, and Horse Heavens.
After a break from acting to raise five children, she began to make steady appearances on television in the early 1960s, including the role of Sue Knowles on the soap opera Search for Tomorrow, and a five-year stint as manipulative Aunt Liz Matthews on the soap opera Another World. She had regular roles as Meredith Baxter's mother in the sitcom Bridget Loves Bernie as well as Lee Grant's best friend in Fay. Both series were short-lived.
In 1971, she starred in Taking Off, the first American film of Miloš Forman. She had guest roles on The Love Boat in 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1981 (pilot movie 3, season 1 episode 4, season 2 episodes 1 & 2, season 3 episodes 1 & 2, season 4 episode 18, and season 5 episode 10).
Her greatest fame came when she began playing the wisecracking, perpetually unfulfilled and sexually frustrated Helen Roper on the hit sitcom Three's Company (1977–79), in which she wore a wig to maintain her character's exaggerated hairstyle. The character and her husband Stanley, portrayed by Norman Fell, also starred in the spin-off series The Ropers (1979–80), which ran for two seasons.
Lindley continued to appear steadily on television and in films, such as Revenge of the Stepford Wives in 1980 and as Fauna, the owner of a brothel in the 1982 film Cannery Row. In 1982, she appeared in the film Best Friends, starring Goldie Hawn and Burt Reynolds.
She played a supporting role in the lesbian-themed film Desert Hearts (1985). In 1987, she had another supporting role as Judith Light's mother in the TV movie Dangerous Affection. She also appeared in 1989's Troop Beverly Hills as outspoken director of the Wilderness Girls. Also in 1989, she was the main character of an episode of the horror anthology series Tales from the Crypt.
In 1991, she starred in an episode of the horror anthology series The Hidden Room. She got parts in various TV films and series, including playing Phoebe Buffay's grandmother on Friends and her last, a recurring role as Cybill Shepherd's mother on the sitcom Cybill (having previously played Shepherd's mother in the 1972 film The Heartbreak Kid).
Personal life and death
She was married to Hardy Ulm, with whom she had five children, from 1943 until his death in 1970. She was then married to actor James Whitmore from 1972 to 1979.
Lindley died of complications from leukemia on October 16, 1997, at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. She was age 79. She was cremated and her ashes buried in an unmarked grave near her parents at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, California.

SCOPE Maastricht is the official study association (in the legal form of a Dutch vereniging) of the School of Business and Economics (commonly abbreviated as SBE) at Maastricht University, representing students and organizing social, academic and career-oriented activities and events. Since 2017 the study-specific associations SCOPE | 3MA (Marketing, Management, Organization), SCOPE | Economics (Economic Studies), and SCOPE | FOCUS (Finance, Accounting, Controlling) merged with the former umbrella association. Combined as SCOPE, the association operates on a non-profit basis. Revenue is generated through membership fees and sponsor contributions by local and multinational companies.
History
SCOPE Maastricht was created in 2011 as a merger from study associations EFM Academy and FAME Cooperation. Back then, FAME Cooperation used to be the umbrella organization for study associations at the School of Business and Economics, operating a bookstore inside the faculty building. Other study associations under FAME included: 3MA (later: SCOPE | 3MA), FS FOCUS (later: SCOPE | FOCUS), IES Network (later: SCOPE | Economics) and Vectum (changed to SCOPE | Vectum in 2011, and back to Vectum again in 2020). EFM Academy was formed as a vereniging under Dutch law in 2002 in a merger of EFM Alfa and EFM Imperator, two study associations that focused on Dutch and international students of the faculty respectively. EFM Academy focused on all first and second-year bachelor students in the B.Sc. programs International Business and Economics. Effectively, most students became member of EFM Academy in the beginning of their studies and stayed in the association for two or three semesters, before their membership was transferred to a study association specialized on their major or study track.

In 2022, heavy tensions broke out between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, which have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each others territory.
The crisis is related to a recent offensive by members of the March 23 Movement (M23), which the Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting. Rwanda has also accused the DRC of supporting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) paramilitary group. Both the Congo and Rwanda deny they support the FDLR and M23, respectively. The MONUSCO peacekeeping mission maintains that it is not involved in the conflict, but has been accused by Rwanda of taking sides.
Timeline
May
DRC forces said that they had captured two Rwandan soldiers that had been sent into the Congo in disguise. Both were released on June 11.
May 23
DRC forces reportedly shelled Musanze District, in the Northern Province of Rwanda, injuring several people.
May 27
The Democratic Republic of the Congo ordered the suspension of all RwandAir flights. Rwanda condemned the action and RwandAir decided to retaliate by cancelling flights to Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Goma.
May 29
African Union Chairman and President of Senegal Macky Sall said that the African Union was supporting a "peaceful resolution" to the tensions.
June 2
Angolan president João Lourenço attempted to mediate a resolution between the two countries in Luanda.
June 8
Alexander De Croo, the Prime Minister of Belgium, compared the Eastern DRC to Ukraine in a visit to Kinshasa, additionally making comments implying his support for the Congo in its border crisis with Rwanda.
June 9
The Democratic Republic of the Congo said it had discovered that 500 Rwandan special forces had been sent into the Tshanzu region in North Kivu.
June 10
The DRC accused Rwanda of firing rockets at a school in Biruma, North Kivu, killing two children and seriously injuring another person of unspecified age. Rwanda also said that the Congo had fired rockets into Western Rwanda from the direction of Bunagana.
June 11
The United Nations called for a ceasefire between the two countries.
June 12
The Congo alleged that Rwanda intended to occupy the city of Bunagana.
June 13
On June 13, M23 forces captured the city of Bunagana from the DRC, forcing about 30,000 people civilian to flee to Uganda. However, the DRC claimed that Rwandan forces were helping to occupy the city. The rebels claimed that taking Bunagana wasn't their goal but decided to do it after repeated attacks by the Congolese army. They also said that they were open to doing direct negotiations with the government. The DRC described the fall of Bunagana as "no less than an invasion" by Rwanda. Two senior Congolese security sources claimed that Uganda was also helping the M23 in their offensive. That same day, Rwanda charged the MONUSCO mission of taking sides in the conflict, which it said was allowing the Congo to carry out cross-border attacks in Rwanda.
The heavy fighting also caused about 137 Congolese soldiers and 37 police officers to flee into Uganda, where they surrendered to Ugandan forces.
A Kinyarwanda speaking DRC Armed Forces lieutenant colonel was attacked and beaten by a mob in Kisangani.
June 15
Thousands of demonstrators organized a protest against Rwandan actions in Goma. The protest quickly turned into an anti-Rwandan riot as an angry mob pillaged and attacked shops owned by Rwandans, seizing vehicles to check if Rwandans were inside. Congolese riot police fired tear gas at protesters after some tried to enter a border checkpoint at the Rwandan border. Several Rwandans in Goma responded by fleeing the country.
On the same day, the DRC suspended all "memoranda of understanding, agreements, and conventions concluded with Rwanda", demanding the withdrawal of all alleged Rwandan military personnel within the boundaries of the country.
June 17
Just a few hours after Congolese security officials called for the DRC to cut all ties with Rwanda, a Congolese soldier crossed into Rubavu District carrying an AK-47 and was shot to death by a Rwanda National Police officer. The Rwanda Defence Force said that the soldier was killed after he started shooting at civilians and security forces, and had injured two officers. The Congo shut down the two countries' border in response to the officer's death, adding that it would open an investigation into the events.
As a vehicle brought back the officer's body to Goma, a crowd made up of hundreds of people followed the vehicle shouting "hero, hero" and describing President of Rwanda Paul Kagame as an assassin. Some members of the crowd were documented yelling hateful slogans against Tutsis.
August
In early August, a report for the United Nations by independent experts was leaked to the press. The report provided evidence that Rwandan troops had entered Congolese territory to support M23, fighting alongside the insurgents. These findings led to calls by journalists and officials in the DRC for the UN to sanction Rwanda.

The Gator Guard Drill Team, abbreviated GGDT, is a precision drill team and military fraternity based at the University of Florida. The team is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida. Founded in 1953, the Gator Guard is most widely known for its annual performances in the New Orleans Mardi Gras Parades.
In 2016, the team consisted of 31 active male and female members.
Unit history and background
The Gator Guard Drill Team was founded in 1953 at the University of Florida. The drill team was formed by cadets from the University of Florida ROTC program. The Gator Guard performs annually at the University of Florida's Homecoming Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid-City and King Rex parades at the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The Drill Team uses M1903 rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances. In addition, the Gator Guard also performs Color Guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the SEC, and the MLB. The Gator Guard was modeled after the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment, "The Old Guard." The team makes an annual trip to Washington D.C. to train with The Old Guard.
The Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida's Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The founding class of the Gator Guard consisted of 16 cadets in 1953. The team's membership would see an all-time high of 72 members in 1957.
In many universities across the United States, ROTC participation was compulsory. This policy would be revoked in the 1960s, following opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, in favor of voluntary programs. This move from compulsory to voluntary participation in the UF ROTC program would cause a substantial decrease in enrollment of members, both in the ROTC program and in the Gator Guard Drill Team. This is largely why the team's enrollment peaked in 1957. From 1963 to 1972 the Gator Guard would hold an unprecedented nine year winning streak as the "Best Drill Unit" in the All-Florida Invitational Drill Meet, held in Sarasota, Florida.
On August 18, 1976, an alumnus of the Gator Guard, Mark T. Barrett, assigned to United States Forces Korea would tragically be at the center of the Axe Murder Incident. Assigned to the Joint Security Area of the Demilitarized Zone, Lieutenant Barrett would be part of a detail sent to cut down a poplar tree that had been blocking the view of the United Nations observers. While in the process of cutting down the tree, the detail was assaulted by North Koreans and Lieutenant Barrett was killed. The incident would be recognized internationally, and had the potential to spark an escalation of conflict on the Korean peninsula. A memorial for LT Barrett currently stands in front of Van Fleet Hall (Gainesville, Florida). The Gator Guard performs an annual changing of the Guard ceremony over the course of 24 hours over Mark T. Barrett's memorial, in similar fashion to 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) Tomb of the Unknown Soldier changing of the guard.
In the 1970s, women would gain opportunities for entrance into ROTC programs, as the Army opened up positions in Field Artillery and the ordinance corps to female officers. Women coming into the Army through ROTC dovetailed with the elimination of the Women's Army Corps. The Gator Guard, having been an exclusively male team, would also see the entrance of female members in the coveted position of drillers, who would march and execute precision drill movements in parade as part of the team. The first female cadet to march with the drill team was during the 1973-1974 school year was Carmen Parrot. She was allowed to carry the Guidon during parades. The first female commander of the drill team would be Nancy A. Oxer in 1979. The first female GGDT member to be commissioned was Bonnie Chandler.
Between 2010 and 2015, the Gator Guard helped to create and train teams at other Florida universities modeled after the Gator Guard Drill Team. By 2015, the Gator Guard had successfully set up the 'Osprey Guard' at the University of North Florida, and the 'Seminole Guard' at Florida State University.
In 2016, the team consisted of 31 active male and female members.

The Constitution Society is an independent, non-party educational trust based in Westminster, London. It was established in 2009 to promote public understanding of the British Constitution and to work to encourage informed debate between legislators, academics and the public about proposals for constitutional change. The Constitution Society does not take any position on the merits of specific reform proposals but opposes ill-considered, piecemeal constitutional change. Alongside its focus on constitutional issues, The Constitution Society supports initiatives which aim to improve the quality of government and legislation generally in the UK.
History
The Constitution Society was founded in 2009 by Nat le Roux. It has expanded significantly since its inception and has influenced the national discussion of constitutional issues on several occasions. In 2017, Sir Malcolm Jack was appointed as the first President of The Constitution Society. In 2020, The Constitution Society started its own regular blog, which provides commentary on topical constitutional issues from a range of expert contributors. It continues to publish in-depth reports and provide support to a number of other initiatives.
Aims
The Constitution Society aims to improve understanding of the British constitution amongst the general public. Though neutral about substantive constitutional issues, The Constitution Society strongly supports due process and good government. It believes that constitutional change should only be introduced to address genuine deficiencies, and only after careful analysis and broad consultation, with adequate time for scrutiny and debate in Parliament, and not merely to serve the political interests of the government of the day. The Constitution Society believes that constitutional bills should be subject to a more rigorous parliamentary process than other types of legislation.
Activities
Notable publications
The Constitution Society regularly publishes papers by leading experts on a wide range of constitutional topics. Constitution Society papers have been cited in Select Committee reports, parliamentary debates and commented on in the media.
In April 2021, The Constitution Society published Union at the Crossroads: Can the British state handle the challenges of devolution? The report examined the UK government's approach to the multi-level territorial constitution since devolution. It identified a number of deficiencies in the machinery and culture of central government and was recognised as a major contribution to the debate on the future of the UK Union.
The Constitution Society published Good Chaps No More? Safeguarding the Constitution in Stressful Times by Andrew Blick and Peter Hennessy in November 2019. The paper looked at whether the so-called 'good chap' principle was coming under increasing strain and set out a number of possible ‘protective mechanisms' for the UK constitution. It has since been cited in House of Lords debates.
The Constitution Society has also contributed to the debate around electoral systems and reform. In April 2019, it published The Electoral System and British Politics which analysed the practical impact of the 'First-Past-the-Post' electoral system, arguing that it no longer delivers the outcomes its advocates claim.
The Constitution Society also produced several Brexit-related publications after the referendum in 2016 which examined, amongst other things, the legal implications, legislative options and a paper by Richard Rawlings on the impact on intergovernmental relations, since cited by Lord Wigley. It has also looked at the place of referendums within the UK's constitutional system more generally.
Further notable report topics have included: the role of the House of Lords; constituency boundaries and electoral registration; the Human Rights Act 1998 and judicial review; the possibility of a UK Constitutional Convention; and data and democracy in the digital age.
The Constitution Society also regularly submits evidence to parliamentary Select Committee inquiries.
United Kingdom Constitution Monitoring Group
In February 2021, The Constitution Society announced that it was supporting a new initiative: the United Kingdom Constitution Monitoring Group (UKCMG). Made up of a group of experts and practitioners, the UKCMG's principal purpose is to assess developments in the UK constitution. The initiative covers areas including government accountability; arrangements for upholding the rule of law and individual rights; the territorial governance of the UK; and how the key aspects of such issues can be distilled and communicated to the public. The UKCMG has submitted evidence to several parliamentary Select Committee inquiries and published a statement of 20 principles expressing what the Group sees as the core values underpinning the proper operation of the UK system of governance.

Cosmos (subtitled The Science of Everything) is a science magazine published in Adelaide, South Australia, by the Royal Institution of Australia that covers science globally. It appears four times a year in print as Cosmos Magazine, and the online edition is updated daily with news as well as long features and multi-media content, and includes the print magazine content. Cosmos Weekly is a subscription-based weekly online edition published on Fridays, and a podcast was launched in April 2022.
History
The magazine was established in Sydney in November 2004 by the Sydney magazine publishing executive Kylie Ahern and science journalist Wilson da Silva. with the first issue published in 2005.
In June 2006, the magazine launched a daily Internet news and features service.
The magazine was the originator of Hello from Earth, a web-based initiative to send messages from the public, each just 160 characters in length, to Gliese 581d, the (then) nearest Earth-like planet outside the Solar System. Created as a science communication exercise for 2009 National Science Week in Australia, it collected nearly 26,000 messages that were beamed by NASA's Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex on 28 August 2009.
In June 2013 the company, then owned by Luna Media, moved to Melbourne following its acquisition in February 2013 by Australia's Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, and his wife Elizabeth Finkel, a science journalist, who became editor-in-chief. The Finkels were already part-owners, and acquired the remainder from Ahern and Da Silva, who remained on the editorial staff.
On 1 September 2018, custodianship of the magazine was transferred to Royal Institution of Australia (RiAus), a not-for-profit science media organisation based in Adelaide.
In April 2021 Cosmos Weekly was launched, and exactly a year later, a podcast on the LiSTNR app, featuring science explainers, was launched.
Writers whose work have featured include Margaret Wertheim, Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery, Richard Dawkins, Edward O. Wilson, Michio Kaku, Susan Greenfield, Steven Pinker, Paul Davies, Simon Singh and Oliver Sacks.

Human Racing is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Nik Kershaw, released on 27 February 1984 by MCA Records. Several songs like "Drum Talk" were based around improvisation; other songs, like "I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me", had a political message.
Kershaw's most commercially successful solo album, it peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and reached the top 10 in several other countries, including Germany, Finland, and Norway. The album spawned four charting singles in the United Kingdom. "Wouldn't It Be Good" peaked at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart; "Dancing Girls" peaked at No. 13; "I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" at No. 2; "Human Racing" at No. 19. Human Racing was the 22nd best-selling album of 1984 in the UK and received a nomination for Best British Album at the 1985 Brit Awards. The album has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).
The album was re-released on 27 February 2012, on Universal's new Re-presents imprint featuring rare bonus content. The reissue is a 2-CD set with the original album digitally remastered from the original 1/2" mix tapes; the bonus content consists of associated 12" mixes and B-sides including a previously unreleased version of "Bogart", a special brass mix of "Shame on You" and a live version of "Cloak and Dagger" recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon.
Critical reception
Smash Hits magazine gave the album a highly negative review, awarding it 1 out of 10, and calling it "Competent but relentlessly dull synthesised meanderings of no importance to anyone but Mr Kershaw himself (and even he doesn't sound that interested)." Reviewing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Scott Bultman wrote of the album: "His debut, although rough around the edges, showed talent and promise."

The 1902 Bury by-election was a by-election held in England on 10 May 1902 for the House of Commons constituency of Bury in Lancashire.
It was the first by-election gain by the Liberal Party from the ruling Conservatives in the Parliament of 1900–1906 and it can arguably be said to have set in motion the swing to the Liberals from the Tories which brought twenty by-election gains in all over the following months, leading to the Liberals landslide victory in the 1906 general election.
Vacancy
The election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), James Kenyon.
Candidates
The Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist Party allies already had a candidate in the field, as Kenyon had made known his intention to stand down because of ill-health. They had chosen Harry Lawson, the former Liberal MP.
The Liberals re-selected their candidate from the 1900 general election George Toulmin, a Lancashire newspaper proprietor.
It was reported that at a meeting of socialists at Bury on 28 April 1902 it was agreed to support a socialist candidate at the forthcoming election, if one were nominated. There were splits in the socialist camp however. The Independent Labour Party decided to dissociate itself from the decision of the Social Democratic Federation to bring forward a candidate and chose to support Toulmin. The Labour Representation Committee in Bury held a meeting to decide their position but declined in the end to stand a candidate. The traditional Lib-Lab alignment seemed to be holding in Bury with the trade unions in the cotton industry coming out strongly for Toulmin.
Issues
Irish Home Rule
A principal issue in the election was the question of Irish Home Rule. This was the issue which had split the Liberal Party in 1886 and the constituency of Bury was typical of many at the time. The sitting Liberal MP, Sir Henry James had defected to the Liberals Unionists in opposition to Home Rule and he retained his seat unopposed at the 1886 general election. With Conservative support Bury had been held for the Unionist cause at each election since. When the by-election was called one of the first acts recorded was a public vote of support for Toulmin by the Irish Nationalist electors of the town, on the basis that they had received from him a satisfactory declaration of his sympathy with the cause of Home Rule. They urged all Irish voters in the constituency to vote for Toulmin to prevent the election of Lawson, who they described as a renegade on Home Rule and a coercionist. A meeting of Roman Catholic voters in the town was held on 4 May 1902 to discuss the election but no resolutions of support for either candidate were passed.
Levy on corn
Taxation and the policy of Free Trade once more became central election issues at Bury. The Conservative government had introduced a duty on corn as a revenue measure to help meet the cost of the Boer War. The Liberal leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman wrote to Toulmin deploring the government's proposed introduction of a duty on corn, claiming this would lead to the poorest in the community having to pay more for their bread or suffering some deterioration in the quality of their loaf and stating that this measure was the first step in the government's plan to reverse the country's traditional Free Trade approach. The Conservatives said most of any extra burden would fall on businessmen at home or abroad and what Lawson described in a speech as the 'middlemen' adding that the British consumer would have to pay only one extra penny on every 32 loaves. The Times newspaper identified the one shilling corn duty as "the real horse [the candidates] are riding on".
Education and the Boer War
Other issues included the Education Bill. Toulmin apparently held strong views against the legislation although as Bury had no school board as set up by the Elementary Education Act 1870, it was not thought to have such great resonance as elsewhere. The Boer War was also the subject of debate between the candidates. Joseph Chamberlain the great Liberal Unionist Secretary of State for the Colonies urged the electors of Bury not to support a party willing to surrender to the Boers. The voters of Bury were probably as patriotic as any other men but the spiralling cost of the war was a real issue for them. First the government had raised income tax and now the corn levy was thought to herald a bread tax and it was this perception which fostered support for the Liberals rather than the pro-war Unionists.
Result
The result was a Liberal gain from the Conservatives perhaps against the odds. The Times, taking the temperature of local opinion in the constituency, had predicted a Unionist hold by a majority of around 500 votes.
The corn tax issue seems to have been more of true vote winner for the Liberals than even political correspondents anticipated as Toulmin took the seat with a majority of 414 – a swing of 9% and he continued to hold it at the next three general elections. The corn duty continued to play well for the Liberals at forthcoming by-elections in predominantly working class constituencies. Government hopes that its unpopularity would soon fade were misplaced. The Conservative MP for Oldham, Winston Churchill conceded to Prime Minister Arthur Balfour six months after the Bury result that the corn tax remained 'very unpopular'.

George Karl Wentzlaff, whose stage name was George "Foghorn" Winslow (May 3, 1946 June 13, 2015), was an American child actor of the 1950s known for his stentorian voice and deadpan demeanor. He appeared in several films, opposite such stars as Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, Dean Martin, and Jerry Lewis. In the late 1950s, he retired from acting.
Career
Nicknamed "Foghorn" for his raspy voice as a slender child with dark blond hair and deep blue eyes, Wentzlaff, a Los Angeles native, broke into the entertainment business on Art Linkletter's family-oriented radio program, People are Funny. Asked his name by Linkletter, the youngster said: "George Wentzlaff, but I'd rather be Casey Jones", with a delivery that cracked up Linkletter and the audience and led to about 20 subsequent appearances on the show.
Actor Cary Grant, who heard the show and was impressed with Wentzlaff's unusual voice and comedy instincts, introduced him to director Norman Taurog, leading to his roles in Grant's films, Room for One More (1952) and Monkey Business (also 1952), which co-stars Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe. Next up was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), in which Wentzlaff — playing Henry Spofford III, Monroe's young admirer — stole scenes from the actress, including his line about her possessing a "certain animal magnetism". In the comedy Mister Scoutmaster (1953), he traded barbs with Clifton Webb, and he had a small role in the musical comedy Artists and Models (1955), with Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Dorothy Malone and newcomer Shirley MacLaine in what blogger Aurora called Wentzlaff's "last 'good' movie."
He also appeared in television episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Blondie and Dear Phoebe. Wentzlaff's final screen appearance came in the feature film, Wild Heritage (1958), cast as 'Talbot Breslin', son to film's lead, Maureen O'Sullivan.
Personal life and death
Retiring from show business at age 12, Wentzlaff finished school, served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, moved to Camp Meeker in the late 1970s and retired from the Postal Service a few years before his death. Wentzlaff died of a heart attack June 13, 2015, at age 69. His body was found by a friend the following day.
A memorial service was held in Petaluma, California, in July 2015, followed by burial with military honors at the Sacramento Valley National Cemetery.

The Keillers Park murder is a famous Swedish criminal case. On 23 July 1997, the body of an unknown man was discovered in a park in the city of Gothenburg, in western Sweden. The man, who had been shot twice with a pistol, was identified two days later than Josef ben Meddour (aged 36), a homosexual and Algerian national, who had been living in Sweden for many years.
After many months of investigation, the police were able to apprehend the two murderers. They were named as Jon Nödtveidt (aged 22), the frontman of extreme metal band Dissection, and his friend Vlad (aged 20), an Iranian national settled in Sweden. The two men, who confessed to their crime, were eventually sentenced by a court of appeal to ten years of incarceration. Vlad was also a suspect in other murder and assault cases around that time.
Nödtveidt and Vlad, who were members of Temple of the Black Light, had on several occasions discussed performing human sacrifices before they murdered Meddour. Whether the motive was occult-related or not could not be clearly established, however, and the murder was described as a homophobic hate crime by the Swedish police.
Discovery of the body
On 23 July 1997, at around 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy discovered the body of a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Gothenburg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.
No identification was found on the corpse, but a female police officer recognized the man as someone who was often seen in the area of Svingeln square and who, with his curled hair and sunglasses, looked like Swedish singer Magnus Uggla. In the neighbourhood, a shop attendant told the police that the actual name of the victim was Josef and that he was often in the company of a Finnish-looking man. Thanks to this testimony, the police were able to identify Josef ben Meddour, aged 36, an Algerian national. Settled in Sweden for about ten years, Meddour was gay, and the Finnish-looking man was his boyfriend.
First leads
The police first suspected the victim's boyfriend. The head cap recovered near the body was his, he had no alibi, and the couple was known for their frequent arguments. After twelve days in custody, the boyfriend was nevertheless released, and he was later cleared of all suspicion.
The investigators then learned that on the evening of 22 July, Meddour had received the visit of militants of the GIA, an Algerian Islamic organisation. As Meddour himself was known for his opposition to the GIA, the police considered the possibility of a political assassination. Other people were interrogated, but leading to no breakthrough, and the investigators soon realised they were headed in the wrong direction.
Arrests
On 15 December 1997, a 23-year-old woman entered a police station in Stockholm, the Swedish capital. She wanted to file a complaint against her boyfriend Vlad, whom she accused of beating her, and threatening to kill her. She also told the police officers present that Vlad had once confessed to her that he was, along with his friend Jon, the perpetrator of the Keillers Park murder.
The story that Vlad had told the young woman was as follows: he and Nödtveidt met Meddour in a street of Gothenburg, and invited him to follow them to Keillers Park. There, they first tried to immobilise him with an electroshock weapon (Taser), which somehow did not succeed. Meddour tried to run away, but Vlad shot him in the back with a pistol. While Meddour was lying on the ground, Vlad handed the gun to Nödtveidt, who shot a second bullet into his head.
The 23-year-old woman also told the police that she knew the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Alerted, police investigators in Gothenburg could only acknowledge that observations made on the crime scene matched the woman's account of the events. Vlad was arrested the same day at his home in Stockholm. He was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol. Nödtveidt was apprehended in Gothenburg on the morning of 18 December.
Confessions
The two suspects at first denied any involvement in Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, Nödtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Gothenburg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while Nödtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who at the sight of their clothes, asked them if they were Satanists, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, Nödtveidt and Vlad tried to push back the unknown man, but he insisted. This was how they came to know Meddour.
The two friends eventually invited Meddour to follow them to Nödtveidt's home. While on the way, Meddour's behaviour and speech made clear he was a homosexual, which made Nödtveidt and Vlad feel angry and offended. Once they reached Nödtveidt's home, Meddour appeared scared and refused to step in. Nödtveidt and Vlad then suggested continuing their discussion about Satanism at Keillers Park. The three men hit the streets again, but before they left, Nödtveidt entered his flat to pick up the pistol and the Taser. Once at Keillers Park, Vlad took the Taser from Nödtveidt, and tried unsuccessfully to immobilise Meddour. Meddour attempted to run away, but his escape was cut short when Vlad shot a first bullet in his back, followed by a second bullet in his head.
When faced with his contradictions, Vlad also confessed to the murder. His version of the events was very similar to Nödtveidt's, apart from one significant difference: according to him, Nödtveidt was the one who had held the gun, and who had pulled the trigger twice.
Background
The investigation led the Gothenburg police into the world of black metal and Satanism.
Black metal
Nödtveidt was the leader of a musical band, Dissection, that had earned some fame in the small world of early black metal, a subgenre of heavy metal characterised by the occultism and raw violence of its lyrics, and by the extreme behaviour and lifestyle of its followers. In the middle of the nineties, the brief history of black metal was already riddled with violent deaths.
In 1991, Per Ohlin, the Swedish singer of a Norwegian band called Mayhem, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun. His body was found by the band's leader, Øystein Aarseth, who instead of calling the police immediately, left to buy a disposable camera, and came back to take photographs of the corpse, which were eventually used for the bootleg live album Dawn of the Black Hearts (whose creator, Mauricio Montoya Botero, died in 2002 by suicide). Aarseth also picked up fragments of his friend's skull, which ended up on a display shelf at the Helvete record shop in Oslo.
The following year, Bård "Faust" Eithun, a co-worker of Aarseth, stabbed a homosexual man in a park in Lillehammer. The murderer later stated homophobia as the motive for his act. Aarseth himself was stabbed to death in 1993 by a Norwegian musician, Varg Vikernes, who was known for his solo project Burzum. Vikernes claims that the murder was in fact an act of self-defense, as Aarseth had allegedly planned to murder him. Vikernes – who was also accused of burning three churches – was sentenced in 1994 to 21 years in prison.
Satanism
When the arrests were made on 15 and 18 December 1997, the police discovered satanic altars in the homes of the two suspects. A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts. Nödtveidt and Vlad were members of a satanic organization called Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO), of which Vlad was one of the founders, and that, according to the police, never had more than a handful of followers.
During their investigations, the police interrogated former members of the MLO, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons, and animal sacrifices (specifically cats, which were bought through classified ads). During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt's girlfriend.
These plans led to the defection of some members of the MLO, who did not want to take part in any assassination, or who feared for their own lives. As a result, when the arrests were made, the number of active members was down to three: Nödtveidt, Vlad, and his girlfriend.
Trials
During the trial, the motives of the murder were not made clear as to whether it was a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about, or if it was rather a hate crime, motivated by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality. According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, Nötveidt stated during interrogation that the murder was a "sacrifice to Satan", but later retracted the statement. According to Ohlin, there is no denying that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.
On 6 July 1998, Nödtveidt was sentenced by the Gothenburg district court to eight years in prison for accessory to murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Vlad was sentenced to ten years for murder, violence against his girlfriend, illegal possession of a firearm and possession of body parts. All three parties appealed the verdict.
The Court of Appeal for Western Sweden gave its verdict on 25 September 1998. Nödtveidt was this time sentenced to ten years in prison, just as Vlad, whose sentence was confirmed.
Epilogue
Nödtveidt and Vlad were released in 2004, after spending seven years in prison. Nödtveidt committed suicide in 2006. His body was found at his home, surrounded by a ring of candles, a ritual book by his side.
Josef ben Meddour's body was repatriated to Algeria. He was buried in the national capital, Algiers.

South of the Clouds is a 2018 novel by John D. Kuhns
Plot summary
The Great Recession of 2008 humbled many good men. Once
featured on the front pages of New York's business and society
papers, Jack Davis had spiraled downward in the aftermath of the crisis.
How far will someone go to get their reputation back? Jack is about to find out.
Exiled to the last remnant of his investment empire—a rusty silicon smelter
in the Chinese jungle north of the Burmese border—his comeback seems farfetched.
But it's either take his best shot or crawl away from the world in shame.
His prospects appear grim when Jack discovers his employees are using the
company's trucks to run jade from Burma over the border to China. His first
instinct is to clean house—until he learns they're making more money running
jade than he is smelting silicon.
Set in a dangerous, once-obscure corner of the world that has recently vaulted
to prominence, South of the Clouds tells the story of an American forced to
choose, not between right and wrong --"there's no legal here"—but between
the predictable and the unknown, between a stale life or one with Mei.
Wall Street isn't only about greed and cynicism. There are heroes there too.
Commentary for South of the Clouds
"An engaging novel with a protagonist who remains appealing, even as he tiptoes into shady territory,"—Kirkus Review.

Sherman Cedric Williams (born August 13, 1973) is a former American football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys; he was a member of their Super Bowl XXX team that defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football at the University of Alabama.
Early years
Williams attended Mattie T. Blount High School, where as a senior he became the first running back in Alabama prep history to rush for over 3,000 yards in a season, after registering 3,004 rushing yards, 307 carries and 31 touchdowns. He also received All-State honors, while leading his team to the Class 5A state title and receiving player of the year honors.
College career
He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Alabama. As a freshman, he played in 8 games, tallying 108 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.
As a sophomore, he was the team's fourth leading rusher behind Derrick Lassic, collecting 299 yards on 64 carries and 8 touchdowns. His best game came against Louisiana State University, when he rushed for 69 yards and 2 touchdowns on 10 carries. He was a member of the 1992 National Championship team. In the Sugar Bowl against the University of Miami, he had the first touchdown of the game, a two-yard run.
As a junior, he was named the starter in the third game in place of an injured Chris Anderson. He never gave back the job and opened the season with five straight 100 rushing yard games. He posted 738 rushing yards with 9 touchdowns, including 148 yards on 24 carries against the University of Arkansas.
In his senior season he rushed for 1,341 yards (second in school history) and became only the fourth Bama player to reach 1,000 rushing yards in a season. His 291 carries broke the school record for a season and his 138.5 all-purpose yards-per-game ranked 16th best in the nation. He earned All-SEC and second-team All-American honors in 1994. In the Florida Citrus Bowl, he became the first Bama player to gain over 100 yards rushing and receiving in a postseason game, after posting 166 rushing yards on 27 carries and 8 receptions for 155 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown reception for the winning touchdown with 42 seconds remaining, in the 24-17 victory over Ohio State University.
Williams finished his college career with 2,486 rushing yards (fifth in school history), 535 carries (third in school history), 27 rushing touchdowns (fourth in school history) and 424 receiving yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. He is also remembered for his signature touchdown dance, the "Sherman Shake".
Professional career
Entering the 1995 NFL draft, the Dallas Cowboys considered their roster so strong, that they drafted players based on their contributions as backups. The team traded their first round draft choice (#28-Derrick Brooks) to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two second-round picks (#41-Ron Davis and #63-Shane Hannah). The Cowboys selected Williams with their first choice in the second round (46th overall), which was criticized by the media and quarterback Troy Aikman, for using a high selection on a backup player. As a rookie, he was a part of the Super Bowl XXX championship team. He tallied 205 rushing yards (second on the team) and one touchdown.
In 1996, he had 269 rushing yards. In 1997, he was expected to relieve more of Emmitt Smith's workload, but the additional playing time exposed him as fumble-prone, even though he had a career-high 468 rushing yards.
Williams was released during the 1998 offseason, after the team signed Chris Warren to be the backup running back to improve their depth. When Warren strained his groin in preseason, the team re-signed Williams as insurance. He contributed by being third on the team on special teams tackles (17) and while Warren's injury forced him to miss eight regular season games, Williams stepped up against the New York Giants in Week 3, when he rushed for 61 yards on 20 carries (including an 18-yard touchdown run) and in the final game of the regular season against the Washington Redskins, when he rushed for 90 yards on 23 carries and also caught three passes for 19 yards.
In the spring of 1999, Williams played for the Mobile Admirals of the short-lived Regional Football League. The Admirals were league champions, and Williams was named league MVP. In the 1999 NFL preseason, after the Cowboys third team running back (Tarik Smith) suffered a season-ending knee surgery, Williams was once more re-signed, but was eventually released after the first game of the regular season.
Personal life
In 2000, Williams was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison, for three counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and a separate plea for passing counterfeit currency. Saying that his time as a professional football player toughened him, Williams said in a prison interview, "You know, I would think that things that would kill the average man wouldn't even make me flinch". He was incarcerated on April 20, 2000. He was released on March 1, 2014.
After his release from prison, Williams started a community assistance program for disadvantaged children and returned to the University of Alabama, receiving his degree in May 2018.

Anorectal varices are the dilation of collateral submucosal vessels due to backflow in the veins of the rectum. Typically this occurs due to portal hypertension which shunts venous blood from the portal system through the portosystemic anastomosis present at this site into the systemic venous system. This can also occur in the esophagus, causing esophageal varices, and at the level of the umbilicus, causing caput medusae. Between 44% and 78% of patients with portal hypertension get anorectal varices.
Signs and symptoms
Pathogenesis
Blood from the superior portion of the rectum normally drains into the superior rectal vein and via the inferior mesenteric vein to the liver as part of the portal venous system. Blood from the middle and inferior portions of the rectum is drained via the middle and inferior rectal veins. In portal hypertension, venous resistance is increased within the portal venous system; when the pressure in the portal venous system increases above that of the systemic, blood is shunted through the portosystemic anastomoses. The shunting of blood and consequential increase of pressure through the collateral veins causes the varicosities.
Diagnosis
The terms rectal varices and haemorrhoids are often used interchangeably, but this is not correct. Haemorrhoids occur due to prolapse of the rectal venous plexus and are no more common in patients with portal hypertension than those without. Rectal varices, however, are only found in patients with portal hypertension and are common in conditions such as cirrhosis.
Treatment
Unlike esophageal varices, rectal varices are less prone to bleeding, are less serious when a bleed does occur, and are easier to treat because of the more accessible location. However, in some cases, rectal varices can result in severe bleeding.
Typically, treatment consists of addressing the underlying portal hypertension. Some treatments include portosystemic shunting, ligation, and under-running suturing. Insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been shown to alleviate varices caused by portal hypertension. Successful treatment of portal hypertension that subsequently reduces anorectal varices provides a confirmation of the initial diagnosis, allowing for a distinction between varices and hemorrhoids, which would not have been alleviated by reduction of portal hypertension.

William Wirt Sikes (November 23, 1836 – August 18, 1883) was an American journalist and writer, perhaps best known today for his writings on Welsh folklore and customs.
Early life
William Wirt Sikes was born in Watertown, New York, the son of William Johnson Sikes, a prominent local physician. He was the seventh of eleven children, of whom only six survived to adulthood. Sikes himself was seriously ill as a child and almost lost his hearing, so he was largely educated at home. At fourteen he went to work for a printer and learned how to set type. He supported himself thereafter by typesetting, contributing to local newspapers, and giving temperance lectures.
At the age of nineteen, on August 28, 1855, he married Jeannette Annie Wilcox (1837–1889); they had two children, George Preston Sikes (1856–1957) and Clara Jeanette Sikes (1858–1956).
Career in America
In 1856 he was working at the Utica Morning Herald as a typesetter and contributor. He published a book of stories and poems, A Book for the Winter-Evening Fireside, in 1858. He spent time in Chicago working at newspapers there, and around 1860 worked on a paper called City and Country in Nyack, New York. In 1862 he was given the job of canal inspector in Chicago for the state-owned Illinois and Michigan Canal. While in Chicago he was separated from his wife, by mutual consent; they divorced in 1870.
Between 1865 and 1867 he went to New York City to work on newspapers there; he took a special interest in the lives of the poor there. He continued to write, publishing stories in The Youth's Companion, Oliver Optic's Magazine, and others. He published two novels, The World's Broad Stage (serialized in the Toledo Blade) and One Poor Girl (1869). Sikes gave lectures and was represented by the Boston Lyceum Bureau from 1869 to 1871; he married fellow lecturer Olive Logan on December 19, 1871.
In Europe
After their marriage the couple went to Europe, where they continued to practice journalism. Sikes produced a biographical and critical piece on the Wiertz Museum for Harper's Magazine in 1873 which was later reprinted by the museum.
In June 1876 Sikes was appointed U.S. Consul at Cardiff, Wales. Over the next few years Sikes produced a number of pieces on Welsh folklore, mythology, and customs, collected as British Goblins; Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends, and Traditions (1880) and Rambles and Studies in Old South Wales (1881). He also wrote Studies of Assassination (1881). He died in Cardiff in 1883 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery, Brookwood, Surrey.
Sikes is said to have used as many as thirty pseudonyms for his prolific output, as well as material published under his own name. As "Burton Saxe" he wrote the dime novel The Black Hunter; or, The Cave Secret (American Tales #22, 1865).
A literary appreciation
In George Presbury Rowell's memoir Forty Years an Advertising Agent, he recalls a column in the New York Tribune, "wherein certain literary characters were reviewed in grades and classes, beginning with - I don't remember whom, Thackeray perhaps, and descending, as the editor expressed it, 'down to Wirt Sikes'".

Harperrig Reservoir is a reservoir in West Lothian, Scotland, to the north of the Pentland Hills, south of Mid Calder. The Water of Leith flows through it, and nearby are Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir. It has been proposed that the reservoir be designated as a local nature reserve to be managed by West Lothian Council.
History and usage
Harperrig Reservoir was created in 1860 as part of a scheme to improve the supply of drinking water to Edinburgh, its function being as a compensation reservoir to guarantee a supply of water to the mills along the course of the Water of Leith. The dam was raised in height in 1890. In 2006 ownership of the reservoir was transferred from Scottish Water to the City of Edinburgh Council, the Council undertook modifications to the outflow in 2007–2008 as part of the Water of Leith Flood Prevention Scheme so that the reservoir could be used to store flood water and regulate the downstream flow of the Water of Leith.
Description
Harperrig reservoir lies in the middle of a basin on the northwestern side of the Pentland Hills some from south west of Edinburgh. The dam is in height and is in length. The reservoir holds of water and has a surface area of .
Historical sites within the catchment
The catchment area of Hareprrig reservoir includes the Scheduled Ancient Monuments which lie on East Cairn Hill and West Cairn Hill which date from the Bronze Age. The Old Schoolhouse at Causewayend is a category B Listed Building and the Royal Commission Inventory lists several other sites of historical interest. The ruin of Cairns Castle, dating from around 1440 and built by George Crichton, is situated on a hillock which projects into the reservoir.
Fishing
At Harperrig Reservoir the fishing season runs from 15 March to 15 October and the fishing permits are administered and sold by Harperrig Fisheries Ltd, a company which represents the various owners of the fishing rights. Both boat and bank fishing are allowed and the reservoir is stocked with brown trout.
Wilidlife interest
Harperrig reservoir is known to be used by Eurasian otter and an artificial holt has been provided. An island in the reservoir, called Gull island, provides a safe breeding habitat for gulls and wildfowl. Geese and ducks use the reservoir for wintering. It is one of only four sites in the Lothians where the stonefly leuctra leuctra has been recorded.

The Gare de Metz-Ville is the main railway station serving the city of Metz, capital of Lorraine, France. Sometimes spoken of as the Station Palace as it displays the apartments of the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, Metz station has been registered as a Historic Monument since 15 January 1975. This designation gives legal protection to the station's facade, the roof, the departure hall, the honorary lounge, and the former station restaurant with its interior decorations.
History and strategic role
The station in Metz was a central point of plans for a new urban area in Metz, now called the Imperial Quarter, which was built during the first annexation of Metz into the German Empire. In order to "Germanify" the city, Kaiser Wilhelm II decided upon the creation of a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture. The district was conceived by German architect Conrad Wahn and is now commonly called the Imperial District.
The railway station constitutes the cornerstone of this district, not far from the historic downtown. Its first aim was military usage and it had to answer a strategic need: For the success of the Schlieffen plan, the Kaiser had to be able to transport his troops from France to Russia in just 24 hours. This resulted in a sizeable station with platforms large enough to accommodate troops on foot and on horseback. So the Metz railway station was directly linked to Berlin via the Cannons Railway.
Architecture
The railway station is a 350-metre-long neo-Romanesque building built between 1905 and 1908 by German architect Jürgen Kröger, assisted by the architects Jürgensen and Bachmann, as well as by the sculptor Schirmer. It was built in the pale grey stoneware of Niderviller, in marked contrast to the other buildings of the city, which are mainly built in yellow limestone. Because of the swampy soil of the area, the station and its water tower are built on 3,034 foundation piles which run from ten to seventeen metres deep, made from the system of reinforced concrete which had just been developed by the French engineer François Hennebique.
The station building is architecturally reminiscent of the shape of a church in the departure hall area, with a clock tower rising 40m in height (said to be designed by Kaiser Wilhelm himself); on the other hand, the arrivals hall and restaurant echo the form of an imperial palace. The purpose of this is to represent the religious and temporal powers of the Holy Roman emperors. The statue of the Knight Roland at the angle of the clock tower represents Imperial protection over Metz. In the great hallway a stained glass window depicts the Emperor Charlemagne sitting on his throne. Kaiser Wilhelm appreciated his travels to Metz and the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which was administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. So at the railway station can be seen the apartments he used during his visits to the city; today they have been transformed into offices for the SNCF Railway Company.
The forecourt of the railway station is adorned by street furnitures designed by Philippe Starck.
Transport
The Gare de Metz-Ville is connected to the French TGV high speed train network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris, the city of Luxembourg, Dijon, Lyon, Marseille, and Montpellier. The time from Paris East station to Metz railway station is about 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz railway station is connected to the Lorraine TGV station, located at Louvigny, at the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Brussels, Bordeaux and France international Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (without stopping in Paris).
Also Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system TER Grand Est. One of its main lines is the Nancy-Metz-Luxembourg line, completed by many lines going to main cities of the area.

Kelly Moran (September 21, 1960 – April 4, 2010) was an American professional speedway rider who rode for a number of British clubs and also represented USA. Kelly's younger brother Shawn Moran was also a successful speedway rider who won the European (World) Under-21 World Championship in 1981 and the Long Track World Championship in 1983.
Career
Moran was known as "Jelly Man" and "the Wizard of Balance" for the way he would hang off his machine when cornering. He arrived in England to race for Hull in 1978 as a teenager, but his season was curtailed when he crashed heavily at the Hackney Wick Stadium and suffered multiple injuries. However, the following year he qualified for his first World Championship Final at the Silesian Stadium in Poland. After finishing equal third with 11 points from his five rides (two wins, two seconds and a third), Moran was involved in a four-way run-off for third and fourth places with England's Michael Lee, Australian Billy Sanders, and defending champion Ole Olsen from Denmark. Lee won the run-off from Moran, Sanders and Olsen.
A dispute over terms saw Kelly make a late start to his British season with Birmingham. But he was on the move again in 1981 when he joined the Eastbourne Eagles where he became a spectacular crowd pleaser. He then qualified for his second World Championship Final in 1982 where he again finished fourth, this time in front of his home crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Despite experiencing his best ever season in 1982, he decided to remain in California for the next three years. During this period he won back-to-back US National Championships in 1983 and 1984, and qualified for his third and last World Championship Final in 1984 at the Ullevi stadium in Göteborg, Sweden. Once more he finished fourth with 11 points.
In 1986 Kelly joined his younger brother Shawn at the Sheffield Tigers where he had three successful years and helped himself to 1012.5 points at an average of 8.88. He represented his country on several occasions and it was his partnership with Shawn that helped United States team to win the 1982 and 1990 Speedway World Team Cups.
Following Sheffield's closure Kelly moved to the Belle Vue Aces with his brother, where he remained until a dip in form saw him move from Belle Vue to Swindon early in 1992. A broken collar bone interrupted his spell at Swindon, but he struggled for form in a team that was rooted at the foot of the league. He retired from speedway at the end of the season, but he made a brief comeback in 2003 racing in North America. However, his comeback lasted just the one season.
Death
Kelly Moran, a heavy cigarette smoker, died in his home town, Huntington Beach, California, on April 4, 2010 from complications of emphysema. He was 49 years old at the time of his passing.
A public memorial service was held for Kelly Moran on April 10, 2010 at his home track, the Costa Mesa Speedway in Los Angeles, organised by close friend and long time sponsor Peter Rovazzini of Rovazzini Electric. Among those who attended and gave speeches about Kelly were Bruce Penhall, Bobby Schwartz, Dennis Sigalos, Ron Preston, John Cook, and Briggs. Condolence messages sent from Australian rider John Titman and 15 time World Champion Ivan Mauger were read out by those present.

Daen Lao Range
is a fictional character in the Sailor Moon media franchise. She is a black cat who has the ability to talk, and serves as a mentoring figure for the titular character and her companions, the Sailor Guardians. Luna makes her debut in the first act or episode of each version of the series, in which she meets Usagi Tsukino and tells her she is Sailor Moon, and gives her a brooch that allows her to transform. Luna features prominently in the first story arc, and although she becomes a supporting character for the rest of the series, she keeps providing the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask with advice, her family relationships are explored alongside her partner Artemis and their daughter from the future Diana, and she even manages to transform into a human being at key points of the series (including the ability to transform into a Sailor Guardian in the 2003 live-action series).
Profile
Luna first appears in the series as a mysterious black cat with a crescent moon mark on the forehead that meets Usagi and tells her she is Sailor Moon, a Guardian destined to fight evil. Luna gives Usagi the mission to find her fellow Sailor Guardians and Princess Serenity, whom, unbeknown to both of them, is Usagi herself. The two of them meet Ami Mizuno, Rei Hino, and Makoto Kino, whom Luna assist to awake respectively as Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, and Sailor Jupiter, before encountering Sailor Venus and Artemis, a male white cat that also has the ability to speak and who has been secretly providing Luna with details on her mission.
Halfway through the first arc, Luna's backstory is revealed: in the Silver Millennium, she was a servant to Princess Serenity, sworn never to leave her side, as well as an advisor to her mother, Queen Serenity. When the Moon Kingdom fell at the hands of the Dark Kingdom, she and Artemis were put into a long sleep and sent down to Earth to look after the Sailor Guardians, who would eventually be reborn there. Part of Luna's memory was suppressed, in order to make her task easier; she only knew that she was supposed to find and awaken the Sailor Guardians of the inner Solar System. Further details on Luna and Artemis' origin are revealed in the final arc of the manga, in which it is stated they were born in Planet Mau, home planet of the evil Sailor Tin Nyanko.
Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though early on it is on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets Usagi by giving her advice she does not want, often leading to comic results. The whole Tsukino family adopts her as a pet, even when they are unaware of her true identity. In an anime-only storyline, Shingo Tsukino is shown to be reluctant to accept Luna at first, and his animosity is enhanced by an attack from the Dark Kingdom; however, at the end of the episode, he seems to be friendly towards her. Luna also becomes good friends with Ami. Luna and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, who is their daughter from the future. During the Sailor Stars anime, Luna also develops a crush on Kou Yaten, the male civilian form of one of the Sailor Starlights.
In the live-action series, Luna is portrayed as a stuffed toy rather than a real cat. Usually she is represented by a puppet, though CGI effects are used for complicated scenes.
Aspects and forms
Even when Luna does not have as many incarnations and special powers as the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask, she nonetheless manages to get some transformations, as well as a long lifetime virtually spanned between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century.
Human form
The character is first shown to get the ability to transform into a human being in the manga special The Lover of Princess Kaguya, which was released a month after the end of the third arc of the series. In this side story, Luna falls in love with a human named Kakeru. It is stated that Kakeru's wish is to meet Princess Kaguya someday. During the climax of the story, Sailor Moon uses the Silver Crystal to transform Luna into a human woman. At first, Kakeru thinks this woman is Kaguya, but then he notices Luna's crescent moon mark in her forehead and realizes it is her. This side story was adapted into Sailor Moon S: The Movie, which marks Luna's only transformation into a human in the first anime adaptation.
Luna's human form appears in the main story timeline in the climax of the Dream arc, after Queen Nehelenia's defeat, alongside Artemis and Diana, who also appear in their human forms. The three of them appear once more than humans in the final arc, when Tin Nyanko attacks them.
In Sailor Moon Crystal, the second anime adaptation, Luna's human form appears earlier during the climatic battle against Queen Metalia, in which Artemis spots her praying on the Moon in this form.
Sailor Luna
In Act 27 of the live-action series, Luna gains the ability to turn into a young human girl, given the name , and is able to transform into , the "Guardian of Love and Small Things." Her uniform is colored in yellow and purple, along with purple boots with white fur atop of them as well as in the sleeves, a jingle bell instead of a brooch, and a cat ear motif in her dark blue hair. Luna's personality as a human girl is essentially identical to her normal self, except that she has a mild obsession with sweet foods and behaves more like a real cat, in that she runs from dogs and is easily distracted by toys. She also has heightened hearing and is able to move extremely quickly. Luna involuntarily transforms back into a plushie under certain circumstances such as sneezing, taking a direct attack from an enemy, or falling unconscious.
In the Special Act epilogue, Luna is the only one of the Guardians who is still able to transform without outside assistance. She is also shown living mainly as a human with Usagi's family, with whom she gets along quite well, though she still takes on her cat form when necessary. She is also shown to have taken on some of the personality traits of Usagi and her mother, such as acting in the same melodramatic manner when waking up in the morning.
Special powers and items
Luna's most distinctive power is her ability to talk like and communicate with human beings. This trait is only shared by Artemis and their daughter Diana. In all versions of the series, Luna provides the Sailor Guardians with many of their special items, particularly early on. The items always spring into existence, seemingly out of thin air, and it is unclear whether she is creating them herself or simply transporting them from some other location. Luna is also shown to be capable of handling machines, as shown when she accesses a secret laboratory below Game Center Crown, or an arcade machine in the first anime adaptation. The first time Luna manages to transform into a human is thanks to the power of the Silver Crystal; however, in subsequent appearances, she transforms by herself. Human Luna gains additional powers such as the ability to fly, to teleport herself and others, and is even capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. Luna loses all of these powers if the crescent moon mark on her forehead is hit by an attack, as shown when she, Artemis, and Diana are struck by Tin Nyanko, which renders them as normal cats. It is also stated by Princess Kakyuu in the final arc that Luna's Star Seed is almost as powerful as a Sailor Crystal.
In the live-action series, Luna uses a special cell phone named Lunatia L to transform into Sailor Luna, by dialing 6-7-2 and shouting "Luna Prism Power, Make up!". In this form, she uses a special attack called "Luna Sucre Candy" which bombards an enemy in exploding sweets. Her main weapon is the "Moonlight Stick", which looks identical to Sailor Moon's "Moonlight Stick" from the same series and which she can transform into various other objects, such as a paper fan or a butterfly net.
Development
The concept of a talking cat guiding a schoolgirl to becoming a Sailor Guardian first occurs in Codename: Sailor V, Takeuchi's manga series that served as the basis for its successor Sailor Moon in which Artemis appears before Minako to reveal to her she has been chosen as "Sailor V" to protect Earth. When Codename: Sailor V was proposed for an anime adaptation, the story was revisioned so that it would eventually become Sailor Moon, and the talking cat role would result in Luna.
Luna has blue eyes in the manga, the live-action series, and in the Sailor Moon Eternal film, but red eyes in both anime TV series. In the Materials Collection, Takeuchi describes Luna's whiskers as long, and the character shares her page with Artemis, whom the author labels as opposite to Luna, though being her "other half". Luna and Artemis also share their page with an unused characer called "Diana the Moon Fairy", whom Luna does not like very much. This character never appears in the series, but her name was given to Luna and Artemis' daughter. Though Luna's age is never discussed in any version of the series, Takeuchi states in the Materials Collection that Luna's human form appears to be a year younger than Usagi and goes on to describe her as frail, as if she had recently lost a lot of weight. The author says her hair is the same color as her cat form's fur—blackish-gray—with two odangos in either side of her head.
The character of Sailor Luna was designed by Takeuchi herself. One of the only times she appears in an outfit other than those Takeuchi designed—her Guardian uniform or her purple shirt and yellow skirt—is in the Special Act, where she serves as the flower girl at Usagi and Mamoru's wedding.
Luna's name comes from the Latin word for Earth's Moon. Luna is also the divine embodiment of the Moon in the ancient Roman religion.
Actresses
In the original anime, as well as the live-action series, Luna is voiced by Keiko Han, the same woman who voiced Queen Beryl. Her English voice actress for the entire series was Jill Frappier, who portrayed the character with an English accent, described as "fairly old, not to mention cranky and British". In the live-action series, Sailor Luna is played by Rina Koike, who thought that she was going to play Chibiusa until she went in for a costume fitting. However, Chibiusa never appears in Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon. Ryō Hirohashi has voiced Luna in all media following Sailor Moon Crystal, while Michelle Ruff has portrayed the character in the English dub of this version. In the stage musicals, Luna has been portrayed by Tomoko Ishimura (1993-1994), Misato Matsumoto (2018-2019), Hiroko Wakasa (2018), Yune Sakurai (2021; cat form), and Marisa (2021; Human Form).
Reception and influence
In the first official Sailor Moon character popularity poll, Luna was the eighth most popular character out of thirty eight choices. One year later, now with fifty choices, Luna was the twenty-second most popular character. Her role in the series has been compared to Rupert Giles' in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Writer Mary Grigsby considers Luna, along with the other cat characters, to blend pre-modern ideas about feminine mystery with modern ideas such as the lucky cat. In his review of season one episode "Loved and Chased! Luna's Worst Day Ever", Michael Mammano from Den of Geek thought that a Luna-centric episode "would have come earlier in the show" and that very little of Luna's background is known, considering her pivotal role in the series. In a review of Sailor Moon Crystal, Meghan Sullivan from IGN pointed that there are "weird issues" regarding Luna's role, particularly how the character "remembered being from the moon, but couldn't remember what the moon princess looks like?" However, on a review of a later act, the author praised the "growing friendship between Luna and Usagi", and how the latter defended the former when the brainwashed Mamoru attacked her. In her review of the season finale, Sullivan stated that voice actress Ryo Hirohashi "did an amazing job expressing helplessness and despair as Luna watched Metalia steamroll over everyone and everything back on Earth." In her reviews of Crystal, Gabriella Ekens from Anime News Network stated that series was "poorly animated" and that "Luna sometimes looks more like a horse than a cat." In her review of the act in which Artemis and Sailor Venus made their debut, Ekens considered that "Artemis consistently looks more like a cat than Luna, sometimes even while they're in the same shot."
In an undergraduate honor thesis analyzing Japanese Feminine Language, author Alexandra Damalas from University of Colorado explained that "because Luna is a cat, her gender identity is not obvious through her biological sex, physical appearance, or bodily gestures. As a result, her speech style throughout the series is frequently gender marked", and that the character uses Sentence Final Particles that emphasize her "social standing as a mentor" to the Sailor Guardians. Damalas also stated that Luna curates the Sailor Guardians group "to be established in the way she sees fit" and explained that "there is not another female character in the series who shares the same or similar social role as Luna".
Appearances in other media
Luna is featured in Nakayoshi crossover video games Nakayoshi to Issho and Welcome Nakayoshi Park. In a collaboration between Sailor Moon and Capcom as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of the Sailor Moon franchise, the Felyne cat companion assumes the form of Luna and wields Usagi's Cutie Moon Rod weapon in the Monster Hunter XX expansion of Monster Hunter Generations.
In the second episode of RuPaul's Drag Race: UK Versus the World, American contestant Mo Heart's look for the "Kitty Girl" runway theme was as Luna, which according to Andy Swift from TVLine, was among the most incredible of the week.

The series stars Hat, the descendant of a hero who fought an evil king and sealed Devildom. Hat falls into Devildom and finds he has to defeat the evil king.
The 1990 Mega Drive game is based on this series. Due to the game's developer failing to secure the Magical Hat license outside Japan, it was completely redone and released in 1991 as Decap Attack. The game features different characters, story, art, music, and level design, but the same general gameplay.

"The Q and the Grey" is the 11th episode of the third season of Star Trek: Voyager, the 53rd episode overall. This is a science fiction television episode of the Star Trek franchise that aired on UPN in 1996, featuring John de Lancie as the alien Q.
Releases
The episode first aired in the United States on November 27, 1996, and subsequently in Germany and Hungary in 1998 and 2001, respectively. In the USA it was aired on the television network UPN.
This was released as a single episode on VHS video cassette tape in July 2002. This episode was also released in 2006, on DVD as part of the Q Collective, which features episodes from across the Star Trek franchise featuring this character.
Plot
Captain Kathryn Janeway is surprised when Q appears in her quarters – and in her bed – one night. Q is intent on Janeway becoming the mother of his child, and plies the Captain with gifts in an attempt to win her affections. Q believes that his desire for Janeway should be regarded as an honour, but Janeway insists that he leave, and eventually he does.
Q's absence does not last long, as he abducts the captain and takes her to the Q Continuum, now appearing as an American Civil War period piece. He explains that there is a civil war brewing among the Q race, and Q hopes that he and Janeway can bring a child into the Continuum to avert the war. The Q authorities (represented as Confederate soldiers) fire on them, wounding Q, then arrive and capture Q and Janeway. The Q leader, appearing as a Confederate colonel, intends to execute them both.
On Voyager, the remaining crew have been observing dozens of supernovae taking place throughout the area. A Q female (Suzie Plakson), Q's former partner, appears and says that the civil war among the Q is the cause. She helps the crew reach the Q Continuum by flying into a supernova, and provides the Voyager crew with Q weapons, which they use to attack the Q authorities' camp and free Q and Janeway. The two Qs resume their relationship and decide to become parents themselves, thus ending the war. Captain Janeway is witness to the two Q mating, which consists of simply touching fingers.
Q returns later to Janeway's quarters with his infant son and asks her to be his godmother, which she accepts.
Background
The trigger for the civil war among the Q was the suicide of the Q known as "Quinn", the focus of the Voyager episode "Death Wish". The underlying cause for the civil war, though, was longstanding tension between two Q factions which maintain a tenuous balance between simple survival and creative advance as a species.
Releases
"The Q and the Grey" was released on LaserDisc in Japan on June 25, 1999, as part of the 3rd season vol.1 set.
This episode was released on DVD on July 6, 2004 as part of Star Trek Voyager: Complete Third Season, with Dolby 5.1 surround audio. The season 3 DVD was released in the UK on September 6, 2004.
In 2017, the complete Star Trek: Voyager television series was released in a DVD box set , which included it as part of the season 3 discs.

Astra 2B is one of the Astra communications satellites owned and operated by Société Européenne des Satellites. Launched in September 2000 to join Astra 2A at the Astra 28.2°E orbital position providing digital television and radio broadcast services to the United Kingdom and Ireland, the satellite has also served at the Astra 19.2°E and the Astra 31.5°E positions.
History
The satellite provides two broadcast beams, each with horizontal and vertical polarisation, across two footprints - 2B North (covering Central Europe and Scandinavia) and 2B South (covering Central Europe and the Iberian Peninsula and Canary Islands).
While at 28.2° East, television signals could be received with a 43 cm dish across the majority of the British Isles with a 60 cm dish required in the extreme north and west, although the official footprint maps now show a 60 cm dish as required across all of Western Europe. At 28.2° East, 17 transponders on Astra 2B were used by BSkyB to provide the Sky Digital television services of standard and high-definition television (HDTV) and digital radio. Astra 2B could also provide backup capacity, substituting for one or more transponders across the whole 10.70-12.75 GHz range used by Astra satellites in the Astra 19.2°E and Astra 28.2°E orbital positions. A third, steerable beam provides 8 transponders in the 12.50-12.75 GHz range for Internet and telecommunications services in West Africa. This aspect of the satellite was originally the commercial responsibility of SES New Skies (now incorporated into SES S.A.).
Following the launch of Astra 2F to 28.2° East, in February 2013, Astra 2B started its planned move from that position to Astra 19.2°E, to serve alongside Astra 1KR, Astra 1L, Astra 1M, and Astra 2C, arriving in position by 27 February 2013. In January 2014, Astra 2B moved to the Astra 31.5°E orbital position, pending the delayed launch of Astra 5B to that position and stayed there as back-up until it was moved back to 19.2° East in December 2016. In June 2017, it was moved west at approximately 0.6°/day to arrive alongside NSS-7 at 20° West in August 2017. From April 2018 to July 2018, Astra 2B was moved east at 0.6°/day to Astra 19.2°E. Since June 2021, Astra 2B has been non-operational and moving west at approximately 4.9°/day.

Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande (commonly referred to as Pichon Lalande or Pichon Comtesse) is a winery in the Pauillac appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxièmes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.
Wine style
While the winery was once known for its higher percentage of Merlot and lower percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in its blends, the vineyard started to move towards blends more consistent with other wines from the Pauillac region, with recent vintages being between 70-75% Cabernet Sauvignon.
The second wine is called Pichon Comtesse-Réserve.
History
Château Pichon Comtesse was once part of the larger Pichon estate, owned by Pierre de Rauzan, along with what today is Château Pichon Longueville Baron. In 1850, the estate was divided into the two current Pichon estates. In 1925, Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande was bought by Edouard Miailhe and Louis Miailhe. The daughter of Edouard Miailhe, May Eliane de Lencquesaing (born in 1926) later became the owner and manager of the property. In 2006, de Lencquesaing sold a majority interest in the Château to the Rouzaud family, which also owns the Champagne house Louis Roederer.

Typhoon Kalmaegi (), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luis, was the 22nd depression and the 15th named storm of the 2014 typhoon season. Kalmaegi was the first storm to make landfall over the Philippines since Typhoon Rammasun, two months prior. The storm caused flooding in Southeast Asia during mid-September.
Meteorological history
On September 10, a tropical disturbance formed northeast of Palau with a possibility of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next few days. Later the same day, the JTWC had reported that it had intensified into a tropical depression, giving it the designation "15W". Early on September 12, the JMA started to track 15W as a tropical depression. In the same time, PAGASA had issued their first advisories on the storm, naming it as Tropical Depression Luis. As Luis entered a more conducive environment, it steadily intensified into a tropical storm and was named Kalmaegi by the JMA later that day and the JTWC followed suit on the same day. The storm entered an area of warm waters as the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon, while JTWC upgraded it to a category 1 typhoon late on September 13. Kalmaegi made landfall over Cagayan early the next day, as it start to interact with land and weakened to a tropical storm. On September 15, Kalmaegi entered the South China Sea and intensified again. The typhoon reached its peak strength while making its second landfall over Hainan Island. Kalmaegi rapidly weakened to a large tropical storm as it continued to move in a westward direction. Both agencies classified Kalmaegi as a tropical depression. Later that day, both agencies announced that Kalmaegi had dissipated.
Preparations and impact
Philippines
Known in the Philippines as Luis, PAGASA had issued some first Signal Warnings over Region II on September 13. PAGASA had also warned residents in regions of Luzon about landslides, thunderstorms and flash floods from the effects of Luis. Several rubber boats and medical aid supplies were prepared.
As the storm was exiting the country, PAGASA reported that the province of Pangasinan was under the "state of calamity" due to flash floods, especially towns in Calasiao, Santa Barbara and even as far as Urdaneta. Meanwhile, the NDRRMC said that landslides had occurred in Cagayan Valley as of September 17. It was also reported that at least 200 houses had been destroyed while 600 were damaged.
As for impacts in the Philippines, a total of 12 people were killed by the storm with eight of them drowning as the boat they were on sank due to rogue waves caused by the storm. According to the NDRRMC, damages amounted to ₱1.2 billion (US$27.3 million).
Highest Public Storm Warning Signal
China
On September 15, the government weather bureau reported that the storm was headed toward southern China at about 19 mph. In Haikou, the capital of Hainan Province, schools were ordered to close on September 16 and 17. Later that day, the storm hit Hong Kong, disrupting flights and forcing the stock market to close, as well as causing 29 injuries. The stock market reopened Tuesday morning. The storm hit Hainan on September 16, where more than 90,000 people were evacuated from its east coast prior to the storm's impact. Kalmaegi killed a total of 11 people and caused about CN¥17.74 billion (US$2.89 billion).
Vietnam
The typhoon was also felt in Vietnam, with strong gusty winds and flash floods reported. As of September 18, it was reported that the death toll had risen to 9 and 10 were injured. Damages have also been topped to VND20 billion (US$944,000). Another 2 were reported killed on the same day. On September 19, it was reported that 15 were injured. So far, a total of 13 people were reported killed by the storm.
India
After the dissipation of Kalmaegi, its remnants continued to move towards Eastern India on September 19. With this, it caused flash floods and landslides over the area until it dissipated on September 23. On September 22, it was reported that a total of 12 people had been killed in Meghalaya in the past 72 hours. Several bridges were also reported destroyed.

Don Vesco (April 8, 1939 – December 16, 2002) was an American businessperson and motorcycle racer who held multiple motorcycle land-speed and wheel-driven land speed records. In his lifetime, he set 18 motorcycles and 6 automobile speed records.
His accomplishments recognized by the American Motorcyclist Association include winning the United States motorcycle Grand Prix 500 cc class in 1963, operating a California motorcycle dealership that sponsored up to 60 racers at a time, and setting a number of motorcycle and automobile land speed records.
Speed records
His motorcycle land speed records were set in 1970 at in a twin-engined streamliner "Big Red", becoming the first person to ride faster than 250 mph; in 1975, when he pushed past the milestone for the first time with "Silver Bird"; and in 1978 at in a twin-turbo powered streamliner "Lightning Bolt", a record that stood for 12 years.
In 2001, he set the FIA wheel-driven land speed record of in a turboshaft powered streamliner called "Turbinator"., although the record has since been eclipsed. Brother Rick improved the "Turbinator," and current Vesco driver Dave Spangler averaged in 2018.
Vesco died in 2002 from prostate cancer.
Other designs
In addition to his own land speed record vehicles, Vesco had a consulting role in other streamlined vehicles. One was Max Lambky's Vincent-engined Lambky Liner streamliner. Another was the "Project 200" streamliner designed by his business partner, Matt Guzzetta, and speed tested by Vesco at El Mirage Dry Lake. Project 200 both competed in the Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge, and in 1983, performed an American coast-to-coast transit without refueling, sponsored by Motorcyclist magazine.
Vesco also designed aftermarket motorcycle accessories including extended range gas tanks for offroad motorcycles sold through Don Vesco Products, which also had a line of motorcycle fairings called "Rabid Transit" designed by Guzzetta.
Honors
Vesco was inducted to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999 and posthumously inducted to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2004.
Collections
Vesco's "Big Red" #11 streamliner is part of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum collection. His #14 streamliner, with a fiberglass body molded around a 22-inch aircraft drop tank, powered by twin supercharged Yamaha XS650 SOHC engines, is on display at the National Motorcycle Museum in Iowa. The "Project 200" fuel efficiency contest streamliner was on display at the San Diego Automotive Museum as of 2011.

An extreme clipper was a clipper designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. In the United States, extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855. British-built extreme clippers include vessels built over the period 1854 to 1870 (Annandale to e.g. Norman Court).
The first extreme clipper
Arthur H. Clark, in his 1910 book The Clipper Ship Era, explains the history leading up to the construction of the first extreme clipper:
Medium and extreme clippers
From 1851 or earlier another type of clipper ship was also being built, the medium clipper. In the mid-1800s, shipbuilders in Medford, Massachusetts began building what would become the medium clipper ship. They "quietly evolved a new type (of ship) of about 450 tons burden which, handled by eighteen officers and men, would carry half as much freight as a British-Indianman of 1500 tons with a crew of 125, and sail half again as fast." Most owners wanted ships that could do all kinds of work and the "finest type" then being built was the Medford or Merrimac East Indiaman. An example would be the Columbiana built in Medford in 1837, or Jotham Stetson's ship the Rajah, 531 tons, 140 feet long which was constructed in the previous year. Ships built in Medford "have more fast California passages to their credit, considering the number they built, than those of any other place."
Two early examples of the medium clipper are the Antelope of Boston (1851): "The design of her model was to combine large stowage capacity with good sailing qualities"; and the Golden Fleece (1852): "In the form of her ends she is of the medium model." The medium clipper, though still very fast, had comparatively more allowance for cargo.
After 1854 extreme clippers were replaced in shipbuilding yards by medium clippers. "...after 1854, a fine class of ships, known as medium clippers, was constructed, some of which proved exceedingly fast, and remarkable passages continued to be made. Many of these medium clippers would be considered very sharp and heavily sparred vessels at the present time."
Extreme clippers remained in vogue only a few years. Owing to the depth and sharpness of their floors they lacked stability, and in consequence of the sharpness of the ends those parts did not have buoyancy enough to sustain their own weight—a fact which led to the straining and weakening of the vessel. A change was made in 1855 by joining to the clipper top, bow, and stern the fuller bottom of the old-fashioned freighting ship. The midship section, or widest part of the ship, was also moved farther aft, so as to be only a trifle forward of the middle of the ship's length, and the vessel was made to float substantially on an even keel. That style of vessel remains in use to the present day [1884], although capacity is now the chief aim in American sailing ships rather than speed.
Alternative definition
Duncan McLean, the marine reporter who wrote at least 161 more or less detailed descriptions of ships launched in Boston and elsewhere in New England for the Boston Daily Atlas between April 1850 and March 1857, defined an extreme clipper as "clippers of 40 inches dead rise at half floor". By his definition extreme clippers ceased to be built after early 1852.
In the midst of the great clipper boom, in early 1851, he wrote "Nearly all the clipper ships which have been built recently, have had 40 inches dead rise at half floor." This was followed in late 1852 by his comment "It is therefore doubtful whether another clipper, having 40 inches dead rise, will be built."
Further understanding of what was happening in clipper ship construction at the time can be obtained from reading the whole section from which the last sentence above was obtained. "Our first large clippers had rounded lines and 40 inches dead rise at half floor; but now nearly all new clippers have hollow lines, and only 30 or 18 inches dead rise. The upright stem, too, has been modified into the inclined, and the length and sharpness of the ends have also been much varied."..."though very sharp and clipperly in the ends, has only 20 inches dead rise at half floor, experience having demonstrated, that great length with sharp ends do not require extreme sharpness of floor. Buoyancy is of more importance, and the speed obtained, especially running free, is more satisfactory. It is therefore doubtful whether another clipper, having 40 inches dead rise, will be built."
This narrower definition has not been accepted by history. The term "extreme clipper" was applied to the clipper ships built by Donald McKay during 1851 even though their dead rises were less than 40 inches. It has also been applied to clipper ships he built from 1852 to 1854, and to similar clipper ships built by other shipbuilders in the same period. It has been applied to clipper ships built with a lengthening of the bow above to water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft.

Van Troff's Cylinder () is a social science fiction novel by Polish writer Janusz A. Zajdel. The novel covers the problems of time travel, society development, eugenics and isolated societies. At the time of its release it was treated as a warning for totalitarian systems.
Its first publication was serialized by newspaper, issues 209-291, 1978. In book form it was published by Czytelnik in 1980.
Plot synopsis
The plot covers a story of a group of astronauts who are approaching Earth after a 200-year-long journey on a long-distance spaceship called "Helios". Instead of reaching Earth, they are communicated by people living in the Moon's underground colony, and convinced to land there. After landing they get isolated, and they quickly find out that the colony is ruled by an authoritarian regime, which tends to control all the people living there by means of censorship from one hand, and denunciation from the other one. Also, to make the colony's population stable, there is strict birth control there, and people over the age of 60 get "retired", which in fact means senicide.
The colony's officials give vague explanations to the reason on why "Helios" has been diverted to land on the Moon instead of on its original destination, Earth. Initially it is only said that it is "not feasible", or "pointless" to go to Earth now. Gradually "Helios"' crew find out that the Earth's population underwent some process of degeneration (the cause, however, not being revealed), that the Earth's inhabitants are expected to die out quickly, and that the Moon colonies were constructed as a sort of asylum for the non-degenerated part of humanity, which is also expected to recolonize Earth when the crisis will have ended. The crew, however, can already see that the Moon's inhabitants are undergoing some degeneration process as well (skeletal, due to lighter gravity on the Moon, but also mental due to living permanently underground, which leads to chronic agoraphobia) and this finding in turn casts doubts on the planned recolonization. Also, they find out that even the regime itself does not know about the current situation on the Earth, because any bilateral communication was cut long time ago.
The astronauts arrange an escape for one of them, the book's protagonist. He lands near a city, whose name is not mentioned, but some details suggest Warsaw. The suburbs are in devastated state (it is said, that the devastation looks intentional) and are inhabited by a mob which creeps out apparently only at night to catch something to eat. The centre of the city is in turn inhabited by aggressive youngsters, their main occupation being apparently struggling between themselves and hunting for the individuals of the aforementioned suburban mob, in order to just kill them. Both the mob and the youngsters, as observed by the protagonist, are males only.
Despite that, the city is fully automated, robots cleaning the streets and facilities, fixing any damaged equipment, providing food for humans and (as it gradually turns out) for rats, which occupy lower parts of the city and are intelligent enough to use underground trains or food-providing machines.
Initially, the aim of the protagonist is to collect information about the Earth's situation, share it with the rest of the "Helios"' crew who are remaining on the Moon, and arrange an escape also for them. But his main aim - which he is keeping secret from everyone - is to find the "Van Troff's cylinder", a secret chamber (built before "Helios" started its journey to space) in which prof. Van Troff had managed to reproduce the effect of time dilatation.
Translations
The book was translated into Bulgarian by Lina Vasileva and published by Georgi Bakalov publishing house (bul. Цилиндърът на ван Троф) in 1983.
Helena Stachová was an author of Czech translation (cz. Vynález profesora van Troffa). Published in 1983.

The anthropology of institutions is a sub-field in social anthropology dedicated to the study of institutions in different cultural contexts.
The role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century. Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of globalization in both institutions and the field of anthropology. Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as for-profit business, nonprofit organizations, and governments. For instance, cultural anthropologists are commonly employed by the United States federal government.
The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are total institutions and social institutions. Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include prisons, convents, and hospitals. Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals' day-to-day lives, such as kinship, religion, and economics. Anthropology of institutions may analyze labor unions, businesses ranging from small enterprises to corporations, government, medical organizations, education, prisons, and financial institutions. Nongovernmental organizations have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments, or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate social problems.
The types and methods of scholarship performed in the anthropology of institutions can take a number of forms. Institutional anthropologists may study the relationship between organizations or between an organization and other parts of society. Institutional anthropology may also focus on the inner workings of an institution, such as the relationships, hierarchies and cultures formed, and the ways that these elements are transmitted and maintained, transformed, or abandoned over time. Additionally, some anthropology of institutions examines the specific design of institutions and their corresponding strength. More specifically, anthropologists may analyze specific events within an institution, perform semiotic investigations, or analyze the mechanisms by which knowledge and culture are organized and dispersed.
In all manifestations of institutional anthropology, participant observation is critical to understanding the intricacies of the way an institution works and the consequences of actions taken by individuals within it. Simultaneously, anthropology of institutions extends beyond examination of the commonplace involvement of individuals in institutions to discover how and why the organizational principles evolved in the manner that they did.
Common considerations taken by anthropologists in studying institutions include the physical location at which a researcher places themselves, as important interactions often take place in private, and the fact that the members of an institution are often being examined in their workplace and may not have much idle time to discuss the details of their everyday endeavors. The ability of individuals to present the workings of an institution in a particular light or frame must additionally be taken into account when using interviews and document analysis to understand an institution, as the involvement of an anthropologist may be met with distrust when information being released to the public isn't directly controlled by the institution and could potentially be damaging.

There have been two baronetcies created for members of the Boughton, later Rouse-Boughton family, one in the Baronetage of England and one in the Baronetage of Great Britain.
The Boughton Baronetcy, of Lawford in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of England on 4 August 1641 for William Boughton of Lawford Hall, at Little Lawford near Rugby, Warwickshire, as a reward for services to the Royalist cause. Several members of the family served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire. The second and fourth Baronets both sat as Knight of the Shire for Warwickshire. The baronetcy descended in direct male line until Sir Theodosius, the 7th Baronet, still a minor, died in mysterious circumstances in 1780. He was confined to his bed by severe illness at Lawford Hall, where his mother and sister, Mrs Donellan, wife of Captain Donellan, were living. He died immediately after taking a draught from the hands of Lady Boughton, and after his body was exhumed on a suspicion of poisoning, a Coroner's inquest returned a verdict of murder against Captain Donellan. Captain Donellan, who was known as Diamond Donellan, because of a large diamond he had brought back from India, was tried condemned and executed for the crime, although the evidence against him was solely circumstantial and he died solemnly protesting his innocence. His widow subsequently married Sir Egerton Leigh Bt.
The title was inherited by a half cousin, (grandson of the 4th Baronet by his second wife Catherine), Sir Edward Boughton, 8th Baronet, who sold Lawford Hall (later demolished) and the Warwickshire estate in 1793. Sir Edward Boughton died and left his estate to Eliza Davies, his illegitimate daughter. She later married Sir George Charles Braithwaite, 2nd Baronet (1762–1809). Edward's brother Charles, who followed as 9th Baronet in 1794, had on 28 July 1791 been created a Baronet, of Boughton of Rouse Lench in the County of Worcester, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. He married the heiress of an estate in Downton, Shropshire and thereafter the family seat was at Downton Hall near Ludlow. The 11th, 12th and 13th Baronets all served as high sheriffs of Shropshire. Both baronetcies remained united until they became extinct on the death of the 13th/5th Baronet in 1963.

Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 47 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. Certain species of Spathiphyllum are commonly known as spath or peace lilies.
They are evergreen herbaceous perennial plants with large leaves 12–65 cm long and 3–25 cm broad. The flowers are produced in a spadix, surrounded by a 10–30 cm long, white, yellowish, or greenish spathe. The plant does not need large amounts of light or water to survive.
Etymology
Schott's description of the genus refers to , where is a spathe, and is an adjective modifying spathe, meaning relating to a leaf, and means continuing or persisting. also means a leaf. The more common name of peace lily derives from the plants symbolism for peace, purity, and healing, and has also been associated with the white flag, which is a signal for truce.

Cultivated hybrids include:
Spathiphyllum × clevelandii
Cultivation and uses
Several species are popular indoor houseplants. It lives best in shade and needs little sunlight to thrive, and is watered approximately once a week. The soil is best left moist but only needs watering if the soil is dry. The NASA Clean Air Study found that Spathiphyllum cleans certain gaseous environmental contaminants, including benzene and formaldehyde. However, subsequent tests have shown this cleaning effect is far too small to be practical.
The cultivar 'Mauna Loa' has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Toxicity
Although it is called a "lily", the peace lily is not a true lily from the family Liliaceae. True lilies are highly toxic (poisonous) to cats and dogs, but the peace lily, spathiphyllum is only mildly toxic to humans and other animals when ingested. It contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation, a burning sensation in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and nausea, but it does not contain the toxins found in true lilies, which could cause acute kidney failure in cats and some other animals.
In popular culture
The 7th track on Mother Earth's Plantasia, an early electronic album that was composed for plants to listen to, is "Peace' Spathiphyllums".
Simon Pegg's character PC Nicholas Angel in the movie Hot Fuzz has a peace lily that appears in several scenes and is referred to throughout the film. Angel's dedication to caring for the peace lily serves to symbolize his highly structured lifestyle and by-the-book approach to policing, which he abandons when he shatters the plant over the head of Michael "Lurch" Armstrong.

Gladys Louise Welge (May 23, 1902 – July 27, 1976) was an American violinist and conductor. She was the conductor of the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago from 1938 to 1940. She was also founder of the Symphony of Oak Park and River Forest, one of the longest-surviving community orchestras in the United States.
Early life
Gladys Louise Welge was born in Austin, Illinois (near Chicago), the daughter of Friedrich Welge and Friedericke J. Aron Welge. Both of her parents were born in Chicago; her Welge grandparents were from Hannover in Germany. She studied violin with Leon Sametini. Her brother Vernon Welge was a pianist.
Career
Welge was a performing violinist based in Chicago, "one of the extremely good and altogether agreeable young players of the city". In 1919, Welge opened the Welge School of Music in Chicago, with her brother Vernon. She taught violin there and conducted the school's twenty-piece orchestra.
In 1931, Welge was founder of the Symphony of Oak Park and River Forest, one of the longest-surviving community orchestras in the United States. She was conductor of the Symphony from its founding in 1931 until she retired to Fontana, Wisconsin in 1954.
Welge was a violinist in the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago, and after conducting summer concerts at Grant Park, succeeded Ebba Sundstrom as the orchestra's conductor from 1938 to 1940. She was admired for her "strikingly forceful, even dynamic conducting", but limited to conducting primarily at rehearsals; male guest conductors took the podium at most of their concerts.
She moved to California by 1963, where she was a music director at a church in Laguna Beach, and conducted the Laguna Hills String Ensemble.
Personal life
Gladys Welge died in 1976, aged 74 years, in California.

Toponymy
The name Luque is first mentioned in 1635, in an act of the Cabildo of Asunción when the colonial governor of the Governorate of Paraguay, Martín Ledesma de Valderrama, granted two leagues of land to a Spanish Captain named Miguel Antón de Luque in a place near Asunción known as las Salinas. According to the act this was the place where Captain Antón de Luque had been working an Encomienda for more than twenty years.
A century later, in 1743, another Miguel de Luque, a descendant of the first mentioned, made a donation by testament of a section of those lands to the Franciscans who built a chapel for the devotion of the Virgin of the Rosary in 1750 - 1755, and from that time the old name of Salinas was changed to Valle de Luque.
In 1781, governor Pedro Melo de Portugal made the first administrative division of the Governorate of Paraguay into six towns and designated the district with the name Partido de Luque.

Maria Fareri Children's Hospital was built through the efforts of hundreds of parents, medical professionals, and community leaders, including Brenda and John Fareri who lost their 13-year-old daughter, Maria, to rabies in 1995. After Maria died, her parents learned that Maria had made a special wish as part of a school project - for the health and well-being of all the children in the world. Guided by Maria's wish, the Fareri family helped lead the design and creation of Maria Fareri Children's Hospital as a “family-centered” hospital. It is the only hospital in the United States named after a child.

O'Connor-Connolly had previously served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from November 2001 to October 2003.
From October 2003 to April 2005 she served as Minister for Planning, Communications, District Administration and Information Technology. During her tenure, Hurricane Ivan devastated the island in September 2004. O'Connor-Connolly was a minister in within the government whose collective decision at that time was to turn away two British warships that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make.
Following one term in the opposition benches. O'Connor-Connolly was elected Deputy Premier during the Cayman Islands general election in 2009, and in addition to assuming the post of Deputy Premier, she served as Minister of District Administration, Works, Lands and Agriculture. In 2012 O'Connor-Connolly assumed the post of Premier of the Cayman Islands she also served as Minister of Finance, District Administration, Works, Lands and Agriculture.

Following the 2017 Cayman Islands general election She is served as Minister of Education, Youth, Sports, Agriculture and Lands.
During debate in the Legislative Assembly, following the same-sex marriage ruling by Chief Justice Anthony Smellie on 29 March 2019, O'Connor-Connolly described the day of the ruling as "black Friday" for the Cayman Islands. She encouraged Caymanians to do what they could to object to the planned wedding between two women, even to the point of interrupting the wedding itself. The Education Minister had used the morning prayer before the debate to refer to "cruise passengers with alternative lifestyles" causing the streets of George Town to resemble Sodom and Gomorrah.
The education minister has been a fervent opponent of the Domestic Partnership Bill and any legislation that supported same-sex couples' right to a private life; describing it as "this evil that is being forced upon us". She was one of two Cabinet ministers who voted against the legislation brought by government in July to address the longstanding breach by the Caymanian authorities of Cayman's Bill of Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Following the 2021 Cayman Islands general election, she again crossed the floor to align with a group of independents to form a government on the morning before Parliament had its first sitting, citing that "her constituents have expressed in no uncertain terms that Cayman Brac and Little Cayman need a Minister in the Government". This was her second switch of allegiance, this time to avoid the loss of a cabinet position.

The Nebraska Rural Radio Association is a radio broadcast network in the U.S. state of Nebraska. It was formed in 1948 with the goal of bringing information to farmers and ranchers in the state, including daily grain and livestock markets, weather and farm reports. Its first station, KRVN (AM), was started in 1951.
Severe blizzards in Nebraska in 1948-49 had resulted in deaths and serious damage to herds and crops across the state. One of the reasons cited for the massive loss of life, crops, and livestock was a lack of timely news and weather sources for farmers. More than 4,000 shares (at $10 each) were sold under the auspices of the Nebraska Cooperative Council, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Farmers Union, and the state Grange. The network is still owned and operated by a cooperative of farmers and ranchers. Founder Max Brown ran the network until 1979 and was succeeded by his son Eric Brown, who served until 2012.
In November 2019, the association purchased a group of stations -- six in Scottsbluff and one in Holdrege -- from Legacy Communications. It then resold one of the Scottsbluff stations, KETT, to VSS Catholic Communications. With that purchase, the network now owns 15 stations across the state, as well as four additional affiliates.

Henry Noble MacCracken (November 19, 1880 – May 7, 1970) was an American academic administrator who was the fifth president of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, serving from 1915 to 1946 as the first secular president of the college. MacCracken's term as president of Vassar College is the longest in the college's history.
Early life
MacCracken was born in Toledo, Ohio in November 19, 1880, to Henry Mitchell MacCracken. Henry's brother was John Henry MacCracken, president (1915–26) of Lafayette College. In 1900, MacCracken earned an English degree from New York University (NYU). After graduation, he joined the faculty of Syrian Protestant College in Beirut for three years before coming back to NYU for graduate study. After completing a master's degree in English, he earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University.
On June 12, 1907, MacCracken married Marjorie Dodd. His son, Calvin Dodd MacCracken, was a noted inventor.
Career
MacCracken was president of Vassar from 1915 to 1946. A proponent of women's suffrage and liberal political views in general, MacCracken was fired for holding such beliefs in 1918. However, three trustees resigned and students protested, so MacCracken was returned to his position.
In the 1920s, MacCracken was involved in the founding of Sarah Lawrence College, which was initially a women's junior college affiliated with Vassar. A residence hall named after MacCracken was completed in 1930. He was on the board of trustees of the college until its affiliation with Vassar was severed in 1935.
Later life
MacCracken died on May 7, 1970, at his home, 87 New Hackensack Road, in Poughkeepsie, New York. His wife, Marjorie Dodd MacCracken died in 1974.

Twizell Bridge (also spelt Twizel Bridge) is a Tudor arch bridge which crosses the River Till near Duddo, Northumberland in the Northeast of England. It is a Grade II* listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument and no longer carries vehicular traffic. The bridge played a role in the Battle of Flodden in 1513.
History
Twizel Bridge was built in 1511, when it provided the only dry crossing over the River Till between its confluence with the River Tweed and the village of Etal some 5 miles (8 kilometres) to the southeast. It was the longest stone span of any bridge in England for three centuries. Local legend suggests that it was built by a lady of the Selby family, whose seat was Twizell Castle nearby. The bridge is described by the antiquary Francis Grose in his "The Antiquities of England and Wales" as "Twisle Bridge of Stone, one bow, but greate and stronge".
On the morning of 9 September 1513, the English army commanded by Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey undertook a march northwards to outflank the invading Scottish army commanded by James IV of Scotland, which was encamped at Flodden Hill. The English artillery train and vanguard under Edmund Howard crossed the Till at Twizel Bridge, while the main English force crossed by fords and smaller bridges upstream. By making this manoeuvre, Surrey forced King James to abandon his secure position on Flodden Hill and the resulting battle that afternoon was fought on ground which was disadvantageous to the Scottish tactics and contributed to their defeat.
Alterations in 1770 and 1820 added small flood arches and a rebuilt parapet with a decorative dentil cornice. The bridge carried the main A698 road from Hawick to Berwick-upon-Tweed until 1983, when a modern bridge was completed immediately to the south.

Manitoba (AG) v Manitoba Egg and Poultry Association (the Manitoba Egg Reference) [1971] S.C.R. 689 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the Trade and Commerce power under section 91(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The decision was the result of a growing political debate known as the "chicken and egg war" where Quebec and Ontario enacted protectionist legislation for the egg and poultry industry preventing Manitoba from selling their eggs and poultry products in those provinces. To much of the public's surprise the Court struck down a provincial statute regulating the marketing of eggs. The case somewhat contradicted the precedent case of Carnation Co. v. Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board, [1968] S.C.R. 238 which held that provincial law that has an incidental effect on other provinces is still valid.
The Court held that even though there was no direct evidence showing that there was extraprovincial effect of the provincial law, the potential effect was sufficient to find the law ultra vires. The Court found that control of imports was essential to the provincial legislative scheme even though the law made no distinction between eggs produced inside or outside of the province. The Court distinguished the case from the Carnation decision by the fact that the Manitoba regulations intended to provide regulation of inter-provincial trade while in Carnation the law only has the effect of regulating inter-provincial trade.
In the aftermath of the decision, all 11 governments, the 10 governments of the provinces and the federal government, entered an agreement with the federal government which arranged a federal egg marketing scheme which created quotas for each of the provinces, and charged tariffs for eggs sold outside of the province.

Major technologies are CRT, LCD and its derivatives (Quantum dot display, LED backlit LCD, WLCD, OLCD), Plasma, and OLED and its derivatives (Transparent OLED, PMOLED, AMOLED). An emerging technology is Micro LED and cancelled and now obsolete technologies are SED and FED.
Temporal characteristics
Different display technologies have vastly different temporal characteristics, leading to perceptual differences for motion, flicker, etc.
The figure shows a sketch of how different technologies present a single white/grey frame. Time and intensity is not to scale. Notice that some have a fixed intensity, while the illuminated period is variable. This is a kind of pulse-width modulation. Others can vary the actual intensity in response to the input signal.
Single-chip DLPs use a kind of "chromatic multiplexing" in which each color is presented serially. The intensity is varied by modulating the "on" time of each pixel within the time-span of one color. Multi-chip DLPs are not represented in this sketch, but would have a curve identical to the plasma display.
LCDs have a constant (backlit) image, where the intensity is varied by blocking the light shining through the panel.
CRTs use an electron beam, scanning the display, flashing a lit image. If interlacing is used, a single full-resolution image results in two "flashes". The physical properties of the phosphor are responsible for the rise and decay curves.
Plasma displays modulate the "on" time of each sub-pixel, similar to DLP.
Movie theaters use a mechanical shutter to illuminate the same frame 2 or 3 times, increasing the flicker frequency to make it less perceptible to the human eye.

Crime Cutz is the second EP by American synth-pop duo Holy Ghost!, released on April 29, 2016, through DFA Records. Its title came from the name of a person of the same name who offered a drum break for the title track that was not included in the final mix. Containing a 1980s-style atmosphere and noted by one reviewer to be the duo's cleanest sounding release so far, the extended play was influenced by Russian disco records Frankel found on eBay. DFA released the title track as a single in February 2016 to promote the EP's release. The EP went on to receive positive reviews from music critics.
Production and composition
Crime Cutz has been described by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu-disco side of the duo. The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo's home country; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic. Frankel, who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay, said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique: "I guess that's kind of what Nick and I do ... We find a sound we like, try to make it and fail, but in the process we make something new." The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics, given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be "instantly rhythmically gratifying", as member Nick Millhiser described. In addition to its disco element, Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R&B vocals that gives it a 1980s-esque atmosphere. Consequence of Sounds David Sackllah noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost!'s cleanest-sounding release to date. As for the lyrical content, Frankel wanted the songs' seductive lyrics to be "phonetically fun" as with most other disco records.
Songs
The starting title track of Crime Cutz derived its title from a person of the same name who gave Holy Ghost! a drum break to be used in the song; it was not included in the final mix, however. It begins with "spacey" synthesizers, before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song. Halfway into the song, diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in, which Frankel, "literally found them on the internet. We met up the next day, and it was awesome and really moving to hear them sing. In general we've tried to be a bit more off the cuff when recording recently, [and they were] a last minute addition while mixing the song." Sequenced synth arpeggios, "super-dry" guitars, and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement. "Stereotype" is about the band's self-awareness and pride towards them being of a very well-known musical genre, singing in a mournful tone that "I know I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical […] Let go." In the track's first draft, the drum parts and chord progression were developed first. Holy Ghost! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song, but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost! wanted it to be. It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz.
The title of "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a reference to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was "Back to Earth", and was the first song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it's just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it'll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." Frankel called the EP's closer, "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they're DJing,' and that's something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it's a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; "We're still messing around, because we have a lot of demos from this last year and a half, and we're sifting through, figuring out if there's one more we want to finish."
Release and promotion
Holy Ghost! first announced in a January 7, 2016, interview with The Boston Globe that an extended play titled Crime Cutz was to be released in late spring of that year. The title track of Crime Cutz first premiered worldwide on Zane Lowe's Apple Music show Beats 1 on February 4, 2016. The label DFA Records released it as a digital download single a day later. As part of the PopMatters feature Singles Going Steady, multiple writers reviewed the track upon its release. The 12-inch vinyl single for the song that also includes the instrumental version of the song was a 300-copy limited edition. An official Ben Fries-directed video for the song depicted multicolored lights flashing to the beat, with Aubrey Cook starring as the dancer. On April 22, 2016, DFA released a "Crime Cutz" remix EP featuring two re-cuts of the song, one by Alan Palomo's project Neon Indian and another by producer Eli Escobar. DFA released the Crime Cutz EP on April 29.
Critical reception
Reviews of Crime Cutz were generally positive, holding an aggregate 67 out of 100 on the website Metacritic based on four critics. Lily Moayeri wrote in her review that "Holy Ghost! has sculpted its production for a sharply defined quadruple hit." Austin Reed, writing for Pretty Much Amazing, praised the band for returning to a little-to-no effort approach that was used in making their self-titled debut album: "Dynamics fell short because neither Frankel nor bandmate Nick Millhiser seemed 100% convinced that what they were doing made any sense. But on tracks like "Crime Cutz", and EP highlight "Compassion Points", that confidence sounds fully restored and more galvanized than ever".
Cameron Cook of Pitchfork honored Crime Cutz as "a bright, tight, tense mini-epic, solidifying [Holy Ghost!] as one of the pillars of the mid-'00s disco resurgence." His only major criticism of the EP was its lack of stylistic variety: "you spend a lot of the record hoping for something to take them even further over the edge, but they continue to pull back until the very end." The group's lack of musical risk on the EP was also criticized in a more mixed review by Sackllah, spotlighting "Compass Point" as the set's only memorable track: "At best, Crime Cutz is a decent release by a talented group that clearly has potential to make some great retro records. At its lowest points, it's filled with clumsy lyrics and meandering tracks that never really go anywhere."

The Battle of Valencia was an identity conflict held in the Valencian society during the Spanish transition to democracy. It involved the progressive valencianism known as Fusterianism (named that way after intellectual Joan Fuster i Ortells) and the conservative anticatalanist regionalism known as blaverism.
Valencianist positions
The positions associated with Valencianism have varied somewhat since the return to democracy, depending on the direction of the supposed "threat". Some Valencianists positions have become mainstream (e.g., the flag), some have lost
their association with Valencianism (e.g., role of the autonomous institutions) while some have become more associated with valencianism, and more hotly debated (e.g., the Valencian language).
Flag of the autonomous community
The question of which flag should be used to represent the Valencian Community is at the origin of the name "Valencianism", which is derived from the Valencian "blava", meaning "blue". The origin of the dispute can be traced to Fuster's "Nosaltres els valencians", where he claims that Valencians and Catalans have always shared the same flag (the Senyera) and that
Valencian groups who had used different flags in the years before Franco "knew not what they did" (no sabien el que es feien, p. 26). The Senyera in its simplest form—sometimes referred to as the quatribarrada—gained a certain (but not overwhelming) support in Valencianist circles, and
was on view at the march in favour of autonomy of 9 October 1977.
The Statute of Morella proposed that the flag of the autonomous community be the Senyera with the royal coat of arms at the centre (those of Peter III of Aragon (1336–87), who did much to formalize the autonomy of the Kingdom of Valencia within the Crown of Aragon). This was adopted as the flag of the Consell del País Valencià on 24 April 1979: however the decision was seen as a
provocation by the UCD, coming as it did after elections
which would have given the centre-right a majority on the Consell but before the new Consell could be constituted.
The more Valencianist groups seized the opportunity provided by the tense political climate: the flags of the Valencia Town Hall were burnt by demonstrators on 9 October 1979, far from the only act of political violence that year.
The socialist representative left the Consell on 22 December 1979 and the choice of flag was reversed on 14 January 1980. The Valencianists continued to insist that the flag of the new autonomous community be recognisably different from that of any other, and particularly that of Catalonia (the Senyera in its simplest form). The Statute of Benicàssim proposed a new design, but the UCD representative on the
Constitutional Committee of the Congress of Deputies managed to impose an amendment making the flag of the autonomous community the same as that of the city of Valencia (for, 17; against, 16; abstention, 1) which includes the blue fringe (the Senyera Coronada).
Since the adoption of the first Statute of Autonomy, the issue has lost much of its controversy. The use of the Senyera coronada has a wide acceptance within the Valencian Community, although some small groups on the left of the political spectrum (e.g. Els Verds, ERPV) continue to refer to it as the "blavera" and the Senyera quatribarrada
can be seen from time to time, particularly in the districts furthest from the capital.
Name of the autonomous community
The question of the name of the autonomous community was initially seen as fairly minor compared to the debates over the flag and the powers which would be granted to the Generalitat Valenciana. However it became the issue which almost caused the rejection of the Statute of Autonomy by the Congress of Deputies in 1982.
At the start of the democratic transition Valencian: País Valencià, (roughly translated as "Valencian Country") seemed to enjoy a wide consensus. It was under this name that the Consell del País Valencià was established, and it was this name which was used in the Call for Autonomy of 8 October 1978, signed by both the UCD and by the postfranquists of the Alianza Popular.
The blaverist view, minority even on the right at first, was that the term País Valencià implied an identification with the Països Catalans, an anathema to the valencianists. In the context of the political tensions of 1979–80, they called ever more loudly for the alternative name Regne de València ("Kingdom of Valencia").

Daniel Harold Rolling (May 26, 1954 – October 25, 2006), known as The Gainesville Ripper, was an American serial killer who murdered five students in Gainesville, Florida, over four days in late August 1990. Rolling later confessed to raping several of his victims, committing a triple homicide in his home city of Shreveport, Louisiana, and attempting to murder his father in May 1990. In total, Rolling confessed to killing eight people. Rolling was sentenced to death for the five Gainesville murders in 1994. He was executed by lethal injection in 2006.
Early years
Danny Rolling was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father was a Shreveport police officer named James Rolling, who told Danny that he was unwanted from birth. James also abused and beat Danny, Danny's mother Claudia, and his brother Kevin for frivolous things, such as breathing in a way that displeased him. In one incident, Danny's mother went to the hospital after claiming her husband tried to make her cut herself with a razor blade. She made repeated attempts to leave her husband but always returned shortly. In one example of the senior Rolling's sense of discipline, he pinned Danny to the ground and handcuffed him, then had police take his son away because he was embarrassed by him. In another story, Danny had a dog, but James would beat the dog so often that it died in Danny's arms.
As a teenager and young adult, Rolling was arrested several times for robberies in Georgia and was caught spying on a woman getting dressed. As an adult, he had trouble trying to assimilate into society and hold down a steady job. At one point, Rolling worked as a waiter at Pancho's restaurant in Shreveport.
Serial killings
In August 1990, Rolling murdered five students (one student from Santa Fe College and four from the University of Florida) during a burglary and robbery spree in Gainesville, Florida. He mutilated his victims' bodies, decapitating one. He then posed them, sometimes using mirrors.
In the early morning hours of Friday, August 24, Rolling broke into the apartment shared by 17-year-old university freshmen Sonja Larson and Christina Powell. Finding Powell asleep on the downstairs couch, he stood over her briefly but did not wake her up, choosing instead to explore the upstairs bedroom where Larson was also asleep. Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams and then stabbing her to death with a Ka-Bar knife. She died trying to fend him off.
Rolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with the knife as he cut her clothes off. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions. He took a shower before leaving the apartment.
A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling broke into the apartment of 18-year-old Christa Hoyt, prying open a sliding glass door with a screwdriver. Finding she was not home, he waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m., Hoyt entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a chokehold. After she had been subdued, he used duct tape to gag her mouth and bind her wrists together behind her back and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her to lie face-down onto the bed and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her aorta. He then flipped her body over and sliced her abdomen open from her pubic bone to her breastbone. After arriving back at his campsite, Rolling could not find his wallet. Thinking he may have lost it at the murder scene, he returned there, at which time he decapitated Hoyt, posed her body in a sitting position at the edge of her bed and placed her head on a shelf facing the corpse. He later claimed his intent was to add to the shock of whoever discovered her.
By this point, the murders had attracted widespread media attention. Many students had begun taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening so early in the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Tracy Paules, who was 23 years old, was living with her roommate Manny Taboada, also 23. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the sliding glass door with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and killed him after a struggle.
Hearing the commotion, Paules went down the hall to Taboada's bedroom and saw Rolling. She attempted to barricade herself in her bedroom, but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped her mouth and wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her over and stabbing her three times in the back. Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.
With the exception of Taboada, all of the victims were petite white brunettes with brown eyes, like Rolling's mother. Although law enforcement initially had very few leads, police did identify two suspects. One suspect was Edward Lewis Humphrey, a University of Florida student who had a history of mental illness and bore numerous scars on his face from a car accident. Humphrey was arrested after a physical altercation with his grandmother and held in custody for five months, until a grand jury refused to indict him on the murder charges citing insufficient evidence. Humphrey's photo was shown repeatedly by media outlets. Authorities publicly cleared him of all charges after Rolling's arrest. The other suspect was also later cleared.
Shreveport murders and tip about Rolling
Louisiana police alerted Florida authorities to an unsolved triple murder in Shreveport on November 4, 1989. Detectives noted that there were similarities between the Gainesville murders and those of 55-year-old William Grissom, his 24-year-old daughter Julie, and his 8-year-old grandson Sean. The family had been attacked in their home as they were preparing for dinner. Afterwards, Julie Grissom's body had been mutilated, cleaned, and posed.
Don Maines, an investigator on the case with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, traveled to Shreveport in November 1990, because of similarities between the murders committed in Gainesville and murders committed in Shreveport. They included: posing of the victims; tape residue on victim's body; and vinegar used to clean the body. Maines said they tested the body fluids from the perpetrator in Shreveport and found that this person also had type B blood. He called the match to the evidence in Gainesville a "revelation" in the case.
Shortly after Maines' trip to Shreveport, a Shreveport resident, Cindy Juracich, called Crime Stoppers and reported that Danny Rolling was possibly connected to the murders in both cities. Three months earlier, in August 1990, Juracich heard a news report about a string of murders, as she traveled through the Florida Panhandle. The report made her think about Rolling, whom she met at her Louisiana hometown church, and his possible link to these three other Shreveport murders. Rolling had said deeply disturbing things to both her and her then-husband, Steven Dobbin. "He'd come over every night for a while, and then one night, Steven came in and he goes, 'He's got to go,'" Juracich said. She also said that Dobbin told her that Rolling had told him he had a problem. "I said, 'What kind of problem,'" Juracich said, "[and Steven said], 'He likes to stick knives into people.'" Juracich said she dismissed these comments when she heard about them because she didn't want to believe Rolling could be responsible for the murders in Shreveport. Danny had also told her, "...'One day, I'm going to leave this town and I'm going to go where the girls are beautiful and I can just lay in the sun and watch beautiful women all day'". News of the Gainesville murders haunted Juracich, so she finally contacted police in November, based on her hunch about Rolling's connection to the murders in both cities. "It would not let me rest," she said. "One day, I picked up the phone, I called Crime Stoppers, and I said, 'I think there's one guy y'all need to investigate -- Danny Rolling.'"
Investigators responded to the tip and quickly found Rolling, who had been arrested on September 7, 1990, for an Ocala supermarket robbery. The robbery had been committed ten days after the bodies of Paules and Taboada were found. Rolling was being held in the Marion County Jail forty miles south of Gainesville. Investigators determined that Rolling had type B blood, like the suspect in both the Gainesville and Shreveport murders.
Once Florida investigators realized that Rolling had multiple convictions for armed robbery, they realized he could have also been responsible for the bank robbery that occurred on the day Christa Hoyt's body was found. They returned to the evidence locker, where the gun, screwdriver, bag of money and cassette player had been stored, and listened to the tape. They also found tools matching marks left at the Gainesville murder scenes. The small camp where he had been living was in a wooded area near apartment complexes frequented by students; investigators discovered audio diaries he had made there alluding to the crimes.
Later it was discovered that on August 5, 1990 Rolling broke into the home of Janet Frake in Sarasota, Florida. He bound and gagged her with duct tape while he sexually assaulted her, but spared her life.
Charges and trial
In November 1991, Rolling was charged with five counts of murder.
Rolling was brought to trial nearly four years after the murders. He claimed his motive was to become a "superstar" similar to Ted Bundy. In 1994, before his trial could get underway, Rolling unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges. Subsequently, State Attorney Rod Smith presented the penalty phase of the prosecution. During his trial, Court TV conducted an interview with Rolling's mother from her home, during which his father could be heard shouting off-camera.
On April 20, 1994, Rolling was sentenced to death. Rolling was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and paraphilia.
Execution
Shortly before he was executed in Florida for the series of killings in Gainesville, Rolling claimed responsibility for the Shreveport murders, handing his spiritual adviser Reverend Mike Hudspeth and Florida police a handwritten confession and apology. In a written statement made shortly before his execution, Rolling confessed to the murders of the Grissom family in Shreveport. Rolling had a last meal of lobster tail. He sang a gospel hymn, but made no statement immediately before his execution, which was witnessed by many of his victims' relatives.
Rolling was executed by lethal injection at Florida State Prison on October 25, 2006, after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch appeal. He was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m EDT.
In media
Rolling has been the subject of several written works. His crime spree inspired screenwriter Kevin Williamson to pen the script of the 1996 slasher film Scream.

Varuna (; , , Malay: Baruna) is a Vedic deity associated initially with the sky, later also with the seas as well as Ṛta (justice) and Satya (truth). He is found in the oldest layer of Vedic literature of Hinduism, such as hymn 7.86 of the Rigveda. He is also mentioned in the Tamil grammar work Tolkāppiyam, as Kadalon the god of sea and rain. He is said to be the son of Kashyapa (one of the seven ancient sages).
In the Hindu Puranas, Varuna is the god of oceans, his vehicle is a Makara (crocodile) and his weapon is a Pasha (noose, rope loop). He is the guardian deity of the western direction. In some texts, he is the father of the Vedic sage Vasishtha.
Varuna is found in Japanese Buddhist mythology as Suiten. He is also found in Jainism.
Etymology
In Hindu tradition, the theonym Váruṇa (Devanagari: वरुण) is described as a derivation from the verbal root vṛ ("to surround, to cover" or "to restrain, bind") by means of a suffixal -uṇa-, for an interpretation of the name as "he who covers or binds", in reference to the cosmological ocean or river encircling the world, but also in reference to the "binding" by universal law or Ṛta.
Georges Dumézil (1934) made a cautious case for the identity of Varuna and the Greek god Ouranos at the earliest Indo-European cultural level.
The etymological identification of the name Ouranos with the Sanskrit Varuṇa is based in the derivation of both names from the PIE root *ŭer with a sense of "binding" – the Indic king-god Varuṇa binds the wicked, the Greek king-god Ouranos binds the Cyclopes. While the derivation of the name Varuṇa from this root is undisputed, this derivation of the Greek name is now widely rejected in favour of derivation from the root *wers- "to moisten, drip" (Sanskrit vṛṣ "to rain, pour").
Hindu texts
Vedas
In the earliest layer of the Rigveda, Varuna is the guardian of moral law, one who punishes those who sin without remorse, and who forgives those who err with remorse. He is mentioned in many Rigvedic hymns, such as 7.86–88, 1.25, 2.27–30, 8.8, 9.73 and others. His relationship with waters, rivers and oceans is mentioned in the Vedas. Rig veda 10.123 says Hiranyapaksha (golden winged bird) as the messenger of Varuna. The golden winged messenger bird of Varuna may not be a mythical one but most probably flamingos because they have colourful wings and the sukta further describes Vulture as the messenger of Yama, the beaks of both these birds have similar morphology and flamingos are seen nearby seashores and marshlands.
Varuna and Mitra are the gods of the societal affairs including the oath, and are often twinned Mitra-Varuna. Both Mitra and Varuna are classified as Asuras in the Rigveda (e.g. RV 5.63.3), although they are also addressed as Devas as well (e.g. RV 7.60.12). Varuna, being the king of the Asuras, was adopted or made the change to a Deva after the structuring of the primordial cosmos, imposed by Indra after he defeats Vrtra.
According to Doris Srinivasan, a professor of Indology focusing on religion, Varuna-Mitra pair is an ambiguous deity just like Rudra-Shiva pair. Both have wrathful-gracious aspects in Indian mythology. Both Varuna and Rudra are synonymous with "all comprehensive sight, knowledge", both were the guardian deity of the north in the Vedic texts (Varuna later gets associated with west), both can be offered "injured, ill offerings", all of which suggest that Varuna may have been conceptually overlapping with Rudra. Further, the Rigvedic hymn 5.70 calls Mitra-Varuna pair as rudra, states Srinivasan. According to Samuel Macey and other scholars, Varuna had been the more ancient Indo-Aryan deity in 2nd millennium BCE, who gave way to Rudra in the Hindu pantheon, and Rudra-Shiva became both "timeless and the god of time".
In Vajasaneyi Samhita 21.40 (Yajurveda), Varuna is called the patron deity of physicians, one who has "a hundred, a thousand remedies". His capacity and association with "all comprehensive knowledge" is also found in the Atharvaveda (~1000 BCE). Varuna also finds a mention in the early Upanishads, where his role evolves. In verse 3.9.26 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (~800 BCE), for example, he is stated to be the god of the western quarter, but one who is founded on "water" and dependent ultimately on "the heart" and the fire of soul. In the Katha Upanishad, Aditi is identified to be same as the goddess earth. She is stated in the Vedic texts to be the mother of Varuna and Mitra along with other Vedic gods, and in later Hindu mythology she as mother earth is stated to be mother of all gods.
In Yajurveda it is said: "In fact Varuna is Vishnu and Vishnu is Varuna and hence the auspicious offering is to be made to these deities." || 8.59 ||
Upanishads
Varuna, addressed as Varuni explained Brahman in Taittiriya Upanishad to sage Bhrigu. First six anuvakas of Bhrigu Valli are called Bhargavi Varuni Vidya, which means "the knowledge Bhrigu got from (his father) Varuni". It is in these anuvakas that sage Varuni advises Bhrigu with one of the oft-cited definition of Brahman, as "that from which beings originate, through which they live, and in which they re-enter after death, explore that because that is Brahman". This thematic, all encompassing, eternal nature of reality and existence develops as the basis for Bhrigu's emphasis on introspection, to help peel off the outer husks of knowledge, in order to reach and realize the innermost kernel of spiritual Self-knowledge.
Ramayana
Rama interacts with Varuna in the Hindu epic Ramayana. For example, faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to Lanka, where his abducted wife Sita is held captive by the demon king Ravana, Rama (an Avatar of Vishnu) performs a pravpavesha (prayer, tapasya) to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans, for three days and three nights, states Ramesh Menon. Varuna does not respond, and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged. He states to his brother Lakshamana that "even lords of the elements listen only to violence, Varuna does not respect gentleness, and peaceful prayers go unheard".
With his bow and arrow, Rama prepares to attack the oceans to dry up the waters and create a bed of sand for his army of monkeys to cross and thus confront Ravana. Lakshmana appeals to Rama, translates Menon, that he should return to "peaceful paths of our fathers, you can win this war without laying waste the sea". Rama shoots his weapon sending the ocean into flames. As Rama increases the ferocity of his weapons, Varuna arises out of the oceans. He bows to Rama, stating that he himself did not know how to help Rama because the sea is deep, vast and he cannot change the nature of sea. Varuna asked Rama to remember that he is "the soul of peace and love, wrath does not suit him". Varuna promised to Rama that he will not disturb him or his army as they build a bridge and cross over to Lanka. Although, most of the sources claim it was Samudra, the god of the oceans who met Rama not the water god Varuna.
In Tolkappiyam
The Tolkāppiyam, a Tamil grammar work from 3rd century BCE divides the people of ancient Tamilakam into 5 Sangam landscape divisions: kurinji, mullai, paalai, marutham and neithal. Each landscape are designated with different gods. Neithal is described as a seashore landscape occupied by fishermen and seatraders, with the god of sea and rain, Varunan or Kadalōn. "Varuna" means water which denotes the ocean in the Tamil language.
Festivals
Jhulelal is considered an avatar of Varuna by Sindhi Hindus. The festivals of Cheti Chand and Chalio are dedicated to Jhulelal.
Cheti Chand
The Cheti Chand festival in the Hindu month of Chaitra marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi Hindu community, it also marks the mythical birth of Uderolal in the year 1007. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the saviour of the Sindhi Hindus, who according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal's birthday.
Chaliya saheb
Chalio or Chaliho, also called Chaliho Sahib, is a forty-day-long festival celebrated by Sindhi Hindus to express their gratitude to Jhulelal for saving them from their impending conversion to Islam. The festival is observed every year in the months of July to August; dates vary according to Hindu calendar. It is a thanksgiving celebration in honor of Varuna Deva for listening to their prayers.
Narali Poornima
Nārali Poornima is a ceremonial day observed by Hindu fishing communities in Maharashtra, India particularly around Mumbai and the Konkan coast. It is held on the full-moon day of the Hindu month of Shravan which falls around July or August. On this day offerings such as rice, flowers and coconuts as offered to Lord Varuna, the god of ocean and waters.
Beyond Hinduism and India
Sri Lankan Tamils (Karaiyar caste)
Karaiyar is a Sri Lankan Tamil caste found mainly on the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka, and globally among the Tamil diaspora.
They are traditionally a seafaring community that is engaged in fishing, shipment and seaborne trade. They fish mostly in deep seas, and employ gillnet and seine fishing methods. The Karaiyars were the major maritime traders and boat owners who among other things, traded with pearls, chanks, tobacco, and shipped goods overseas to countries such as India, Myanmar and Indonesia. The community known for their maritime history, are also reputed as a warrior caste who contributed as army and navy soldiers of Tamil kings. They were noted as the army generals and navy captains of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. The Karaiyars emerged in the 1980s as strong representatives of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. The nuclear leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have background in the wealthier enterprising section of the Karaiyars.
The word "Karaiyar" is derived from the Tamil language words karai ("coast" or "shore") and yar ("people"). The term Kareoi mentioned by 2nd century AD writer Ptolemy, is identified with the Tamil word "Karaiyar". The Portuguese and Dutch sources mentions them under the term Careas, Careaz, or Carias, which are terms denoting "Karaiyar".
Kurukulam, Varunakulam and Arasakulam were historically one of the significant clans of the Karaiyars. Kurukulam, meaning "clan of the Kuru", may be a reference to their origin from Kurumandalam (meaning "realm of Kuru's") of Southern India. They attribute their origin myth from the Kuru Kingdom, mentioned in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Some scholars derived Kurukulam from Kuru, the Tamil name for Jupiter. Varunakulam, meaning "clan of Varuna", is a reference to their maritime origin. Varuna is the god of sea and rain, mentioned in Vedic Literature, but also in Sangam literature as the principal deity of the Neithal Sangam landscape (i.e. littoral landscape). Arasakulam means "clan of kings".. They used the Makara as emblem, the mount of their clan deity, the sea god Varuna, which was also seen on their flags.
Sindhi Hindus
Jhulelal is believed by Sindhi Hindus to be an incarnation of Varuna. They celebrate the festival of Cheti Chand in his honor. The festival marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi community it also marks the birth of Uderolal in year 1007, after they prayed to Hindu god Varuna to save them from the persecution by tyrannical Muslim ruler named Mirkhshah. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the champion of the people in Sindh, from both religions. Among his Sufi Muslim followers, Jhulelal is known as "Khwaja Khizir" or "Sheikh Tahit". The Hindu Sindhi, according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal's birthday.
Buddhism
Theravada
The Pali Canon of the Theravada school recognizes Varuṇa (Sanskrit; Pali: Varuna) as a king of the devas and companion of Sakka, Pajāpati and Isāna. In the battle against the Asuras, the devas of Tāvatiṃsa were asked to look upon the banner of Varuna in order to have all their fears dispelled (S.i.219).
The Tevijja Sutta mentions him among Indra, Soma, Isāna, Pajāpati, Yama and Mahiddhi as gods that are invoked by the brahmins.
The Ātānātiya Sutta lists him among the Yakkha chiefs.
Buddhaghosa states (SA.i.262) that Varuna is equal in age and glory (vanna) with Sakka and takes the third seat in the assembly of devas.
Mahayana
In East Asian Buddhism, Varuna is a dharmapāla and often classed as one of the Twelve Devas (Japanese: Jūniten, 十二天). He presides over the western direction.
In Japan, he is called "Suiten" (水天 lit. "water deva"). He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten (Śakra/Indra), Fūten(Vāyu), Emmaten (Yama), Rasetsuten (Nirṛti/Rākṣasa), Ishanaten (Īśāna), Bishamonten (Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera), Katen (Agni), Bonten (Brahmā), Jiten (Pṛthivī), Nitten (Sūrya/Āditya), and Gatten (Chandra).
Shinto
Varuna is also worshipped in Japan's Shinto religion. One of the Shinto shrines dedicated to him is the Suitengū ("Palace of Suiten") in Tokyo. After the Japanese emperor issued the Shinbutsu bunri, the separation of Shinto and Buddhist practices as part of the Meiji Restoration, Varuna/Suiten was identified with the Japanese supreme God, Amenominakanushi.

Fort Souville, briefly called Fort Lemoine, was one of the forts of the Verdun Fortification District, situated in the commune of Fleury-devant-Douaumont. Constructed between 1876 and 1879 at an altitude of 396m, it is a first generation fort. It served as a key battlefield in the 1916 Battle of Verdun during World War I. The fort was armed on its ramparts with 9 cannons and 5 mortars, with 8 pieces of artillery used as flanking fire. A Bussiere turret in attached battery was also present.
Location
The fort is part of the interior belt of forts, one of two belts securing Verdun. Fort Souville was part of the first sector (Northeast of the city), serving as the first sector commander's headquarters, connected to central command via telephone.
Fort Souville is located south of Fort Douaumont and southwest of Fort Vaux.
History
The fort was one of the first forts of the Séré de Rivières system, being constructed of masonry and limestone rubble covered with soil. Built 1875–1879, the fort was modified from 1888–1890, excavating underground shelters and reinforcing the powder magazine with concrete.
The planned garrison was 326 men and 32 artillery pieces. The fort's name originates not from a nearby settlement, but from the birthplace of the designer, Gustave de la Taille.
A turret for two 155mm Bussière cannons was installed from 1890–1891, 120m to the west of the fort.
By the Decree of 21 January 1887, the Minister of War Georges Boulanger renamed all forts, batteries, and barracks to those of prior military leaders. Fort Souville was thus rechristened Fort Lemoine, in reference to General Louis Lemoine. The new name was engraved on the pediment of the entrance. On 13 October 1887, Boulanger's successor, Théophile Ferron, abrogated the decree. The fort returned to its prior name while retaining the inscription at the entrance.
July 1916 Combat
On 11 July 1916, the Bavarian Guard infantry launched an assault on the village of Fleury and attempted to seize Fort Souville.
The Fleury sector was held by the French 128th Division under the command of general Riberpray. the 167th and 168th Infantry Regiment of the 255th Brigade under Colonel Coquelin de Lisle held the front line. The 167th held the foremost position, with the 168th providing support from behind.
On 9 July, the 167th Regiment was shelled by German Artillery using both explosive and gas shells.
During the night of 10 July, a captured German officer was interrogated by the 167th Regiment, revealing the planned assault for the next day.
At 5 am on 11 July, a violent bombardment began on the French lines prior to the assault by German infantry. At 5:42, the Bavarian Guards launched their assault, with flamethrowers in tow. They penetrated the French lines before the French had time to react, with ensuing hand-to-hand combat with both grenade and bayonet.
The German gas and shells interrupted all heliograph communications with Fort Souville.
At 6 o'clock, Colonel Coquelin de Lisle sent a homing pigeon with the following message: "The 255th Brigade's situation in front of Fleury is grave, with gas bombardments and the enemy's attacks, which were delayed, and morale is high but the men are exhausted. I need artillery support with 100 red fuses and 100 white fuses. The main attack appears to be between the station and the village of Fleury.
By 6:50, the Germans were approaching brigade headquarters. The order to burn confidential documents was given, with Colonel Coquelin de Lisle fighting with his rifle side by side with his men.
The 140th East Prussian Infantry Regiment aimed to seize Fort Souville, but failed to break through French lines. Meanwhile, the Bavarian attack progressed from south of Fleury to near Fort Souville. However, heavy French artillery fire inflicted severe casualties, causing the attack to stall.
However, a shell destroyed the Ménétrier battalion's machine guns, situated between the Ménétrier and Gérard battalions. German forces penetrated this gap and advanced closer to brigade headquarters, with Colonel Coquelin de Lisle killed in combat.
In the evening, the 169th and 100th Infantry Regiments moved towards "the ravine of Our Lady", which was called "the ravine of Death" by the men. The 100th regiment advanced at the head of the line, with its 2nd and 3rd battalions led the march while the 1st battalion stayed in reserve. They drove back elements of the Bavarian Guards who had crossed the railway, taking 80 prisoners. During the night, a severe German bombardment on "the ravine of Death" inflicted severe casualties on the 1st battalion, which had advanced in support of the 2nd. The majority of its soldiers were killed, as well as their leader, Commander Forlet.

Wartime Publicity
The war artist François Flameng illustrated the events of Fort Souville in numerous sketches and drawings in the magazine L'Illustration.
Current State
After several years, Fort Souville was abandoned, having become obsolete by artillery and Verdun's location. The fort has since deteriorated, but visitors may still visit and take photos while exploring the site.

Hera Agathon, also called Isis, is a fictional character from the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series.
She is the first, and only, known Cylon-Human hybrid child to be born and she first appears, at birth, in the episode "Downloaded". She is the daughter of the Cylon Sharon "Athena" Agathon and human father Karl "Helo" Agathon. They name her "Hera" after the Colonial goddess. In the final plot development of the series, shown in the closing moments of the series finale, it is revealed that her Cylon-Human mtDNA is the starting point of the Homo sapiens of the Earth located in our Solar System, as she is the Mitochondrial Eve.
Background and details
The humanoid Cylons are as biological as they are technological and can potentially mate with humans and produce offspring. This fact seems to be part of the "plan" of the Cylons who want to repopulate the human colonies with a new generation of hybrid beings. Once the Cylons learn of Athena's pregnancy, they decide the child must be protected at all costs and thus have impact on the Cylon agenda in pursuing the refugee fleet. Hera is believed to be the only successful hybrid born, which is believed to be due to the love between her parents. Attempts at producing hybrids in "farms" on the occupied Colonies have all presumably failed in the early stages of gestation, if they ever got that far.
Fearing that Cylon spies within the fleet would try to kidnap Hera, the President Laura Roslin of the Fleet secretly orders Dr. Cottle to fake the child's death. Hera had been born with underdeveloped lungs and Cottle uses this fact as the cause of her death. Sharon, however, refuses to believe this and accuses Cottle of having murdered her child on Roslin's or Admiral Adama's orders.
Later, while Helo and Chief Tyrol scatter ashes into space that they believe are Hera's, Roslin and Cottle secretly meet on Colonial One and give Hera to a woman named Maya who had lost a child in a previous Cylon attack. Emphasizing the need for secrecy, Roslin's aide Tory Foster tells Maya that the baby's mother is an anonymous Pegasus officer who cannot care for the child due to political and religious reasons. Maya subsequently names the baby Isis.
After a year on planet New Caprica, Isis is still alive. She had been under the care of Maya, who works with Roslin in a New Caprica school. Roslin tries to keep Isis and her adoptive mother hidden (see Exodus, Part 1). However, Maya is killed during the evacuation of New Caprica (in the episode Exodus, Part 2). Hera is taken into the custody of Number Three.
During the race to Earth, Hera begins to get sick and her Cylon caretakers cannot determine what the problem is. During a Cylon diplomatic trip to Galactica, Boomer tells Hera's biological mother Sharon "Athena" Agathon that Hera is still alive and is sick (see The Eye of Jupiter). At Athena's request, her husband Helo shoots and kills her so that she can download to a new body in the Cylon fleet and attempt a rescue of her daughter (see Rapture). On download, Caprica-Six takes her to Hera, who is under Boomer's care. Hera appears to be comforted by her mother's presence. As Caprica-Six observes, despite Boomer and Athena being biologically identical, Hera can apparently distinguish between them, and she has missed her real mother. However, Athena also discovers that Hera's belly is very hard, indicating a possible blockage in her bowels, and advocates that Hera be examined by a human doctor aboard Galactica. With help from Caprica-Six, Athena and Hera escape to Galactica, where Hera is presumably examined by Doc Cottle.
As a "hybrid", Hera/Isis possesses incredible regenerative properties. Some of her blood is donated to Laura Roslin, which helps treat her cancer to the point where she completely recovers (see "Epiphanies"). This fact leads to Laura's decision to not have Athena's fetus aborted as she had previously ordered. It is not yet known if Isis/Hera possesses any of the machine qualities of her mother, such as the fiberoptic neural pathways, and she is too young to determine if she has the superhuman physical prowess demonstrated by other humanoid Cylon models such as Leoben Conoy and Number Six. However, in Islanded in a Stream of Stars it is revealed that she possesses the Cylon ability to project (to inhabit an internally generated virtual environment and to share this environment with other Cylons). As previously mentioned, Hera can distinguish her mother apart from the other Number Eights, but whether this is attributed to a Cylon inherited ability or to the emotional bond between a mother and her child is unknown.
In Someone to Watch Over Me, Hera gives Starbuck a drawing. Later, Starbuck realizes that the "stars" in Hera's drawing match up with the notes to "All Along the Watchtower" - the song that activated the Final Five. Hera is kidnapped by Boomer who arrives at the daycare dressed as her mother and then quickly drugs the little girl with a drink. Pretending to be Athena, Boomer smuggles Hera onto a Raptor inside a provisions container (Athena had planned to leave on an extended mission) and jumps away.
In the final episode, in which Hera is rescued and reunited with her mother, it is revealed that Hera is apparently the Mitochondrial Eve and lived 150,000 years before the present day. Her remains (described as being those of a "young woman") are recovered by the Smithsonian Institution in modern-day Tanzania.

Lew Beach is a hamlet in the town of Rockland, New York, United States. It is at the northernmost corner of the town and thus also of Sullivan County, near the tripoint with Delaware and Ulster counties, within the Catskill Park. Its ZIP code, 12758, extends into the neighboring sections of the latter county's town of Hardenburgh, and some of those areas are considered part of Lew Beach as well.
Its small downtown is located at the confluence of Shin Creek and the Beaver Kill, which brings many fly fishermen to Lew Beach during New York's trout season. It has a few houses, a church, store, firehouse, and park with baseball field.
History
Originally the hamlet was named "Shin Creek", after the Beaver Kill's tributary that flows through town. It was later renamed "Lew Beach" after US Congressman Lewis Beach (March 30, 1835 – August 10, 1886).
The Beaverkill Valley Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The Essex Memorial Arena was an ice-hockey arena in Essex, Ontario, Canada constructed in 1960-1961. The capacity of the Essex Memorial Arena was 1,501 and it served as the home ice for the Essex 73's of the Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League from 1973–2009. During that time the 73's won 16 Great Lakes League Championships and 6 Ontario Junior C titles, The 2008–2009 season was to be the final year for the 73's at the Essex Memorial Arena and in that year the 73's captured the Ontario Junior C crown finishing with a perfect 31-0 record in the arena. A replacement arena was completed in September 2009. Various groups including Essex Minor Hockey continued to use the arena until it was demolished in the summer of 2015.
History
The first records mentioning the potential of an artificial rink for Essex are from the mid-1950s. The idea grew and by March 1956 the Parks Board created an Arena Committee, which it named the Essex Memorial Arena Campaign Committee, and appointed members from the Essex Rotary Club, the Legion (Branch 201), and the Kinsmen Club of Essex. The Kinsmen Club of Essex were the first to initiate a challenge to the town to raise $50,000. The name of the arena was one of the first issues addressed. It was decided that it would be called Essex Memorial Arena in honour of the men who had fought and died in World War I and World War II.
Indoor Design
The first arena proposed by the committee was an outdoor arena. An outdoor arena could only function from December 1 to April 15. The design allowed for the easy addition of a roof at a later time. The committee soon changed the original proposal from an outdoor arena to a closed arena due to the long-term economic benefit. It was $15,000 more expensive for the freezing equipment for an outdoor rink than for an indoor rink, and the utility costs for the outdoor rink would have been much higher. Another bonus to having an indoor rink was the longer skating season; 6 months compared to 4½. With 10,000 people in the area surrounding Essex the indoor option would increase revenue to easily pay for up front extra cost for an indoor arena.
Completing the construction
The Essex community was not completely supportive of the arena building project. They feared the arena would increase water rates in town, and that the arena was an unsafe structure. By the final stages of construction funds were drying up and $100,000 would be needed to complete it. On June 19, 1961 the town went to the polls to settle the issue, voting 551 to 392 in favour of the arena loan. The loan was obtained and the building was completed within the year. The walls were made of 12" (30.5 cm) thick reinforced masonry blocks. The roof is supported by eleven trusses. The arena has heated dressing rooms, a canteen and 1054 seats. It took 937 days to fully complete the arena. The Essex Memorial Arena Campaign Committee was then dissolved and the town took control and created an Arena Commission.
The arena officially opened on November 25, 1961.
Decommission and Demolition
In the early 2000s the deterioration of the southeast corner of the arena forced an emergency closure for repair work. This, along with the shortage of ice time in Essex Centre prompted Essex to build a new arena which was completed for the 2009-10 hockey season. Despite the completion of the new Essex Centre Sports Complex next to the Essex Memorial Arena the older structure continued to be used for hockey for a time. In August 2011 Essex and Lakeshore, Ontario agreed to keep the arena open until 2014 when Lakeshore's own new arena would be completed. With some roof repairs the arena remained open until the end of the 2014-15 hockey season. The arena was demolished in the summer of 2015.

Lisa McCune (born 19 February 1971) is an Australian actress, known for her role in TV series Blue Heelers as Senior Constable Maggie Doyle, and in Sea Patrol as Lieutenant Kate McGregor RAN. She has won four Gold Logie Awards.
McCune has also featured in many theatre roles.
Early career (1986–1993)
Born in Sydney, McCune grew up in Perth. She first performed on stage at the age of 15 playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz at the Limelight Theatre in Wanneroo, Western Australia.
After attending Carine Senior High School and graduating from Greenwood Senior High School, she was accepted into both the classical singing and musical theatre courses at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). She graduated with a BA in Music Theatre in 1990. Upon graduation, McCune secured an agent, Robyn Gardiner Management (RGM Associates), and took on various jobs in Sydney and Melbourne.
In February 1991, she won a twelve-month contract with Coles Supermarkets for a series of print and TV advertisements in which she played Lisa, the girl-next-door checkout chick.
McCune performed in a statewide tour of Victorian high schools in the educational John Romeril play about work experience, called Working Out, was in the chorus for a Sydney musical version of Great Expectations starring Philip Gould, and starred as the aspiring ballerina postulant, Sister Mary Leo, in the sequel to the Dan Goggin musical Nunsense.
She had a brief appearance in a re-enactment about a possible UFO-sighting in Bass Strait for the American series Unsolved Mysteries and a role in the 1993 satirical horror movie Body Melt in which her heavily pregnant character was attacked by a ferocious placenta before dying from an exploding stomach. McCune also sang in a couple of bands, including George Kapiniaris' Flares and Choice.
In 1991, she filmed a pilot for a Steve Vizard/Artist Services comedy called Turn it Up (aka Radio Waves). In 1993, McCune won the lead part of Allie Carter in the pilot of Newlyweds before being replaced by Annie Jones for the series.
Blue Heelers (1993–2000)
McCune shot to fame in September 1993 at age 22 when she debuted as Constable Maggie Doyle in Blue Heelers, playing the role until the seventh season. During this time she won the Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Television Personality four times.
Throughout her Blue Heelers run, she occasionally took time off to appear in other productions. In 1996 McCune appeared opposite Brett Climo who played her brother in Blue Heelers, in a friend's film The Inner Sanctuary. In early 1997 she played the role of Anne in the Melbourne Theatre Company's (MTC) production of Sondheim's A Little Night Music. In 1998, McCune played Cinderella in another Sondheim musical, Into the Woods. She also did two short seasons of the classic two-hander Love Letters.
In early 1999 she took six weeks off Blue Heelers to play one of the leads, Mary Abacus, in the miniseries adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's The Potato Factory, which earned her a nomination for an AFI award for Best Actress in a TV Drama. In July 1999, a couple of months before finishing on Blue Heelers, she starred alongside John Wood in She Loves Me.
Later career (2000–present)
Immediately after finishing Blue Heelers, she starred alongside John Waters, Bert Newton, Nikki Webster, Rachel Marley and later Rob Guest in a stage version of The Sound of Music, as Maria von Trapp.
In 2001, while she was pregnant with her first child, her portrait by Shaun Clark was entered in the Archibald Prize. She was off screens for a year to be a stay-at-home mother.
In 2002, her next project was a "comeback" role in the television series Marshall Law with Alison Whyte and former Blue Heelers cast member William McInnes. Although it rated well in the first week, the series was critically panned and its subsequent low ratings ensured it was cancelled after one season.
In 2004, after another year off due to the birth to her second child, McCune slowly began to return to television. She again was the advertising face of Coles Supermarkets. She also hosted Seven Network shows The World Around Us and Forensic Investigators. McCune also appeared as the love interest opposite Matt Day in the ABC telemovie Hell Has Harbour Views.
In September 2005, McCune guest starred in a four-episode storyline on MDA alongside her former Blue Heelers co-star Paul Bishop. Also in 2005 she narrated a second season of Forensic Investigators and appeared in the Australian film Little Fish, starring alongside Cate Blanchett and Sam Neill in the early stages of her third pregnancy. In 2006, she played Annabel in Tripping Over.

Her character is the executive officer (second in command) Lieutenant Kate McGregor, of HMAS Hammersley, a fictional Royal Australian Navy patrol boat. There were five seasons of the show, and it was cancelled due to financial issues resulting from the scheduled loss of pertinent government tax credits.
On 5 April 2008, she began her role of Sarah Brown in the major stage production Guys and Dolls, playing for 20 weeks at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne before being revived for a Sydney season at the Capitol Theatre on 12 March 2009.
In 2010, she appeared as Jean in the MTC production of Sarah Ruhl's Dead Man's Cell Phone. McCune also appeared as the celebrity guest in the reasonably-priced ute/car in season 3, episode 1 of Top Gear Australia in August. She appeared alongside Richard Roxburgh in season 1, episode 2 of the television series Rake, which aired in November.
McCune starred Dr. Sam Stewart in Reef Doctors, an Australian television drama series that ran 9 June 2013 to 7 September 2013.
In 2014, she starred as Anna Leonowens in Opera Australia's production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, playing opposite Teddy Tahu Rhodes in Brisbane and Sydney, and Lou Diamond Phillips in Melbourne.

is a popular film genre in Japanese cinema which focuses on the lives and dealings of yakuza, Japanese organized crime syndicates. In the silent film era, depictions of bakuto (precursors to modern yakuza) as sympathetic Robin Hood-like characters were common.
Two types of yakuza films emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. The Nikkatsu studio was known for modern yakuza films inspired by Hollywood gangster films, while Toei was the main producer of what is known as . Set in the Meiji and Taishō eras, ninkyo eiga depict honorable outlaws torn between giri (duty) and ninjo (personal feelings).
In contrast to ninkyo eiga, based on real crime stories became popular in the 1970s. These portrayed modern yakuza not as honorable heirs to the samurai code, but as ruthless street thugs living for their own desires.
Early films
In the silent film era, films depicting bakuto (precursors to modern yakuza) as Robin Hood-like characters were common. They often portrayed historical figures who had accumulated legends over time as "sympathetic but lonely figures, forced to live an outlaw existence and longing, however hopelessly, to return to straight society." Kunisada Chūji was a popular subject, such as in Daisuke Itō's three-part A Diary of Chuji's Travels from 1927. During World War II, the Japanese government used cinema as wartime propaganda, and as such depictions of bakuto generally faded. Mark Schilling named Akira Kurosawa's Drunken Angel from 1948 as the first to depict post-war yakuza in his book The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films, although he noted it does not follow the genre's common themes. The Occupation of Japan that followed World War II also monitored the films being made. However, when the occupation ended in 1952, period-pieces of all types returned to popularity. A notable modern yakuza example is 1961's Hana to Arashi to Gang by Teruo Ishii which launched a series that depicted contemporary gang life including gang warfare.
"Borderless Action" and Ninkyo eiga
The studio Nikkatsu made modern yakuza films under the or "Borderless Action" moniker, which, unlike other studios in the genre, borrowed heavily from Hollywood gangster films. These are typified by the Wataridori series that started in 1959 and star Akira Kobayashi and, in most installments, Joe Shishido. Another popular series in the style was the Kenjū Buraichō series starring Keiichirō Akagi and, again, Joe Shishido. However, this series ended abruptly in 1961 due to Akagi's death.A subset of films known as or "chivalry films" then began to thrive. Most were created by the Toei studio and produced by Koji Shundo, who became close with actual yakuza before becoming a producer, and despite his denial, is said to have been one himself. Set in the Meiji and Taishō eras, the kimono-clad yakuza hero of ninkyo films (personified by Kōji Tsuruta and Ken Takakura) was always portrayed as a stoic honorable outlaw torn between the contradictory values of giri (duty) and ninjo (personal feelings). Sadao Yamane stated their willingness to fight and die to save someone or their boss was portrayed as "something beautiful." In his book, Schilling cited Tadashi Sawashima's Jinsei Gekijo: Hishakaku from 1963 as starting the ninkyo eiga trend. Ninkyo eiga were popular with young males that had traveled to cities from the countryside in search of jobs and education, only to find themselves in harsh work conditions for low pay. In their book Yakuza Film and Their Times, Tsukasa Shiba and Sakae Aoyama write that these young men "isolated in an era of high economic growth and tight social structures" were attracted to the "motifs of male comrades banding together to battle the power structure."
Shundo supervised Takakura and helped Toei sign Tsuruta, additionally his own daughter Junko Fuji became a popular female yakuza actress starring in the Hibotan Bakuto series. Nikkatsu made their first ninkyo eiga, Otoko no Monsho starring Hideki Takahashi, in 1963 to combat Toei's success in the genre. However, today Nikkatsu is best known for the surreal B movies by Seijun Suzuki, which culminated with the director being fired after 1967's Branded to Kill. Likewise, Daiei Film entered the field with Akumyō in 1961 starring Shintaro Katsu. They also had Toei's rival in the female yakuza genre with Kyōko Enami starring in the Onna Tobakuchi series.
In 1965, Teruo Ishii directed the first installment in the Abashiri Prison series, which was a huge success and launched Takakura to stardom.
1970s and Jitsuroku eiga
Many Japanese movie critics cite the retirement of Junko Fuji in 1972 as marking the decline of the ninkyo eiga. Just as moviegoers were getting tired of the ninkyo films, a new breed of yakuza films emerged, the . These films portrayed post-war yakuza not as honorable heirs to the samurai code, but as ruthless, treacherous street thugs living for their own desires. Many jitsuroku eiga were based on true stories, and filmed in a documentary style with shaky camera. The Jitsuroku genre was popularized by Kinji Fukasaku's groundbreaking 1973 yakuza epic Battles Without Honor and Humanity. Based on the events of real-life yakuza turfs in Hiroshima Prefecture, the film starring Bunta Sugawara spawned four sequels and another three part series.
Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane believes the films were popular because of the time of their release; Japan's economic growth was at its peak and at the end of the 1960s the student uprisings took place. The young people had similar feelings to those of the post-war society depicted in the film. Schilling wrote that after the success of Battles Without Honor and Humanity, Takakura and Tsuruta received less and fewer roles at the direction of Toei's president. Soon after, Shundo retired, although he would later return.
Decline and home video resurgence
In the 1980s, yakuza movies drastically declined due in part to the rise of home video VCRs. One exception was the Gokudō no Onnatachi series starring Shima Iwashita, which was based on a book of interviews with the wives and girlfriends of real gangsters. In 1994, Toei actually announced that The Man Who Shot the Don starring Hiroki Matsukata would be their last yakuza film unless it made $4 million US in home video rentals. It did not and they announced they would stop producing such movies, although they returned a couple of years later.
But in the 1990s, the low-budget direct-to-video movies called Gokudō brought a wealth of yakuza movies, such as Toei's V-Cinema line in 1990. Many young directors had freedom to push the genre's envelope. One such director was Rokurō Mochizuki who broke through with Onibi in 1997. Directors such as Shinji Aoyama and Kiyoshi Kurosawa started out in the home video market before becoming regulars on the international festival circuit. Though the most well-known gokudō creator is Takashi Miike, who has become known internationally for his extremely violent, genre pushing and border crossing (yakuza movies taking place outside Japan, such as his 1997 Rainy Dog) films in the style.
One director who did not partake in the home video circuit is Takeshi Kitano, whose existential yakuza films are known around the world for a unique style. His films use harsh edits, minimalist dialogue, odd humor, and extreme violence that began with Sonatine (1993) and was perfected in Hana-bi (1997).

St Patrick's Church is a Roman Catholic church in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. It serves the Parish of the Holy Redeemer in the Deanery of Huddersfield, in the Diocese of Leeds.
Built in 1832 for use as a parish church, it was designed by Joseph Kaye, an architect from Bradford. It is situated on the junction between New North Road and Castlegate in the centre of the town. It is a Grade II listed building.
History
Construction
In 1831, land for the church was leased from a local family, the Ramsdens. Construction began that year and the church was designed by Joseph Kaye of Huddersfield (1783-1858). On 26 September 1832, the church was opened.
Decoration
In 1874, the interior was redecorated. That year, a new stained-glass windows was installed in the sanctuary of the church. In 1889, new seating was put into the church as well as a new organ.
In 1962, reordering of the church took place. A new porch was added, and a new altar and reredos were installed. More reordering followed with the side altars being later removed and lectern and font being added. From 1980 to 1981, the exterior of the church was cleaned.
In 1982 the church was reordered and a new altar, ambo, font and tabernacle pedestal, made from locally quarried stone, were installed. In 2009 a new organ was installed - the first to be specifically built for the church.
Parish
In 2007, the parishes of St Patrick's; Holy Family, Slaithwaite in the west; and Our Lady of Lourdes, Sheepridge in the east of the town, together with those of Saint James and Saint Brigid (whose churches were closed) were merged to become the Parish of the Holy Redeemer.

Dutch intervention in Bali of 10–26 December 1858 was the fourth punitive expedition of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) on the island. This expedition was directed against certain chiefs (pungawwa) of Buleleng who were fomenting revolt and opposition to the Dutch-appointed regent.
After the Dutch intervention of 1849, the prince of Bangli was given charge of the administration of Buleleng. Unable to win the confidence of either the chiefs or the people, he resigned in 1854 and the Dutch appointed a regent under the supervision of a Dutch controleur (comptroller). In Jembrana the people revolted against the oppressions of the restored prince, and the Dutch replaced him with another regent and two advisors, one Dutch the other approved by the local chiefs.
When the deposed prince of Jembrana, who had gone into exile in Buleleng, invaded his former princedom, the people failed to rise in support. The Dutch had the chiefs of Buleleng banish him from Bali. One pungawwa, Njoman Gempol of Bandjar Djawa, opposed this and tried to foment popular unrest against the Dutch by spreading rumours (true or false) of Dutch misrule on Java. Summoned by the Dutch authorities he refused to appear, and when the chiefs were asked to extradite him they refused. Towards the end of 1858 three warships, three transports and two kruisboten (cutters) under Lieutenant Captain (Kapitein-luitenant ter zee) van Hasselt left Java for Buleleng with a force consisting of the 13th Infantry Battalion and two mortars under Lieutenant Colonel Karel Felix van Steijn van Hensbroek. The total number of troops was 707 infantrymen under 12 officers. Political control of the expedition fell to assistant residents Bosch and van Bloemen Waanders.
On 11 December 1858 the Dutch forces landed without resistance and began marching on Bandjar Djawa. They intended to arrest Njoman Gempol, but he fled into the kampungs. The show of force—and sacking of villages—was enough to get the chiefs to comply with the order to extradite Gompal. He was betrayed by some farmers and handed over. By the end of December the troops had returned to Surabaya. Gompal and his fellow chief, Ida Mahe Rai, were exiled to Java.

Maurizio Cattelan is an Italian artist known for his tongue-in-cheek art, such as his 2016 creation America, a fully functional golden toilet. He previously used duct tape suspension for A Perfect Day in 1999, fastening the art dealer Massimo De Carlo to a gallery wall. At the 2019 Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain art fair in Paris, the American conceptual interventionist Meth Fountain showed a half-eaten croissant affixed to the wall, predating Comedian by several months.
Comedian is a piece consisting of a fresh banana duct taped to a wall. Cattelan purchased the bananas at a Miami grocery store for an estimated 30 cents. The work includes a certificate of authenticity along with detailed instructions for its proper display, intended for its owner to use when displaying the work. Both the banana and the duct tape can be replaced as needed; the physical representation of Comedian is not the work itself. It was Cattelan's first artwork for a fair in over 15 years. The piece was compared to Andy Warhol's 1967 pop art fruit. Emmanuel Perrotin, the gallerist exhibiting the work, stated Comedian is "a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor".
Reception
Comedian created controversy, with some writers, such as Robin Pogrebin, questioning if it was even art. The Guardian called Comedian a "questionably genius work. ... It calls to mind the old Lucile Bluth Arrested Development gag about rich people not knowing the price of a banana." Artnet wrote the piece was one of the worst of the week, and that Cattelan "somehow duped a group of collectors into buying bananas duct-taped to walls for $120,000 a pop. Seriously." USA Today deadpanned, "This piece of art is bananas – literally." Newsweek called it "humorous minimalist artwork", while ARTnews asked whether the piece was cynical or thrilling. CBS News reported, "It may be the most talked-about artwork at this year's event." On December 13, the New York Post featured Comedian on its cover. In his 2021 book The Devil in the Gallery, Noah Charney stated, "Comedian is neither beautiful nor does it exhibit skill, so it represents the Duchampian path." In his book Beauty (and the Banana), author Brian C. Nixon stated, "To say the least, Comedian is a commentary on the wild world of contemporary art, communicating how culture understands, interprets, and engages with the arts."
Purchases
The piece was released in an edition of three; two were purchased for $120,000 USD at Art Basel. The selling price garnered significant media attention. One edition was purchased by Sarah Andelman, a founder of Colette. Another edition was sold to Billy and Beatrice Cox, who stated:
We are acutely aware of the blatant absurdity of the fact that Comedian is an otherwise inexpensive and perishable piece of produce and a couple of inches of duct tape. When we saw the public debate sparked about art and our society, we decided to purchase it. We knew we were taking a risk, but ultimately we sense that Cattelan's banana will become an iconic historical object.
In August 2020 artist Damien Hirst complained to the media that he was unable to purchase the piece and had offered to trade any of his own works for it with Cattelan; Cattelan replied that the piece had sold out. The following month Comedian was donated to the Guggenheim Museum, with instructions and diagrams for its installation and display.
Intervention
After its sale, while still on exhibit at Art Basel, Georgian performance artist David Datuna ate the piece in an intervention he called Hungry Artist. The banana was replaced later that day. No legal action was taken against him, though he was asked to leave the fair. Datuna stated, "What we perceive as materialism is nothing but social conditioning. Any meaningful interaction with an object could turn it to art. I am a hungry artist, and I am hungry for new interactions."
Interpretations
Following a flurry of publicity, a number of commentators satirized or interpreted Comedian. Designer Sebastian ErraZuriz taped a dildo to a wall with duct tape and listed it for sale for $12,000. Cryptocurrency artist CryptoGraffiti created The Commodity, "which instructed collectors to find and claim a banana with a bitcoin key address carved into it". Actress Brooke Shields taped a banana to her forehead with blue tape and posted it to Instagram with the caption, "An expensive selfie". Designer Simon Porte Jacquemus "created a merch opportunity when posting a duct-taped yellow version of [his] micro Le Chiquito bag". Popeyes Chicken joined with the San Paul Gallery Urban Art in Miami to create The Sandwich, a chicken sandwich taped to a white wall with duct tape; it was listed at $120,003.99 and "became a viral sensation in its own right". Multiple other brands followed suit, including the New York Mets, Burger King, Hostess, Perrier, Carrefour, Sweetgreen, Absolut, and Bobbi Brown.
Removal
In the morning on Sunday, December 8, 2019, Comedian was removed from the fair. The curators removed the piece because they were afraid other art would be damaged by queuing crowds. After the removal, the gallery released the following statement: Comedian, with its simple composition, ultimately offered a complex reflection of ourselves. We would like to warmly thank all those who participated in this memorable adventure, as well as to our colleagues. We sincerely apologize to all the visitors of the fair who today will not be able to participate in Comedian.
After the removal, Perrotin created a social media account dedicated to the piece. One of the walls featuring the piece was later vandalized with the text "Epstien didn't kill himself" in lipstick, which was soon covered by the art fair.
Court case
Artist Joe Morford has filed a suit against Cattelan for copyright infringement of his 2000 work titled Banana & Orange. In July 2022, a federal judge in the Southern District of Florida denied Cattelan's motion to dismiss the case.

The Grass Harp is a play written by Truman Capote based on his novel of the same name. Producer Saint Subber staged it on Broadway in 1952. It was Capote's first play.
History
Capote's novel The Grass Harp was favorably reviewed when it was published, and it attracted the interest of the Broadway producer Saint Subber, who traveled to Taormina to urge Capote to write a stage adaption of the work. His offer opened up new possibilities for income at a time when Capote was still struggling financially. Working with intense concentration, Capote managed to complete a draft of the play in a year's time. He was personally involved in the selection of a production team. The adaptation, produced by Subber and directed by Robert Lewis, opened on March 27, 1952, at Broadway's Martin Beck Theatre, where it ran for 36 performances.
The cast included Mildred Natwick as Dolly Talbo, Ruth Nelson as Verena Talbo, Jonathan Harris as Dr. Morris Ritz, Sterling Holloway as The Barber, Gertrude Flynn as The Baker's Wife, Val Dufour as The Sheriff, Jane Lawrence as The Choir Mistress, Lenka Peterson as Maude Riordan, and Alice Pearce as Miss Baby Love Dallas. Music was by Virgil Thomson and scenery and costumes were by Cecil Beaton.
Reception
Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times praised the play, calling it "beautiful", with "lightness and grace". In The New Republic, Eric Bentley said it was trite and ridiculous, although he praised Natwick's performance.
Designer Cecil Beaton won the 1951-52 Donaldson Award in the category of "Setting (play)".

Florida's News Channel (FNC) was a regional cable news network available on Florida's cable television systems (e.g. Comcast, GTE, TCI Cable, AT&T Broadband, and Continental Cablevision) that operated from 1998 to 2003. FNC's viewers were the first to see virtual reality news environments with customized local scenery in each of Florida's seven major television markets.
FNC created nightly newscasts for a black audience. These newscasts were hosted by anchors Gordon Graham, Val Bracy, and Karla Winfrey.
Frank Watson served as FNC's vice president and general manager. Partners included Willie E. Gary, Evander Holyfield, Cecil Fielder, Marlon Jackson, and Alvin James.
Comcast dropped FNC due to lack of viewer interest. The legal dispute between FNC's management and Comcast was settled in 2005.

Charles de Groux or Charles Degroux (25 August 1825 – 30 March 1870) was a French painter, engraver, lithographer and illustrator. As he moved to Belgium at a young age and his whole career took place in Belgium he is usually referred to as a Belgian artist. His depictions of scenes from the life of the disadvantaged and lower-class people of his time mark him as the first Belgian social realist painter. These works made him the precursor of Belgian Realist artists such as Constantin Meunier and Eugène Laermans.
Life
Charles de Groux was born in Comines, a commune bordering on Belgium in the French Nord department. His father Jean Baptiste Joseph de Groux was a ribbon manufacturer. Charles was the 7th of 10 children. His family moved to Brussels in November 1833. Despite several attempts in later life to become a naturalised Belgian citizen, he remained a French national throughout his life.
De Groux attended courses at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. From 1843 he studied under François-Joseph Navez who was a director of the Académie and a neo-classical painter. He lived in those days a Bohemian lifestyle. In 1849 he married Jeanne Geyssens of Brussels. The couple would have five children, one of whom called Henry became a prominent Symbolist painter. In April 1851 he left for Düsseldorf where he stayed for a year. Around 1853 de Groux had his first success with his work The Drunk (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) (another version referred to as The farewell on the art market in 2017). This work depicting a dying woman, her drunk husband and their young children in a cramped and poorly lit room signaled a clear break with the lofty and elegant style and subjects of his master Navez.
De Groux became an illustrator of the satirical periodical Uylenspiegel founded by Félicien Rops, a prominent Belgian illustrator and draughtsman. Rops and de Groux met Gustave Courbet several times at the exhibitions of the latter in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Courbet's influence on de Groux's aesthetic choices is evident as early as 1853.
He became a member of the Société royale belge des aquarellistes (Royal Belgian Society of Watercolorists) founded in 1856 to promote watercolor art in Belgium through the organisation of annual exhibitions. He joined in 1868 the Société Libre des Beaux-Arts (Free Society of Fine Arts), an organization formed in 1868 by Belgian artists to react against academicism and to advance Realist painting and artistic freedom. Based in Brussels, the society was active until 1876, by which time the aesthetic values it espoused had infiltrated the official Salon.
The Belgian government of that time promoted monumental art as a means of promoting nationalism and a revival of the arts in the young Belgian state. One of the projects promoted by the government was the decoration of the Ypres Cloth Hall. Charles de Groux was among various Belgian painters such as Jan Swerts and Godfried Guffens who were invited by the Belgian government to decorate the Ypres Cloth Hall. De Groux created his designs but died before he could realise the paintings. He was also invited to provide designs for the stained glass windows of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, which were executed by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier.
De Groux died on 30 March 1870 in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode at the age of 44.
Work
De Groux worked in different media, including oil painting, watercolor, pastel, engraving and lithography. He started out as a painter of history and religious scenes in the Romantic style then prevalent in Belgium. He later developed his own realist style which shows the influence of Courbet as well as genre painters of the 17th century.
Around 1853 de Groux had his first success with his work The Drunk (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) (another version referred to as The farewell on the art market in 2017). It depicts a woman who is lying sick and dying on her bed while her drunk husband holding a bottle is brought in by two young children. The sober palette and the execution that neglected detailed depiction for global effect as well as the subject matter were de Groux' radical break with the Classicist style of Navez in favor of the 17th century genre painters such as Adriaen Brouwer. During this period de Groux painted many compositions depicting the disadvantaged people of his day in their misery and vices such as alcoholism and lassitude. Often he depicted scenes with priests and pilgrimages. He still painted some history scenes in this later phase such as The death of emperor Charles V (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) and Frans Junius preaching the Reformation in secret in Antwerp.
De Groux' social realist works contain many religious overtones and references. This is obvious in his The blessing before supper, a solemn depiction of a peasant family saying grace before supper. The painting was closely linked to Christian representations of the Last Supper.
De Groux influenced many young, realistic painters, including his pupil Constantin Meunier and Eugene Laermans. Even the later society painter Gustave Léonard de Jonghe painted early in his career a social realist painting called Pilgrims Praying to Our Lady of the Afflicted or Our Lady of Mercy (1854, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium), which was clearly influenced by de Groux' social realist works. Vincent van Gogh is known to have admired de Groux's work The blessing before supper. Van Gogh's The Potato Eaters was inspired by this work of de Groux. Van Gogh also praised de Groux for his excellent 'types'. He was of the view that de Groux' studies and drawings displayed the same 'white-hot' passion that he found in the head studies of Frans Hals and Honoré Daumier, and in the novels of Zola and Balzac.

"Sunset", also known as the "Retreat Call", is a bugle call played in the United Kingdom and British Commonwealth countries to signal the end of the official military day. In common with all bugle calls, it consists only of notes from a single overtone series. This allows it to be playable on a bugle or equivalently on a trumpet without moving the valves.
The call is regularly heard performed in an arrangement for full military band by Captain A.C. Green (1888–1974), who was Director of the Royal Naval School of Music's Junior Wing on the Isle of Man.
The arrangement was composed aboard in response to Admiral Fisher's desire for a "spectacular show" and was first performed in 1932 by the Massed Bands and Bugles of the Mediterranean Fleet. The Sunset call is now a regular part of the Royal Marines' "Beat the Retreat" ceremony, the call's melody also gives its name to "Sunset Parades" given in commemoration of former military conflicts. It is traditional to stand for the performance of the piece.
Trumpet & Bugle Calls for the British Army marks this call for Royal Artillery units only. The call would then be sounded on an E♭ Cavalry Trumpet.
Lyrics
.
Sunset in the western sky,
Darkness falls o'er land and sea
Praise, Lord, we raise to you
This night and for evermore.
We think of loved ones near and far
And those who've fought the fight before
Keep safe your people, Lord
This night and for evermore.
Keep safe your people, Lord
This night and for evermore
This night and for evermore.

is an animated short film produced by Toei Doga. It is a crossover anime between Great Mazinger and Getter Robo G. It was originally shown in theaters along with Uchu Enban Daisenso. They both premiered in in Japan.
As with the rest of Toei's Mazinger Vs. animated films, the events presented in the film are not considered canon to either of the anime television series, but it is considered a direct sequel to the previous film Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo.
Like most of the Mazinger movies, it was shown in some countries outside Japan where the TV series were broadcast. It is known as Il Grande Mazinga contro Getta Robot G in Italy, Gran Mazinger contra Getter Robo G in Spain and مازنجر الكبير يقاتل جيتا روب in the Middle East.
Story
Aliens in a spaceship decide to conquer the Earth and begin by attacking the headquarters of the Getter Robo team while the Mazinger was being repaired so it could not go to their aid. One of the team members, Musashi, is killed in the battle with the alien monster Grangen and his vehicle is destroyed, meaning they can no longer form the first Getter Robo. However the laboratory already had a new Getter Robo ready for action named Getter Robo G and a new third pilot is elected. Meanwhile, Great Mazinger and his allies fight the invaders' giant robot Bong but it was just bait to lure it out so that the invaders could use their trump card: Pikadron. Getter Robo G arrives to help, but their combined beams only make Pikadron grow bigger. However Great Mazinger's pilot Tetsuya figures out how to strip this defense from the monster and destroys it with a new weapon. The alien spaceship is also destroyed and in the end everyone gets together to grieve the loss of Musashi.
Invaders
There are three alien monsters that serve as the antagonists of the movie. They were created by the Mysterious Invaders, the same race that created Gilgilgan in the previous movie. In Go Nagai's Dynamic Heroes the aliens were referred to as the Damdom and were revealed to be the arch enemies of the Vegan Empire from UFO Robo Grendizer.
Grangen: Capable of flying and is armed with tentacled fingers, a bladed boomerang, and eye beams from its eyes capable of blinding enemy pilots. It is the only organism of the alien trio. It makes an appearance in Super Robot Wars MX.
Bong: Is armed with military vehicle style weapons on its body including a tank cannon-like flamethrower on the torso, normal sized tank cannons all around the body, a drill for the right arm, eye beams, and has jets for feet. It is the only machine of the alien trio. It also appears in Super Robot Wars 2 and MX.
Pikadron: The main antagonist of the movie and is made entirely out of light waves, making it impossible to kill unless it is solidified and will absorb energy to turn into its super form. Powers include electric balls from the mouth, emitting electricity, extendable tentacle fingers, an electric beam from its mouth, and in its super form it can fire seven electric beams from the chest and horns. Unlike its two cohorts it appears throughout various Super Robot Wars games and in them gains the ability to make clones of itself by being divided and can swim underwater, however it lacks its super form. Pikadron's overall frame most likely served as a basis for other Go Nagai monsters such as Zumezume, Mephisto Dance, Algoth, and Cobalt King.

The Fort du Replaton is a fortification of the Séré de Rivières system in Modane, France. The fort was built to provide artillery cover for the French end of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel away horizontally. It is connected to Modane by an aerial tram, which continues on from Replaton to the Fort du Sapey on a much higher eminence.
The Fort du Replaton was built between 1884 and 1892 using an arrangement that anticipated the later Maginot Line fortifications, and resembles Fort Saint Michel near Toul. It cost approximately 2 million francs. Unlike a Maginot fortification, Replaton was enclosed by a perimeter wall and had surface barracks. The original armament consisted of two 95mm and two 155mm guns along a communicating gallery on the rock behind. The fort received concrete reinforcement in the early 1900s.
A renovation project in 1930 added 75mm guns in place of the 95mm weapons. The fort was fired upon in 1940 and 1944. It is the property of the Association de la Traversée es Alpes. It is not open to the public, but is in a good state of preservation.
Redoute du Replaton
A smaller fortification occupies the eastern extremity of the small plateau, about above Modane. It was armed with a single 95mm gun.

Thun Castle () is a castle in the city of Thun, in the Swiss canton of Bern. It was built in the 12th century, today houses the Thun Castle museum, and is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
During the Early Middle Ages there was a small fort and church on the top of the castle hill. The castle was built between 1180 and 1190 by Duck Berthold V of Zähringen, who constructed the still preserved keep to the level of the Knights' Hall (). The tall Knights' Hall was built as the centerpiece of a monument to Zähringen power. However, the family never lived in the castle, preferring Burgdorf Castle. In 1218 it was inherited by the House of Kyburg, who built the upper levels above the Zähringen castle. A quarrel over who would rule the southern Kyburg lands led, in 1322, to Eberhard II von Kyburg murdering his brother Hartmann II at the castle. To protect his newly acquired land from the Habsburgs Eberhard II then sold them to Bern and was promptly given them back as a fief. The Kyburgs ruled over the region for nearly two centuries until a failed raid by Rudolf II on Solothurn, in 1382, started the Burgdorferkrieg (also Kyburgerkrieg). After several decisive Bernese victories the Kyburgs were forced to concede an unfavorable peace. In 1384 Bern bought Thun and Burgdorf, the most important cities of the Kyburg lands. The castle came under Bernese control and became the seat of their local administration.
The massive roof (1430–36) comes from the Bernese period. Due to the lack of residences in the castle, in 1429, an administrative and residential wing was added to the west of the keep, built in late Gothic style, and known as the "new castle". The castle was the seat of the local court and since at least the 17th century there was a prison under the roof of the donjon. In 1886 a new prison was built on the castle grounds. Two years later, in 1888, the museum opened in the castle. For a time the jailer was also the ticket seller and guard for the museum.
In 2006, the castle was bought by the city of Thun from the canton of Bern. Until the end of 2009 the Bernese Oberland regional court was based in the castle.
The castle museum
The castle museum is housed in the five floors of the tower, and includes cultural and historic displays showing the development of the region over some 4,000 years. It is open daily between February and October, and on Sundays only for the rest of the year. The great hall is used for concerts or plays, and can be hired for private events.

Adele was a steel screw steamer that was built in 1906 as a yacht. She was twice commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), firstly as HMAS Franklin and later than HMAS Adele. She was wrecked at Port Kembla, New South Wales on 7 May 1943.
Design and construction
Adele was built in 1906 by Hawthorns & Co Ltd, Leith, Scotland as yard number 116. She was launched on 18 October 1906 and completed in November 1906.
Originally built as a yacht, she was later converted to steam power.
Propulsion
By 1930, Adele was powered by a triple expansion steam engine with cylinders of , and bore by stroke. The engine was manufactured by Hawthorns & Co Ltd. Adele was capable of .
Official Number and Code Letters
Official numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. In 1930, Adele had the UK Official Number 123022 and used the Code Letters HJRW.
Operational history
In 1915, Adele was purchased by the Australia Government for £21,500 from the estate of Henry Dutton of Kapunda, South Australia. On 14 September 1915 she was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Franklin. HMAS Franklin served as a tender to the Royal Australian Naval College.
Franklin collided with the Sydney Harbour ferry, Vaucluse in 1916 injuring two passengers. Franklin's sharp bow smashed halfway through the wooden ferry's hull almost sinking her, however, the ferry was towed to nearby Garden Island where the dock's pumps kept her afloat.
Franklin was paid off on 31 March 1921 only to be recommissioned on 21 September.
Franklin was decommissioned on 18 September 1922 and gifted to the Administrator of Papua-New Guinea, serving there until 1929. By 1930, she had reverted to the name Adele and was owned by the Commonwealth Government of Australia and operated by the Department of Home & Territories. At the time she was homeported at Port Adelaide under the British Flag. In 1932, Adele was laid up at Rabaul. She was sold for £1,652 on 7 December of that year to W L Buckland of Melbourne, Australia who refitted her as a private yacht and used her for cruising. Adele was later sold to C H Relph of Sydney and was laid up for some years at Rose Bay Port Jackson, Sydney.
On 24 October 1939, Adele was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Adele. She was armed with two .303-in Vickers machine guns and employed as an examination vessel. From December 1941, HMAS Adele was attached to .
Loss
On 7 May 1943, Adele struck the breakwater at Port Kembla and was subsequently declared a total loss. The wreck of Adele is protected under the New South Wales Heritage Act, 1977.
Legacy
Franklin is remembered in the naming of two other sail training yachts associated with the RAN College:
a yacht in the 1960s and 1970s, which took part in several Sydney to Hobart races;
a Hunter yacht acquired in 2005.

Irving Force (real name Adam Skog) is a synthwave producer from Stockholm, Sweden. He previously was a member of the black metal bands Vanhävd and Vapenlicens, before becoming interested in 80's-influenced film scores.
Works and style
Irving Force's musical and aesthetic style is influenced by 1980's action films and characters, such as John Carpenter films and his character Snake Plissken. Skog originally intended Irving Force to have a more pop oriented sound, but the music soon took on elements from his heavy metal past.
He also cites cyberpunk science fiction from all types of media and the band Tangerine Dream as further influences. Having come from a film-score background, much of Irving Force's music is designed to have some sort of narrative or story element - such as his 2015 release The Violence Suppressor. A video was filmed for the title track on that album, which was made to invoke classic sci-fi and action movies like Assault on Precinct 13 and Judge Dredd. Following releases were set out to take place in a loose thematic universe.
In April 2020, Irving Force provided the soundtrack for the Android retro point & click adventure game Awaken Alone. His music has been described by reviewers as "guiding the listener through cyberpunk narratives that twist and mutate with a musical playfulness". Others have praised its "next level grooves" and "balls to the wall rhythms".

In hydrology, a Venturi flume is a device used for measuring the rate of flow of a liquid in situations with large flow rates, such as a river. It is based on the Venturi effect, for which it is named. It was first developed by V.M. Cone in Fort Collins, Colorado.
The Venturi flume consists of a flume with a constricted section in the center. By the Venturi effect, this causes a drop in the fluid pressure at the center of the constriction. By comparing the fluid pressure at the center of the flume with that earlier in the device, the rate of flow can be measured.

Don Kitchenbrand (also Kichenbrand; born 13 August 1933) is a retired South African football player who played in Britain for Rangers and Sunderland in the mid to late 1950s.
Nicknamed The Rhino by the club's fans, Kitchenbrand was one of very few players of the Catholic faith to play for Rangers between the 1920s and 1980s, between which times an unwritten rule was in effect; he was advised not to disclose his religion when signing. In his first season in British football (1955–56), he scored 24 goals in 25 league appearances to help Rangers win the Scottish League title. That goal tally included the only goal in a 1–0 win over Old Firm rivals Celtic on 2 January 1956, and a five-goal haul in an 8–0 rout of Queen of the South at Ibrox on 7 March 1956. Kitchenbrand didn't feature much for Rangers after that first season, having lost his place in the side to Max Murray, and left for Sunderland in March 1958.
He played 54 competitive games for Sunderland, scoring 28 goals. In November 1958 he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Rotherham, the first hat-trick a Sunderland player had achieved in two years.
He returned to his homeland in 1960 to play for Johannesburg Wanderers and a number of other teams, before coming back to Scotland two years later for a brief spell at Forfar Athletic.
He played once for his country in March 1956, featuring in a South Africa representative side all consisting of British-based players and including Kitchenbrand's Rangers team-mate Johnny Hubbard. They played against a Scotland XI at Ibrox, losing 2–1.
As of 2019, Kitchenbrand and his wife were living in an elderly persons' complex in Benoni, Gauteng.

Caffeine is an episodic survival horror video game created by Dylan Browne and developed by Incandescent Imaging. The creator posted the game on Indiegogo to help crowdfund the development. The game takes place on a derelict spaceship used to mine caffeine, and it is inspired by Condemned: Criminal Origins, F.E.A.R., and Doom 3. Caffeine was released in five episodes for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux on 5 October 2015, although it has yet to release any episodes after the first.
Caffeine was negatively received by the majority of the public and almost all of the critics. While it has not been canceled, the second episode has been on a four-year hiatus and there is not information on when it will be released.
Story and gameplay
Caffeine is set in a universe where the Earth has run out of its caffeine supplies, so big companies invest in mining ships that go into space to mine caffeine. In Caffeine, the player takes the role of a young boy aboard a caffeine mining ship that has an extreme addiction to caffeine. The boy wakes up with no memory of why he is on the ship and decides to explore the ship. The boy runs into multiple characters throughout his journey on the mostly abandoned ship. There are no combat mechanics and the gameplay mostly involves wondering around the empty halls. The horror aspect of the game comes from what the player cannot see and the eerie sound design that makes the atmosphere frightening.
The main draw of the game is the player finding their way through the ship by solving various puzzles to let them progress the game. The puzzles are environmental and memory-based in which the player has to travel to many different locations and memorize different information in order to get through blocked areas.
There is also a lot of lore to find throughout the game in the form of sticky notes, audio logs, whiteboards, etc. The intent of this aspect is to make the game feel more lived-in.
Development and marketing
Caffeine was developed by Incandescent Imaging, a small indie video game developer company. Their only two releases are the first episode of Caffeine and a mobile game called Boxed In. The game was developed mostly by the head of the company, Dylan Browne. He is the creative mind behind most of the game. Other important figures are composer Adam Klingman and sound designer Jonathan Wachoru, who were responsible for all of the sound and music in the game. Over the years preceding its release, Caffeine made appearances in popular video game news sites, such as IGN and Kotaku. All of this led to there being some hype surrounding the game, but it died out with a lackluster launch of episode one and no follow-up for further episodes.
Release and reception
Caffeine was released on October 5, 2015 on Steam for PC players as well as being playable on many virtual reality systems. The game was never released to any other system. It can be bought on a per-episode basis or one could buy the season pass and receive all of the episodes whenever they come out. As of now, there is no information on when the next episode for the game will be released.
Caffeine was mostly negatively received upon release and did not grow enough to hit a mainstream audience or even garner an audience of its own.

The first school, a small log cabin one-half mile (ca. 2 km) east of Oskaloosa, was opened on September 16, 1844, and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church opened as the first church in 1846. On July 2, 1850, the first edition of the Iowa Herald was issued (today the Oskaloosa Herald). The first tracks of the Des Moines Valley Railroad were laid through the county in 1864.
Coal mining was once a major industry in Mahaska County. During the 19th century, Muchakinock, about south of Oskaloosa, was probably the largest and most prosperous coal camp in Iowa.

Majestic is the second live album by Christian singer and songwriter Kari Jobe. It is her second release with Sparrow Records. The album was recorded at the Majestic Theatre in Dallas, Texas, was produced by Jeremy Edwardson and released on March 25, 2014. It has attained critical acclamation and commercial successes.
Background and recording
The material took two years to develop for the release. According to Jobe, the music is about helping people connect with the majesty of God and His son Jesus Christ, whether they are a believer or not. She said that she could not get the lyrics made by herself alone that is why she teamed-up with others, but in doing this she had to allow herself to be vulnerable in getting out of her "comfort zone". The album was recorded at the Majestic Theatre in Dallas, Texas during the performances on November 20–21, 2013. It was produced by Jeremy Edwardson. The album released on March 25, 2014 by Sparrow Records.
Composition and musical style
The songs "Hands To the Heavens", "Only Your Love" and "How Majestic" are in the Brit-rock genre. "Hands To the Heavens" features electric guitars and "solid drumming". However, a critic did not like the arrangement of the bridge section because it would be hard to utilize in a corporate worship setting. "Breathe On Us" is a more "up-tempo" track in comparison to its predecessor. "Only Your Love" is a "jazzy song", with a guitar lead. "Keeper of My Heart" contains "marching" drums, and "stirring" electric guitar work. "Always Enough" is a soft worship anthem with "rousing" guitars, "an epic" crescendo, and "a captivating" instrumental bridge to the song. The piano-led "Forever" is a ballad and a worship anthem. "How Majestic" is an anthemic worship-esque song. "When You Walk In the Room" contains a "stellar" crescendo. "I Am Not Alone" is a "gorgeous" and "poignant" ballad, which contains a "rich" piano lead. "Lord Over All" is a mid-tempo song that is a guitar-driven anthem. "Look Upon the Lord" is a delicate piano ballad, which contains "Coldplay-esque swelling guitars." "Let the Heavens Open" is a Brit-rock song, which is in the vein of Delirious?.
Critical reception
Majestic garnered critical acclaim from eight music critics ratings and eleven reviews. At CCM Magazine, Caroline Lusk rated the album four stars out of five, remarking that "From the opening strands, it's clear that Majestic is not just an album; it's an experience." Jeremy Armstrong of Worship Leader rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, observing how "Majestic is at once overwhelming and intimate; it creates space for the Spirit to dwell and it fills all the sonic landscape with music that supports the prayers of the people." At New Release Tuesday, Kevin Davis rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, affirming that "Majestic is about proclaiming the majesty of God and crying out for His presence throughout this incredible worship experience, which stirs my heart, mind and soul to bow before Jesus, our Majestic King." At Christian Music Review, Jay Heilman rated the album a four-point seven out of five, thinking that "Majestic will stand the test of time and rank up there with some of the all-time greatest live worship projects."
At Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies rated the album four-and-a-half stars, noting how the release contains "so many powerful moments." Christian Music Zine's Joshua Andre rated the album a four and three fourths out of five, highlighting that with respect to this release "there's no doubting the passion, enthusiasm and strong faith for Jesus that Kari has." Andrew Funderburk of CM Addict rated the album four stars out of five, and according to him "It seems [...] that Kari Jobe's music is progressively getting better and better", and indicating how "Her experiences shine through it all." At All About Worship, Adam Hellyer gave a positive review, stating that "It's a well written, well produced worship album, which does what it says on the label." Kim Jones of Music Times gave a positive review, saying that "Every song on Majestic shines with an unchanging thirst for God's presence", and writes that "the bar was high for her first live worship album and she didn't just meet the challenge, she exceeded it."
Mark D. Geil of Jesus Freak Hideout rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, and according to him "Majestic therefore becomes extra-tricky, since it's a live album meant to recreate not so much a concert as a worship experience, and it's introducing all-new music at the same time." However, Geil states that "The songs are strong enough that they don't rely on a live setting with a fervent audience to communicate praise", but cautioned that "they might have spoken louder without the audience." At Hallels, Timothy Yap gave a mixed review, cautioning that "'Majestic' does [have] its share of magnificently written ballads sung tenderly and passionately by Jobe, but whether or not this album works well for congregational worship is another issue."
Accolades
This album was No. 3 on the Worship Leader'''s Top 20 Albums of 2014 list.
The song, "Forever (We Sing Hallelujah)", was No. 1 on the Worship Leader's Top 20 Songs of 2014 list.
Commercial performance
For the Billboard charting week of April 12, 2014, Majestic'' was the No. 12 most sold album in the entirety of the United States via the Billboard 200, and it was the No. 1 most sold album in the Christian Albums market. Also, it was the fourth most sold Digital Album.

Kiss and Tell is a 2011 Nigerian romantic comedy film, produced by Emem Isong and directed by Desmond Elliot. It stars Monalisa Chinda, Joseph Benjamin, Desmond Elliot, Nse Ikpe Etim, Uche Jombo and Bhaira Mcwizu. Though the film was a commercial success, it was met with mixed to negative reception.
The film revolves around two Casanovas, friends and business partners; Iyke (Joseph Benjamin) and Bernard (Desmond Elliot), and a divorce lawyer, Delphine (Monalisa Chinda), who is a divorcee herself and doesn't want to have anything to do with men again. Bernard strikes a bet with Iyke which involves Iyke having sex with Delphine in ten days or forfeit five percent of his shares to Bernard; if Iyke succeeded, he'd have five percent of Bernard's shares. However, Bernard tells Tena (Nse Ikpe Etim), Delphine's best friend about the bet in order to have an edge, thereby complicating things for Iyke.

"The Royal Salute" ( ), also known as "The Health of the Shah" ( ) was the royal and national anthem of Qajar Iran between 1873 and 1909. The French musician Alfred Jean Baptiste Lemaire composed this anthem in 1873 on the orders of Naser al-Din Shah. It had no lyrics.
Salâm-e Shâh was played in official ceremonies during the reigns of Naser al-Din Shah, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah and Mohammad Ali Shah. It was also played as the Persian (Iranian) national anthem during Naser al-Din Shah's and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's European tours.
In 1909, after the fall of Mohammad Ali Shah, the anthem was abolished, and after the coronation of his son and successor Ahmad Shah in 1914, Salute of the Sublime State of Persia was adopted as the Iranian national anthem.
Rearrangement
This anthem was rearranged, recomposed and orchestrated by the Iranian composer Siavash Beizai. Only the main parts of this song are derived from the original version. There are also some harmonic and formal corrections in this piece. The introduction, the middle part, and closing part were composed by Siavash Beizai too. Due to the great popularity of this anthem, it has been increasingly misused by the official Iranian Radio and Television and the government without any permission from Siavash Beizai.
Bijan Taraqi was asked by Peyman Soltani, the leader of Melal Orchestra of Iran, to write lyrics for the old national anthem. This new version of the anthem was performed in October 2005 by the Melal Orchestra of Iran. The singer in this version was Salar Aghili.
"Irân-e Javân" (Persian: "ايران جوان") means "Young Iran" in English. It is also known as "Vatanam" (Persian: "وطنم"), which means "My Homeland".

Harlequin syndrome is a condition characterized by asymmetric sweating and flushing on the upper thoracic region of the chest, neck and face. Harlequin syndrome is considered an injury to the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls some of the body's natural processes such as sweating, skin flushing and pupil response to stimuli. Such individuals with this syndrome have an absence of sweat skin flushing unilaterally; usually on the one side of the face, arms and chest. It is an autonomic disorder that may occur at any age. Harlequin syndrome affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.
Symptoms associated with Harlequin syndrome are more likely to appear when a person has been in the following conditions: exercising, warm environment and intense emotional situation. Since one side of the body sweats and flushes appropriately to the condition, the other side of the body will have an absence of such symptoms. This syndrome has also been called the "Harlequin sign" and thought to be one of the spectrum of diseases that may cause Harlequin syndrome.
It can also be the outcome of a one sided endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) or endoscopic sympathetic blockade (ESB) surgery.
Harlequin syndrome can also be seen as a complication of VA (veno-arterial) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This involves differential hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) of the upper body in comparison to the lower body.
Signs and symptoms
The "Harlequin sign" is unilateral flushing and sweating of the face, neck, and upper chest usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion. Horner syndrome, another problem associated with the sympathetic nervous system, is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome.
Since Harlequin syndrome is associated with a dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, main symptoms of this dysfunction are in the following: Absence of sweat(anhidrosis) and flushing on one side of the face, neck, or upper thoracic area. In addition, other symptoms include cluster headaches, tearing of the eyes, nasal discharge, abnormal contraction of the pupils, weakness in neck muscles, and drooping of one side of the upper eyelid.
Causes
One possible cause of Harlequin syndrome is a lesion to the preganglionic or postganglionic cervical sympathetic fibers and parasympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion. It is also believed that torsion (twisting) of the thoracic spine can cause blockage of the anterior radicular artery leading to Harlequin syndrome. The sympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes the flushing of the opposite side to appear more pronounced. It is unclear whether or not the response of the undamaged side was normal or excessive, but it is believed that it could be a result of the body attempting to compensate for the damaged side and maintain homeostasis.
Since the cause and mechanism of Harlequin syndrome is still unknown, there is no way to prevent this syndrome.
Mechanism
Although the exact mechanism for Harlequin syndrome is still unclear, understanding what is affected with this syndrome is important. The majority of cases are thought to occur when nerve bundles in the head and neck are injured. Such bundles are able to send an action potential from the autonomic nervous system to the rest of the body. However, action potentials in this system are not being received by the second or third thoracic vertebrae which innervates the face, neck, and upper chest. Damage or lesions near T2 or T3 could be between the stellate ganglion and superior cervical ganglion. This is where we would observe absence of sweat and skin flushing on one side of the face, neck, and upper chest.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is made when the individual has consistent signs and symptoms of the condition, therefore, it is made by clinical observation. In addition, a neurologist or primary care physician may require an MRI test to rule out similar disorders such as Horner's syndrome, Adie's syndrome, and Ross' syndrome. In an MRI, a radiologist may observe areas near brain or spinal cord for lesions, or any damage to the nerve endings. It is also important that the clinician rules out traumatic causes by performing autonomic function tests. Such tests include the following: tilt table test, orthostatic blood pressure measurement, head-up test, valsalva maneuver, thermoregulatory sweat test, tendon reflex test, and electrocardiography (ECG). CT scan of the heart and lungs may also be performed to rule out a structural underlying lesion. The medical history of the individual should be carefully noted.
Treatment and prognosis
Harlequin syndrome is not debilitating so treatment is not normally necessary. In cases where the individual may feel socially embarrassed, contralateral sympathectomy may be considered, although compensatory flushing and sweating of other parts of the body may occur. In contralateral sympathectomy, the nerve bundles that cause the flushing in the face are interrupted. This procedure causes both sides of the face to no longer flush or sweat. Since symptoms of Harlequin syndrome do not typically impair a person's daily life, this treatment is only recommended if a person is very uncomfortable with the flushing and sweating associated with the syndrome.
Research
In August 2016, researchers at the Instituto de Assistência dos Servidores do Estado do Rio de Janeiro used botulinum toxin as a method to block the acetylcholine release from the presynaptic neurons. Although they have seen a reduction in one sided flushing, sweating still occurs.
There have been case studies of individuals who have experienced this syndrome after an operation. Two female patients with metastatic cancer, ages 37-years-old and 58-years-old, were scheduled for placement of an intrathecal pump drug delivery system. After the intrathecal pump was placed, certain medications were given to the patients. Once the medications were administered, both patients had one sided facial flushes, closely resembling Harlequin Syndrome. Patients were given neurological exams to confirm that their nerves were still intact. An MRI was performed and showed no significant evidence of bleeding or nerve compression. After close observation for 16 hours, symptoms of the Harlequin syndrome was diminished and both patients did not have another episode.
Another case study was based on a 6-year-old male visiting an outpatient setting for one sided flushes during or after physical activity or exposed to heat. Vitals, laboratory tests, and CT scans were normal. Along with the flushes, the right pupil was 1.5 mm in size, while the left pupil was 2.5 mm in size; however, no ptosis, miosis, or enophthalmos was noted. The patient also had an MRI scan to rule out any lesion near the brain or spinal cord. No abnormalities were noted and the patient did not receive any treatments.

Friedrich Justus Heinrich Knecht (7 October 1839 – 31 January 1921) was a German Catholic theologian, writer and bishop in Freiburg, Germany.
Early life and education
Justus Knecht was born in Bruchsal, the fourth of seven children of Heinrich Ludwig Knecht, a master tailor, and Catharina Schmer. He attended elementary school from 1843 to 1849 and high school from 1849 to 1856.
Knecht was baptized a Protestant but converted to the Catholic faith in 1855 at his mother's request, along with his father and three siblings. After finishing high school in 1858, he studied Catholic theology in Freiburg im Breisgau (1858–1861). In 1861 he entered the seminary in Sankt Peter and was ordained a priest there on 5 August 1862 by Archbishop Hermann von Vicari.
Career
From 1862 to 1864 Knecht worked as a vicar in Durmersheim, Rastatt and Freiburg. He was also a tutor at the archbishop's seminary for boys and a religion teacher in a school in Freiburg.
From 1869 to 1871 he was an administrator in Gengenbach, in 1871 a parish administrator in Seelbach, and finally from 1871 to 1877 a pastor in Reichenbach/Lahr. During this time he was appointed to be the archbishop's school inspector and intervened in the disputes between church and state in the Kulturkampf. From 1879 to 1882 he was pastored in Schuttertal, and in 1882 Archbishop Johann Baptist Orbin appointed him to his cathedral chapter and entrusted him with the schools and religious education in the Archdiocese of Freiburg. In the same year Knecht published his Practical Commentary on Biblical History, which remained in use in German-speaking regions for an entire generation. This was followed in the same year by the publication of a Brief Biblical History for Catholic elementary schools. This textbook was extremely popular in its day and has been translated into 20 different languages. His Practical Commentary on Biblical History, translated in 1925, was one of the foundations for the Catholic mission in China. In 1907, his Biblical History for Schools and Homes was published.
In 1893 he received from Pope Leo XIII the honorary title of "Papal secret chamberlain" and was appointed titular bishop of Neve and auxiliary bishop in Freiburg on 4 February 1894. He was ordained a bishop on 4 April of the same year.
Following the death of Archbishop Johann Baptist Orbin in 1886, Knecht was considered a possible successor, but was removed from the list of candidates by the Baden state government. In 1896, he was appointed Dean of the Cathedral of Freiburg and thus, as vicar, head of the cathedral chapter. After the death of Archbishop Johannes Christian Roos in 1896, he served as regent of the Archdiocese for two years until 1898.
Honours
Knecht was awarded the title of "Papal Assistant to the Throne and Comes Romanus" in 1903.
In recognition of his services as a religious education teacher and his successful literary activities, the Bruchsal city council awarded him honorary citizenship on the occasion of his approaching 80th birthday on 2 October 1919.
Death
Knecht died in Freiburg on 31 January 1921, at the age of 81, and was buried in the same city on 3 February.

"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?" is an American folk song originally recorded on December 4, 1929, in New York City. It was written, composed, and performed by Blind Alfred Reed, accompanying himself on the violin. The song tells of hard times during the Great Depression. It is considered an early example of a protest song. In 2020, the song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame.
There was once a time when everything was cheap.
But now prices almost puts a man to sleep.
When we pay our grocery bill,
We just feel like making our will.
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Cover versions
The New Lost City Ramblers on their 1959 album Songs from the Depression.
Ry Cooder on his 1970 self-titled album Ry Cooder. This version reorders the verses compared with Reed's original and is a very different arrangement; however, all of the lyrics come from the original version recorded by Reed.
Bobby Doyle on his 1973 album Nine Songs.
Paul Millns in the middle 1980s in Copenhagen together with Peter Thorup on guitar.
Del Lords on their 1984 debut album Frontier Days. This ramped up version begins with the last verse of Reed's version and also includes several verses written by the band.
Eric Burdon on his 1985 live album That's Live.
The Blues Band on their 1993 album Homage.
David Lindley accompanied by Hani Naser on the 1995 album, Official Bootleg #2: Live All Over the Place. This version uses the first, last and fifth original verses and takes minor lyrical liberties common to live performance.
Boxcar Satan on their 2003 album Upstanding and Indigent. This version includes most of Reed's original lyrics but features a noisy, post-punk arrangement.
Bruce Springsteen on his 2006 Seeger Sessions Band Tour, and then recorded and included on his October 2006 We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions - American Land Edition album reissue. The Springsteen version only shares the lyrics of one of Reed's original verses, and owes more to Cooder's version musically than it does to the original. The rest of the verses were written by Springsteen about Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina.
Murray Head Trio on their 2009 album Blues & Beyond.
UB40 on their 2013 album Getting Over the Storm. Many of the lyrics have been changed to reflect the global financial crisis and current gulf between rich and poor.

Glenn Shafer (born November 21, 1946) is an American mathematician and statistician. He is the co-creator of the Dempster-Shafer Theory. He is a University Professor and Board of Governors Professor at Rutgers University.
Early life and education
Shafer grew up on a farm near Caney, Kansas. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Princeton University, then entered the Peace Corps, serving in Afghanistan. He returned to Princeton, earning a PhD in mathematical statistics in 1973 under Geoffrey Watson.
Career
He taught at Princeton and the University of Kansas, joining the faculty of Rutgers Business School – Newark and New Brunswick in 1992. From 2011 to 2014 he served as dean of the school.
During the 1970s and 1980s he expanded a theory first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster to create the Dempster-Shafer Theory, also described as the theory of belief functions or evidence theory. It is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, allowing one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called belief function) that takes into account all the available evidence. The theory and its extensions have been of particular interest to the artificial intelligence community.
More recently he worked with Vladimir Vovk to develop a game-theoretic framework for probability. That work produced a 2001 book, Probability and Finance: It's Only a Game! A joint research group between Rutgers and Royal Holloway, University of London has produced more than 50 working papers on the subject.

Mramorje () or Bagruša () is a medieval necropolis, located in Perućac, Serbia, and is among the best preserved necropoli of the region. The necropolis was built in the 14th century, and extends between the Drina river and the main road that follows its course, at the entrance of the settlement. The site is protected by the Republic of Serbia, as a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance, but is nevertheless threatened by the Drina river on one side and the continued expanding of the town of Perućac, on the other. Stećaks was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016, of which 3 sites are located in Serbia, Mramorje being one of them.
The Necropolis
The Necropolis, with about 200 tombstones made of solid limestone, was established in the fourteenth century. The largest found specimens of tombstones in the necropolis reach a length of , and a width and height of nearly . Earlier sources record a number of 122 monuments, while according to recent data, there are 93 as follows: 46 panel, 18 with stand, 10 slemenjak without stand, 7 sarcophagi with stand, 10 sarcophagi without base, and 2 amorphous samples. Over time, some of the tombstones were moved, others have sunken into the ground, while several items were transferred to museums (two tombstones with no decorations are in the collection of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade, and one is in the National Museum in Užice).
Tombstones in the necropolis are arranged in regular rows, and also tend to have an east–west orientation. No inscriptions can be read on the tombstones, however a number of them are fine-processed, very few of them are decorated, and there are a few recorded motifs (including circles, the moon, and sword and shield designs).

Absolute First Album is the first studio album and debut Korean release by South Korean girl group T-ara. It was released on November 27, 2009, through Core Contents Media. T-ara sought to showcase "two different charms" through Absolute First Album, one embracing a "trendy" image and the other leaning towards a "classic" aesthetic. The result is a modern dance record with traces of retro influences. Absolute First Album features contributions by Shinsadong Tiger, Cho Young-soo, Choi Kyu-sung (now of Black Eyed Pilseung), Wheesung and "Hitman" Bang.
The album was preceded by the hit single "TTL (Time to Love)", with its two lead tracks, "Bo Peep" and "Like the First Time", becoming commercial successes as well. "Bo Peep" was a breakthrough single for T-ara, further attaining recognition as one of their signature songs. Absolute First Album peaked at number two on the Gaon Chart and has received positive reviews.
The success of Absolute First Album lead to T-ara's newcomer wins at the Golden Disc and Seoul Music Awards. The album was re-released as Breaking Heart on February 23, 2010, spawning "You Drive Me Crazy" which became T-ara's first number-one single. The reissue was nominated for Disk Bonsang and Popularity Award at the Golden Disc Awards.
Background and promotion
T-ara was formed by Core Contents Media CEO Kim Kwang-soo, and prior to commencing their activities as a sextet, two members bowed out after contributing a song to the Cinderella Man soundtrack, citing creative differences. The label brought in three new members and released their debut single "Lie" (, Geojitmal) on July 27, 2009. The song was composed by Cho Young-soo, who would become a frequent collaborator of the group.
T-ara's debut was made amid an influx of girl groups on the Korean pop music scene, and a writer for weekly magazine SisaIN remarked that the old-school trot influence of "Lie" did little to appeal to core consumers of the girl group market; those who found nostalgia in the 1990s groups like S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. The group utilized a "girlish and pure" image during its run. T-ara would find wider success with their Supernova collaboration "TTL (Time to Love)", a track influenced by southern hip hop. The single was marketed as a "180-degree transformation" of the group, who took on a "sexier" image compared to their debut.
In October 2009, the group revealed their plans for a mini-album release in the coming months. Expanding into a full-length studio album, Absolute First Album was formally announced days prior to its late November release. Core Contents Media brought on Shinsadong Tiger and "Hitman" Bang to produce songs for the album. The marketing for Absolute First Album revolved around its dual concepts; with T-ara's intent to appeal through "two different charms", the group released two lead singles simultaneously: "Bo Peep" was backed by a "charismatic" image, whereas "Like the First Time" (, Cheoeum Cheoreom) was billed as "colorful yet classic".
Absolute First Album was digitally released on November 27, 2009. A physical release followed on December 4, 2009. Upon the album's release, Core Contents Media conducted an online poll in order to determine which lead single to promote first. Nearly 9,000 respondents from Melon, Cyworld, and Soribada, among others, were given the choice between "Bo Peep" and "Like the First Time", the latter of which won the poll by 53 percent. However, management proceeded with promotions for "Bo Peep" as the label intended to present a "180-degree transformation" of T-ara's image. The group began performing on Korea's televised music programs with the December 4, 2009, broadcast of Music Bank. "Like the First Time" was subsequently promoted in January 2010, yet their appearances quickly ceased as main vocalist So-yeon contracted H1N1, as did promotions for Absolute First Album as a whole.
Composition
Absolute First Album is primarily a dance-pop and electronic record. Member So-yeon remarked that though "idol music [follows] the latest trend", adult listeners would be "at ease" with songs such as "Like the First Time", "Apple is A" or "You You You" (, Neo Neo Neo), as they have ppong (뽕) melodies that "stimulate emotion". Its lead single, "Bo Peep", is billed as a "trendy" dance song with a "funky" rhythm; Spin magazine describes it as "robotic". The song is one of several that feature repetitive hooks, including "Tic Tic Toc". The album dips into "retro" territory as evident on "Lie", which is derived from trot, and "Like the First Time", which employs 1980s influences. T-ara sings in falsetto on the latter track, and parts of its electronic production is "reminiscent" of Aphex Twin and Humming Urban Stereo. Furthermore, "Like the First Time" has been compared to "In for the Kill" by English synthpop act La Roux.
"You Drive Me Crazy" (, Neo Ttaemune Michyeo), from the Breaking Heart re-issue, is an "edgy" electropop song which has received comparisons to "If U Seek Amy" by American singer Britney Spears. It has been called a "song without breaks" and is highlighted for the "important key role" that synthesizers play in "creating a hook song". Elsewhere, T-ara explores R&B on "Falling U", southern hip hop on "TTL (Time to Love)", and house music on "TTL Listen 2".
Singles
Absolute First Album collects each T-ara single prior to its release, though they were not utilized to promote the album directly. "Lie" was released on July 27, 2009, as a maxi single containing four tracks: "Lie (Part 1)" and "Lie (Part 2)", a ballad rendition of "Lie", and "Wanna Play?". The songs were re-titled for inclusion on Absolute First Album, with "Lie (Part 2)" omitted completely. A music video was produced for each song: in "Lie (Part 1)", the members are coupled with actor Yoo Seung-ho; "Lie (Part 2)" features the group performing at a waterpark, also known as the "Summer" version. "Lie (Ballad Ver.)" was used to promote the MBC horror series Soul, which stars member Ji-yeon. Actress Lim Ju-eun reprises her role as Ji-yeon's twin sister in the music video. "Wanna Play?" (; Norabollae?) showcases T-ara's "powerful" dance skills in "intense" black, white and red.
"TTL (Time to Love)" was released on September 15, 2009; a collaboration with T-ara's labelmates Supernova. The two groups formed a project unit consisting of Eun-jung, So-yeon, Hyo-min, and Ji-yeon with Kwang-su, Ji-hyuk, and Geon-il; the single was Supernova's first release in two years. Qri stars in the "TTL (Time to Love)" music video. The success of "TTL (Time to Love)" prompted Core Contents Media to produce the sequel entitled "TTL Listen 2" with participation from all members of both groups. Originally set for release on October 13, 2009; "TTL Listen 2" was pushed forward to October 9, 2009, due to the popularity of the original song. The groups performed "TTL Listen 2" for the first time at the annual Dream Concert on October 10, 2009. Nami Tamaki released a Japanese cover of "TTL (Time to Love)" with Supernova in 2011.
"Bo Peep" and "Like the First Time" were released simultaneously with the album on November 27, 2009. "Bo Peep" was a breakthrough for the group, with its cat dance becoming a craze in the country. The single peaked at number four upon the advent of the Gaon charts in January 2010. "Like the First Time" was successful for T-ara as well, it charted at number ten and both singles sold more than 1.6 million copies each in 2010. The music video for "Like the First Time" features the group transforming member Hyo-min into a "sophisticated" version of herself.
Breaking Heart
In early February 2010, it was announced that T-ara would be re-releasing their album with two new songs in order to thank their fans for the success of their first album. Entitled Breaking Heart, the reissue centers around a "temptation of the devil" concept. Initial concept photos typo-ed the release as Braking Heart. Breaking Heart was physically released on March 3, 2010, in two editions: a standard, and a first press edition with a 56-page photobook. This edition was limited to 6,000 copies. The album was subsequently released in Taiwan as a CD and DVD package, with pre-orders that include a file folder.
The lead single, "You Drive Me Crazy" (, Neo Ttaemune Michyeo), was penned by singer-songwriter Wheesung, with music by Cho Young-soo and Kim Tae-hyun. Robbie Daw of Idolator drew comparisons to American singer Britney Spears, commenting: "the "Womanizer" beat, the "If U Seek Amy" melody and the wardrobe that looks like it was stolen from the storage unit housing the "...Baby One More Time" video shoot memorabilia. [...] You know, the line "you empower me, sexy shadow" is simply just not used enough in pop songs these days. So props for that, T-ara." Filming for the music video, directed by Cha Eun-taek, began on February 18, 2010, in a Namyangju, Gyeonggi studio. Member Ji-yeon suffered a knee ligament injury during its production, causing the other members to end their solo shoots with Ji-yeon finishing hers the next morning. "You Drive me Crazy" peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart; holding its position for two weeks, it sold 3 million copies by the end of 2010 and ranked at number sixteen on the annual chart.
T-ara began dual promotions for their second single, "I'm in Pain" (, Naega Neomu Apa), with the March 11, 2010, broadcast of M! Countdown. It was performed alongside "You Drive Me Crazy", with the music video premiering on March 15, 2010. Two alternate versions of the video were further released, and "I'm in Pain" peaked at number 31 on the Gaon, selling 1.2 million copies by the end of 2010.
Critical reception
The album has received generally positive reviews. A columnist for Sohu Music marked Absolute First Album as a "clear improvement" over their debut single, yet criticized its lack of identity, opining that though T-ara were able to follow popular trends, they had yet to find a suitable music style. Nevertheless, the reviewer picked "Falling U" as a standout track. In a more negative review, Seo Jung-min of K-pop Archive agreed that their music "can't be considered to have its own grammar", and called the album's sound "mechanical and [simplistic]". Seo further expressed their ambivalence towards girl group hook songs "flooding" the Korean pop music scene in 2009. A writer for Sina Entertainment stated that the album was "full of youthfulness" and "T-ara's color". Similarly, a staff writer for Bugs! remarked that the album "[makes] you feel the charm of T-ara" across its fourteen tracks; singling out the "sweet and refreshing" "Apple is A", and "body shaker" "Tic Tic Toc". Reviewing the Breaking Heart reissue, a bug! staff writer calls the album a "turning point showing the essence of fresh electronic music", in addition to naming the album's slower offerings such as "Good Person" and "Falling U" as high quality songs.
Writing for Kpopstarz, Jesse Lent commended "Like the First Time" for its enduring appeal. Lent highlighted the "ethereal restraint" in T-ara's vocals, which "seems to be out of fashion in an industry built on one-upmanship", comparing their technique to that of Kate Bush and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Members Qri, Hyo-min, and Eun-jung have named "Like the First Time" as their all-time favorite track. In 2017, Jacques Peterson of SBS PopAsia named "TTL (Time to Love)", "You Drive Me Crazy" and "Like the First Time" as among the group's best singles. Peterson previously opined that Absolute First Album "still stands as one of the best, if not the best, Korean girl group album of the past five years". In 2018, SBS PopAsia listed Absolute First Album as one of 10 "Essential Modern K-pop Albums You Need to Hear".

Absolute First Album (re-issue)
Hamzah Haz (born 15 February 1940) is an Indonesian politician who served as the ninth vice president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004. He also chaired the United Development Party from 1998 to 2007.
Career
Hamzah was a newspaper journalist in his home town of Pontianak, on the island of Borneo, and later taught economics at Tanjungpura University.
His political career began in 1968 as a member of the West Kalimantan Provincial Representative Council. He later moved to Jakarta, became a member of the Parliament in 1971, first as a member of the Muslim Nahdlatul Ulama Party. After the political fusion which joined all Islamist parties into one party and the withdrawal of Nahdlatul Ulama from politics, he became in 1973 a member of the newly formed Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (PPP).
Hamzah served as Minister for Investment under President B. J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto, then resigned that post to lead the PPP in the 1999 elections. He joined the cabinet of President Abdurrahman Wahid, then became the first to quit Wahid's first cabinet, resigning as Minister for People's Welfare after just two months.
He became a vocal critic of Wahid, but he is also known for his ability to compromise. By the time of Wahid's impeachment in the summer of 2001, Hamzah was leader of the PPP, then the third-largest party in the Indonesian Parliament. As such, he became the obvious choice for the members of People's Consultative Assembly to fill the vacancy of Vice President's office, as Megawati Sukarnoputri moved up to the Presidency.
In the 2004 presidential election, Hamzah was one of the presidential candidates, running with Agum Gumelar. The pair finished last among the five candidates, garnering only 3 percent of the total vote.
Connections with militant Islamism
A number of journalists and commentators have reported that Hamzah is believed to offer support for militant Muslim groups as a way of gaining political support from them. In 2002, Bill Guerin, in an opinion piece in the Asia Times wrote, "Hamzah... is widely seen as blatantly vying for support from among Indonesian Muslims, including the militant groups, to strengthen his run for the presidency in the country's next general elections in 2004."
Hamzah is also reported to be as an apologist for and friend of Abu Bakar Bashir, who is the spiritual leader for the terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah. While vice president, Hamzah made a public show of inviting Bashir to dinner, and visited his jihadist pesantren (religious school) in Pondok Ngruki. Hamzah denied that Bashir was connected to terrorism up until Bashir's arrest in October 2002, and was quoted as saying before Bashir's arrest "If you want to arrest Abu Bakar Bashir.. you will have to deal with me first."
In October 2002, an article in TIME stated "That clerics like Abubakar [Bashir] have powerful military and political allies is no secret: the nation's Vice-President Hamzah Haz is one of them." TIME reported that Hamzah described his relationship with Bashir and Laskar Jihad leader Jafar Umar Thalib as "very close", but TIME added, "many see this relationship as a purely political ploy to woo Muslim voters ahead of the 2004 election." Hamzah, although he "has a reputation as a wily politician" nevertheless "will be remembered for a particularly ill-judged speech before Muslim clerics at Abubakar's Solo boarding school in May [2002]", the newsmagazine reported. During that visit Hamzah was also reported to have said, "If they can prove there are terrorists here I'll be the first to order an arrest," and then stepped down from the podium and kissed Abubakar on both cheeks.
In 2002, an Australian academic cited Hamzah as the "best example" of Islamic politicians in Indonesia "prepared to play the extremist card to attract extra votes". Hamzah "has supported Jemaah Islamiyah and has even been instrumental in having its members released from detention in the past", according to Tim Lindsey, director of the Asian Law Centre at the University of Melbourne. "He has also openly accused the CIA and the United States of carrying out the Bali bombing."
Denial of terrorists in the country
In 2002 Hamzah gave an interview to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which broadcast it on 23 October. In a voice-over played during the television interview, an ABC journalist said, "Before the Bali bombing, Vice President Hamzah Haz insisted there were no terrorists in Indonesia. After the bombing, he gave this extraordinary justification for that position:"
Hamzah Haz press statement: "If I as vice president said that Indonesia has terrorists, no one would come to Indonesia, no investors would come."
The ABC interviewer then told Hamzah: "In light of Bali, that would seem a reprehensible comment, if you knew that people were here."
Hamzah responded: "It's not true that I protect them and I don't regret what I said, but I said it in the past – it relates to the past. But now if there is a connection we want to know whether it is true that Indonesia has a terrorist network."
Accusation of United States terrorism
On 3 September 2003 Hamzah stated, "Actually, who is the terrorist, who is against human rights? The answer is the United States because they attacked Iraq. Moreover, it is the terrorist king, waging war."
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Hamzah's statement was "a scathing attack that echoed the language of many of the Bali bombers." Hamzah had also been criticised for publicly associating with several of Indonesia's more hardline Islamic leaders, including Bashir, although after the Bali terrorist attack Hamzah severed those ties. Soon after Hamzah's remarks, Riza Sihbudi, a political analyst at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, told the Detik news service that Hamzah seemed to be chasing votes. "He should not have spoken like that as he is the Vice-President," Sihbudi said.
Al Jazeera reported the day after Hamzah's statement that "There has yet to be a US reaction to the well-known firebrand's comments."
Personal life
The Office of the Vice President officially states that Hamzah has two wives, Asmaniah (b. 27 July 1942), and Titin Kartini (b. 4 May 1946), with whom he has a total of 12 children. However, another source states Haz has a third wife, Soraya, whom he does not officially acknowledge, and with whom he has a further three children.
Hamzah Haz's son Nur Agus Haz, is a member of parliament for the United Development Party
Degree
He is sometimes known as Dr. Hamzah; he is reported to have obtained a PhD from American World University, an internet diploma mill, for US$1,200.

McGillin's Olde Ale House is a tavern in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1860, McGillin's is the oldest drinking establishment in the city. It is located on Drury Street, an alley connecting 13th Street and South Juniper Street, between Chestnut Street and Sansom Street, in Center City.
History
The famous pub, officially called The Bell in Hand, opened its doors in 1860 in the home of Irish immigrant William "Pa" McGillin, the owner and operator of the establishment. It was nicknamed McGillin's by those who frequented the establishment, and the bar took on the title as its official name. "Pa" McGillin operated the establishment until his death in 1901. Then his wife Catherine, known as "Ma" McGillin continued running the business, which had grown to encompass the oyster house next door as well as the remainder of the McGillin's house, displacing her 13 children. "Ma" ran the restaurant until her own death in 1937, at age 90.
After Ma's death, the tavern was run by her daughter, Mercedes McGillin Hooper, until 1958, when she sold it to Henry Spaniak and Joe Shepaniak, brothers and experienced bartenders (who used different spellings of their last names). Since 1993, the bar has been owned by Henry's daughter, Mary Ellen Spaniak Mullins, and her husband Chris Mullins. Their son, Christopher Mullins, Jr., also helps run the day-to-day operations.
The ceramic tile floor (main floor), though not original to the bar, was installed by "Pa" McGillin because he was "tired of replacing the wooden floors because of wear and tear from workers' boots. William got the idea from a local butcher shop—little wear and tear, easy to clean."
There is a ship bell and a cow bell behind the bar which the bartenders ring when they get a great tip. They also ring it to "gong" or "boo" a bad karaoke singer. During a Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Eagles of Philadelphia Sixers, Philadelphia Union or Philadelphia Flyers game, it can be expected that the bell will be rung when the home team scores.
The political website PoliticsPA named it to their list of restaurants frequented by politicians.
In 2013, Gourmet magazine called McGillin's one of the 3 coolest bars in the United States. In 2007, the national trade magazine Nightclub and Bar included McGillin's in its Editors' Choice Top 100 bars and clubs in the United States. The list is based on annual revenue, effective marketing and advertising, uniqueness to market and other factors. And many media outlets have called McGillin's one of America's most authentic Irish pubs including USA Today, Huffington Post, Fodor's, The Daily Meal, MSN and Orbitz.
Notable paraphernalia
McGillin's has become the home to a sizable collection of historical Philadelphia paraphernalia including:
A catalogue of every Liquor License held by the pub since 1871, saved by William McGillin and each successive owner.
The original "Bell in Hand" sign, the original sign that William "Pa" McGillin had designed for the pub when it originally opened. "The sign has survived through the years and is an amazing carved piece of wood of an arm ringing a bell - you can almost hear the crier calling the public to McGillin's!"
The John Wanamaker's "signature" logo sign from the original Wanamaker's Department Store at 13th and Market Streets.
The Strawbridge & Clothier "Seal of Quality" logo sign from the Market Street Store - Presented to McGillin's by Peter Strawbridge, the founder's great-grandson.
Gimbel's Department Store tiled subway sign.
Lit Brothers Department Store tiled subway sign.
F.W. Woolworth's tiled subway sign indicating the defunct Market Street store.
A Corestates Financial Group sign.

There are also several hand-drawn scenes of McGillin's and Philadelphia drawn by various artists through the 1960s and 1970s.

The Villa Merian, with its English Garden, stands on the elevated plain above Brüglingen in Münchenstein, in the canton of Basel-Country in Switzerland.
Geographical location
The geographical area Brüglingen is a plane region that lies along the western bank of the river Birs between St. Jacob an der Birs (now part of Basel) and Münchenstein. The Villa Merian, with its English Garden, stands upon the elevated plain directly above the Watermill Museum Brüglingen.
History
Manor house
The original manor house was built in 1711 Baroque style by Alexander Löffler, above the watermill and the canal. The two storey building was covered by a gentle sloped hipped roof. Before the northern cladding there was a courtyard. To the south there was an arboretum and plant nursery. On the western side there was a tower and a gardening house. Built onto the rear of the house was a polygonal tower with spiral staircase.
In 1801 the manor was rebuilt in early Neoclassical style. The polygonal tower with stairway and the tower to the west were removed. The staircase was relocated internally. A winter garden, with a pergola above it, was built onto the rear of the villa. A pillared portico was placed in front of the main entrance. Above the structure of the hip roof a parapet was drawn in and installed as fixed-point mounting.
Approximately ten years later the stately home and its properties were acquired by Christoph Merian-Hoffmann, and in 1824 he gave the estate to his son Christoph Merian as wedding present. The Villa Merian was used by Christoph Merian and his wife Margarethe as a summer residence.
During 1858/59 Christoph Merian rebuilt the villa in Second Empire style. The architect Johann Jakob Stehlin-Burckhardt from Basel received the assignment. Although Stehlin proposed a new building, Merian restricted the rebuild to a refurbishment. The quintessential walls were roughcast and clad with cast iron and iron mouldings. The ground floor was clad with imitation ashlar and the windows were summated with acroterion. The first and second floors were separated by Gesims and the outer corners of the building were reinforced. The roof parapet was replaced by an Attica and covered by a hipped roof, the crown of which is concluded by a belfry. The portico at the front entrance was replaced by a two storey cast iron pavilion, the projecting roof being used as a balcony. To the rear the winter garden and pergola were replaced by a three axe cast iron open hallway that was encased with artificial marble. The stairway was replaced and finished with elaborate iron rolling bars, the room arrangement remained unaltered.
Christoph Merian died in 1858 before the refurbishment works were completed. Despite this the Villa was still used by his widow Margaretha Merian-Burckhardt as her summer residence. She died on 3 May 1886. With her death the will of her husband became legally binding and the public utility institution Christoph Merian Stiftung came into effect and inherited the manor Brüglingen and the five affiliated farmyards (Singerhof, St. Jakob, Ziegelhütte, Unter- und Vorder-Brüglingen)
Other buildings
Standing in Unteren Brüglingen, the lower district, is a mill from the 15th century. On the opposite side of the canal there is a tenantry house from the 16th century and a gardeners house dated 1824.
In 1837 the architect Melchior Berri developed another farm house north of the manor house with an outbuilding with stables, in Vorder-Brüglingen, the "front" district of Brügglingen on the elevated plain. This raised plateau offers an ideal terrain for an English garden. To the south of the manor house gardens is Merian Park, which extends south to the Neue Welt district in Münchenstein.
Modern history
The Gothic Revival style watermill building has housed a museum since 1966. It is located on the bank of the "St. Alban-Teich" canal directly below the villa.
In 1967 the institution Christoph Merian Stiftung made the decision to lease the villa and the estate to the city of Basel, gratuitously for one hundred years, so that a botanical garden could be established on the grounds.
Grün 80
During the summer of 1980 Münchenstein was the host municipality for Grün 80, the 2nd Swiss exhibition for gardens and landscaping. The exhibition was held in Brüglingen and also made benefit of the entire estate grounds. The remains of the Grün 80 exhibition complex, and the villa's gardens and landscape, are now a public park named Merian Park. The botanical gardens are within the borders of Merian Park and cover an area of 135,000 m2.
With a view to the Grün 80, during 1977, the Villa Merian was overhauled and became a coffee house. Since then the Villa has been reconverted and redecorated. The two cast iron verandas on either side of the house were removed, but all the other cast iron prefabricated units and the inner decorations were carefully restored. In the lower floor various demolition works were carried out and new toilets for the coffee house were installed, while the unused arched cellar and basements were rebuilt so that they could be utilized. The painted, stuccoed ceilings with their gold-plated ornaments, the wall panelling, the bas-relief, overdoors and the parquetry were all completely restored.
The tower heating furnace, previously removed and stored in the basement, was reinstalled in the parlour. The entrance hall, the three axe cast iron hallway and the entire first floor were left unaltered, but ceilings, walls and floors were redecorated. In the attic area the walls were demolished, the hipped roof had windows built in, and it was insulated. Three seminar rooms and a central zone with restrooms then were created there.

This was the nation's third appearance at a Summer Paralympic Games, following their two previous participations at the 2008 Summer Paralympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Gabon sent a sole athlete to represent them at Rio de Janeiro, wheelchair racer Edmond Ngombi. He did not advance from his heat in the men's 100 metres T54 event as he came sixth out of seven competitors and attributed the result to a handlebar problem.
Background
Gabon first entered Paralympic competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics and have appeared in every Summer Paralympic Games since. Thus, Rio de Janeiro was the country's third time competing at a Summer Paralympiad. The nation has never won a medal at the Paralympic Games. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Gabon was represented by a sole athlete, Edmond Ngombi, a short-distance wheelchair racer. He was accompanied by his coach Guy Gaétan Ntoutoume Endenda and international classifier Astride Koumba. Ngombi was selected to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Athletics
Edmond Ngombi contracted polio at an early age, and lost the use of both his legs, resulting in him using a wheelchair in competition. He is classified T54 by the International Paralympic Committee. The Rio Summer Paralympics were his second significant international competition, after the 2015 African Games, and he was 39 years old at the time of the Games. To compete at the Games, he received an invitation from the Bipartite Commission because his fastest time of 18.34 at the 2015 African Games was 3.19 seconds slower than the "B" qualifying standard for his event, the men's 100 metres T54. On 16 September, Ngombi competed in the heats of the men's 100 meters T54. Assigned to compete against seven other athletes in heat one, he completed the race in 18.79 seconds, which put him sixth. Nogmbi failed to qualify for the final since he was 19th overall and only the top eight advanced to that stage of the competition. After the Paralympics, he said his performance was hindered by a handlebar problem on his wheelchair and revealed that he exceeded his expectations.

Johnny Ross (1931-2018) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played as a five-eighth for Parramatta in the 1950s.
Playing career
Ross was a Parramatta junior and made his first grade debut for the club in 1951. Ross played a total of 33 first grade games for Parramatta at a difficult time in the club's history with the newly admitted side struggling due to a weak playing roster and lack of resources. Ross claimed 2 wooden spoons as a player at the club. Ross played over 100 games in total for Parramatta including reserve grade and third grade appearances.
Post playing
Ross coached teams in the local Wollongong district for a number of years before becoming a successful publican managing several pubs in New South Wales before retiring in 1997. Ross then became the founding chairman of HOSTPLUS, the industry superannuation fund for a range of industries including hospitality.

Kleinothraupis is a genus of warbler-like birds in the tanager family Thraupidae. They are found in highland forest in South America.
Taxonomy and species list
The five species now placed in this genus were formerly assigned to the genus Hemispingus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that Hemispingus was polyphyletic. As part of the subsequent rearrangement, the five species were assigned to a new genus Kleinothraupis that was erected with the black-capped hemispingus as the type species. The name Kleinothraupis was chosen in honour of the ornithologist Nedra K. Klein whose name is combined with the Ancient Greek θραυπίς (thraupis), an unidentified small bird mentioned by Aristotle. In ornithology thraupis is used to signify a tanager.
The five species in the genus are:
Grey-capped hemispingus, Kleinothraupis reyi
Black-capped hemispingus, Kleinothraupis atropileus
White-browed hemispingus, Kleinothraupis auricularis
Orange-browed hemispingus, Kleinothraupis calophrys
Parodi's hemispingus, Kleinothraupis parodii

Gorman disqualification
During the race Australia's Melissa Gorman was disqualified (DQ'd) for unsportsmanlike conduct. Three days later, on Tuesday, July 20, 2010, following a protest of her DQ by Swimming Australia, FINA overturned Gorman's DQ, reinstating her result which placed her in third. This moved China's FANG Yanqiao (and the rest of the finishers below them) down one place; Fang moving from third to fourth. France's Aurelie Muller's similar DQ for unsportsmanlike conduct was also reviewed; however, her disqualification was not overturned.

The Great Industrial Exhibition in 1853 was held in Dublin, Ireland. In its day, it was the largest international event to be held in Ireland. The Irish Industrial Exhibition Building, located on the grounds of Leinster House, housed the entire fair. It lasted from 12 May to 31 October, Queen Victoria accompanied by the Prince Consort and the Prince of Wales, paid an official visit on 29 August.
Background
It was entirely funded by William Dargan, entrepreneur and developer of Irish railways. He had planned to donate $100,000 to the effort, but ended up giving $400,000. The intent of the exhibition was to introduce the industrial revolution to Ireland, which was behind some other European countries.
Irish Industrial Exhibition Building
Visitors were struck with the quality of the building more than by any of the objects that it contained. Critics described the large exhibition building and "the rapidity with which it was erected" (a few months), and "the sufficiency of its plans, and the enormous mass of its carefully worked materials." The building is described by The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue as:
On 12 May 1853, when the exhibition opened, the architect (who had also been the architect for the industrial exhibition held in Cork the previous year), John Benson, was granted a knighthood. Part of the roof blew off during a storm on Christmas Eve, the year before opening.
Exhibits
Some limited Irish furniture industry was shown, including the linen and lace industry which the Irish could identify with. Also Bog wood carvings and Celtic Revival jewellery and other items were showcased, including the Tara Brooch, displayed with the modern imitations which were already fashionable. However none of this inspired new Irish Industry.
There were a few American exhibits including Colt and Singer. Colt sold 40 pistols to the Irish prison system.
There were also some exhibits from Australia, including examples of gold from several fields.
It was the first Worlds Fair to exhibit fine arts paintings. Included in the fine arts section were the calotype photographs which had been taken by Edward King-Tenison, of Castle Tenison, Co. Roscommon of the villages and towns of Spain. E.K. Tenison had developed a technique which enabled him to enlarge his pictures to a size which were appropriate for exhibition.
British exhibits were limited to those companies who were looking for markets in Ireland, with little success. It was only during its last month that Dargan convinced the railways to offer a very inexpensive excursions rate and combined with an admission ticket for almost nothing, did some of the general Irish public get to see the crystal palace in Dublin.
Outcome
The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue commented:
However, overall attendance was lower than expected at approximately 1.15 million visitors, leaving Dargan with a financial loss of approximately £9,000.

Freyberg Pool is a public indoor swimming pool on Wellington Harbour, New Zealand. The main pool is long. It is named for Bernard Freyberg, a World War I Victoria Cross recipient and Governor-General of New Zealand.
A strong swimmer, he won the New Zealand 100-yards championship in 1906 and 1910. Freyberg died in 1963, the year the pool was opened, so it was decided to name it after him as he had trained at Te Aro baths which was previously at the site.
The building is classified as a "Category I" ("places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'") historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
In 2011, along with the Michael Fowler Centre, it won an NZIA Enduring Architecture Award.

In cultures where monogamy is mandated, bigamy is the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another. A legal or de facto separation of the couple does not alter their marital status as married persons. In the case of a person in the process of divorcing their spouse, that person is taken to be legally married until such time as the divorce becomes final or absolute under the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Bigamy laws do not apply to couples in a de facto or cohabitation relationship, or that enter such relationships when one is legally married. If the prior marriage is for any reason void, the couple is not married, and hence each party is free to marry another without falling foul of the bigamy laws.
Bigamy is a crime in most countries that recognise only monogamous marriages. When it occurs in this context often neither the first nor second spouse is aware of the other. In countries that have bigamy laws, with a few exceptions (such as Egypt and Iran), consent from a prior spouse makes no difference to the legality of the second marriage, which is usually considered void.
History of anti-bigamy laws
Even before Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, Diocletian and Maximian passed strict anti-polygamy laws in 285 AD that mandated monogamy as the only form of legal marital relationship, as had traditionally been the case in classical Greece and Rome. In 393, the Roman Emperor Theodosius I issued an imperial edict to extend the ban on polygamy to Jewish communities. In 1000, Rabbi Gershom ben Judah ruled polygamy inadmissible within Ashkenazi Jewish communities living in a Christian environment.
Legal situation
Most western countries do not recognise polygamous marriages, and consider bigamy a crime. Several countries also prohibit people from living a polygamous lifestyle. This is the case with the United States where the criminalisation of a polygamous lifestyle originated as anti-Mormon laws, although they are rarely enforced. De facto polygamy is illegal under US federal law, the Edmunds Act.
In diplomatic law, consular spouses from polygamous countries are sometimes exempt from a general prohibition on polygamy in host countries. In some such countries, only one spouse of a polygamous diplomat may be accredited, however.
By country and region
Australia: Illegal. Up to five years' imprisonment.
Belgium: Illegal. Five to ten years' imprisonment.
Brazil: Illegal. Two to six years' imprisonment.
Canada: Illegal.
China: Illegal. Up to two years' imprisonment, and up to three years for bigamy with soldiers (but tolerated for some minorities, such as Tibetans, in some rural areas in the south-west).
Colombia: Illegal with exceptions (such as religion). Although bigamy no longer exists as a lone figure in the Colombian judicial code, marrying someone new without dissolving an earlier marriage may yield to other felonies such as civil status forgery or suppression of information.
Egypt: Legal for men if first wife consents.
Eritrea: Illegal. Up to five years' imprisonment.
Germany: Illegal. Up to three years' imprisonment.
Ghana: Illegal. Up to six months' imprisonment.
Hong Kong: Illegal. Up to seven years' imprisonment.
Iceland: Illegal.
India: Legal only for Muslim men but very rarely practised. Up to 10 years' imprisonment for others except in the state of Goa for Hindus due to its own civil code.
Indonesia: Depending on the specific tribe in question, bigamy can be legal or illegal.
Republic of Ireland: A criminal offence under section 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, up to seven years' imprisonment. The Director of Public Prosecutions has discretion and rarely prosecutes. Catholic canon law permits a second marriage if the first was in a UK register office or annulled by the church; the state considered such marriages bigamous without a civil annulment (more restricted than a church annulment) or divorce (illegal from 1937 until 1996) and two cases in the 1960s led to suspended sentences. The 1861 act replaced an 1829 act which in turn replaced acts of 1725 and 1635.
Iran: Legal for men with consent of first wife. Rarely practised.
Israel: Illegal for members of each confessional community. Up to five years' imprisonment.
Italy: Illegal. Up to five years' imprisonment.
Libya: Legal for men with conditions.
Malaysia: Illegal for non-Muslims under federal jurisdiction. Under section 494 of Chapter XX of the Penal Code, non-Muslim offenders found guilty of bigamy or polygamy can be punished up to seven years' imprisonment. Bigamy or polygamy is legal only for Muslim men with restrictions under state jurisdiction, rarely practised.
Maldives: Permitted for anyone.

Jacob Breda Bull (28 March 1853 – 7 January 1930) was a Norwegian author, journalist and editor.
Biography
Jacob Bull was born at Rendalen in Hedmark, Norway.
He was the son of parish priest Mathias Bull (1815–1876) and Henriette Margrethe Breda (1817–1887). In May 1876 he graduated with a cand.theol. degree and received the university title “haud laudibilis” (not without praise). He then served a year as a teacher at Nickelsen's Girls' School in Kristiania (now Oslo). In April 1878 he founded the newspaper Dagen and subsequently earned his living as a journalist. He served as leader of the Norwegian Authors' Union from 1900 to 1903.
His debut novel Paa Grænsen was published in 1879. Bull is best known as the author of the short story Vesleblakken. The story about the horse named Vesleblakken is based upon a childhood memory from the author's upbringing in Rendalen. The story was first published in Skisser (1891). His other novels and stories often described folk life in the valley of Østerdalen. He also wrote historical novels, contemporary novels and poetry. In 1911, Bull became a Knight 1st grade in the Order of St. Olav. After 1914, he resided in Copenhagen where he died during 1930.
Personal life
He married Gunvor Sophie Rytter Saws (1843–1882) on 29 December 1876, and was married a second time with Swedish-born Anna Maria Augusta Bergløf (1854–1922) on 9 January 1883. He was the father of poet Olaf Bull (1883–1933) and grandfather of author Jan Bull (1927–1985).
Jacob Breda Bull died during 1930 and was buried at Ytre Rendal Church (Ytre Rendal Kirke).
The former church rectory in Rendalen where he grew up is now the Bull Museum (Bull-Museet). Opened in 1964, it is a biographical and cultural history museum. Since 1997, Rendalen municipality has annually awarded Vesleblakkenprisen, named after Bull's most notable work, to individuals or organizations who have excelled in altruistic work.

I Sell the Dead is a 2008 horror comedy, the feature film debut from Irish director Glenn McQuaid. The film is a period horror comedy about grave robbing and stars Dominic Monaghan, Ron Perlman, Larry Fessenden and Angus Scrimm.
Plot
While awaiting his execution for murder and grave robbery, Arthur Blake (Dominic Monaghan) is visited by Father Duffy (Ron Perlman), who wishes to obtain a statement from the condemned to be used as a cautionary tale. Arthur denies that he is a murderer, a crime for which his former partner, Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden), has already been executed by guillotine. However, Blake freely admits to being a grave robber, and begins to recount his career with Willie.
Arthur became Willie's apprentice following the death of Blake's father, forcing the young man to find a job to support his family. Willie quickly taught him the skills necessary to steal corpses, both from graves and more risky locations, such as wakes. The job proved profitable on its face, but both Arthur and Willie's ability to make money was severely hampered by the interference of Doctor Quint (Angus Scrimm), who frequently blackmailed the two into obtaining corpses for free under threat of notifying the police of their activities. This blackmail continued for numerous years.
Willie and Arthur's career changed abruptly when procuring another corpse for Quint. Digging up a corpse buried at a cross-roads, the two were confused when they found a garlic wreath around the body's neck and a wooden stake in its chest. Arthur dismissed these things as superstition, and removed them against Willie's protests. Moments later, while the two were clearing their cart, the dead woman rose and walked away. Willie and Arthur attempted to flee, but came across the undead woman, who attacked Arthur. Willie was able to fend her off briefly with a shovel, and when she attacked him he managed to plunge the stake back into her chest, causing her to go immediately limp. Willie and Arthur delivered the staked body to Doctor Quint and departed quickly. The doctor removed the stake, awakening the undead woman, who killed him.
Freed of their blackmailer and now aware of a new market for their skills, Arthur and Willie shifted their career towards the supernatural side of grave robbing. During one such job (retrieving a body resembling a Grey alien) they were stopped by Cornelius Murphy, main spokesperson for the House of Murphy, an infamous and vicious band of grave robbers led by Cornelius' unseen father, Samuel. Cornelius demanded the body at knifepoint; though Willie advised him to cooperate, Arthur refused, and the three scuffled over the body until it vanished in a burst of light.
At this point in Arthur's narrative, Father Duffy asks him if he had any further encounters with the House of Murphy. Arthur is reluctant to speak of the matter, but finally relents, discussing the next—and last—time he encountered the Murphys.
Drinking at a local pub with their new apprentice (and Arthur's girlfriend) Fanny, Arthur and Willie received word from pub owner Ronnie about a possible job: a local mortuary had been reported as receiving crated shipments of the undead. However, their most recent shipment was incomplete, two of the crates lost in a shipwreck and believed to be located on a nearby island. The catch was that the mortuary had already hired someone to retrieve the missing undead: The House of Murphy. Willie and Arthur initially turned down the job, not wishing to cross paths with the Murphys, but at Fanny's insistence the two reluctantly agreed.
On the island the crates, are guarded by Bulger, House of Murphy's enforcer. Fanny slit his throat (to Arthur and Willie's surprise), then the three rounded up one of the undead, Willie suffering a bite during the effort. Before they could get to the second, Fanny was killed by a knife thrown by Cornelius, who then tied the remaining two to the cage containing the captured undead. The two were only saved from death when the captured undead tore free of its cage and attacked Valentine, one of Murphy's disfigured female assassin. Cornelius attempted to save Valentine, only to be attacked by the second undead. Willie and Arthur freed themselves, then escaped in the confusion. Afterward, the two argued bitterly over the botched job, resulting in the end of their partnership, and friendship. A week later, the two were arrested.
At the conclusion of the tale, Father Duffy asks whether it was Arthur or Willie who murdered Cornelius, but Arthur reiterates that the two simply left him to his fate. When Father Duffy expresses a surprising amount of anger at this, as well as the sentiment that Willie was "lucky" to have been killed before Duffy could meet him, Arthur realizes the priest's true identity: Samuel Murphy. The elder Murphy then attempts to kill Arthur with a mace, but, before he can, he is struck down by an unseen rescuer. When he is able to look up, Arthur is surprised to discover his rescuer is Willie—more accurately, the decapitated body of Willie. Holding his head in one hand, Willie explains that the bite he suffered on the island seems to have rendered him undead following his execution. As the two make their way out of the prison cell, Willie remarks that being undead is the best thing that ever happened to him, and even suggests that Arthur himself get bitten. When Arthur rejects the idea, Willie claims he's starting to feel "ravenous", and jokingly chases after Arthur as they leave the prison.
Unknown to them, Cornelius rises from his underwater grave.

Production
The film was based on McQuaid's 2005 short film The Resurrection Apprentice, which also starred Fessenden. After a muted response to the more serious and dramatic tone of the short, McQuaid reworked the idea to be more comedic. Scrimm was cast when McQuaid met him on the set of another Fessenden project. When Scrimm mentioned to Fessenden's son that he could play the violin, McQuaid added a scene to showcase this talent. Perlman had worked with McQuaid and Fessenden previously on The Last Winter. Perlman's role was expanded after he pointed out that it was light. Monaghan was approached by producer Peter Phok. Shooting took place in Staten Island, New York City. Production was halted for five months while co-star Perlman starred in Hellboy II: The Golden Army.
Release
In 2009, the film was picked up for distribution by IFC (US), Anchor Bay (Canada, UK and Australia) and Screen Media (foreign sales). The Blu-ray Disc was released on March 30, 2010 in the United States.
Critical reception
I Sell The Dead has received primarily positive reviews. , it holds a 72% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 46 reviews with an average rating of 5.92/10. The site's consensus reads: "A horror comedy that's almost as chilling as it is funny, I Sell the Dead relies on its dark humor and offbeat charm to overcome its low budget shortcomings." Online critic Maitland McDonagh stated, "A fresh, darkly funny blend of crime [graverobbing, to be precise] and supernatural hijinks ... that delivers an offbeat but carefully balanced mix of shocks, homages and uneasy chuckles." Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the film "doesn't build much narrative steam" but will entertain horror fans. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that although the jokes and setup wear thin, the filmmakers' enthusiasm carries the film. In a negative review, Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film lacks both scares and humor. Nicolas Rapold of The Village Voice called the premise "snack food for horror hobbyists" but said the film's editing focuses on the wrong scenes. Jeannette Catsoulis of NPR wrote that the film is "more slapstick than horror" but has "genuinely chilling moments". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated it a letter grade of B and wrote that the veteran cast carries the film. Andrew Kasch of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, "[T]his is a film made by horror fans for horror fans with enough fun to please almost any crowd."
I Sell the Dead won the 2009 Slamdance Award.

Celama parvitis is a moth of the family Nolidae first described by George Howes in 1917. It is likely endemic to New Zealand. Specimens have been found in Broad Bay, Otago and Aniseed Valley in Nelson. A specimen was also collected south east of Te Anau where it was described by Charles E. Clarke as being a rare moth that was taken in December amongst Leptospermum. This species has also been collected in December in the Dansey ecological district, near Kakanui, on Helichrysum aggregatum.

The Aircraft Board was a United States federal government organization created from the Aircraft Production Board on October 1, 1917, by Act of Congress to provide statutory authority to the APB, which had been created by a resolution of the Council of National Defense on May 16, 1917. Chaired by Howard E. Coffin, the Aircraft Board was also removed from the control of the Council of National Defense and placed under the Secretaries of War and the Navy. The boards, ruled advisory in nature by the Judge Advocate General, gave their recommendations to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps regarding the development and procurement of aircraft during World War I.
The board consisted initially of Coffin, Brig. Gen. George O. Squier (Chief Signal Officer), Rear Adm. David W. Taylor (Chief of the Bureau of Construction of the Navy), S.D. Waldron, Edward A. Deeds, and Col. Robert L. Montgomery. On June 16, 1917, it added Col. Raynal C. Bolling, and on September 14, 1917, Col. Benjamin D. Foulois and Capt. N. E. Irwin, all of the Aviation Section.
After Howard Coffin had resigned under corruption allegations in March, President Wilson appointed John D. Ryan in April 1918 to replace Coffin as head of the board.

The Soviet War Memorial in Schönholzer Heide (Sowjetisches Ehrenmal in der Schönholzer Heide) in Pankow, Berlin was erected in the period between May 1947 and November 1949 and covers an area of 30 000 m². The memorial contains the largest Soviet cemetery in Berlin, which is also the largest Russian cemetery in Europe outside of Russia.
The monument is one of three Soviet memorials built in Berlin after the end of the war. The other two memorials are the Tiergarten memorial, built in 1945 in the Tiergarten district of what later became West Berlin, and the Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park).
Schönholzer Heide was a popular recreation area in the 19th century. During the Second World War the area was turned into a work camp. After the war, the north-western part of the area was used to build the third largest Soviet war memorial in Berlin, together with the memorials in Treptower Park and Tiergarten.
A group of Soviet architects consisting of K. Solovyov, M. Belaventsev, V. Korolyov and the sculptor Ivan Pershudchev made the plan for the cemetery, where 13,200 of the 80,000 Soviet soldiers that had fallen during the Battle of Berlin, would be buried. On a wall around the memorial there are 100 bronze tablets where the names, ranks and birth dates of the soldiers it was possible to identify are written. This group constitutes about one-fifth of the fallen soldiers.
On both sides of the main axis, which at its one end sits a 33.5 meter tall obelisk made of syenite, there are placed 8 burial chambers where 1182 soldiers are buried. Under the Honor Hall inside the obelisk there are buried two Soviet colonels.
A statue of the personification of Mother Russia is situated in front of the obelisk and constitutes the main focal point of the memorial. On the statue's base, which is made out of black porphyry, sit 42 bronze tablets on which the names of fallen officers are inscribed.

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans was first studied in the laboratory by Victor Nigon and Ellsworth Dougherty in the 1940s, but came to prominence after being adopted by Sydney Brenner in 1963 as a model organism for the study of developmental biology using genetics. In 1974, Brenner published the results of his first genetic screen, which isolated hundreds of mutants with morphological and functional phenotypes, such as being uncoordinated. In the 1980s, John Sulston and co-workers identified the lineage of all 959 cells in the adult hermaphrodite, the first genes were cloned, and the physical map began to be constructed. In 1998, the worm became the first multi-cellular organism to have its genome sequenced.
Notable research using C. elegans includes the discoveries of caspases, RNA interference, and microRNAs. Six scientists have won the Nobel prize for their work on C. elegans.
Early research
C. elegans was first described in 1900 by Émile Maupas, who isolated it from soil in Algeria. Ellsworth Dougherty proposed in 1948 that free-living nematodes of the sub-order Rhabditina might be useful for genetic study, noting their relative structural simplicity and invariant cell lineage (eutely). Dougherty and Victor Nigon obtained the first mutant, from a laboratory culture of the closely related nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae. However much of the early laboratory work on Caenorhabditis nematodes was directed towards the establishment of a defined axenic culture medium.
Brenner's search for a new model system
By the early 1960s, Sydney Brenner had made several important contributions to molecular biology, notably a demonstration (with Francis Crick and other colleagues) that the genetic code is triplet in nature.
In June 1963, he wrote to Max Perutz, then the head of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, proposing future research:
By the end of that year, his thoughts were more concrete:
Brenner obtained C. elegans from Dougherty and began to study them in the laboratory by December 1963.
Transgenesis
C. elegans is amenable to transgenesis, the process of introducing foreign genetic material into the genome. The most frequent method for generating transgenic worms is to inject exogenous DNA into the syncytial germ line; biolistic transformation can also be used.

Agnes Kathinka Malling Henningsen (18 November 1868 – 21 April 1962) was a Danish writer and an activist for sexual freedom. Her writings were centred on love and sex, as was her own life.
Biography
Henningsen was born on the Skovsbo estate in the south of Funen where her father was the farmer. After both her mother and father died when she was young, she and her sister were sent by the family to the girls boarding school at Antvorskov near Slagelse. After the unfortunate events in her family, Henningsen remained an atheist for the rest of her life. She married Mads Henningsen, a schoolteacher, with whom she had three children before the marriage ended in divorce after he left her to emigrate to America. The father of her fourth child, the architect and designer Poul Henningsen, was the writer Carl Ewald. As a single mother, Agnes Henningsen earned a living for a time as a hairdresser in central Copenhagen but later devoted all her time to writing.
While still married, she developed a friendship with Herman Bang who in 1891 helped her to have a number of short stories published in the newspaper København using the pen name Helga Maynert. After a number of difficult years in Copenhagen, in 1898 Henningsen moved to Roskilde where she was able to concentrate on writing. In 1899, she published her first novel, Glansbilledet (Scrap Picture), immediately followed by Strømmen (The Current). Influenced by Bang's impressionism, both depict somewhat frigid, depressive women who suffer from a lack of work and staid egocentric attitudes.
In 1900, she began a period of frequent travel, successive new lovers and interesting friendships with figures from Copenhagen's cultural scene which led to her portraits of Gustav Wied, Holger Drachmann and Georg Brandes. After spending a lengthy period in Poland, in 1901 she gained literary fame with Polens Døtre (Poland's Daughters), an intimate work describing the unhappy relationships two women have with the same man, as a result of their platonic views and misgivings about sex. Here Henningsen develops a much more direct style of her own, free from Bang's influence. In 1919, she married the writer Simon Koch but continued her extramarital relationships, refusing to adopt the conventions of the bourgeoisie. Her most successful works are her eight volumes of memoirs (Erindringer) from 1941 to 1955, tracing the various episodes of her life: Let Gang paa Jorden (Stepping Lightly on the Ground), Letsindighedens Gave (Gift of Recklessness), Byen erobret (City Conquered), Kærlighedssynder (Sins of Love), Dødsfjende-Hjertenskær (Mortal Enemy-Heartthrob), Jeg er Levemand (I'm Alive), Den rige Fugl (The Rich Bird) and Skygger over Vejen (Shadows on the Road).
For most of her life, Henningsen was disliked by her contemporaries for her free sexual views and behaviour but she later saw more positive interest in her work from the younger generation. When the Danish Academy was founded in 1960, she was one of its two female members, the other being Karen Blixen.

The emigration of Cubans, from the 1959 Cuban Revolution to October of 1962, has been dubbed the Golden exile and the first emigration wave in the greater Cuban exile. The exodus was referred to as the "Golden exile" because of the mainly upper and middle class character of the emigrants. After the success of the revolution various Cubans who had allied themselves or worked with the overthrown Batista regime fled the country. Later as the Fidel Castro government began nationalizing industries many Cuban professionals would flee the island. This period of the Cuban exile is also referred to as the Historical exile, mainly by those who emigrated during this period.
History
1959 - 1960
The first to emigrate after the revolution were those who were associated or worked for the old Batista regime. The U.S. embassy in Havana and consulate in Santiago would regularly grant visas to Cubans wishing to leave.
By the middle of 1959 various new policies had affected Cuban life such as the redistribution of property, nationalization of religious and private schools, and the banning of racially exclusive social clubs. Those that began to leave the island were driven by them being negatively affected by new economic policies, their distaste with new national public schools, or anxiety over government supported racial integration. The government would quickly label exiles who left as "racists", discouraging Afro-Cubans to also emigrate. These conditions caused the majority of those who emigrated to be either upper or middle class, white, and catholic. Many middle class emigrants were often professionals that were tied to American companies that were nationalized.
Many of the emigrants that would leave believed they would be returning soon to Cuba, believing the U.S. would soon intervene and overthrow the Fidel Castro government. Some of those exiled in the United States would organize a militant resistance to the Fidel Castro government.
The 1960 United States census stated that there were over 124,000 Cubans in the United States. In response to the exodus of Cubans the U.S. government established programs to provide social services and resources to arriving Cubans.
The flight of many skilled workers after the revolution caused a “brain drain.” This loss of trained professionals sparked a renovation of the Cuban education system to accommodate the education of new professionals to replace those that had emigrated.
1961
On January 3, 1961 the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and afterwards emigrants gained visas for humanitarian reasons, and after arriving in the United States they could apply for parole and gain refugee status.
In April of 1961 the Bay of Pigs Invasion consisting of many militant and anti-fidelista Cuban exiles would fail to take over Cuba. Afterwards those who would choose to emigrate would view their decision as a permanent one. Fidel Castro would then term those leaving "gusanos" (worms).
Growing controversy in Cuba with the nationalization of Catholic schools spurred the development of Operation Peter Pan to relocate children to the United States.
1962
During the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, travel between the United States and Cuba became restricted. Afterwards Cuban emigration would occur using makeshift vessels illegally leaving Cuba. From 1959 to the end of open travel in 1962 around 250,000 Cubans left the island.
Characteristics
Demographics
Researcher Jorge Duany claims the majority of exiles were urban, middle-aged, well-educated, light-skinned, and white-collar workers, who emigrated primarily did so for religious, or political reasons. He also claims that while the first emigrants left because they were old Bastianos, those after left because of disillusionment with the new government and because economic reforms and nationalizations of American companies had harmed their professions. Researchers Irving Louis Horowitz and Jaime Suchlick have claimed about half of those who emigrated by the Second Wave were blue collar workers and many of those were agricultural workers and fishermen. They also proposed many left because of Cuba's new rationing system and mandatory military service.
Horowitz and Suchlick claim that while most emigrants were not involved in militant movements a majority did financial support them until later becoming disillusioned after the failures of such movements.
Emigration process and settling
Cubans who requested exit permits would be fired from their job if they worked for a government enterprise. Officials from Committees for the Defense of the Revolution would take inventory of all property of the applicant emigrant, once inventoried the applicant could not sell or give away any of their property. All property and money would be confiscated from them when finally leaving the country, and most exiles left with only a suitcase of clothing in their possession. By 1960 the United States had established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which supplied exiles with food, money, clothing, medical aid, adult education, and plane tickets to locations that had humanitarian organizations that were caring for new arrivals.
Once in the United States many exiles adopted blue-collar jobs. The notably affluent majority of exiles had now become mostly middle or lower class. In Miami discrimination was still commonplace towards Cuban immigrants and many were barred from renting certain properties or membership in trade unions. This discrimination helped foster the Cuban community of Little Havana, where Cubans could remain close to Catholic churches and school's offering charitable aid. Many exiles' were able to use already attained professional skills to eventually better their occupations, and contribute to building Miami's Cuban business enclave.
Legacy
"Golden exile" identity
The Cuban success story or sometimes referred to as the "myth of the golden exile", is the idea that Cuban exiles that came to the United States after the 1959 Cuban Revolution were mostly or exclusively political exiles who were white, largely conservative, and financially successful. The idea garnered traction starting in the 1960s via rags-to-riches stories of Cuban exiles in the US news media, and became widely promoted within the Cuban American community.
The identity of "golden exile" has been used in Cuban-American circles as an identity to distinguish Cuban Americans who are seen as racially white and exuding conservative values as compared to Cuban Americans who came later in the Cuban exile who may have darker skin. The term "golden exile" has also been used in discussions involving immigration as a term to glorify Cuban immigrants as anti-communist political refugees and productive members of the middle class. This term has spurred controversy due to statistics countering this image.
"Cuba de ayer" mythos
This first wave of upper-class emigrants from Cuba in the immediate years after the Cuban Revolution would leave the island with only memories of Cuba from the era of Fulgencio Batista. These memories formed the genesis of the idealized image of the Cuba de ayer. The Cuban exiles who came immediately after the revolution where largely shocked by American racism which differed in expression from Cuban racism. In Cuba no formal de jure racial segregation existed. Whatever social manifestations of racism existed in Cuba were often ignored or unknown to the upper-class white emigres arriving in Miami. The sight of formal racial segregation in the American south by Cuban exiles reinforced the idea that the Cuba de ayer was free of racism unlike the United States.
The reconstruction of outlawed businesses and social organizations in Cuba by exiles now in Miami, reaffirmed the memories of the idyllic Cuba de ayer. This reconstruction came from the waning of a hope to return to a Cuba without Fidel Castro in power, so Cuban exiles began to model their communities in the image of the Cuba de ayer. The most notable of these communities is Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. Little Havana became an epicenter for Cuban life in Miami, specifically in how many institutions are Cuban owned and modeled in the image of nostalgia for the Cuba de ayer.

Corporal Edward Sullivan of the. United States Marine Corps was born May 16, 1870, in Cork, Ireland. He died March 11, 1955, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Uxbridge, Massachusetts has proud connections to the military history of America. Uniforms for the U.S. military were manufactured in Uxbridge for more than 100 years.
Sullivan was awarded the nation's top honor, the Medal of Honor, for heroism during the Spanish–American War of 1898.
Biography
Edward Sullivan entered the United States Marine Corps from Massachusetts in 1896, and served in the Spanish–American War as a Corporal in the United States Marine Corps.
He was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism on May 11, 1898, at Cienfuegos, Cuba. His citation reads -
"On board the USS Marblehead during the operation of cutting the cable leading from Cienfuegos, Cuba, May 11, 1898. Facing the heavy fire of the enemy, Sullivan displayed extraordinary bravery and coolness throughout this action." (Bio by: Don Morfe)
Here is an excerpt from Home of Heroes website:
Edward Sullivan was one of 52 sailors and Marines cited for bravery and coolness in the face of enemy fire during the cutting of cables at Cienfuegos, Cuba on May 11, 1898. The mission was a daring operation to cut undersea cables linking the Spanish fortifications at Cienfuegos with the rest of the world. Destruction of the cables was ordered to disrupt communications. In two boats, sailors from the and the were joined by a Marine guard as they moved within 15 feet of the enemy shore, under fire from the hidden enemy, to dredge up and cut two such cables. During the 80 minute operation, the cable cutting party was under constant enemy fire from a short range, while they coolly dredged the cables across the bow of their boats, then cut through them with hacksaws. When a cable was severed, the seaward end was transported back to the USS Marblehead, which then moved further from shore to drop the ends in deeper water and make repair impossible. So intense was the enemy presence, and so daring the American support, Captain Maynard of the Nashville was wounded in the action. With great courage, the mission was accomplished.
Corporal Sullivan died on March 11, 1955, at the age of 84 in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. He is buried in the Prospect Hill Cemetery in Uxbridge.

Brotherhood of the Snake is the twelfth studio album by American thrash metal band Testament, released on October 28, 2016. It is the band's first studio recording with bassist Steve Di Giorgio since First Strike Still Deadly (2001). Brotherhood of the Snake also marks Testament's fifth collaboration with Andy Sneap, who had mixed and engineered all of their albums since The Gathering (1999) and produced Dark Roots of Earth (2012). The album debuted at number twenty on the Billboard 200 chart, making it Testament's second-highest-charting album in the US, behind Dark Roots of Earth, which peaked at number twelve four years earlier.
Background and production
The possibility of an eleventh Testament studio album was first mentioned about a week before the release of Dark Roots of Earth, when vocalist Chuck Billy stated that Testament would not take "huge gaps" between albums anymore, and would "work hard and tour for two years or so," and try to release another album when they could. Guitarist Eric Peterson added, "There's definitely some politics in the band now. I think if the record does good — which I think it will — it'll see Testament be doing another record. There's some people in the band that are, you know, I think aren't a hundred percent there unless, you know, it keeps going good. That's pretty extreme, but, like for me, I'm down for whatever. I started the band, I'm totally into it. This is what I do. I think, you know, if Testament sees darker days, I don't know if this lineup would stick." Testament spent most of 2012 and 2013 touring in support of Dark Roots of Earth, including supporting Anthrax and Death Angel on the Worship Music tour, and headlining their own U.S. tour, with support from Overkill, Flotsam and Jetsam and 4ARM. 2013 also saw the release of a live DVD/double album from Testament Dark Roots of Thrash, which documents the band's sold-out headlining performance at the Paramount in Huntington, New York in February 2013.
When asked in a September 2013 interview if Testament had any ideas for the follow-up to Dark Roots of Earth, Billy stated Testament would begin writing and recording the album from January to April 2014 for release later that year. He added that the band was in the "right direction" with Dark Roots of Earth, and added "I think that the old saying 'if it's not broken, don't fix it' fits, so we're probably going to stick with the same formula and idea. I think that there isn't any Testament album that sounds the same, so who knows what kind of songs we'll write next year...I don't know." However, these plans fell through, when it was announced in January 2014 that bassist Greg Christian had left Testament for the second time, citing differences with the band and money disputes as the reasons. Christian was replaced by Di Giorgio, who was the bassist for Testament from 1998 to 2004.
Asked in an April 2015 interview about Testament's plans to begin recording a new album, Peterson said that his "main goal" was to "get home [from tour] in June, finish it up and get in the studio by September." Billy added that the band's goal was to have the album finished by Thanksgiving. In May 2016, Billy confirmed the title of Testament's eleventh album to be The Brotherhood of the Snake, which at the time had been recorded, and he hoped for it to be completed before their UK tour in June 2016. Peterson said that the album was going to "get delivered at the end of June, and it'll be probably be delivered to the record company by the end of the summer just in time for a really big tour we're doing of Europe."
When asked about the musical direction of Brotherhood of the Snake, Peterson replied, "It's different. This one is more thrash. I mean, this has got some of the fastest stuff that we have ever played. Usually, we have one or two thrash songs, and then we have some mid-tempo, and then we have a slow, heavy one, and then up-tempo kind of stuff. Half of the new record is thrash, which we've never done before." He also described the album as their "kind of Reign in Blood record", a reference to Slayer's third studio album.
Billy has stated that the album draws lyrical inspiration from the ancient astronaut hypothesis, namely through the Ancient Aliens television program. Furthermore, he said the title comes from the name of an ancient secret society.
On August 4, 2016, Testament began an eight-day countdown to the release of the artwork for Brotherhood of the Snake, and the album's track listing was revealed later that month.
In an interview published August 26, 2016, Testament singer Chuck Billy revealed that first single "Brotherhood of the Snake" would be released September 2, 2016.
Testament released second single "Stronghold" October 12, 2016. The official video for the song “The Pale King” was released on October 31, 2016.
Reception
Brotherhood of the Snake has received generally positive reviews from critics. AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, and states that it "offers an excellent sonic portrait of Testament doing what they do best -- aggressive, riff-heavy, in-your-face thrash. There is a fun concept at work here, but this is more a track-by-track listening experience that adds up to a massive whole."

WFFY (98.5 MHz) is an FM radio station licensed to San Carlos Park, Florida, and broadcasting to the Fort Myers, Florida media market.
WFFY broadcasts at 50,000 watts at .
History
From 2007 to 2014, the station was known as WDEO-FM, airing Catholic-based religious programming branded as "Ave Maria Radio" under the ownership of the Ave Maria Foundation. WDEO-FM aired all Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games in the 2008 season using the ISP Sports feed.
On September 4, 2014, it was announced that Educational Media Foundation (EMF) would purchase WDEO-FM for $2.2 million and convert the station to its contemporary Christian music network, K-Love. The call sign was changed to WLVO.
On June 24, 2015, Classical South Florida announced the sale of its three south Florida classical stations, including WNPS (88.7 FM) in Fort Myers, to EMF. On July 17, 2015, EMF took over operations of 88.7 and began simulcasting K-Love format on both WLVO and WNPS (renamed WDLV).
On August 13, 2015, the license was converted to commercial and EMF announced the sale of WLVO to local group Sun Broadcasting. The sale, however, was quite contentious. Competing radio groups Renda Broadcasting and Beasley Media filed a joint petition with the FCC to deny the sale. The petition was based on the fact that while Sun Broadcasting was below ownership limits in the market, it operates as one de facto group with Fort Myers Broadcasting. The two companies together share studio and staff, and Renda and Beasley argued the sale should not go through because the two companies combined own far more signals than the FCC allowed. In the interim, on August 20, 2015, WLVO switched from K-Love to the Radio Nueva Vida Spanish Christian format.
After two years of airing Radio Nueva Vida format, the FCC dismissed the petition and approved the sale. On June 12, 2017, the station changed its call sign to WKHW. On June 13, 2017, the purchase of the station by Sun Broadcasting from Educational Media Foundation was consummated, at a price of $3,045,000. The new owners immediately changed the call sign to the current WFFY. On June 15, 2017, WFFY changed its format from Spanish Christian to rhythmic contemporary, branded as "Fly 98.5".

Secret Story 2009 is the fifth edition of the French version of the popular reality show Big Brother carrying on from the previous similar show, Loft Story. It began airing on TF1 on June 19, 2009 and continue to air until September 25, 2009, lasting 99 days, and is presented by Benjamin Castaldi, who presented Loft Story and the first two seasons of Secret Story.
Principle
The principle is similar to that of Loft Story.

All of the rooms are installed with cameras, (except the toilet due to a law imposed by the Conseil Supérieur de l'audiovisuel). The Voice speaks to the contestants at times, and acts like "Big Brother" in other countries. Each contestant has to conceal a secret which the other contestants must try to discover. If a contestant does, that contestant wins the jackpot of the contestant whose secret they have guessed. Each secret is worth €10,000. Each Tuesday, 2 contestants are nominated and put up against the public vote, one housemate will be evicted every Friday. Housemates are only permitted to nominate every other week and housemates are only allowed to nominate other housemates of the opposite sex.

Nominations
Nominations follow a different formula than is typical of the Big Brother franchise. Each week the housemates alternate nominations : male housemates nominate female housemates one week, and female housemates nominate male housemates the following week. In some weeks housemates are only permitted to nominate one housemate, rather than the typical two.
Notes
: In round one of nominations only male housemates could nominate.
: As Angie, Kevin, and Romain were only intruders they could not be nominated for eviction.
: In round two of nominations only female housemates could nominate.
: As Kevin and Leo were only intruders they could not be nominated for eviction.
: In week two Big brethren gave Romain the choice between immunity from the second eviction or 10,000 euros, Romain chose to take the immunity.
: In week three, Romain revealed his secret to Jonathan, and as punishment he was automatically nominated and faced the public vote alone.
: In round four of nominations only male housemates were allowed to nominate.
: In round four of nominations there was a three-way tie between Angie, Maija, and Sabrina. As only two housemates can be nominated at one time, the male housemates were each asked to vote for one of the three to face the public vote. Angie received votes from Didier and Nicolas, Maija received votes from Bruno, Francois-Xavier, and Leo, and Sabrina received votes from Jonathan, Kevin, and Romain. Since Maija and Sabrina received the most votes they remained nominated.
: In round four of nominations Nicolas was nominated for eviction by Big brother for discussing nominations.
: In round five of nominations Angie answered the red phone and was told she could nominate anymale housemate for eviction, she chose Leo.
: In round five of nominations only female housemates could nominate.
: Nomination results from the fifth round of nominations were discounted and Jonathan and Romain were no longer nominated. Instead of a public vote, on day 36 the housemates were asked to vote on whether or not Leo should be ejected. Angie, Romain, Vanessa, François-Xavier, Jonathan, Cindy, Sabrina, Kevin, Elizabeth and Maija voted against Leo's return so he was ejected. All other housemates, with the exception of Bruno who chose not to vote, voted for Leo to stay.
: In round six of nominations only male housemates could nominate.
: Upon his eviction, Nicolas was asked to choose either Cindy or Vanessa to give exemption to in the next female nominations week. Nicolas chose to give Vanessa the exemption.
: In round seven of nominations all housemates were allowed to nominate, however the male nominations were fake and, as such, no female contestant was nominated.
: In round eight of nominations Sabrina was automatically nominated by Big Brother for revealing her secret.
: Emilie was exempt from nominations as she had been placed in a secret room following Romain's eviction. For the same reason, Jonathan did not nominate.
: In week nine Jonathan and Maija were automatically nominated for eviction by Big brother for revealing their secrets, as a result the scheduled nominations were cancelled.
: In week ten, Didier was unanimously given the power to nominate two girls for eviction by the 5 remaining men, all other housemates were ineligible to nominate.
: In week eleven, Bruno was given the choice to give immunity to François-Xavier and make everyone lose money or to not give him immunity. He chose to give him immunity.
: In week eleven, Big Brother asked the boys whether or not they wanted Vanessa to single-handedly nominate two boys for eviction and all but Jonathan agreed, all other housemates were ineligible to nominate.
: In round twelve of nominations housemates were allowed to nominate any housemate regardless of gender, they nominated one during the Friday show (Kevin nominated Vanessa, leading to a tie with Emilie and as such both were nominated) and one on Tuesday.
: Jonathan won an automatic pass to the finals after discovering a secret in the house.
: As there was only one week left until the final, all housemates apart from Jonathan were nominated for a triple eviction.

"Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen" is a pop song released in 1961 by Neil Sedaka. Sedaka wrote the music and performed the song, while the lyrics were written by Howard Greenfield. The song is noted for being similar in musical structure to Take Good Care of My Baby by Bobby Vee (another 1961 hit), and additionally for its resemblance to the melody of the Chiffons' subsequent 1963 hit "One Fine Day". Both of these songs exhibiting similarity to "Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen" were penned by the team of Carole King and Gerry Goffin (King and Sedaka were close friends in high school, and Sedaka was known for his appropriation of other popular song motifs in his work). The song reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart.
The narrator sings the song to a younger acquaintance who had up to that point had more of a sibling-like relationship (“when you were only six, I was your big brother”) upon her sixteenth birthday, reminiscing about the ups and downs of their friendship thus far and declaring that now that she has grown from an awkward tomboy (comparing her younger self to the subject of the Rodgers and Hart song "My Funny Valentine") into a beautiful young woman, he wants her for his sweetheart. Greenfield wrote the song out of a flippant comment Sedaka had made regarding their success up to that time: "you could write a birthday song and it'd be a hit."
This was one of several Sedaka recordings that employed the services of drummer Gary Chester. Other musicians on the record include Al Casamenti, Art Reyerson and Charles Macey on guitar, Ernie Hayes on piano, George Duviver on bass, Artie Kaplan on sax, Seymour Barab and Morris Stonzek on cellos, David Guillet, Joseph Haber, Louie Haber, Harold Kohon, David Sackson, Maurice Stine, Louis Stone, and Arnold Goldberg on violins, and Phil Kraus and George Devens on percussion.
A year after the song became a hit, Sedaka's brother-in-law, chemist Ed Grossman, wrote lyrics for a sequel song from the sixteen-year-old's perspective. In "It Hurts to Be Sixteen," the female singer laments her "in-between" state between childhood and adulthood, insisting she has fallen in love but that those around her insist she is too young. "It Hurts to Be Sixteen," with a melody written by Sedaka, was a minor hit for Andrea Carroll (herself 16 at the time she recorded it) in 1963.

Other versions
A Bobby Vee version was released on the album "30 Big Hits from the 60's" in 1964.
The Swedish dansband Flamingokvintetten in 1968 recorded a cover of the song that reached #1 in the Swedish charts Tio i Topp and Kvällstoppen. They also recorded a Swedish version of the song, named "Hon är sexton år i dag" reaching Svensktoppen the same year.
A version called "Happy Birthday, Twenty-One" with a special lyric by Ian Whitcomb and sung by Mae West was released on her Great Balls of Fire album in 1972 on MGM Records.
In 1975, Davey Page released a version of the song, which peaked at number 57 on the Australian charts.
In 2009, Damian McGinty of Celtic Thunder included the song on their album Take Me Home.
In the Roseanne episode "Pretty in Black" (Season Five), Roseanne, Dan and several of their friends sing the first chorus of this song to a mortified Darlene at her "sweet sixteen" party. A version of the song by an uncredited performer is also played over the closing credits of the episode.
In an episode of King of Queens Arthur Spooner, played by Jerry Stiller claims that he inspired Sedaka to this song. In the end of this episode Sedaka appears as himself.
The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina used the song in their first trailer.
Neil Diamond recorded the song for his 1993 album Up on the Roof: Songs from the Brill Building.

State Route 115 (SR 115) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. It runs in Imperial County from Interstate 8 (I-8) southeast of Holtville to SR 111 in Calipatria. The routing was added to the state highway system in 1933, and was constructed by 1934; SR 115 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering.
Route description
SR 115 begins with an interchange at I-8. It then heads northwest through the community of Date City and briefly enters the city of Holtville. Near its exit of the city, it intersects a few county roads before turning due north and continuing through rural Imperial County, eventually beginning an overlap with SR 78 and continuing west. East of Alamorio, SR 115 turns due north again, and intersects CR S26. After a few miles, the highway turns due west, reaching its north end in Calipatria at SR 111.
SR 115 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 115 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. In 2013, SR 115 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 830 between Wirt Road and East Avenue, and 5,800 between the intersection of Walnut Avenue and 5th Street and the intersection of the highway with Holt Avenue, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.
History
The routing from Brawley to Calipatria was added to the state highway system in 1933; following the completion of the road from Yuma to San Diego, increased tourism and growth led to the development of more highways in Imperial County, and the construction of the system was expected to aid in future growth, according to the Los Angeles Times. The northern section above SR 78 was legislatively defined as Route 187; the part of the highway south of Route 187 was defined as Route 201.
The roadway had been constructed by 1934, though the state described the majority of it as a "low type" road. The portion from Route 78 to US 80 was paved by 1938, and the entire road had been paved by 1940. By 1956, the routing was signed as Route 115. By 1961, the highway continued just west of Holtville to an intersection with US 80 (later I-8), where it ran concurrently with US 80 briefly before heading south to a junction with SR 98 in Bonds Corner.
SR 115 was officially defined in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The segment south of SR 78 was altered in 1972; the portion between I-8 south to SR 98 near Bonds Corner was deleted, and the definition was clarified from "Route 8 near Holtville" to "Route 8 southeasterly of Holtville". By 1975, the routing of SR 115 had been adjusted to end at I-8, south of the old US 80 routing.
Future
The 2007 Imperial County Transportation Plan proposed the improvement of SR 115 from the Evan Hewes Highway north to SR 111 from a two-lane highway to a four-lane expressway.

Lake Windigo is a small lake on Star Island in northern Minnesota, United States. The lake covers a total of 199 acres (80 hectare) and reaches a maximum depth of 15 feet (4.6 m). The littoral zone is 129 acres (52 hectare). Due to its shallow depth and subsequent abundant plant and algae growth, water clarity extends 6 feet (1.8 m). The lake hosts small populations of northern pike and walleye and large communities of panfish. Access to Lake Windigo is by a short portage from Cass Lake on the north side of the island. The lake is best navigated by canoe, rowboat, or other small watercraft.
Windigo is located in Star Island in Cass Lake. In the television series Ripley's Believe It Or Not, the lake was designated as being the only lake within a lake in the Northern Hemisphere. There are a few other such lakes. It is, however, the only spring fed lake within a river fed lake in the northern hemisphere.
Star Island is itself a historical site. The village of Ozaawindib, Schoolcraft's guide to Lake Itasca, was located on the island. The Ojibwe people flourished in the area up until the arrival of American and European settlers. In the early 1900s, parts of the island were sold to private entities, while the majority of the island entered the protection of the federal government as a national forest. It remains this way to this day.
The lake derives its name from the Wendigo or Windigo of Algonquin mythology, a malevolent, cannibalistic spirit that could possess people and inspire cannibalism, particularly during times of famine. Wendigo ceremonies were often performed during times of famine to remind the people to be wary of the Wendigo spirits.

Through his study, he came into contact with the Danish People's Mind Collection, and was hired as an assistant in 1955. After taking a Master's Conference in 1960 using the thesis of The Production of Danish partisans between 1770 and 1821, and contemporary views on the genre, Piø was hired as an archivist at the Folklore Connection.
Piø became a Doctor of Philosophy with New Approaches to the Ballad in 1985 about his theory of many folk songs that were believed to be from the Middle Ages actually originated from the 1500s to the 1800s. In 1987, he received the Danish Writers Association Nonfiction Prize for his work in disseminating scientific research to a wider audience.

Sententiae, the nominative plural of the Latin word sententia, are brief moral sayings, such as proverbs, adages, aphorisms, maxims, or apophthegms taken from ancient or popular or other sources, often quoted without context. Sententia, the nominative singular, also called a "sentence", is a kind of rhetorical proof. Through the invocation of a proverb, quotation, or witty turn of phrase during a presentation or conversation one may be able to gain the assent of the listener, who will hear a kind of non-logical, but agreed-upon truth in what one is saying. An example of this is the phrase "age is better with wine" playing off of the adage "wine is better with age". The same saying is present in .
History
The use of sententiae has been explained by Aristotle (when he discusses the γνώμη gnomê, or sententious maxim, as a form of enthymeme), Quintilian, and other classical authorities.
Early modern English writers, heavily influenced by various humanist educational practices, such as harvesting commonplaces, were especially attracted to sententiae. The technique of sententious speech is exemplified by Polonius' famous speech to Laertes in Hamlet. Sometimes in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama the sententious lines appear at the end of scenes in rhymed couplets (for instance, John Webster's Duchess of Malfi). In some early modern dramatic texts and other writings, sententiae are often flagged by marginal notes or special marks.
The "first Roman book of literary character" was the Sententiae of Appius Claudius, which was composed upon a Greek model.
A similar literary genre recurred in 1150 within the Libri Quattuor Sententiarum (The Four Books of Sentences) of Peter Lombard, a book which was widely commented during the Middle Age, namely by Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Bonaventura.
There is a classical, Roman novel written by Publilius Syrus. The book is a series of proverbs written in Latin.

Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is a 1994 platform game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the first video game to feature Wario as both a playable character and the main character, as well as the first appearance of Captain Syrup and her Brown Sugar Pirates, recurring villains in the Wario Land series.
The game was then later released for the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console service via the Nintendo eShop on which it gained positive reviews from critics.
Gameplay
Wario Land features gameplay markedly different from the previous two games in the Super Mario Land series. The game takes place on a route through several themed areas, which are split into several courses culminating in a boss fight. Wario is able to jump on or bump into enemies to knock them over. Enemies thus stunned can be picked up and thrown at other enemies. When in his grown form, Wario is also able to perform a shoulder charge, which is used to attack enemies, break through blocks and open hidden treasure chests.
There are additionally three unique helmets that Wario can obtain, with their own abilities. The Bull Helmet increases Wario's strength and doubles the length of his shoulder charge attack, allowing him to smash through blocks more easily. It also gives Wario the abilities to stick onto ceilings and perform a "butt stomp" into the ground which stuns nearby enemies and breaks through blocks underneath him. The Jet Helmet increases Wario's running speed and lets him fly in purely horizontal directions in the air, as well as to shoulder charge underwater. Finally, the Dragon Helmet lets Wario shoot long-ranged bursts of flames both on land and underwater, which destroy enemies and blocks on contact. This attack replaces his shoulder charge so long as he wears the Dragon Helmet. Players can also collect a Starman to gain temporary invincibility. If Wario takes damage from an opponent or obstacle, he will shrink, losing his shoulder charge move, and will remain small until he collects a clove of garlic, a helmet, or reaches the end of the level. If Wario is hit while small, or is hit by an instant kill obstacle, such as pits or lava, he will lose a life and all the coins he had collected in that level.
Unlike the Mario series, in which coins are typically used to earn extra lives, coins in this game are instead used as currency. They can be earned by collecting them, finding them in blocks, or shoulder charging enemies. If Wario has acquired 10 or more coins in a level, he can pull out a 10-coin piece, which he can throw at enemies, and pick up again if desired. They can also be spent to open level exits, or activate checkpoints. Extra lives are earned by collecting heart points, which are earned by defeating enemies or collecting Hearts, with an extra life earned for every 100 points. At the end of each level, the player can choose to either gamble the coins they have collected in the level in a game of chance, or spend them to try and earn heart points.
Certain levels contain a locked treasure room, each of which contains a unique treasure. To acquire the treasure the player must find the key in the level, carry it to the treasure room (Wario cannot use helmet abilities or the shoulder charge while carrying the key), break open the treasure chest, take the treasure, and finish the level. Upon finishing the game, each treasure the player has acquired is traded in for a set amount of coins. Even the least valuable treasure is worth roughly as many coins as the player would normally acquire over the entire game. The game's ending varies according to how many total coins the player has.
Plot
After being ejected from Mario's castle in the previous game, Wario resolves to get his own castle, one even bigger and more impressive than Mario's. To fund this extravagant dream, he travels to Kitchen Island, where the Brown Sugar Pirates have hidden many treasures and coins, including a golden statue of Princess Peach, stolen from the Mushroom Kingdom. Wario intends to retrieve this statue and sell it back to Mario for the price of a castle. After exploring the island, stealing the pirates' treasures, and infiltrating their Syrup Castle, Wario confronts the leader of the pirates, a female buccaneer named Captain Syrup. She summons a genie to destroy Wario, but he defeats the genie and Syrup destroys the castle with a large bomb as she escapes. In doing so, the pirates' biggest treasure is revealed: the giant gold statue of Princess Peach. However, Mario appears in a helicopter, thanks Wario and takes the statue away in front of his eyes.
Still holding the genie's lamp, Wario summons the genie and wishes for a castle. The genie tells him that he requires money to grant his wish, and so Wario gives him all the coins the player has collected over the course of the game, plus trades in all the found treasures for more coins. Exactly how well the genie grants Wario's wish depends on the final amount of coins he is given: Wario can get (from best to worst outcome) a castle, a Chinese pagoda, a log cabin, a treehouse, or a tiny birdhouse. If the player collects all the treasures and has enough coins to reach the 99,999 limit, the genie will give Wario an entire planet with his face etched on its surface.
Release
Originally released for the Game Boy on January 21, 1994 in Japan and from March 13 to May 13 in North America and Europe, the game was later re-released on the Nintendo 3DS's eShop Virtual Console download service in Japan on December 14, 2011, Europe on February 16, 2012 and North America on July 26, 2012. The game can be downloaded along with its predecessors, Super Mario Land and Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins.
Reception
In the United States, it was the top-selling Game Boy game in March 1994 and April 1994. By 1997, units had been sold worldwide.
Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 13th best Game Boy game and called it the most successful spin-off from the Mario series. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Game Boy game for three months in 1994, from May to July.
GamePro named it the best Game Boy game at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, praising the new power-ups and the multiple endings. In their later review, they deemed the game "faster, more challenging, and more fun than its hand-held predecessors." They particularly commented that the backgrounds were not as cluttered as in the previous games, making the action easier to follow, that the music was less obtrusive, and that the sprites were better detailed. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a unanimous 7 out of 10, criticizing that the game is too easy but praising the new power-ups and strong graphics. Pocket Gamer awarded the Virtual Console re-release a 9 out of 10, insisting that "this is a Nintendo classic that you must play – especially if you never have before." Nintendo Life similarly awarded the game 9 out of 10, praising the game as being "some of the best platforming the Game Boy system has to offer."
Legacy
Wario Land, the sequel to Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, was designed to promote Wario to a starring role and expand the Mario universe. Wario Land spawned five popular sequels: Virtual Boy Wario Land, Wario Land II, Wario Land 3, Wario Land 4, and Wario Land: Shake It!. Other Wario titles have been released following the success of Wario Land, including Wario World, Wario: Master of Disguise, and the WarioWare Inc. series.
Several Mario spin-off titles have referenced the original Wario Land. In Mario's Super Picross, Bull Wario, Dragon Wario, and Small Wario appear in the background of the Wario stage selection screens. Subsequently, in Picross 2, Wario is depicted wearing his safari helmet that was introduced in this title. Similarly, Wario's Amiibo board map in Mario Party 10 features his safari helmet as a background element. And finally, in Mario Kart 7, Wario's bull transformation appears as a billboard on the Wario Shipyard racetrack. Additionally, the music track of this course is based on the main theme of Wario Land.

Northeastern Tasmanian is an aboriginal language family of Tasmania in the reconstruction of Claire Bowern.
Languages
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis suggests (at either p < 0.15 or p < 0.20) that three Northeastern Tasmanian languages are recorded in the 26 unmixed Tasmanian word lists (out of 35 lists known). According to Bowern's analysis, the Lhotsky and Backhouse/Walker lists, which do not record their provenance, together with the "Eastern" Jorgenson list, attest to a previously unidentified language in the northeastern family, as does the "Norman" list of Charles Sterling. The other lists attest to a single language, though the dialect of the Tamar River region (North Midlands tribe) is divergent, and Dixon & Crowley consider it to be a distinct language. There are thus tentatively up to four attested Northeastern Tasmanian languages:
Pyemmairre (Northeastern language)
Tyerrernotepanner (North Midland language)
Lhotsky/Blackhouse
"Norman"
These languages cannot be shown to be related to other Tasmanian languages based on existing evidence.
Two of the word lists reported to be from Oyster Bay (see Eastern Tasmanian languages) contain substantial Northeastern admixture, as the authors traveled along the coast collecting "Tasmanian" words, which Bowern believes to be responsible for several classifications linking the languages of the east coast. However, once that admixture is accounted for, the apparent links disappear.

Crown Central Petroleum, commonly known as Crown, is an American oil company that has flourished in Baltimore since the early 20th century until its recent decline due to rebranding.
History
Crown Central Petroleum Company or Crown, first began in 1917 in Harris County, Texas, when the New Crown Oil and Refining Company's Number 3 well struck oil.
In 2013 Clark Brands acquired the brand licensing business of Crown Central Petroleum.
An abandoned Crown gas station was used in the production of House Of Cards, a Netflix original series. The building, in Churchville, Maryland, is currently still standing, but it's underground gasoline tanks have since polluted the ground beneath it. This has, and is currently causing issues with the possibility of future redevelopment and residential well contamination. Crown has not addressed these issues, and the contamination is currently present to date.
Endangerment
During the summer of 2006, many stations began to disappear. All but about 20 stations were rebranded to either Texaco, Chevron Corporation, or Royal Dutch Shell gas stations. This is because the company sold these stations about two years ago, as reported in The Baltimore Sun.
As of the Spring of 2022 20 Crown stations operate in the state of Maryland. There are four Crowns branded stations operating in Baltimore, Maryland. All four stations utilized a standard self service canopy set up featuring a brick and tan stucco design. All four stations currently operate 24 hours a day. The stations can be found at 4201 Erdman Ave
, 5101 York Rd, 501 E 33rd St and 4123 Frederick Ave

Station Square is a indoor and outdoor shopping and entertainment complex located in the South Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States across the Monongahela River from the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. Station Square occupies the buildings and land formerly occupied by the historic Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Complex, including the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, which are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
With of retail space, it features nearly 60 stores, restaurants and entertainment venues, including Highmark Stadium and the 396-room Sheraton at Station Square. As one of Pittsburgh's largest tourist destinations, it attracts more than three million people annually, including many Pittsburgh natives. The retail development was built at the location of a former station on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, with many of the original structures such as the freight house building and the concourse being converted into restaurants and a shopping mall. Proximity to a stop on the Port Authority of Allegheny County 'T' Pittsburgh Light Rail system and the dock for the Gateway Clipper Fleet of local river cruise boats makes Station Square a major parking and jumping-off point for activities and events around the city. The property is operated by Brookfield Asset Management.
In 1979, the Station Square complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the "Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Complex."
History
Station Square was conceptualized by Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr., one of the founding national leaders of historic preservation in the United States and President of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, or Landmarks. Landmarks developed the site in 1976 as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.
Aided by an initial gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper Fleet and parking areas. Now, shops, offices, restaurants and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square to Forest City Realty Trust which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people — teachers, students, adults, and visitors — to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.

Ellen Emerson White is an American author who has written a number of young adult fiction novels.
Writing
Ms. White's first book, Friends for Life (1983) was published while she was a senior at Tufts University. Ms. White grew up in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Many of her fiction novels feature characters who reside in Boston or are from Boston and are fans of the Boston Red Sox (as Ms. White is). White now resides in New York City.
In addition to her fiction novels, Ms. White has written both sports biographies and historical fiction/biography books. She wrote four stories about the Echo Company in the midst of the Vietnam War under the pseudonym Zack Emerson. White got the name Zack from the name of her shepherd dog. She has also written the Santa Paws series under the pseudonym Nicolas Edwards.
The young adult characters in Ms. White's novels are realistic people who struggle with very difficult lives—whether those lives include war, murder, kidnapping, or some other trouble. The focus of all of her books is on overcoming the difficulties and surviving as a better person. None of her characters' live what could be classified an "ordinary" life, but all are relatable to an "ordinary" person.
Elements of White's stories are connected within her works. For example, the character Trudy (President's Daughter series) is from Brighton, the section of Boston where Molly and Patrick (Where Have All the Flowers Gone?) live. Perhaps the most intricate cross-work involvement occurs with the character Susan McAllister/Dowd. In the final book of the President's Daughter series, Meg's JA at Williams College is Susan, whose 'life'is chronicled in Friends For Life, and Life Without Friends. Another example of these connections is the character of nurse Rebecca Phillips from The Echo Company series, who was romantically connected to an army grunt named Michael Jennings. Rebecca's future is hinted at in both "All Emergencies, Ring Super" and the Santa Paws series when a "Dr. Jennings" is mentioned. In addition, most of White's main characters are animal lovers, as is White.

Moexipril an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Moexipril can be administered alone or with other antihypertensives or diuretics.
It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1995. Moexipril is available from Schwarz Pharma under the trade name Univasc.
Side effects
Moexipril is generally well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension.
Hypotension, dizziness, increased cough, diarrhea, flu syndrome, fatigue, and flushing have been found to affect less than 6% of patients who were prescribed moexipril.
Mechanism of action
As an ACE inhibitor, moexipril causes a decrease in ACE. This blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Blockage of angiotensin II limits hypertension within the vasculature. Additionally, moexipril has been found to possess cardioprotective properties. Rats given moexipril one week prior to induction of myocardial infarction, displayed decreased infarct size. The cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are mediated through a combination of angiotensin II inhibition and bradykinin proliferation. Increased levels of bradykinin stimulate in the production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, which cause vasodilation and continue to exert antiproliferative effects. Inhibition of angiotensin II by moexipril decreases remodeling effects on the cardiovascular system. Indirectly, angiotensin II stimulates of the production of endothelin 1 and 3 (ET1, ET3) and the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), all of which have tissue proliferative effects that are blocked by the actions of moexipril. The antiproliferative effects of moexipril have also been demonstrated by in vitro studies where moexipril inhibits the estrogen-stimulated growth of neonatal cardiac fibroblasts in rats. Other ACE inhibitors have also been found to produce these actions, as well.
Pharmacology
Moexipril is available as a prodrug moexipril hydrochloride, and is metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active compound moexiprilat. Formation of moexiprilat is caused by hydrolysis of an ethyl ester group. Moexipril is incompletely absorbed after oral administration, and its bioavailability is low. The long pharmacokinetic half-life and persistent ACE inhibition of moexipril allows once-daily administration.
Moexipril is highly lipophilic, and is in the same hydrophobic range as quinapril, benazepril, and ramipril. Lipophilic ACE inhibitors are able to penetrate membranes more readily, thus tissue ACE may be a target in addition to plasma ACE. A significant reduction in tissue ACE (lung, myocardium, aorta, and kidney) activity has been shown after moexipril use.
It has additional PDE4-inhibiting effects.
Synthesis
The synthesis of the all-important dipeptide-like side chain involves alkylation of the tert-butyl ester of L-alanine (2) with ethyl 2-bromo-4-phenylbutanoate (1); the presominane of the desired isomer is attributable to asymmetric induction from the adjacent chiral center. Reaction of the product with hydrogen chloride then cleaves the tert-butyl group to give the half acid (3). Coupling of that acid to the secondary amine on tetrahydroisoquinoline (4) gives the corresponding amine. The tert-butyl ester in this product is again cleaved with hydrogen chloride to afford moexipril (5).

Frank Kerby Fergusson (February 28, 1874 – June 17, 1937) was a United States Army officer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served in World War I and received the Distinguished Service Medal.
Biography
Fergusson was born on February 28, 1874, in Riddleton, Tennessee. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1896 and was commissioned into the Third Artillery.
In his early military career, Fergusson was stationed at several locations, including Fort Monroe, Fort Canby, Battery K, First Artillery, Camp Wickoff, Fort Sam Houston, Galveston, Texas, Fort McIntosh, and Fort Brown. Fergusson commanded the latter fort between February and August 1901 as a first lieutenant. After his promotion to captain on August 1, 1901, until November 20, 1902, he commanded the 111th Company of the Coast Artillery at Fort Dade, Florida. After commanding the 73rd Company at Fort Monroe, he attended the School of Submarine Defense at Fort Totten between August 1905 and July 1906, when he graduated. He commanded an army mine planter, the Armistead, and from December 1908 to April 1909 he transported four mine planters from Fort Monroe to San Francisco, traveling around Cape Horn. In San Francisco, Fergusson served for sixteen months as a coast defense officer as well as an aide to Thomas Henry Barry.
Fergusson attended the United States Army War College between 1911 and 1912, and after graduating, he served as the adjutant general at a camp at Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. After serving on the Ordnance Board from 1912 to 1914, Fergusson went to the Philippines, remaining there until December 1916. He traveled to France in August 1917 with the Eight Coast Artillery because of World War I, though the United States Department of War ordered his return to Fort Monroe in February 1918 in order to command the Artillery Training Center, for which he won the Distinguished Service Medal. Fergusson was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on August 8, 1918, and he assumed command over the Coast Artillery School and several other military installations on the same day. After this, he served as the Coast Artillery district commander in San Francisco, and he went to Washington, D.C., to the General Staff College in August 1919.
After serving at Fort DuPont, Fergusson became Chief of Staff of the Third Corps Area in Baltimore, and he subsequently went to the Philippines from March 1922 to September 1924 and served as the Chief of Staff of the Philippine Division. After returning to the U.S., he assumed command over the 11th Coast Artillery as well as the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. He then served at the Panama Canal Zone and later became the chief of staff of the Organized Reserve Second Corps Area. Lastly, he commanded the Harbor Defenses of Eastern New York, the 62nd Coast Artillery (AA), and the Eighth Corps District. He died on July 17, 1937.

Rajo Motor and Manufacturing was a manufacturing company based in Racine, Wisconsin in the twentieth century. The company built performance enhancing cylinder heads for Model T cars that were designed by Joe Jagersberger (Rajo Joe). The company was named by combining the "RA" from Racine and the "JO" from Joe Jagersberger's first name. The heads were sold around the world. The company's Los Angeles salesman Rajo Jack helped popularize the heads.
History
In 1911 Joe Jagersberger retired from driving after he had one of his legs amputated. Jagersberger continued to work for J.I. Case, as he had before the crash, until he decided to go out on his own. The company was formed in 1914 as Rajo Manufacturing. Jagersberger restructured the company in October 1919 after he designed a head with double the performance of the stock Model T head.
Models
Rajo Motor started out building spark plugs and other various engine parts. Jagersberger began manufacturing heads for The first design was the Model 30 which had 4 exhaust ports and one intake port all on the right side of the head. The Model 31 had two intakes on the right and four exhaust on the left. The Model 35C, first known as the "Improved Rajo Valve-in-Head" and later as the Model C had two intakes and three exhausts on the right. The Model A used the stock intake ports on the block. It had two exhaust ports on the right. His Model B two intakes on the right and four exhausts on the left. It came in three versions. The BB featured a higher compression ratio and the BB-R also included two spark plugs per cylinder.
Chevrolet work
He also offered a modification to the 1941-52 Chevrolet "Stovebolt" L6 OHV 15 bolt head, which added another set of 3 intake ports above the 3 originals, to permit adding (an) extra carburetor(s) on a separate manifold.
Jagersberger died in 1952. The company closed in 1980.

Boardman's Drainage Windmill is located at How Hill in the English county of Norfolk It is on the east bank of the River Ant close to the large Edwardian building houses the Norfolk Broads Study Centre. The Drainage mill is west of the village of Ludham. The structure is a grade II* listed building.
Description
Boardman's Drainage Windmill is of an interesting design being constructed from an open framed timber trestle method. The mill has a miniature cap, sails and fantail similar to the traditional tower drainage mills which can be seen on other parts of the Norfolk Broads. The windmill was restored by the Norfolk Windmills Trust in partnership with the Broads Authority. Just to the north of this windmill on the same side of the river Ant is another small interesting drainage windmill called Clayrack Drainage Mill.
History
Boardman's drainage windmill was built in 1897 by a local millwright Daniel England of Ludham. Trestle mills or Skeleton mills as they are sometimes described, were a later and less expensive alternative to a brick built windmill. As a result of their mainly timber construction very few have survived the ravages of the weather and of time. Boardman's mill is one of only three Trestle mills left on the Broads. The others being at Horning (OS Map Ref: TG344175) and at St Olaves (OS Map Ref: TM459995). The mill was originally fitted with a scoopwheel but this was later replaced with a turbine pump. Boardman's mill stopped pumping in 1938 when it was blown over in a Gale.

The Blum Store was a women's specialty store on the corner of 13th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with three branch locations in the Philadelphia suburbs. The store was comparable in quality, style, and reputation to larger chains Bonwit Teller and Lord & Taylor and was one of the premier chains headquartered in Philadelphia, selling women's clothing and accessories and children's clothing.
History
The store was founded as Blum Brothers Dry Goods in the late 19th century, The company and the Blum name was acquired by Maurice Spector in 1920. Spector's gift for merchandising expanded the store's clientele, and the firm soon opened branch locations in Bala Cynwyd and Exton, Pennsylvania, and Moorestown, New Jersey. Spector died in 1959, and in 1975, Julio Tanjeloff, an Argentine investor and owner of George Jensen and Rosenthal Studios in Philadelphia, acquired the business, leading to the closure of a branch and concerns for the continuing viability of the chain. According to a story in The New York Times at the time of the purchase, Tanjeloff planned to liquidate the stores' inventory and then reopen them with new personnel.
The first Blum Store in Philadelphia opened in 1920, the year Spector purchased the business from Blum. Its ten-story flagship fashion building on the northwest corner of 13th & Chestnut Streets opened its doors in 1928. In 1957, Blum's opened a 40,000-square-foot Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, branch. In 1966, The Blum Store was acquired by Weiss Bros. Stores; Weiss also operated several other chains around the country including Gus Meyer stores in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1971, Blum's opened a branch in the former C.A. Rowell store at the Moorestown, New Jersey, Mall. A smaller fourth store in Exton, Pennsylvania, was open only briefly before Blum's fortunes spiraled downwards. Changing times were hard on the chain; the number of new debutantes had diminished, shopping malls had sprouted, and denim had replaced tweed. Several ownership changes also had taken their toll on the health of the business. In December 1975, all of the store's branches closed. Plans to revive the brand were discussed but did not materialize. By the next summer, Blum's sold only a small amount of clothes, crystal, and glassware and housed the Jean Madeleine Beauty Salon; then the store's employees' paychecks bounced and owners of the beauty salon were forced to pay the building's overdue utility bills. By the end of the summer of 1976, The Blum Store--"the working girl's Neiman Marcus"—had joined a growing list of American department stores that had gone out of business.

SelectUSA is a summit held by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration to promote foreign direct investment to the United States, the only such U.S. effort at the federal level. Predecessor of SelectUSA, namely Invest in America, was founded in 2007, and renamed as its current title in 2011.
On March 7, 2007, Invest in America was established in the International Trade Administration to promote the United States as a destination for inward direct investment, also known as foreign direct investment. Invest in America is the primary U.S. Government mechanism to manage foreign direct investment promotion. Efforts are focused on outreach to foreign governments and investors, support for state governments' investment promotion efforts, and addressing business climate concerns by serving as ombudsman in Washington for the international investment community.
Invest in America reinforces the longstanding U.S. Open Investment Policy. Through Invest in America, the Department of Commerce promotes the U.S. economy as the best place in the world to do business.
Mission
According to to Invest in America website, Invest in America promotes and supports foreign direct investment in the United States, contributing to U.S. job creation, innovation, and competitiveness.
Activities
Policy: Invest in America endeavors to bolster the global competitiveness of the United States economy by addressing policy issues that concern foreign investors. In November 2007, Invest in America published a policy paper entitled, “Visas and Foreign Direct Investment.” In addition to raising awareness of this issue, Invest in America is now actively engaged with stakeholders to address specific challenges raised in this paper. In October 2008, Invest in America released its second policy paper on "U.S. Litigation Environment and FDI."
Ombudsman: Invest in America serves as ombudsman in Washington, D.C. for the international investment community, working across the Federal Government to act as a voice to address investor concerns and issues involving Federal agencies. Invest in America receives inquiries from potential and current foreign investors with regard to issues encountered within the Federal bureaucracy.
Promotion: Invest in America promotes investment in the United States by highlighting the advantages of investing in the United States, and countering the misconceptions some investors may have. Invest in America meets regularly with both domestic and international stakeholders and organizes events such as "Invest in America Week." The Department of Commerce's global network provides the platform to educate international investors on the advantages that come with investing in the United States. According to to Invest in America website, Invest in America welcomes all inquiries and is equipped to serve as a foreign investor's first point of contact for an investment in the United States.
State Cooperation: Invest in America serves a federal complement to existing U.S. state efforts. Invest in America complements state efforts, but remains neutral in any competition between them. Invest in America promotes the United States, not specific states, as the premier site for foreign direct investment. Invest in America can provide all potential investors an investment contact list encompassing all fifty States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

The Devastatio Constantinopolitana (Devastation of Constantinople) is a short anonymous Latin eyewitness account of the Fourth Crusade. It covers the period from the preaching of Peter of Capua in France in 1198 until 16 May 1204, shortly after the sack of Constantinople.
The Devastatio's coverage is detailed and its perspective unique. It portrays the Fourth Crusade as a series of un-Christian betrayals by the rich of the poor. Modern historians have used it more for its factual detail than for its perspective.
Manuscript
The Devastatio survives in a single parchment manuscript bound as a codex, Cod. Marc. Lat. 1990 in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana in Venice. It takes up a mere five pages (folios 253r–255r). The same manuscript also contains Ekkehard of Aura's Universal Chronicle; the Annals of Würzburg, which is a continuation of the Chronicle; and a brief account of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. The manuscript was completed in the late 13th or early 14th century by two different copyists, one adding Ekkehard and the Annals and the other the Devastatio and the Lateran account.
The Devastatio is unrelated to the Chronicle and the Annals. Its title appears prominently at the beginning and a third person later wrote in the top margin Coronica captionis Constantinopolitanae (Chronicle of the Capture of Constantinople). The account of the Lateran council—which is found in four other manuscripts—is appended to the Devastatio without title or comment. Although they are not by the same author, the copyist probably intended them to be read together, with the council as a happy epilogue to the unfortunate crusade. The Lateran account in Cod. Marc. Lat. 1990 was almost certainly copied from a manuscript of Burchard of Ursperg's Chronicle.
Authorship
The author of the Devastatio is not named in the sole surviving copy of the work and he does not refer to himself in the work. His identity, or aspects of it, must be inferred from the text. There is no scholarly consensus. Most scholars accept that he was from the Holy Roman Empire and probably a German speaker from the Rhineland, although Jules Tessier argues that he was more probably an Italian from Lombardy and Cynthia Arthur that he was more probably a Francophone from the County of Hainaut. As to his occupation, it has been argued both that he was a layman and that he was a secular cleric. Mauriciu Kandel believed he was a cleric who functioned as everything from a warrior to diarist to secretary. Arthur believed he was a lay notary.
There is also no agreement on which contingent of the crusade the author accompanied. While Michael McCormick, Carl Klimke and Tessier make him a partisan of Marquis Boniface I of Montferrat, Kandel places him in the following of Count Baldwin IX of Flanders and Arthur in that of Henry of Hainaut. Andrea rejects all these theories.
The date of composition is unknown, but a reference to the pontificate of Pope Innocent III suggests that it was in the past, meaning that the Devastatio was only finalized after Innocent's death on 16 July 1216. It has been proposed that the author relied for some of his information on the letters sent by Baldwin of Flanders to Pope Innocent after he became emperor, but this is not conclusive.
Content
The author probably relied mostly on notes he had kept while on crusade. The final work, however, is a coherent and well-crafted history, not a diary. Tessier and Kandel took it to be an official work, but this is not widely accepted. To Andrea, there is no evidence that the author was close to any of the crusade leaders or their private councils.
The Devastatio has been compared to a single-entry account book. The author pays special attention to numbers such as prices and payments and also keeps track of the size of the army by counting fatalities, casualties, leaves and desertions. The number of ships in the Venetian fleet and the number of siege engines is also tracked. These statistics are generally accurate, especially when based on first-hand observation, but they are occasionally infected by "camp rumour".
The author also shows great interest in contracts, oaths, pledges and treaties, a series of eight of which structures the entire narrative. The first contracts are the crusading vows and the pledges made by surrogates to go in place of those crusaders who died before setting out. The compact made by the cities of Lombardy to hurry the armed contingents on their way to the rendezvous in Venice is presented as the first counter-crusade action. The next major contracts are the oath of allegiance taken by the barons to Boniface (who is referred to throughout simply as the Marquis) and the agreement with Venice, which results in the Siege of Zara. At Zara, the crusaders enter into a new agreement with Alexios Angelos to place him on the throne of the Byzantine Empire. In response to this diversion, some dissenting crusaders enter a counter-compact to go directly to the Holy Land. As the crusader army and Venetian fleet make their way to Constantinople, the Greeks they pass along the way pledge their allegiance to Alexios. After the capture of Constantinople, Alexios makes pledges and gives surety to the army in exchange for its continued support as he establishes his rule. Next, the new emperor contracts a portion of the army to help him pursue the deposed emperor Alexios III. All of Greece is said to have paid homage to the new emperor, but he reneged on his pledge and did not pay the crusaders for their aid. The army and its patron fall out, the latter is deposed and killed and the crusaders sack the city. The final contracts occur when the Greeks surrender to Boniface while the crusader army elects Baldwin as the new emperor.
The Devastatio contains two errors of dating. It mistakenly dates Peter of Capua's preaching tour to 1202, probably because the author as a German was not directly familiar with events in France. It also places the assault on the harbour wall of Constantinople correctly on 9 April 1204, but incorrectly states that this was during Holy Week. This error may indicate that the writer was writing long after events.
The Devastatio is devoid of references to the supernatural. Neither does it reference the East–West schism between the churches. Thematically, however, the account is inspired by . The anonymous author identifies with the rank-and-file, the "poor in the eyes of the world". His attitude has often been labelled anti-Venetian, but it might be better labelled anti-elite. The material success of the barons and Venetians is contrasted with the plight of the poor crusaders. The Devastatio ends abruptly after noting the payments received by the commoners from the booty taken in Constantinople: "five marks to each foot soldier".

Flight 13 is an adventure published by Steve Jackson Games in 1989 for either the horror role-playing game GURPS Horror or the science fiction role-playing game GURPS Space.
Plot summary
Flight 13 has a Fifties-style B movie setting where alien mad scientists kidnap a group of humans and subject them to a series of scientific tests in an amusement park arcade. It can be played using the rules for either GURPS Horror or GURPS Space.
Publication history
Flight 13 was written by W.G. Armintrout, with a cover by Guy Burchak, and illustrations by Charlie Wiedman, and was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1989 as a 64-page softcover book.
Reception
In the October 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue #150), Ken Rolston thought the adventure was hard to characterize, calling it "1950s Television/Movie Science-Fiction Action-Adventure [...] And freed of such fetters as realism and real-life logic, it looks like a lot of fun." He liked the well-organized material, commenting, "The presentation and adventure staging is sharp and appealing, going for depth of characterization and episode rather than epic scope." He also liked the unexpected plot twists, saying, "all the stuff that happens is tricky and unexpected." He did have some issues with the wacky tone, pointing out "The one problem I can see is fitting this into an ongoing campaign. The tone and texture of the setting are not likely to match a standard SF action-adventure campaign." But he concluded on a positive note: "Flight 13 is full of fun, is well-presented, and is an admirable model for introducing PCs to a scenario through role-playing and interaction with NPCs. It is strongly recommended, though it is a bit eccentric by contrast with other GURPS science-fiction supplements."
In the June 1989 edition of Games International (Issue #6), James Wallis was ambivalent about this adventure, saying, "While the concept is good and the adventure well constructed, the ending is disappointing for both player and referee."

Moni Naor () is an Israeli computer scientist, currently a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Naor received his Ph.D. in 1989 at the University of California, Berkeley. His advisor was Manuel Blum.
He works in various fields of computer science, mainly the foundations of cryptography. He is notable for initiating research on public key systems secure against chosen ciphertext attack and creating non-malleable cryptography, visual cryptography (with Adi Shamir), and suggesting various methods for verifying that users of a computer system are human (leading to the notion of CAPTCHA). His research on Small-bias sample space, give a general framework for combining small k-wise independent spaces with small -biased spaces to obtain -almost k-wise independent spaces of small size. In 1994 he was the first, with Amos Fiat, to formally study the problem of practical broadcast encryption. Along with Benny Chor, Amos Fiat, and Benny Pinkas, he made a contribution to the development of Traitor tracing, a copyright infringement detection system which works by tracing the source of leaked files rather than by direct copy protection.

United Nations Security Council resolution 672, adopted unanimously on 12 October 1990, after reaffirming resolutions 476 (1980), 478 (1980), the Council expressed alarm at the 1990 Temple Mount riots in Jerusalem on 8 October 1990, resulting in the death of over 20 Palestinians and the injury of more than 150 people, including Palestinian civilians and worshippers.
The Council went on to condemn the actions of the Israeli security forces, calling on Israel to abide by its legal obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Resolution 672 also authorised a mission to be sent to the region to investigate the incident, reporting back by the end of October 1990.
Israel rejected the resolution, saying it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall.

He turned down a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers of MLB. He accepted a football scholarship from Ball State University, so the school could sign more baseball players. He lettered in baseball and football, receiving all-league honors in both sports.
As a football player, he played at running back and wide receiver. As a senior, he only played in 3 games after suffering a severe ankle sprain. He set the school career record for rushing yards per attempt: 7.6 yards (on 161 career carries). In baseball, he was a two-time All-Indiana Collegiate Conference selection. He set the school career home run record.
In 1976, he was inducted into the Ball State Athletics Hall of Fame.
Professional career
Rettenmund was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 19th round (257th overall) of the 1965 NFL Draft. Unbeknownst to the Cowboys, he had signed a professional baseball contract with the Baltimore Orioles of MLB one day earlier on November 28.
In 1965, he was assigned to the Single-A Stockton Ports to finish out the year. In 1966, he played in the California League and received All-Star honors after hitting .307 with 21 home runs in 127 games.
In 1967, he hit .286, before suffering a separated shoulder late in the summer. He played in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during winter.
In 1968, he received the Minor League Player-of-the-Year award. He helped the Orioles win the 1969 and 1971 American League pennant, the 1970 World Series (including hitting a home run in the deciding Game 5 over the Cincinnati Reds) and the 1973 AL Eastern Division, the Reds win the 1975 World Series and the Angels win the 1979 AL Western Division. He also served as hitting coach for the 1989 World Series champion Oakland Athletics, as well as the Athletics' 1990 A.L. pennant-winners, and the 1998 National League champion San Diego Padres.
He finished 19th in voting for the 1971 American League Most Valuable Player Award after compiling a .318 batting average (which was third-best in the American League), with 11 home runs, 75 runs batted in, and 81 runs scored.
After the trade of Frank Robinson to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early December 1971, Rettenmund began the 1972 season as the Orioles' starting right fielder. By 1973, he was out of the starting lineup due to injuries, prolonged batting slumps and the emergence of Al Bumbry and Rich Coggins. Rettenmund, along with Junior Kennedy and Bill Wood, was sent to the Cincinnati Reds for Ross Grimsley and Wally Williams on December 4, 1973.
In 13 seasons, he played in 1,023 games and finished with a .271 batting average, 66 home runs and 329 runs batted in. He recorded a .985 fielding percentage while playing all three outfield positions.
After his major league playing career, Rettenmund served as hitting coach for the Texas Rangers (1983–85), the Athletics (1989–90), the Padres (1991–99), the Atlanta Braves (2000–01), and the Detroit Tigers (2002).
After three years out of the majors, Rettenmund returned as hitting coach of the Padres in June, 2006, replacing Dave Magadan. However, he was replaced on July 31, 2007 by Wally Joyner

Obukhovsky (; masculine) or Obukhovskaya (; feminine) is a Russian last name.
There are two theories regarding the origins of this last name. According to the first one, it is simply a variety of the last name Obukhov, which is derived from the nickname "" (Obukh). However, it is more likely that this last name was first given to one of the natives of a rural locality of Obukhovo.

Women's suffrage in Japan can trace its beginnings back to democratization brought about by the Meiji Restoration, with the suffrage movement rising to prominence during the Taisho period. The prohibition of women from political meetings had been abolished in 1922 after demands from women's organizations led by activists such as Hiratsuka Raichō and Ichikawa Fusae. The movement suffered heavy setbacks during and after the Great Depression, when support for democracy began to wane and military influence over civilians increased dramatically. The first election by universal suffrage without distinction of sex was held in 1946, but it was not until 1947, when the constitution for post-war Japan came into effect, that universal suffrage was established In Japan.
History
After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the concept of human rights and universal suffrage began to take hold in Japan. During the late 19th century, the first proponents for women's rights advocated, not for political inclusion or voting rights, but for reforms in the patriarchal society oppressing women. Of prime importance to the early feminist movement was the call for women's education. Policymakers believed that this was imperative to the preservation of the state, as it would prepare girls to become effective wives and mothers capable of producing diligent, patriotic sons.
Although policymakers did not necessarily have the same motives as women's rights advocates in their call for women's education, the availability of education opened the door for further advancements for women in Japanese society. As the idea of women becoming skilled and prudent individuals, whether in the workforce or through education, this modern concept was soon accepted in addition to its interrelationship with excellent and pure motherhood. The end of the 19th century also saw the fight for protection of women from patriarchal cultural practices. Practices such as prostitution and polygamy had long subjected them to abuse, in particular sexually transmitted diseases.
Feminists began to oppose both the exclusive provision of civil rights for men and the exclusion of women from politics. Women in Japan were prohibited, by law, from joining political parties, expressing political views, and attending political meetings. By 1920, the fight for women's political inclusion was at the forefront of the suffrage movement and, in 1921, the Diet of Japan (parliament) overruled Article 5 of the Police Security Act by granting women the right to attend political meetings.
The ban on women's involvement in political parties was not altered, as many members of the Diet felt that it was selfish for women to forsake their families for government. Feminists were still determined to fight for political equality. The Women's Suffrage League was founded in 1924, the same year that the Japanese government enacted the Men's Suffrage Law, without extending the vote to women.
After women were granted the right to participate in political assemblies, there was a surge in numbers of women's interest groups. Alumni groups, Christian missionary groups, and other women's auxiliary groups began to sprout during the inter-war period. After a massive earthquake struck Tokyo in 1923, representatives from 43 of these organizations joined forces to become the Tokyo Federation of Women's Organizations (Tokyo Rengo Fujinkai). The federation was designed to serve as disaster relief to aid those affected by the earthquake; however, it went on to become one of the largest women's activist groups of the time.
To efficiently address the issues affecting women, the Tokyo Federation of Women's Organizations divided into five satellite groups: society, government, education, labor, and employment. The government sector was perhaps the most significant, as it spawned the League for the Realization of Women's Suffrage (Fujin Sanseiken Kakutoku Kisei Domei), later the Women's Suffrage League (Fusen Kakutoku Domei), which became the most influential and outspoken women's advocacy collective of the era. The government satellite issued a manifesto outlining the abuses Japanese women suffered and how they were to be corrected:
1) It is our responsibility to destroy customs which have existed in this country for the past twenty six hundred years and to construct a new Japan that promotes the natural rights of men and women;
2) As women have been attending public school with men for half a century since the beginning of the Meiji period and our opportunities in higher education have continued to expand, it is unjust to exclude women from international suffrage;
3) Political rights are necessary for the protection of nearly four million working women in this country;
4) Women who work in the household must be recognized before the law to realize their full human potential;
5) Without political rights we cannot achieve public recognition at either the national or local level of government;
6) It is both necessary and possible to bring together women of different religions and occupations in a movement for women's suffrage.Molony, Barbara. "Women's Rights, Feminism, and Suffrage in Japan, 1870-1925". The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 69, No. 4, Woman Suffrage: The View from the Pacific. (Nov. 2000), p. 657.
The League, as well as numerous other groups, continued to fight for social and political inclusion, as well as legal protection from the patriarchal traditions that continued in Japan. Women were finally granted the right to vote in 1947, after a US-drafted constitution came into effect and restored the influence of Japan's democratic system.
Key individuals
Shidzue Katō: (1897–2001) As a member of the Japanese Socialist Party, Shidzue Kato was the first woman elected to the Imperial Diet. She spent the majority of her life fighting for women's reproductive and political rights. She is noted for annulling her marriage and remarrying, an act that was extremely rare for women at the time.
Fusae Ichikawa: (1893–1981) Advocate for women's political rights. Ichikawa concentrated most of her efforts towards gaining women the right to participate in the voting process and in political parties. With Hiratsuka Raicho, she helped establish the New Woman Association. Her involvement extended to the Patriotic Press Association and the League for Women's Suffrage (Fusen Kakutoku Domei). Ichikawa traveled to the United States shortly after World War I and observed the advancements American women such as Alice Paul had made in the fight for equality and political rights. She returned to Japan, remained an outspoken voice for women's rights, and was elected to the Japan's House of Councillors in the 1950s.
Shigeri Yamataka: (1899-1977) Worked closely with Ichikawa in the Women's Suffrage League. After World War II, she was twice elected to the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet of Japan, and was a president of the National Federation of Regional Women's Organizations, Chifuren, until her death in 1977.
Hiratsuka Raichō: (1886–1971) Women's rights advocate who was key in the founding of the Shin Fujin Kyokai, or New Woman Association, in 1919. Hiratsuka was noted for her belief that achieving the rights of inclusion in all aspects of Japanese society would have to be secondary to unifying women as a class.
Political participation
In 1890, the first session of the Imperial Diet issues the Law on Assembly and Political Association (shukai oyobi seishaho), which is the first government issued decree banning women from joining political parties. In 1921, the Diet voted to overrule this decree allowing women to attend political meetings. With constraints prohibiting women from actively participating in politics, women's interest groups and other advocates continued to persevere for voting and inclusion rights. This was realized on December 15, 1945, when the election law was revised, allowing women over the age of twenty to vote in elections.
Literary activism
One of the most effective ways in which women were active in the suffrage movement was through literary outlets. During the interwar period, the number of educated women in Japan was at its highest. These women, many of whom were graduates of Japan's finest institutions of higher learning, began using their education as a weapon in the fight against oppression.
Literary serials such as Seito, Fujin Koron, and Shufu No Tomo were the most popular feminist magazines of the time. In addition to suffrage, they often tackled issues such as abortion, sexuality, politics, and independence. Such magazines sometimes included western literary works that were often deemed controversial to the largely conservative Japanese population.
Traditional roles
Tradition calls for Japanese women to serve as willing subordinates to men. One of the most popular sayings of the time was ryosai kenbo, which means "good wife, wise mother". This subservient role can be traced to the widely accepted and revered teachings of Hayashi Razan, who developed a Confucian school of thought that emphasized superiority and inferiority in certain relationships. According to this school of thought, the relationship between husband and wife relied upon a woman fully devoting herself to the needs and success of her husband. Hayashi Razan's teachings, although developed during the seventeenth century, were the basis of the Japanese social and cultural structure for centuries.
Workforce
Women traditionally were to focus all of their efforts to the maintenance and development of their households, and their work was limited to domestic and agricultural tasks. With the evolution of Japan as a growing industrialized nation and with the reformation of Japanese society, women became the majority in newly built factories that became necessary to support Japan's booming textile industry. Although these women were allowed to leave their homes and earn wages, they were still held captive by patriarchal constraints.
Many women in the workforce had been sent by their families to work in factories that would send their earnings back to their homes. They were provided room and board for the duration of their employment, but the conditions where they lived and worked were deplorable and resulted in widespread illness and disease. The conditions, their mediocre salaries, and their risk of developing life-threatening medical conditions were the driving force behind the suffrage movement's desire to improve the state of the workplace for women.
Due to theses insufferable and hazardous work conditions, women, especially textile workers, begun to join the Friendly Society (Yuaikai) later named the Japan Federation of Labor (Nihon Rōdō Sodomei or Sōdōmei), in order to combat the numerous inequalities. With long agonizing hours, constant sexual harassment, and insufficient wages, industrialized women workers of Japan suffered tremendously. Despite the patriarchal ideology categorizing women as "auxiliary members" and "secondary wage earners" of the friendly society, a multitude of women remained eager to fight for justifiable and fair wages.

The City of Lakewood is the home rule municipality that is the most populous municipality in Jefferson County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 155,984 at the 2020 U.S. Census making Lakewood the fifth most populous city in Colorado and the 167th most populous city in the United States. Lying immediately west of Denver, Lakewood is a principal city of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor.
History
The urban and suburban development of the community known as Lakewood was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and W.A.H. Loveland, who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland, the former president of the Colorado Central Railroad, retired to the new community of Lakewood after many years of living in Golden.
Until 1969, the area known as Lakewood had no municipal government, relying instead on several water districts, several fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. Lakewood was a community with policing provided by the Jefferson County Sheriff, several volunteer-staffed fire districts, and some neighborhoods without street lights or sidewalks. However, the community had already existed for about 80 years.
The City of Lakewood was incorporated in 1969 as Jefferson City. Soon after, an election was held and the city's name was changed to Lakewood, due to an overwhelming dislike of "Jefferson City" and the belief that it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At the time of incorporation, the city population was already over 90,000.
Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route joining Denver with the Rocky Mountains. As such, Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. In addition to the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, the small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange, by the 1950s grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots emerged there. Several multiple-business "shopping centers" developed followed by much larger centers at JCRS and Westland. The Villa Italia Mall on West Alameda Avenue, 20 blocks south of Colfax, reflected the southward expansion of the Lakewood settlement and housed a larger concentration of retail space. As the mall went into decline, the Lakewood City Council developed a plan to demolish the Villa Italia Mall and replace it with a new development called Belmar.
In 2011, Lakewood was named an All-America City for the first time.

G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ADRBK2 gene. GRK3 was initially called Beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (βARK-2), and is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase subfamily of the Ser/Thr protein kinases that is most highly similar to GRK2.
Function
G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate activated G protein-coupled receptors, which promotes the binding of an arrestin protein to the receptor. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor prevents receptor stimulation of heterotrimeric G protein transducer proteins, blocking their cellular signaling and resulting in receptor desensitization. Arrestin binding also directs receptors to specific cellular internalization pathways, removing the receptors from the cell surface and also preventing additional activation. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor also enables receptor signaling through arrestin partner proteins. Thus the GRK/arrestin system serves as a complex signaling switch for G protein-coupled receptors.
GRK3 and the closely related GRK2 phosphorylate receptors at sites that encourage arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization, internalization and trafficking rather than arrestin-mediated signaling (in contrast to GRK5 and GRK6, which have the opposite effect). This difference is one basis for pharmacological biased agonism (also called functional selectivity), where a drug binding to a receptor may bias that receptor's signaling toward a particular subset of the actions stimulated by that receptor.
GRK3 is expressed broadly in tissues, but generally at lower levels than the related GRK2. GRK3 has particularly high expression in olfactory neurons, and mice lacking the ADRBK2 gene exhibit defects in olfaction. Gene linkage techniques were used to identify a polymorphism in the promoter of the human ADRBK2 gene as a possible cause of up to 10% of cases of bipolar disorder. However, the significance of GRK3 in bipolar disorder has been controversial due to conflicting reports. GRK3 has also been implicated in regulation of dopamine receptors in Parkinson disease in animal models. Reduced expression of GRK3 has been associated with the immunodeficient WHIM syndrome in humans, and appears causative in a mouse model of the disease.

Night of the Demons is a 2009 American horror film and remake of the 1988 film of the same name. It was directed by Adam Gierasch, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jace Anderson, and stars Edward Furlong, Monica Keena, Bobbi Sue Luther, Shannon Elizabeth, Diora Baird, and Michael Copon.
Plot
The film opens in 1925, with scenes of gore and demons. Evangeline Broussard is in love with a man named Louis who is into black magic. At an evening gathering one night, Evangeline finds herself in a séance with demons who have been banished from Hell. If they get 7 human sacrifices, they can rise again and take over the human world. Rather than allow that to happen, Evangeline prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself—and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs. Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange.
Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela.
Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group returns, unable to find Suzanne, who is revealed to have passed out. Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Angela surmises that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard.
One of the skeletons bites Angela's hand, which causes her to feel woozy. Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced black magic in the hopes that she would attract the attention of Louis, only to have that magic go wrong. The only person found alive was the maid, who was found scribbling spells on her walls, having been driven insane by the night's events.
Angela slowly succumbs to the skeleton bite—and turns into a demon. She returns to the group, who partake in a game of spin the bottle. Angela infects Dex by kissing him. Lily angrily leads Dex into a nearby room, where the pair have sex. Dex transforms into a demon and infects Lily. Angela then attempts to seduce the others while Maddie, Jason and Colin leave to find another exit but can't. Angela successfully seduces Suzanne and then rips her breasts and face, turning her into a demon. Jason sees Lily pressing her lipstick into her breast, then voiding it out through her vagina. He warns the others who do not believe him until a demonic Suzanne attacks them. They decide to leave through the house's escape tunnel. On their way, they arm themselves with a gun and a metal bar. They discover the tunnel has caved in before being attacked by Lily and Dex. They manage to fend off the demons but Jason is injured. The survivors run upstairs and tend to Jason's injury. They realize that not only are they in the maid's room but that the symbols remained on the walls. They discover that the demons are attempting to take over seven human hosts to be freed upon the earth, having been thrown out of hell for trying to usurp Satan's rule. The demons had tricked Evangeline into hosting the party so they could take over the guests. The demons can't take over a dead body, which is why Evangeline hung herself. They also find out that the demons don't like rust, finding that they can use it as a weapon.
As the boys fall asleep, Angela taunts Maddie but is unable to enter the room due to the spells. The walls begin pouring with blood, washing off the spells. The trio attempt to re-draw the spells but are lured out of the room when the demons fake daylight in the windows. The demons attack them. Maddie and Colin rush back to the room, while Jason is caught and disemboweled by Angela turning him into a demon.
As they plan to wait in the room until sunrise, Colin falls through the rotten floorboards, falling many floors into the basement. Maddie climbs down a rope into the basement to help him, but he is now a demon. Maddie manages to get back to the maid's room and fights the demons. She makes her way to the balcony, where she ties a rope around her neck and jumps over, seemingly hanging herself. As the sun rises, the demons are killed. Maddie reveals that she only pretended to hang herself, having tied the rope around her waist and the demons merely assumed that she was dead. Maddie is then able to exit through the gates to her freedom.

Release
The film originally premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival in August 2009, with plans to release it in October of the same year; however, later news reports stated that the film would be pushed back for a tentative release date for September 23, 2010.
In June 2010, it was announced that Night of the Demons would be released straight-to-DVD and Blu-ray on October 19, 2010 as opposed to a theatrical release. The film was released in 2010, containing extras such as an audio commentary with the film crew, a documentary about the making of the film, and a Comic-Con appearance.
Reception
Critical reception has been mostly negative, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rating the film at 35% "rotten" based upon 17 reviews.
Dread Central gave a mixed review for the remake and gave it 3 blades out of 5, saying, "It's brash, loud and sexy but a few too obvious flaws unfortunately knock the film down a peg. In the end it's still a fun ride...and certainly worth a watch on an evening when you'd rather disengage the brain and sink a few drinks than deal with anything more cerebral." Fright Fest director and founder stated that the audience response in general was noted to be positive for the film. The film was a box office bomb, grossing $64,000 against a $10 million budget.
Sequel
In June 2013, Tenney announced that plans were underway to create a sequel to the 2009 film, entitled "After Party." Gierasch is not returning as director, and Anthony Hickox would instead be directing the film. A Kickstarter campaign was launched with a goal of $250,000 but was unsuccessful.
The projected plot for After Party was to center on the character of Diana, one of Angela's former friends and associates, who would hold a party in the same mansion and become possessed by the now-demonic Angela.

Episodes
Production
In March 2016, the pilot was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, as was the rest of the series, primarily at Cinespace Film Studios' Kipling Avenue facility.
When the pilot was being cast, the main character's name was reported as "Carter Morrison". The character was renamed "Hayes Morrison" before the pilot was filmed.
Daniel di Tomasso, who was originally cast as Hayes' brother, was dropped after the pilot was filmed for creative reasons. Daniel Franzese was recast as his replacement starting with the pilot.

The site's critical consensus reads: "While Hayley Atwell proves a strong and likable lead, her charisma alone cannot elevate Conviction from its worn and familiar trappings."

The Reform Party (abbreviation: RP) is a political party in Singapore founded on 3 July 2008.
The Reform Party is a liberal-democratic party. According to the party's constitution, it seeks to promote "political, social and economic reform; the restoration of full human rights; a fairer and just distribution of wealth with the elimination of poverty; an independently appointed judiciary and a fully elected and sovereign parliament". Its stated philosophy is "That every member of the society is born with fundamental rights which cannot be abrogated... and that it is the paramount duty of the society to promote the human dignity of its every single member."
It was founded by opposition veteran and lawyer J.B. Jeyaretnam (formerly known as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam), notable as the former Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore and the first opposition candidate in post-independence Singapore, on 3 July 2008. Around three months after the party's foundation, founder Jeyaretnam died on 30 September, and the leadership has since taken over by his son, Kenneth Jeyaretnam.
History
The Reform Party was founded by lawyer and veteran politician J.B. Jeyaretnam, notable as the first opposition candidate to be elected Member of Parliament under the Workers' Party of Singapore banner after a period of about 16 years when not a single opposition candidate in Singapore won a seat, as well as the secretary-general of the Workers' Party from 1971 to 2001.
At the time, Jeyaretnam (then a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament) was sued by then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong over defamation at the total damages amounting S$565,000 including court costs of S$270,000, and was declared bankrupt (which also barred the right from standing in elections) after failing to follow up his payment. He subsequently resigned from his leadership post and party later, citing that the party (notably then-Secretary General Low Thia Khiang) did not receive due support to help him repay his payments. Since his resignation, Jeyaretnam authored the books Make it Right for Singapore and The Hatchet Man of Singapore and was often seen promoting his books outside Centrepoint, a shopping centre on Orchard Road. In May 2007, Jeyaretnam was discharged from bankrupt and eventually reinstated in the bar later September, in which he would go on to register and form Reform Party on 3 July 2008, where he became the pro-tem Secretary-General.
On 30 September, around three months after founding, Jeyaretnam died following a heart attack, and over a thousand people attended his funeral. J.B. Jeyaretnam's son, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, who at the time resided with his British family in the United Kingdom and had previously never participated in politics directly, took over as secretary-general in April 2009.
On 8 May 2010, the party announced its six candidates well in advance of the upcoming General Election, which also include Kenneth. However, several members who also joined the party resigned to join other parties, such as Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss, Tony Tan Lay Thiam and his wife Hazel Poa, Nicole Seah, James Teo, J. Sivalingam; Justin Ong, Samantha De Silva, Gan Theng Wei and Tan Tee Seng. Earlier on, the party was initially invited by the Singapore Democratic Alliance (a collation formed by then-opposition MP Chiam See Tong of the Singapore People's Party, along with Justice Party and Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura), but the CEC members of the alliance denied their request.
The party fielded two teams to contest in West Coast GRC and Ang Mo Kio GRC, which were respectively led by then-Minister of Trade & Industry Lim Hng Kiang and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, both by People's Action Party (PAP). In his first campaign speech on late April 2011, Kenneth said that competition in politics would lead to better and more intelligent policies for Singapore. He also noted that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) would likely open the floodgates to more foreigners to enter Singapore again once they formed the next government.
However, their electoral debut was unable to bear fruit, as both contests were lost to the PAP with a combined vote share of under 35% from the two constituencies that it contested. Some members subsequently left the party afterwards.
Their subsequent contests for the 2013 by-election and 2015 general elections neither see improvement in the party, as the party lost contests to the WP and PAP, respectively, by large margins.
In 2018, they were among the seven other opposition parties (the other were People's Power Party, Singaporeans First, Singapore Democratic Party, Democratic Progressive Party, National Solidarity Party, and People's Voice Party, the latter formed by former NSP chief Lim Tean) present in a meeting led by former PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock, in their discussion of a possibility of forming a collation for the next election.
On 5 August 2020, chairman Andy Zhu and treasurer Noraini Yunus were removed by Jeyaretnam from the CEC with, CEC member Charles Yeo and deputy treasurer Mahaboob Batcha, taking their places as chairman and treasurer respectively. Several members left the party and followed Zhu and Noraini to form the Singapore United Party.
Objectives
The slogan on the Reform Party's website states "Transparency, Accountability and Inclusion: A democratic Singapore for Singaporeans." In the 2015 elections, the party slogan was "A Brighter Future Tomorrow, Today".
The main objectives of the party stated in its constitution are: to maintain and promote an independently appointed judiciary and a fully elected and sovereign parliament; to ensure that every member of society is entitled to political, social and economic rights; and to eliminate poverty by enforcing a fairer and just distribution of wealth.
In its National Day Message 2015 published on 9 August 2015, the party stated, "We need to secure for Singaporeans a fairer distribution of the national wealth by redistributing some of the massive wealth hoarded by the PAP Government." It proposed to do this "without adopting a high tax regime which might damage Singapore's competitiveness", given the healthy state of Singapore's national finances.
On nomination day for the 2015 General Elections (1 September), the party proposed a S$500.00 monthly allowance to Singaporean citizens aged 65 years and above.
Organisation
The Reform Party is unique among Singaporean political parties, both government and opposition, in that its party structure does not follow a cadre based system of political organisation. The party constitution states that the Party Conference is the supreme governing authority. The first full Conference was in 2012, where the pro-tem CEC were ratified.

Electoral performance
General Election 2011
In their inaugural election, they party garnered only 31.8% of the votes contested in Ang Mo Kio and West Coast GRCs. Their overall popular vote was 4.3%.
By-election 2013
A by-election in Punggol East Single Member Constituency was held on 26 January 2013 after the resignation of former parliamentary speaker Michael Palmer on 12 December 2012. Secretary-general Kenneth participated in the by-election, but was defeated to WP's Lee Li Lian in a rare four-cornered contest. Additionally, due to a vote split towards the major parties, Kenneth had forfeited his S$14,500 election deposit as he garnered only 1.2% of the valid votes cast (per electoral rules, the threshold of retaining the deposit is 12.5%, or one-eighth, of the valid votes cast for the constituency).
2015 general election
Their second general election (and third overall) also fielded 11 candidates contested in three contested constituencies, with the addition of Radin Mas SMC, a ward part of the Jeyaretnam's former Anson constituency, and the two previously contested GRCs, Ang Mo Kio and West Coast. The election also marked the debut of activists Roy Ngerng and M Ravi. In their nomination speech for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Ravi's speech was made semi-viral after he accidentally chanted out PAP before quickly correcting to RP while persuading the voters to vote for their party. On 7 September, they subsequently released their manifesto.
On 11 September, their electoral performance dwindled down compared to the last election as they garnered only 20.60% of the votes on the three constituencies contested, or 2.63% of the overall popular vote, which was mostly attributed to the large swing towards the ruling party, where they attained large winning margins.
2020 general election
The party fielded only six candidates and contested two constituencies, Ang Mo Kio GRC and Radin Mas; in a breaking tradition, the party chose not to contest West Coast GRC, which was reserved by the new party Progress Singapore Party led by former MP Tan Cheng Bock.
Ahead of the elections, the party had accused the Progress Singapore Party for not living up to an agreement so that they could avoid a three way fight with the PAP in Yio Chu Kang SMC. In response, the PSP argued that no such agreement existed. During the campaigning period, secretary-general Kenneth did not participate in the campaigning nor turn up for televised broadcasts as he was serving a mandatory 14-day Stay Home Notice after a visit to the United Kingdom.
On 10 July, the party won neither constituencies, with vote shares of 28.09% and 25.97% respectively. Though the party improved their party's vote share by 27.84% from the last election, their overall popular vote fell to 2.19%.
