The last male northern white rhino has died, the conservation organization in Kenya caring for the animal announced Tuesday, leaving only two remaining white rhinos in existence.
The rhino, named Sudan, who was 45 years old, was euthanized after his health fell into sudden decline "over the last 24 hours." Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dvur Králové Zoo made the decision.
"It is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dvur Králové Zoo announce that Sudan, the world's last male northern white rhino, age 45, died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19th, 2018," the conservancy announced. "Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that led to degenerative changes in muscles and bones combined with extensive skin wounds. His condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours; he was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal."

The only two northern white rhinos still in existence are Sudan's daughter and granddaughter. The second-to-last male northern white rhino died in 2014, at age 42, at the San Diego Zoo.
Ol Pejeta Conservancy had been "cautiously optimistic" just two weeks ago when Sudan appeared to be recovering from treatments for his "age-related infection." They also posted a photo on Twitter showing Sudan enjoying the mud brought on by heavy rains in Kenya.

Sudan lived in captivity for the final 38 years of his life in order to protect and care for him.
"During his final years, Sudan came back to Africa [from Dvur Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic] and stole the heart of many with his dignity and strength," Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a release.
The survival of the species, however, depends on less on the death of Sudan and more on the health of the two remaining females. Semen from dead northern white rhinos is stored around the world, according to The Associated Press. His daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu would need to reproduce through in vitro fertilization, a technique which is still being developed, according to Ol Pejeta.
Tiwa Savage And Hubby, TeeBillz Now Back Together
There are strong indications that singer Tiwa Savage and her hubby Tunji Balogun, better known as TeeBillz, are now back together again.
The Punch reports that the couple were spotted at the wedding of Stephanie Coker, a popular media personality, during the weekend, with the duo the centre of attention.
Though their first public appearance together since their well-publicised break up, the duo, it was learnt, only had eyes for each other at the wedding ceremony.
In April 2016, the internet was overwhelmed with rumours of their break up, after TeeBillz took to social media to lash out at his wife; alleging infidelity, claiming that she had ‘sexual relationship' with Dr. SID, Don Jazzy and 2face Idibia.
In a swift reaction, Tiwa, while denying the allegation, accused her hubby of being a habitual user of drugs, money swindler and engaging in extra marital affairs.
It was however learnt that the intervention of family members from both sides “have brought about reconciliation.”
“Tiwa and Tunji (Teebillz) are back for good, but they haven't finalized the reconciliation process because it takes time,” an insider told TheNetNG. “Don Jazzy is cool with him and there're no issues between the couple anymore,” another industry expert said.

Arsenal host Leicester City on EPL opening day
Arsenal will open their 2017/2018 Premier League campaign against Leicester City on August 12.
The North London club will then go on the road for a couple of tough fixtures, first against Stoke City and later against Liverpool at Anfield.
Arsenal will host Antonio Conte's champions on January 1 in the usual packed festive period programme which will see the teams play four matches apiece between December 23 and New Year's Day.
The first North London derby of the season against Tottenham will be on November 18 at the Emirates, with the return fixture at Wembley Stadium on February 10.
The club's manager Arsene Wenger will be firmly in the sights of the disgruntled Gunners fans who didn't want him to sign a new contract. But the manager has insisted the Gunners will improve in the coming season.
To ensure that happens, Wenger has already signed defender Sead Kolasinac, and he is being linked with a host of players including Monaco's Kylian Mbappe, Leicester's Riyad Mahrez and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez.

As communities age and money for big projects dries up, top municipal officials are saying “something has to give.”
A report on the perspective of chief administrative officers (CAOs) — by Strategy Corp. — found that just as Toronto is struggling to find ways to pay for much-needed infrastructure work, smaller communities, too, are finding it increasingly difficult to come with badly-needed cash.
“You thought Toronto was just having these problems,” said John Matheson, report co-author and a principal at Strategy Corp. “Actually, the report indicates it's the municipal sector as a whole ... These problems are fairly common across Ontario which is why it's important people pay attention to them.”
The group interviewed 26 CAOs — the top bureaucrats of towns, counties or cities — to get their views on the future of municipal government. The report focuses on small- to medium-size communities, and was provided exclusively to the Toronto Sun.
The report says CAOs are seeing a gap between what the public expects of local government and what they are prepared to pay for has grown. One participant told the authors “something has to give.”
The report says councillors in those communities are hesitant to raise taxes or create new revenue streams to pay for the work which isn't surprising, he added.
“There's a lot of infrastructure put in the ground between 50 and 75 years ago,” Matheson said, adding that years of deferring infrastructure work are catching up with communities.
The CAOs also expressed concern about the rise of a divisive brand of populism in city halls across Ontario. A number of councillors are mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump's brash style, often publicly attacking bureaucrats and questioning their work.
“(Municipal governments) are not designed to have a somebody on council who is structurally opposing everything,” he said. “It's contributing to only half of them saying they had good relations with their councils.”
The interviews used for the report were conducted confidentially. The findings offer a rare, unvarnished view of major issues taking place in these towns and cities, said Ron Shaw, a senior advisor with Strategy Corp who co-authored the report.
Shaw, a former CAO with over 30 years experience in Stratford and Kincardine, said top municipal bureaucrats don't want to be critical of their communities publicly.
“They're not going to say much different than what their councillors may be saying,” he added. “They want to make sure they represent the views of the municipality. Speaking confidentially, they can speak to us ... and give honest, open feedback.”
Releasing the report at the Association of Municipalities of Ontario's annual meeting in Ottawa this week will help bring the concerns of the CAOs into focus, he said.
Matheson added that the concerns raised in the report will need to be addressed through a variety of means, including the provision of more cash to municipalities.

Zamfara Officials In Trouble Over Missing Meningitis Vaccine
Two officials of Bungudu local council in Zamfara have been ordered to produce the missing Meningitis vaccines allocated to the area or be sanctioned.
The affected officials are the local council's director of Health, Rabiu Dansadau and the Councillor of Health, Sanusi Umar.
The Chairman of the State Sub-Committee for the Procurement, Management and Distribution of Meningitis drugs and vaccines, Alhaji Aliyu Kagara said on Monday in Bungudu that the committee had discovered massive diversion of the vaccines meant for the area.
He said that a total of 400 I.V injections meningitis vaccines was allocated to the area, but only 30 of the vaccines were accounted for.
“When the committee visited the local government it discovered that 30 persons were treated and there was no trace of the remaining 370 vaccines,.
“The two officials must return the drugs and offer convincing explanation of what happened,” Kagara said.
The chairman said that, so far, the affected officials have failed to give satisfactory explanation as to the whereabout of the remaining drugs.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that patients had a week ago told Gov. Abdulaziz Yari when he visited some meningitis isolation centres that they used their money to buy the drugs which was supposed to be free.
NAN learnt that patients pay up N1,000 per vaccine, to get treated.
The governor has already set up a committee under the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Abdullahi Shinkafi to investigate the matter, while the State House of Assembly has also set up its own investigation committee.
A total of 346 people have died of meningitis and 3,145 infected since the reported outbreak of the disease in Zamfara.(NAN)

A crooked landlord who collected rents from a property seized by Rockland County officials is behind bars following an investigation by the Rockland County Sheriff's Office.
Elazer Dancziger, 61, of New Square, was charged Tuesday, Jan. 30, with three counts of felony grand larceny and scheming to defraud for illegally collecting rent money from tenants who live at 749 Main St., in New Hempstead, said officials with the Sheriff's Office.
The county took possession of the apartment complex on Sept. 18, 2017, for failure to pay back taxes. Following the seizure, Dancziger continued to represent himself as a landlord of the property and collected rents, all the time knowing the building was owned by the county.
“I want to thank the Rockland County Sheriff and his investigators for their prompt and comprehensive investigation that resulted in the arrest of someone who I can only describe as truly the slime of the earth," said County Executive Ed Day. "As a former law enforcement professional, I have nothing but disdain for criminals and to see justice served for those who were taken advantage of is extremely heartening."
Earlier this month, under Day's direction, the county filed a lawsuit against Dancziger and another man who illegally occupied and rented a property that was foreclosed by the county after they failed to pay $54,000 in taxes.
The lawsuit alleges that Joseph Greenbaum and Dancziger allowed new tenants to rent apartments at 749 North Main St., New Hempstead after the County became the owner of the property.
"Their actions were not only illegal, they were outrageous," said Day. "It's a scam – like renting the Brooklyn Bridge. They represented that they owned a property that they did not own."
In a complaint filed in Rockland County Supreme Court, the county is seeking to recover damages for the unlawful occupation of the property.
Tenants told investigators that they had paid $2,000 in rent per unit to Dancziger.
Dancziger was remanded to the Rockland County Jail on $15,000 bail. He is scheduled to return to court on Feb. 5.

One of the big stories surrounding the National Football League playoffs, which will culminate with the Super Bowl Sunday night, was the success of the Jacksonville Jaguars in almost advancing to the big game.
Although the Jags fell short of that goal by narrowly losing to New England on Jan. 21, the play of their defense and quarterback Blake Bortles impressed many — including a North Surry High School graduate who coached Bortles in high school.
“I'll always make the time to talk about good players and good kids,” Wes Allen began a telephone conversation Wednesday during a break in his work day in Florida, where the former local resident has lived for about 15 years.
“And Blake certainly fits that mold.”
During his time in the Sunshine State, Allen — who graduated from North Surry in 1997 before playing football at Appalachian State University — has served as head coach at Oviedo High School, where Bortles played quarterback. Bortles enjoyed a stellar career there before graduating in 2010 and starring at the University of Central Florida before being selected by the Jaguars in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft.
Jacksonville's won-loss record was 11-37 during Bortles' first three seasons. But this season the team went 10-6 before dispatching Buffalo in the first round of the playoffs and then going on the road the next week to defeat the heavily favored Pittsburgh Steelers.
After that, the Jags lost the AFC Championship game at New England 24-20, after leading most of the way and seeing Pats QB Tom Brady engineer a last-minute, come-from-behind victory.
And all of this was closely watched by Bortles' old coach back in Florida, who still keeps in touch with his star signal-caller from their Oviedo High days.
“Honestly, I'm very proud of him and happy more than anything,” said Allen, the son of Surry County residents Robert and Kathy Allen. “I think any kid that grows up wanting to play football, his dream is to play in the NFL and Blake is getting to play out his childhood dream.”
Allen witnessed the transformation of Bortles from a defensive player to a quarterback in high school, who would be playing in Sunday's Super Bowl had a stellar effort from Brady and New England not transpired.
“That's impressive and I'm happy for him — I've seen the time and the effort he's put in to become the quarterback he is,” Allen said of his former player's recent success.
Fond memories
When Wes Allen first came into contact with Blake Bortles, around 2004, the latter was on a much different trajectory.
“He was actually in our youth football program here in Oviedo, and he was a running back and a linebacker,” recalled Allen, who was breaking into the Florida high school coaching ranks after serving as a long snapper at App State.
Allen relocated from Mount Airy to Florida in 2003. “I moved down here and didn't know a soul.”
The former Greyhounds player subsequently became an assistant coach at Oviedo, a large school (about 3,000 students) in Seminole County in the greater Orlando area.
During Bortles' freshman and sophomore seasons there, Allen was offensive line coach, before being elevated to head coach for Bortles' junior and senior campaigns.
As a young underclassman, Bortles was playing at cornerback on defense, but the Oviedo coaching staff saw a quarterback in the making.
“His body — his height, his weight, the way he could run,” Allen said of the physical dimensions that led to this consideration for Bortles, who is now listed at 6-5 and 236 pounds.
“When we saw him throwing and running and the all-around athlete he was, we called him in and said, ‘you're going to be a quarterback,”' Allen remembers. “He looked the part — he had all the intangibles.”
Bortles took this in stride, according to his former coach. “Being the kid he was, he never questioned it, he just went on doing his thing to help the team.”
This paid dividends during Bortles' sophomore season when the Oviedo Lions' starting QB was injured and Bortles — who had played on defense to that point — was inserted as his replacement.
“And once I became head coach, we kind of tailored our offense around him,” Allen said.
Oviedo had been fielding a wing-T offense, which stresses power running and misdirection.
“Playing at North Surry, I grew up in the wing-T,” Allen said. “And when I became head coach, we went to more of a spread-type offense,” a passing-oriented scheme that made better use of Bortles' talents.
This was rewarded with a district title in 2009, when Bortles was a senior at Oviedo.
Pro career impresses
Scholarship offers rolled in, and Bortles elected to play at the University of Central Florida located near his home.
He led UCF to a 22-5 record as a starter in the 2012-2013 seasons and the inaugural championship of the American Athletic Conference in the latter season. It was capped off with an appearance in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, where Bortles led Central Florida to a 52-42 upset of fifth-ranked Baylor, propelling his selection as the third overall pick in the 2014 draft.
Up until the latter stages of the present NFL season as the Jaguars built a winning record thanks largely to their defense, Bortles was disrespected by most of the so-called expert analysts. They tagged him with a label considered distasteful in pro football: a “game manager” — someone expected to hand off the ball, throw short passes and make no mistakes that cause the team to lose.
“Blake has always done a good job of blocking out negativity,” Allen said of such criticism.
“The only thing he cares about is what his coaches and the guys in the locker room think,” he added. “When you go back and look at the entire body of work during the season, he did exactly what the coaches asked him to do.”
When the playoffs rolled around, Bortles' running talents helped the Jags defeat Buffalo 10-3, which included rushing for a game-high 88 yards.
Bortles had a breakout passing game the next week against the Steelers, completing 14 of 26 attempts for the upset victory. He also ran for 35 yards.
“Blake beat them with his feet,” Allen said of his mobility in running the Jags' offense that continually came through in a seesaw battle.
“Every time they needed it, he had an answer,” Bortles' former coach continued. “That's not a game manager, in my opinion.”
That carried over into Jacksonville's last game against the Patriots in a clash for the right to play in the Super Bowl.
Bortles completed 23 of 36 passes for nearly 300 yards and the Jaguars led 20-10 at the start of the fourth quarter before succumbing to Brady's heroics.
‘Still just Blake'
Wes Allen stepped down from coaching one year ago, after nine seasons at the helm of Oviedo High, a won-lost record of 63-36 and five district titles.
He entered private business, working in sales for a company that installs turf fields.
“The opportunity that's been presented to me is just too good to pass up for my family and for myself,” Allen told the Orlando Sentinel in a January 2017 interview.
He and his wife have two children, a son, Austin, 4, and a daughter, Jordan, born only last month.
“I took this job to help my family out,” explained Allen, who hopes to one day return to coaching.
In the meantime, he has maintained a close relationship with his star quarterback from Oviedo High.
“We usually text after the game — we'll text back and forth a little bit,” Allen said of what occurs during the Jaguars' season. “During the off weeks, he'll swing by the house and say ‘hello.'”
Allen said he is happy for Bortles and his family, praising his parents for the job they did in raising Blake and his brother Colby, a baseball player in the Detroit Tigers organization.
“People ask me, ‘how has he changed?'” Allen said of the Jaguars QB.
“Well, he hasn't changed — he's still just Blake.”

Ukraine's government has denied a report that one of its state-owned factories may have supplied the rocket engines North Korea is using in its quest to create a missile capable of hitting the continental United States.
The successful test launches North Korea has carried out in recent months that have prompted fiery rhetoric from President Donald Trump have also surprised experts. The country has been making rapid progress in developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Now, a new analysis by an American missile expert, first reported by The New York Times on Monday, says it has identified the engines that are powering these recent missile tests as a type produced by a factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.
Michael Elleman, a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told The New York Times he believed that the engines had likely been acquired illegally from workers from Yuzhmash, a Ukrainian factory that has been suffering severe financial difficulties recently. Elleman said he did not believe Yuzhmash's executives or the Ukrainian government were involved in the deal, but that Ukraine was the most likely source of engines. Elleman told the Times he feared that Yuzhmash technicians might be aiding the North Koreans.
“It's likely that these engines came from Ukraine —- probably illicitly,” Elleman told the Times. “The big question is how many they have and whether the Ukrainians are helping them now. I'm very worried.”
The head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Oleg Turchynov, flatly rejected Elleman's report in a statement. Turchynov said the claims were unfounded and suggested Russian intelligence officials were behind the allegations.
"This information is not based on any grounds, provocative by its content, and most likely provoked by Russian secret services to cover their own crimes,” Turchynov said. “Ukraine has always adhered to all its international commitments, therefore, Ukrainian defense and aerospace complex did not supply weapons and military technology to North Korea.”
A spokesperson for the factory, Yuzhmash, also denied the report, telling ABC News it was "false information."
Elleman's analysis, published in full on the International Institute for Strategic Studies' website, sought to answer a question that has puzzled experts. Many analysts have wondered how North Korea could have so rapidly produced an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, given that even a year ago its efforts had appeared mired in technical failures.
On May 14, North Korea test launched a new intermediate missile capable of striking Guam. Two months later, on July 4, it launched a more powerful missile that the U.S. military estimates reached an altitude of more than 1,700 miles, making it officially an intercontinental ballistic missile. That launch was met with strong international condemnation and provoked an intense war of words between Trump and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.
The successful launches abruptly ended a long string of failures during which North Korean rockets often blew up shortly after ignition. North Korea's efforts to build an ICBM seemed to stall until September last year, after which the country moved swiftly from a ground-launch test through to a full successful ICBM launch. Such progress through design stages normally take years, experts have said.
In his analysis, Elleman suggested that North Korea's rapid progress was due to the fact that it had imported a new foreign-made engine, adapted with foreign expertise. Based on analyzing video of the launches, Elleman said he had narrowed down the recent missiles' engine type. Elleman said it appeared to be a modified version of a Russian-designed liquid fuel engine, called an RD-250, that was originally mass produced for use in the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal.
During the Soviet Union and up until 2006, Elleman wrote, the engines were produced by Yuzhmash in conjunction with a Russian company, Energomash. But in recent years, Yuzhmash has suffered severe financial problems, recently exacerbated by the economic crisis in Ukraine following the 2014 revolution there and the country's conflict with Russia.
Elleman noted that hundreds of the rocket engines may be stored in Russia in Energomash warehouses as well, but suggested that Yuzhmash's financial troubles mean that it was the prime suspect as the supplier to North Korea. He wrote he believed criminal networks operating in Ukraine may have collaborated with workers from the plant to acquire some of the spare engines.
Yuzhmash rejected that information in a statement on its website, writing that the claims in The New York Times article "do not correspond to reality" and are “based on an incompetent 'expert' opinion.”
The company said that it had not produced any military-use missile technology since Ukraine's independence in 1991 and that it complied with an international treaty intended to prevent the spread of ballistic missile technology for armed purposes.
Reached by phone later on Monday, Elleman reiterated that he did not believe either the Ukrainian government or Yuzhmash executives had been involved in supplying the engines but stood by his claim that Ukraine remained the most likely source.
“I think it's more likely it came from Ukraine, but I can't be certain,” he said. "We don't have proof that it came from Yuzhmash or any other specific firm."
Elleman added that both Yuzhmash and Energomash were the most likely sources. It would not be the first time North Korea has sought Ukrainian rocket technology. In 2012, Ukraine jailed two North Koreans on espionage charges for attempting to acquire classified technology relating to rocket engines from a Yuzhmash researcher, Yonhap News Agency reported at the time.
Elleman said one of his primary reasons for looking to Yuzhmash was the nature of the modification made by the North Koreans, condensing the engine to a single chamber instead of the usual two. Elleman said two sources had seen an engine with such a modification on display at Dnipro National University, which is closely connected with Yuzhmash.
“It doesn't mean that Yuzhnoi actually did it,” Elleman said using part of the company's name. But, he said, "that's what leads me to think it's the most likely source."
Yuri A. Mitikov, head of the university's engine design department who has worked with Yuzhmash, told ABC News that it was impossible that the factory had supplied the engine.
“Yuzhmash is a forgotten factory,” Mitikov said of the company's rocket engineering section. “It simply isn't working.”
Mitikov said that for the past five years, the rocket construction department has only been working one day a week and that most of the rocket engines had been stored in Russia.
He argued U.S. arms control specialists had helped dismantled much of the factories' equipment used for military-use missile construction when Ukraine handed over its nuclear arsenal after 1991.
As for the modified RD-250 engine at the university, Mitikov said there was indeed one in a department lab, but that it was a mock-up for students.
“There's nothing inside,” he said.
Yuzhmash is currently contracted to produce 12 ‘Zenit'-class rockets for the Russian-owned commercial space company, S7 Sea Launch, according to a statement in June announcing the project.
But otherwise, Yuzhmash largely produces trolleybuses and tractors now.
Elleman said the key point he had been trying to make was that North Korea had not produced the engine that it was using and that it must have been smuggled into the country from Russia or Ukraine.
He praised Ukraine's government for its previous work on arms control and said he believed they needed to investigate whether the engine could have come from its territory.
“The Ukrainian government should investigate, and if they exonerate themselves, then great," he said. "But there is definitely a source somewhere.”

IN RIVERS: Army raid 4 cultists' camps, recover DSP Alkali, orderly's guns, uniforms
By Jimitota Onoyume
PORT HARCOURT—The Nigerian Army, in an operation carried out in four camps operated by cultists in Uju community, Ogba Egbema Ndoni Local Government Area, River State, recovered one AK-47 assault rifle and uniforms belonging to DSP Mohammed Alkali and his police orderly, allegedly beheaded by cultists.
General Officer Commanding 6 Division of the Army, in Port Harcourt, Major General Kasimu Abdulkarim, told newsmen, yesterday, at the 6 Division, Port-Harcourt, that the military operation was conducted, weekend, in conjunction with men from his Division and the Special Boat Services/Air Component of Operation Delta Safe.
He recalled that DSP Mohammed Alkali and his orderly were among 15 persons murdered in the community in the last one month with several others kidnapped by the cultists.
General Abdulkarim told newsmen that some of the cultists may have died during the raid, since they jumped into the river while the operation was on, adding that nine suspects were arrested and handed over to police for necessary action.
He gave a breakdown of weapons recovered during the raid to include “one AK-47 rifle, two G3 rifles, five double-barrelled guns, two pistols, 31 empty AK-47 magazines, 242 rounds of 7.62mm NATO and 322 rounds of other ammunition.”
He said the clean-up operation will continue in the local government to completely rid the area of cultists and brigands, adding that it will be extended to other areas in the state with similar security challenges.
General Abdulkarim further appealed for timely information from the public to aid the success of the clean-up.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A Muslim aerospace engineer has sued the Spirit Boeing Employees Association for religious discrimination stemming from a party at a lake in Wichita, Kansas.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Friday on behalf of Munir Zanial, a Malaysian national of Indian ancestry.
The association declined to comment.
Zanial rented the group's lake last year to host a party to celebrate Malaysian Independence Day. The lawsuit alleges the association reported him out of fear he used the lake to hold an Islamic State meeting.
It alleged an American flag that had been "desecrated ISIS symbols." But the flag was actually a Malaysian flag and the guests included people of Malaysian Indian ancestry, some wearing hijabs.
Spirit filed a complaint with the FBI, and the association terminated his rental benefits.
There's just 48 hours before the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles square off at Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but for these U.S. workers, whose companies are helping get game day and the festivities around it off the ground, every day is a winner.
Sportsfield Specialties
The company produces goal posts and other sporting goods, and has been around since 1998. The company employs about 100 people, who weld, shape and paint about 1,000 goal posts a year in Delhi, New York. Sportsfield Specialties also has 50 workers in Salisbury, North Carolina, at its netting and wall-pad manufacturing facility.
This will be the seventh time its goal posts will be in the Super Bowl and the materials for the goal posts come from all over the U.S.
Turf Nation
Turf Nation is located in Dalton, Georgia, and makes synthetic turf systems. According to Turf Nation, 14 of the 32 NFL franchises play or practice on a turf system produced by the company. And on Sunday, the company will celebrate its fourth NFL Super Bowl in the last six years.
"All components of a Turf Nation synthetic turf system are proudly manufactured in the U.S.A. and each surface is custom-designed to a team's or school's specific needs," Turf Nation said in a news release. "All synthetic turf surfaces are field-tested by an independent laboratory prior to shipping."
Turf Nation employs more than 80 workers around the U.S. and makes its turf system out of the same material used in plastic bottles and garbage bags. Last year, the company produced more than 10 million square feet of turf.

WeatherTech
The workers at WeatherTech, which makes vehicle accessories such as floor mats and window deflectors, are hard at work this year for their fifth consecutive Super Bowl ad.
The ad shows employees building a brand-new factory in Boolingbrook, Illinois, right outside Chicago. WeatherTech told ABC News that the company now employs nearly 2,000 people.
Love Your Melon
And finally, as fans touch down in Minneapolis this week for the big game, 10,000 volunteers will be around town greeting them. Love Your Melon's purple hats will help keep many of them warm.
The company in Minneapolis employs 200 workers, who have collectively stitched more than 1 million hats a year.
"It gives everyone here at home a good sense of pride and the ability to say, 'Hey, I made this,'" production manager Kelsey Nelsen said.
Half of every Love Your Melon sale goes to cancer research and support programs as well. Workers also visit hospitals across the U.S., donating hats and their time to children fighting cancer.
"It's keeping jobs right here in our country and we're just really proud of that," Linsey Johnson said.
US Senate backs sanctions on Russia over US election hacking
The US Senate voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to punish Russia over its alleged election meddling, passing a bill that would bar President Donald Trump from unilaterally easing existing sanctions on Moscow.
The vote at a time of high tension in Washington over the Russia scandal was 97-2.
The proposal was included in an amendment that must still win definitive approval from the Senate and from the House of Representatives. It would make congressional approval necessary if Trump seeks to suspend or ease sanctions imposed on Russia over its apparent cyberattacks during the 2016 US election campaign.
This new bill would also give sanctions imposed by then president Barack Obama via an executive order the full force of law. The sanctions target the Russian energy industry in particular.
The legislation would impose new sanctions against “corrupt Russian actors,” “those involved in serious human rights abuses”, Russians providing arms to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime or those engaged in cyberattacks on behalf of the government.
Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Crimea and its support of Assad in the Syrian war are the other stated reasons for the sanctions, aside from the hacking that US intelligence agencies say Russia engaged in aggressively with the alleged aim of helping Trump beat Hillary Clinton last November.
These sanctions have been added to a bill — under debate and almost certain to win passage — aimed at toughening sanctions against Iran for what the bill calls its support of international terrorist acts.
“For too long, the message to Vladimir Putin has been that Russia can invade its neighbors, threaten US allies, intensify its cyberattacks, and interfere with foreign elections with very little repercussion,” said Senator John McCain, a strident critic of the Russian leader.
“Unless and until Russia pays a price for its actions, these destabilizing activities will continue,” he added.
Several more votes on the bill are scheduled in the Senate in the coming days before it can go to the House of Representatives.

Federal safety regulators say that at least four people have died following head-on crashes in Hyundai and Kia cars in which the airbags did not deploy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it's investigating the airbags in 2011 Hyundai Sonatas and 2012 and 2013 Kia Fortes after it received reports the devices failed to deploy in six different crashes that resulted in injuries, including the four involving fatalities.
There are an estimated 425,000 cars on US roads that could be affected by the problem, according to the NHTSA's review, which was made public on Saturday.
Hyundai announced earlier this month that it plans to recall 155,000 of the 2011 Sonatas due to a short circuit in the controller that deploys the airbags. But it has yet to recall the cars because it does not yet have a fix in place. The automaker said it will notify owners by April 20.
Hyundai's initial recall statement did not mention that any deaths or injuries had occurred in the cars with faulty airbags. When asked about the NHTSA's investigation, it said the four accidents involving Sonatas resulted in two deaths and two injuries. It described the accidents as "rare and unique."
"These accidents included a very high rate of speed and a severe offset head-on collision to the front driver side of the vehicle," said the company. "We are actively investigating what exactly causes the airbag control unit to become damaged in these specific types of accidents."
Kia, which is also owned by Hyundai Motors but operates as a separate company in the US, has not announced any recalls for the Forte related to the airbag. Kia said it is working with NHTSA but that it "has not confirmed any airbag non-deployments arising from the potential chip issue."
The airbags were made by ZF-TRW, according to the NHTSA filing. Spokespersons for VF-TRW did not respond to a request for comment.
The largest auto recall in the nation's history involved 50 million airbags made by supplier Takata for 37 million cars across most major automakers. Those airbags, which exploded and sent shrapnel into the car's occupants, have been tied to at least 13 U.S. deaths and more than 200 injuries, according to NHTSA.

play videoPreye, Gospel musician
Welcome to the 8th edition of Adom Praiz here at the magnificent Perez Dome in Accra. Patrons are entering in ceaselessly in a way that throws up imaginations of how triumphant Israel entered the promised land, Canaan.
Well, this promised land here won't take you 40 years to reach. It will take you 50 cedis.
The Preye Hour has come!
It is now the Preye hour. He was a drop out, nearly went into occultism. He was a friend to poverty and went through the College of suffering. He was not qualified. But God doesn't need the qualified. He calls the unqualified and qualifies them. Tonight, the last great act to crown a glorious night of praise at Adom Praiz, the biggest Gospel concert, is Preye Odede. How big and qualified can he get? The crowd is expectant.
After a dose of praise and worship from Donkor, Adjei, Crown and Mettle, Odede takes the final bow of worship to the Lord and the crowd bow along. He says you cannot get enough of praise and worship to the Lord and the crowd agrees. He serves a great many worship tunes and surprises the crowd with a popular Ghanaian worship and gets the crowd shouting. They are still waiting for his hit track- Ebezina.
Melting Point with Joe Mettle
We are now at the melting point. From one Nigerian hit singer to a Ghanaian super hit star, Joe Mettle, the king of Ghanaian worship takes over. The concert is hitting a crescendo. Leading in worship is a craft, a gift, a blessing given to few- Joe Mettle is one. Gifted with tongues of many Ghanaian languages, Mettle announces his presence with one of his twi medleys. He is a Ga man. Not many of them are fluent in Twi but Mettle is and sings flawlessly in a language he learnt. The reason why we live is to give God the worship and Mettle leads the way at Adom Praiz. From Our strength to Our Help, Mettle delivers, then he turns the Dome around with his “Turning around” hit song. He takes the congregants to his Soul winners' days and serves a little ‘jama' praise tunes. A lady in Christ bends over and whispers into my ears, the “Dome is shaking.” Yes it is I answered. Joe Mettle is in, i added. Mixing worship and praise together in a great atmosphere.
Steve Crown
Now we are gradually inching closer to the climax. One of two Nigerian acts, Steve Crown takes his turn. Crown comes without a crown on his head but with a powerful voice to worship and to crown the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. I can bet thousands of the congregants will be waiting for his hit song “You are great” but they are not in a hurry at all as they sing along to his glorious worship songs. The 6 feet looking lanky artiste looks radiant in his typical Nigerian attire- the agbada-and calls out testimonies from the faithful. Such a powerful voice he has. Slowly but surely the are Great time has come and booy the Dome is an electric experience. Demons tremble at His presence, Crown sings and the crowd responds. A total worship performance by a man ready to give glory to God. “Poverty trembles, failure trembles, every challenge you face trembles at His presence. All you need to do is to praise your way out of your troubles and Jesus will stay with you,” he tells the congregation. I thought Francis nailed it but Crown is doing same too, to the glory of God.
An anointed Francis Agyei act proves ‘ you can't teach an old dog new tricks'
Francis Adjei steps in with a song of worship neatly dressed in suit and tie to match. He is in for business, a business to lead the faithful with their hands lifted as a sacrifice of praise and worship to the Lord. Yehowa y3 Kronkron, [God is holy] Oy3 Owura he sings and lights up the auditorium. The church sing along in holiness. Its a great church experience now. Arguably the best performer on the night if you ask me. The praise king effortlessly turns the dome into a market of praise leading the faithful with one hit song after another.
You just can't teach an old dog new tricks. It is an exceptional live praise concert by one of Ghana's most talented gospel singers of all time. S3 mi wo yesu [If you have Jesus] Y3b3 tu Halleluya; Jesus gave to me are just to mention a few of the songs which turned the Dome into a festival. He takes off his jacket? Can you blame him. The praise heat is on and the crowd cheer on.
Smart Exhortation!
If you are a doctor, a police man, a lawyer and feel too big to stand in praise of God, He will bring you down! That's the call from MC Captain Smart and guess what, the Dome is chargedeveryone is on the feet, Lawyer, doctor market woman, everyone is up what a way to introduce Francis Adjei.
Denzel Prempeh
The Perez Dome is now in worship mood. Like the swing of a pendulum the congregants who were shouting in praise with glorious dancing moves have switched into a worship mood, thanks to Denzel. He begins with some local worship songs before increasing the spiritual tempo with Yes you're the Lord Most high.
Celestine Donkor
Celestine Donkor looks celestial. Her apparel, all white with a shiny element in there announces her presence on stage. She needs little or no introduction. Her voice sings louder. Known for her power and glorious ability to turn hit songs into her own, Celestine Donkor performs Sinach's miracle worker in Ewe- a local Ghanaian dialect. For all those whose lives appear to be stagnating Celestine turns the dome around with her Turning around track. “If you proposed to a lady and you were bounced don't worry your life is turning around “she says to a bursting laughter from the crowd.
Sinach and Nathaniel Bassey are not here but their songs performed by Joyce Blessing and later the Multimedia Choir and then Celestine Donkor are crowd favourites.
The Multimedia choir. Wow. If you thought this was a make-shift choir, well, they made us shift from this view. Colour-looking attire. These are simply employees – reporters, front office staff, presenters and hosts – but give it up to them. This is good.
And it is begining to appear, you can't go wrong with a Nigerian gospel. They just did a Sinaach -Rejoice – and a Nathaniel Bassey – Halleluyah Eh – and what a response.
Some Joyce Blessing energy fires up the crowd here. Dressed up in some tight-fitting security clothes, she works up those with energy to burn – which is virtually everybody here. And ends with a Nigerian song ‘Victory' by Eben. We love it.
Kofi is on stage. And this is a gyming exercise packaged for praises. He leads the audience to rise up and asks that you put your hands on the next person's shoulder. Nice opportunity to break the ice with your ‘next person'. If you are a young man, you sure would hope your ‘next person' fits your expectations.
Akesse Brempong, promising a gospel star ‘wonderkid' is cutting his teeth on an Adom Praiz platform. Some big appreciation from the audience as he takes the stage should be heart-warming for him. And some typical Pentecostal worship tunes he is taking us through is sinking in well here. Some Jamaican-themed performances and then he moves us into his popular track ‘Crazy Love'.
Adom Praiz 2017
“Can nobody do me like the way you do Jesus, you're the lover of my sooooouuuul” Nice song right?
Adom FM host of Live Worship Kwamina Idan and Adom FM presenter Captain Smart are MCs for the night and they start up the patrons demonstrating their competencies in trading Bible verses and prophetic declarations.
Not that they are ‘certified' prophets but hey, who knows?
Ann kicks us off with some worship songs. Graceful-looking, her performance is quick and welcoming. And check out her backers too.
Kwamina Idan promises anyone looking for the fruit of the womb to expecting a sort of impregnating experience here and the accompany amen here from the women is…is…words fail me.
This is Adom Praiz. But if you are single, this is a marriage market. Beautiful young women and men litter the rows like a season of harvest. Adom Praiz 2017 ED
Very engaging instrumentals-only rendition of some popular gospel songs. It has been going on here for the past hour and a half and the energy of this trumpeter must be divine. How do you blow this instrument without a stand-by bowl of kenkey?

KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) - A spokesman says former President George H.W. Bush is in "good spirits" at a Maine hospital but will need several more days of treatment.
The 93-year-old was taken to a hospital on Sunday when he experienced low blood pressure and fatigue hours after attending a pancake breakfast at the American Legion post in Kennebunkport.
His spokesman said in a tweet Wednesday that Bush is talkative and in good spirits but that the treatments to address his blood pressure "are expected to take several more days."
The nation's 41st president arrived in Maine on May 20 after being treated for a blood infection. He's without his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush, who died in April in Houston.

Banwarilal Purohit, who was sworn in as the 24th governor of Tamil Nadu today, said his decisions will be based on the constitution and there will no political consideration in it.
"All my decisions will be based on constitution. I have decided to preserve and protect constitution and there will be no political consideration in all decisions whether it is big or small", he said soon after taking oath.
Stating that Governor office is above politics, Purohit said: "all decisions will be based on merit".
He said that he will support the government with regard to developmental activities are concerned. "I have good friends in Delhi and I will ensure more funds are provided to Tamil Nadu", he added.
"I will see that there is total transparency in the administration", Purohit said.
During the swearing-in ceremony, Purohit was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Madras High Court chief Justice Indira Banerjee.
Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy and Opposition DMK working president M K Stalin were among the VIPs present in the function at Raj Bhavan.
Impact: Motorists must take lengthy detours using Highway 91 to the north or Highway 76 to the south
Where: Highway closed to all traffic, including bikes and pedestrians, near Christianos Road east of San Juan Capistrano
When: Closure occurred Jan. 25; Reopening scheduled Feb. 21, though officials say it could come earlier, depending on weather
Why: Repair of a short stretch of sagging pavement caused by recent storms
What: The stretch of Highway 74 known as the Ortega Highway is temporarily shut down
Lake Elsinore resident Frenchy Miller now rises at 3:30 a.m. to reach her bookkeeping job in San Clemente by 7 a.m.
Sylvia Huber drives more than 100 miles to reach San Juan Capistrano -- which is only about 15 miles from her Rancho Carrillo home.
Vivian Barron's three-hour drive to grief classes in Corona Del Mar compounds the anguish she experiences over her husband's death last year.
And Alex and Steve Novorr temporarily live with their 7-year-old son in a trailer in Dana Point rather than deal with five- to six-hour daily commutes.
Those are some of the experiences folks who regularly drive Highway 74 -- known as the Ortega Highway between Riverside and Orange counties -- are facing since officials shut down the route Jan. 25 to repair a collapsed segment on the Orange County side.
“It's an absolute nightmare for commuters and their families,” said Riverside County Supervior Kevin Jeffries, whose office has been inundated by phone calls and emails.
Waiting on a fix
Department of Transportation officials estimated it would take three weeks to reopen that section of Highway 74, a forecast that was extended to Feb. 21. They now believe it could be reopened this week, weather permitting. Paving was scheduled to begin Tuesday, followed by restriping.
“The good news is that we've made progress,” Caltrans spokeswoman Jocelyn Whitfield said. “We expect to have it open this week. I just can't tell you which day. It's just a matter of moving through the process.”
Normally, more than 10,000 motorists per day traverse the two-lane highway, which winds for about 27 miles over the Santa Ana Mountains between Interstate 15 in western Lake Elsinore and Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano.
With the route barricaded near Christianitos Road, drivers must use alternative routes between I-5 and I-15 -- the usually congested Highway 91 about 20 miles to the north or the often stacked-up Highway 76, about 35 miles to the south.
Long delays
“I'm exhausted with all this driving, the wear and tear on my car (and) the wear and tear on my money,” said Miller, who has used both options. “I think it's about 20 hours a week driving. That's like a part-time job.”
She said her migraine headaches have increased, she has no time or energy for the gym, and her toddling granddaughter is dejected by the lack of time grandma spends with her.
The closure is exasperating for those who live and work near San Juan Capistrano whose access to Ortega is east of the barrier.
Huber said the exit for Rancho Carrillo's 240-plus residents is about five minutes from the construction zone to the west, and it normally takes them 25 minutes to reach San Juan Capistrano.
Her daughter and son-in-law rented a place in San Clemente until Ortega reopens and Huber has stayed there when she does her weekly volunteer sessions for the Orange County SPCA after taking the long detour.
“It's really turned everybody's life upside-down,” she said. “We love where we live, but it comes with some issues with only one road to travel.”
Dangerous road
Ortega has issues even without closures, with so many vehicles trying to navigate a mountain road full of steep dips and sharp curves.
Barron's detour is doubly painful. She goes to grief counseling to help is cope with the loss of her husband, Dr. Greg Barron. He was killed Feb. 21, 2016 in a car accident -- on the Ortega Highway.
The doctor was navigating Highway 74 on his way to work when his Chevrolet Suburban was struck by a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road.
“It's been very hard on our family,” she said. “He was a breadwinner, a good doctor and a wonderful family man.”
Her marathon drives to grief classes aren't exactly helping the healing process, but she does have friends and family in Orange County with whom she can stay overnight.
Making other arrangements
After experiencing one evening commute and another the following morning in the first 24 hours of the closure, the Novorrs decided to load up their trailer and reserve a campsite at Doheny Beach State Park.
“My son thinks he's on permanent vaycay,” said Alex Novorrs.
Though they grew up in Orange County, the couple has found shore-front camping in a busy Southern California beach town to be a bit of a culture shock after living for years in the forest.
“It's going from coyotes to homeless people,” Steve Novorr said. “I can't believe there's so much action around here at 3 o'clock in the morning.”
They're making the best of it.
“It went from lemons to lemonade, and we need to add a little sugar now and then,” Alex Novorr said.
The experience has given them a heightened appreciation for life along the Ortega.
“I'm not complaining about the commute anymore,” Steve Novorr said. “This has been a reality check.”

(Reuters) - Jon Huntsman Sr., a billionaire U.S. industrialist who invented the "clamshell" fast-food container and gave away much of his fortune for cancer research, died on Friday at age 80, the corporation he founded said.
Huntsman died at his home in Salt Lake City surrounded by his family, Huntsman Corp, a specialty chemicals company based in Texas, said. It gave no details.
"While never a chemist, he knew more about human chemistry than anyone I have ever met," his son Peter Huntsman, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Huntsman founded Huntsman Container Corp in 1970 and four years later won the contract to create the polystyrene "clamshell" food container for McDonald's Corp. He invented as many as 30 other products, including the first plastic plates and bowls, the company said.
The Salt Lake Tribune, which is owned by Peter Huntsman, said in an obituary that Huntsman donated or committed to donate at least $580 million to the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City.
Huntsman's commitment to cancer research came after he underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 1992. Both his parents had died of cancer, the obituary said.
Huntsman donated at least $1.8 billion to charity during his lifetime, making him one of roughly two dozen people worldwide to give away more than $1 billion, the newspaper said.
Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho, on June 21, 1937, to Blaine Huntsman, a schoolteacher, and Kathleen Robison Huntsman. He described his father as abusive, and for a time the family lived in a two-room house without plumbing.
"'Throughout my life I have hustled to outrun the shadow of poverty,'" the obituary quoted him as saying in his 2015 autobiography, "Barefoot to Billionaire."
He earned a scholarship to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and served as a Navy officer before entering business.
Huntsman was staff secretary to President Richard Nixon and in 1988 briefly challenged Utah Governor Norm Bangerter for the Republican nomination before dropping out of the race.
Huntsman married his high school sweetheart, Karen Haight, in 1959. He is survived by eight of his nine children, 56 grandchildren and 26 great-grandchildren, the obituary said.
His son Jon Jr. served as governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009 and sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. He now is ambassador to Russia.

FG condemns killing of another Nigerian in South Africa
Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has described the latest extra judicial killing of a Nigerian in South Africa as “worrying and condemnable”.
Dabiri-Erewa in a statement in Abuja on Monday said the latest gruesome killing of Tochukwu Nnadi by Police in South Africa, was unacceptable to the people and government of Nigeria.
The statement was signed by her Media aide, Mr Abdur-Rahman Balogun.
She reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari's calls to Nigerians to avoid crimes like drug peddling which attracts stiff penalties, sometimes death.
The Presidential aide noted that the killing of Nnadi had brought to 20 Nigerians killed in South Africa through extrajudicial means in 2016 alone.
While appealing to Nigerians to avoid crimes, Dabiri-Erewa said the extra judicious killing of Nigerians is condemnable and unacceptable.
“The barbaric behaviour of the perpetrators is not only unacceptable, but also calls for urgent attention by diplomatic authorities in Nigeria and South Africa,” she said.
Dabiri-Erewa urged the South African Government to ensure that justice prevails by carrying out investigation and bring the culprit to book.
She reiterated her calls to Nigerians living abroad to always respect the laws of their host countries and be good ambassadors of Nigeria.
She recalled that a Nigerian based in South Africa, Tochukwu Nnadi, was allegedly choked to death by the Police in South Africa on Thursday Dec. 29, after he was arrested for allegedly selling drugs.
According to eyewitnesses, the man, popularly known as King Kingsley, was not struggling after he was arrested and handcuffed, but one of the officers held onto his neck and squeezed tightly until blood started gushing out.
“My heart goes out to the families of the deceased and pray God to grant the departed soul eternal rest,” the SSA prayed.
Meanwhile, the Nigeria Union in Pretoria had confirmed the latest killing.
The Secretary of the union, Mr Adetola Olubajo, told newsmen in Pretoria that “Nigeria Union is calling on the Nigerian Mission to demand results of investigations of all murder cases involving Nigerian victims from the South African authority''.
Olubajo said that the union was not happy that all murder cases involving Nigerians in South Africa were never resolved.
In the year 2016 alone, it has brought to 20, the number of Nigerians killed in South Africa under such cruel circumstances.
Among such victims were Ikejiaku Chinedu, Monday Okorie, Gideon Ogalaonye, Nnamdi Michael, Adeniyi Olumoko, Christian Onwukaike and Tochukwu Nnadi.
Nigerians are perennial victims of the xenophobia in South Africa, with Nigerians losing more than 4.6 million Rand or N90 million during the last attacks.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that about 150 South African business organisations are currently operating in Nigeria, despite the former's allegedly restrictive policies, which have made it difficult for Nigerians to invest in that country.

The Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem said on Monday that it is "very concerned by the images, hateful rhetoric, and subsequent violence emanating from yesterday's (13 August 2017) rally in Charlottesville, Virginia."
Yad Vashem explained, "In our post-Holocaust global society, there is no room for racism or antisemitism. The anti-Jewish ideology of the Nazis was a precursor to the eventual murderous policy and extermination of six million Jews. These images are yet another reminder that we must remain vigilant about educating the public regarding hatred and xenophobia." The statement concluded, "Yad Vashem is determined to continue raising public awareness on this topic through its vast educational and commemorative activities. The memory of the Holocaust – and its meanings today – is more relevant than ever to our society worldwide."
A high-profile member of President Trump's was in Roanoke County this morning to promote the president's tax reform proposal. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway says Trump prefers to call it a “tax cut” proposal, since “reform” is a word that, in her words, many people associate with the Washington Swamp. But she says the plan is also about simplifying the current tax code – and stripping away burdensome regulations. Conway attended an event at Optical Cable Corporation that included representatives from state and national manufacturing associations. Former Governor and US Senator George Allen was also present at the town hall style event.

ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) — Tommy Fleetwood broke the course record at Carnoustie by shooting 9-under 63 to tie for the lead with defending champion Tyrrell Hatton after two rounds of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Friday.
Hatton also tamed the tough British Open venue, shooting 65 to move to 11 under par for the tournament. The English golfers were a stroke clear of Nicolas Colsaerts, and two ahead of Paul Dunne and Marcel Siem.
Playing his first event since becoming a father for the first time last week, Fleetwood birdied six of the last eight holes to complete a bogey-free round and beat the course record by a shot.
Carnoustie is regarded as the most difficult of the three courses that stage the tournament. Kingsbarns and the Old Course at St. Andrews are the others, with players alternating between the three in the first three rounds before playing at St. Andrews again for the final round.
Fleetwood holds a big lead in the Race to Dubai rankings despite playing in only one of the last seven tournaments on the European Tour. This season, he has won the Abu Dhabi Championship and the French Open, finished second at a World Golf Championship in Mexico, and placed fourth at the U.S. Open.
He has three top-five finishes at the Dunhill Links, which he says is one of his favorite events.
Hatton followed up a 68 at the Old Course with an even better round at Carnoustie, featuring birdies on four of the last six holes — including chipping in at the par-3 16th.
Winning the Dunhill Links, amid a strong finish to last season, helped lift Hatton to No. 14 in the world ranking. He made just two cuts in nine events from the Masters to the U.S. PGA Championship this year, but has back-to-back top 10s since.
Colsaerts has had consecutive 67s, at Kingsbarns then the Old Course.
Rory McIlroy shot a 71 at Carnoustie and was even par after two rounds. Eleven shots off the lead, McIlroy is likely to finish a season without a victory for just the second time in his pro career.
Starting today, WyoRadio's 1360 KRKK has gone all Christmas music. According to WyoRadio Operations Manager Michael Berry, the station will play nothing but holiday favorites from now through Christmas day.

We offer free mobile app downloads of all our stations at the App Store or Google play by searching for WyoRadio”.
During the holiday season, 1360 KRKK will still be the home of Rock Springs Tigers basketball and will broadcast all the Tigers and Lady Tigers games during the upcoming Flaming Gorge Classic beginning this Thursday.
On Tuesday, December 26th, 1360 KRKK will return to its recently introduced new music format of “Unforgettable Memories” from the 50's to the 80's. The station had been an ESPN Sports affiliate prior to its format change on December 1st.

If you're still chasing the euphoria of the Great American Eclipse, and 2024 seems too long to wait, this month's meteor showers might sate the craving. October is ripe for shooting stars. This Sunday, there's the Draconid, and then a little later, the main event: the Orionid meteor shower.
Meteor showers show snapshots of the past. As comets course through the sky, they burn up, shedding bits of debris. Those bits burn up as they fall to earth, producing the streaks of light we know as shooting stars. According to NASA, the Draconid meteor shower comes from the comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner.
The Draconids, so called because they appear around the constellation Draco the Dragon, are expected to peak this Sunday, October 8. The Draconid meteor shower normally only provides 10 to 20 meteors per hour at its peak, but this year meteorologists predict that as many as 600 per hour will fall through the sky towards earth.
As The New York Times notes, when you see a meteor shower, you're actually seeing the remnants of the comet from the second-to-last time it showed up in Earth's orbit. So you won't be seeing the remains of the Draconid from last time 21P/Giacobini-Zinner passed through earth's atmosphere, but from the time before.
National Geographic estimates that there are an average of 21 meteor showers per year, mostly between August and December. The American Meteor Society keeps a detailed list of the meteor showers that are visible with the naked eye. And while this weekend's bright moonlight might make the Draconids hard to spot, the Orionids later this month should light up the skies.
After the frenzy of eye care caution surrounding the eclipse and the warnings to under no circumstances look directly at the sun meteor-shower, stargazers can relax. According to The New York Times, it may actually be easiest to watch meteor showers through your own two eyes after letting them adjust to the dark night sky (NASA also regularly live streams the events for the public). If you can, get yourself to a spot away from the noise and lights of a city or town, somewhere where you can see the sky untainted.
For the Draconids, point yourself north.
Then, look up.
No glasses necessary.

I feel very fortunate to live in Phillipsburg with the dedicated emergency personnel we have. I had occasion to use the Phillipsburg Fire Department and the Warren County hazmat team in August.
The problem was high gasoline fumes (200 reading) that seeped into the cellar and home due to a ruptured gas hose on a car parked outside. The gas seeped down a crack in the sidewalk into the cellar. It could have been a bad situation.
I was helped by Fire Chief Rich Hay, Assistant Chief Gary Ricker and the hazmat team, Tom Nigro and Chris McCormick. Not only did these fine professionals find the problem and take steps to rectify it, but they showed concern by checking on my well-being later and even a few days afterward. Thanks also to Warren Chemical Fire Chief James Barber.
When you don't have occasion to use these services, you don't fully realize what we have and how much training and sacrifice all these people have made for us and our protection and betterment of the community. I certainly am grateful and appreciate all they do. I hope this letter calls attention to be more aware of and support their efforts in our community.

NO OFFENCE: The school principal who sent a letter to Gympie hairdressers outlining how they should cut their students' hair, has defended their decision and the guidelines they have set.
Hairdresser speaks about school 'guidelines' uproar: The hairdresser who received a letter regarding acceptable hairstyles at a Gympie school has spoken.
UPDATE
THE principal of a private school who sent written orders to Gympie hair dressers on how to cut the hair of its students has said the school meant no offence.
Cooloola Christian College sent the letter to salons in Gympie to make them aware of the school's strict cut and style policy, which restricts girls to no more than two plaits, and no "faddish" hairstyles for any student.
Scrunchies and hair devices must not be decorative and must be in school colours.
It was the first time the school has sent letter to hairsalons, and Principal Trevor Norman has not received any formal complaints from business owners and said the school meant no offence.
"I am not aware of any hairsalons getting back to us with any concerns," Mr Norman said.
"In the end, the hairsalons have their own businesses to run. I am not trying to suggest they run their business in any way.
"For us it is the benefit for our own students. In a similar way we tell businesses in town that sell shoes that these are the shoes our students can and can't buy. We work along those similar lines.
"They can work with their own clients. The children understand our policy, if they make good or bad decisions either way, we can work with them when they are back at school."
The principal said the school did not send out the letter after any kind of student hair rebellion.
"It's actually rare. I have only been at this school for a year-and-a-half, and in that time there's only really been one or two occasions. Most of the time children understand the guidelines.
"Sometimes students come to school with a uniform which doesn't fit within the guidelines and we speak to them about that. There's sometimes some push back and we accept that too.
"The parents probably put up with more than we do.
"They (students) don't get yelled at and it isn't about bad decisions, but it's about making the best decision possible."
Mr Norman said the school does not have a vendetta on style.
"I suppose it is just the different hairstyles. Whether it is putting a bit of colour in, a bit of slight colour, or shaving or something like that.
"Sometimes we might say to a student they've probably gone a little close there. Next time you go for a haircut probably don't go for a number one blade."
The principal said the guidelines are no different from what other schools set.
"Most schools have policies around what students can do with their hairstyles.
"We are trying to help our students with their appearance around how they present themselves.
"The impetuous was to set some guidelines around that."
Mr Norman said parents are well aware of the guidelines the school receives strong support for uniform guidelines.
"Most parents respect that and recognise when their children grow up, their children will have guidelines in the workplace.
"They appreciate that the students have those societal guidelines.
"It's about being an independent school, they respect that. Having uniform guidelines is part of that package."
EARLIER
A GYMPIE hairdresser was shocked to be given written orders this week by a local school on how to cut the hair of its students.
Streetwise Hair owner Lorraine Carter said the 'Dear Hairdresser' letter arrived in the post on Monday stringently outlining the school's acceptable hairstyles that do not include: hair below the eyebrows, girls to have more than two plaits and boys' hair clipped below a number 3.
Clips, bands and ribbons are also for functional purposes 'not merely decorative.'
"When I opened the letter I got the shock of my life," the experienced hairdresser said.
"I've been a hairdresser for 35 years and I've never seen anything like it.
"The way the letter was written it is stipulating exactly what the child's haircut needs to be like."
A Gympie hairdresser was shocked to receive this letter from a local school. Contributed
The school had opened with contents of the letter as 'being helpful' to the business.
"From time to time we have students arrive at school with a haircut that falls outside our hairstyle policy which can be problematic for parents and students," the letter said.
"By being aware of our requirements then you may be able to assist your clients in selecting a suitable cut/style, or at least notify them that their choice may cause an issue at school."
Mrs Carter said the school's directive had put her in an extremely awkward position with her clients.
"I feel that it's up to the parents as to how a haircut goes - they're actually paying for the haircut not the school.
"It was very to the point."
She also believes the strict rules are squashing a child's way of expressing themselves.
"I think for children it's their way of expressing their individuality. If their parents don't have a problem, why should they (the school)."
The full guidelines, that were included in the letter sent to at least two Gympie hairdressing businesses, are outlined below:

When Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked how he viewed the car attack in Charlottesville, Va., here's how he responded:
"It does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute," he told ABC's Good Morning America.
That certainly seems to suggest the government is looking into a possible terrorism charge against the suspect, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. At Saturday's rally organized by white supremacists, a car slammed into counterprotesters, killing one and injuring 19.
But according to the Justice Department and legal analysts, it's simply not possible for the government to file charges of domestic terrorism, because no such criminal law exists.
The Patriot Act does define domestic terrorism, and under this designation, the Justice Department has broad powers to investigate, said Neal Katyal, a Georgetown University law professor who served as former President Barack Obama's acting solicitor general and as the national security adviser to the Justice Department.
He said the government has three basic ways to approach the Charlottesville case.
"No. 1, this is a hate crime, under the hate crime statutes," he said. "The second is that this is a conspiracy to deprive individuals of civil rights."
"And the third is, this is an act of domestic terror, which isn't itself a crime," he noted. In short, the government can't file a criminal charge of domestic terrorism, but so defining the incident does allow it to investigate not only an individual suspect, but also any group the suspect may be affiliated with.
In an email to NPR, the Justice Department made the same point.
The commonwealth of Virginia, meanwhile, has charged Fields with second-degree murder and other crimes.
The Charlottesville case has again spurred a discussion about describing far-right violence as terrorism. After the al-Qaida attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism was associated primarily with radical Islamist groups based abroad.
The State Department has a list of nearly 60 groups, all foreign, that are identified as terrorist organizations. The vast majority are radical Islamists. And the government can charge a person — American or foreign — with terrorism on behalf of these international groups.
Consider this hypothetical: If the Charlottesville attacker emerged from the car and said he was acting on behalf of the Islamic State, he could be charged with international terrorism, according to Katyal.
Inside the U.S., the political debate appears to be shifting, with growing numbers calling for far-right extremism to be identified as terrorism. But that's almost entirely a political discussion, not a legal one.
On the legal front, there's still a good deal of resistance to creating a criminal charge of domestic terrorism.
"It's an incredibly broad label," said Hina Shamsi, director of the national security project at the American Civil Liberties Union. "There's a real danger of the government criminalizing ideology, theology and beliefs rather than focusing on specific criminal acts."
She said creating a domestic terrorism charge could quickly raise all sorts of political questions about free speech and religion. The ACLU opposes any such law, believing it could be politicized and used, for example, against anti-war groups or environmental activists.
Back in 1995, when Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people with a truck bomb at a federal building in Oklahoma City, it was widely described as the worst act of domestic terrorism to that point.
Yet he was charged with, convicted of and executed for killing federal agents and other crimes — but not terrorism.
The government has historically used the term "terrorism" as a general description for a range of violent acts, including those by right-wing extremists, as well as environmental, anti-abortion and far-left groups. But the specific criminal charge is never domestic terrorism.
Another case came to light Monday, when the Justice Department announced it had arrested a man for allegedly attempting to set off a truck bomb in front of a bank in Oklahoma City on Saturday.
The bomb didn't detonate, the department said. But its description of the case is similar to McVeigh's attack, claiming the suspect, Jerry Varnell, 23, was angry with the government.
The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading what's being described as a "domestic terrorism investigation." Yet the formal charge against Varnell is "attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate commerce."
Not terrorism.

Buffalo Bills general manager Doug Whaley faced a tough line of questioning in his end-of season news conference Monday, after yet another season in which the team failed to make the playoffs.
The Bills ended the season with a record of 7-9, extending their playoff drought to 17 years. That is the longest such drought among all four major North American professional sports leagues.
The organization a number of key decisions to make during the offseason, including hiring a new head coach. Whaley said unlike the hiring of Rex Ryan, the coach decision this time around is his call.
"This search will be different. The first one, I was an assistant GM. The second one, we did by a committee approach. This one will fall squarely on my shoulders," Whaley said. "I have full confidence in myself and the plan that we have in place that we're going to go out and get the best guy for the Buffalo Bills."
Ryan was fired following the team's Week 16 loss to Miami. Whaley said the move was made in a conversation between Ryan and owner Terry Pegula, the details of which Whaley said he was "not privy to." He said he was not aware Ryan was on the hot seat.
Interim head coach Anthony Lynn is among those expected to be interviewed for the job. Reports have called Lynn the front-runner for the job, though Whaley said it will be an "open search." Whaley added the Pegulas will have final say in the hire.
Another key question facing the team is the fate of quarterback Tyrod Taylor and whether to pick up a contract option that would pay him $27.5 million next season. Taylor was benched for Sunday's loss to the New York Jets in what Whaley called a "business decision" in a meaningless game.
"It's going to be a decision by myself and ownership, along with the new head coach," Whaley said. "It's going to be part of the evaluation process, along with everybody else on the team."
Despite facing a grilling by reporters in the 40-minute session, with a number of questioned focused on the organization's chain of command, Whaley tried to put a positive spin on another disappointing season.
"If you look at the season in totality, we did some good things. We did some really good things. We weren't consistent," Whaley said. "We're not a 4-12 team. We're a 7-9 team. Do we need to get better? Absolutely. But we're not that far away, we don't believe."
Canandaigua Speedway Renamed, Joins DIRTcar
Canandaigua, New York—Canandaigua Speedway announced that new track promoter Paul Cole and the Ontario County Fair Board signed an agreement to operate the speedway during 2018 and 2019.

CARS Tour Reduces 2018 Super Late Model Races
Mooresville, North Carolina—CARS Tour President Jack McNelly plans to reduce the number of sanctioned Super Late Model races on the CARS Tour for the 2018 season. Due to the many options throughout the country for Super Late Models, McNelly stated it was hard to create a schedule that will allow teams to commit to the full CARS Tour. Reducing the number of sanctioned CARS Tour races will, hopefully, result in a high car count. The tour launched in 2015 after the discontinuation of the Pro Cup Series. Every CARS Tour race has hosted dual Super Late Model and Late Model Stock races.

Lake County Speedway Gets New Owners and Name

The No. 24 Kentucky Wildcats' softball team entered Monday night's showdown with No. 8 LSU looking to break out the brooms, but Mother Nature had other plans.
Kentucky led 7-0 in the bottom of the fourth inning when a heavy downpour brought a halt to the action at 6:52 P.M., and despite a valiant effort by the UK grounds crew to prep the field, the SEC office called a halt to the proceedings an hour and a half later.
NCAA rules state that each team must have five turns at bat for a game to count in the record books, essentially making the tilt non-existent.
However, despite the disappointing outcome, Coach Rachel Lawson's team put on a tremendous exhibition of softball before the rain started to fall.
Kentucky loaded the bases in the bottom of the first with a trio of singles from Reed, Vick, and Martens. Reed scurried home on a popout by Schaper and was safe due to an error by the LSU first baseman. Then, with one out, Cheek clobbered a three-run homer to the deepest part of center field.
The flurry of runs was enough to chase LSU starter Allie Walljasper from the game, having given up three earned runs and four hits to the first five batters she faced.
The Cats did not have to wait long to hang more runs on the board. With two out in the bottom of the second inning, a Schaper single scored Martens, who doubled earlier in the frame. Following a beanball on Cheek, brought a weak infield hit by Hinz, seemingly destined to be the third out, instead turned into a costly error by LSU that allowed two more UK runners to cross home plate.
Senior starter Erin Rethlake tossed 3.1 scoreless innings. She gave up four hits, walked two batters and struck out one.
Freshman Grace Baalman replaced Rethlake and recorded two outs to get UK out of the top of the third.
The Cats will take to the diamond on Wednesday at Morehead State. First pitch is at 3:00 P.M.
Why there was Civil war and continuous cry of Biafrans – Ben Bruce
By Nwafor Sunday
The senator representing Bayelsa west constituency, Sen. Ben Murray Bruce, has enumerated in a video clip the psycho-causes of Nigerian Civil war in 1967 and the rationale behind the continuous agitation and cry of Biafrans over marginalization and unfair treatment by the federal government of Nigeria after fifty years of war.
‘Let's go back to history to understand why there was civil war in the first place and fifty years later, same people are agitating for independence', he said. Sen. Bruce trailed along history with his learned colleagues, unraveling the consequences of ignorant and negligent of the federal government over what he called non inclusion of the ‘bight of Biafrans' on the Nigeria map.
According to him, “In 1966 we had the first coup which Igbo were alleged to have wiped out the Northern leaders in the military.
“Second coup Gowon took over and there were lots of bloodshed and killings of ndIgbo. “Igbo were killed in the north and they moved back to the Eastern Nigeria were Ojukwu became head of state and declared a nation called ‘Biafra'.
“War started, we fought for three years, the war was over and the South eastern Nigeria was integrated into Nigeria; that is the background” he said.
Sen. Bruce went further to say, “When the war was over, I asked the vice president of Nigeria two fundamental questions which are: Why did you erase the bight of Biafrans from the map of Nigeria? He answered that ‘at the supreme military council meeting they thought Biafra would rise again. “And so the federal government at the time did everything possible not to talk about the war in Nigeria.
“So from 1970 to the present generation of Nigerians who were born did not know we had a civil war. “And I know a lot of young people who do not know Nigeria fought a civil war, he uninterruptedly said.
Proffering solutions to the non inclusive policy of Biafrans bight on the Nigeria map, Sen Bruce said “This policy of being an ostrich and not addressing issues is counterproductive. “If you live in America you will know they have Vietnam War which happened at the same time as Nigerian civil war, we have the Korean War, we have the first and Second World War and we have all kinds of war.
“If you go to the discovering China you will see all their wars on the wall. And the reason they televise these wars is so that you can learn from the mistakes of others so that you will not become a fool to make the same mistakes and fight again.
“Here we are fifty years later talking about something we could have avoided if the federal government at the time understood the value of history. “We erase the civil war from our consciousness and so many generations do not know we fought a war and why we fought a war.
However, Sen. Ben Bruce demystified and counter measured a sectional generalization of Biafrans marginalization, unfair treatment and a call for independent. According to him, “They said they were marginalized, while they fought the war, lost and today they are the most industrious people in the country today. They are the richest Nigerians in the country today. They are the most educated people in Nigeria today yet they feel marginalized, he undoubtedly said.
“If you compare the Igboman to other sections of the society, you will say the Igbo are very privileged because of what they have. “Yet generations of Igbo say they are marginalized, they want to secede and they want a nation.
“Yes a young generation of people who have never seen bloodshed, people being killed, amputated and families being divided. “ Sure they can think like that but what have we done as a nation to educate them about the destruction of war absolutely nothing.
“We do not teach this in our history books, we do not tell our children what war is all about. How many people have carried a gun he quizzed? Those who talk about war, bloodshed and those creating confusion have never fired a shot, so how would they know how people die.
“Have they seen blood? Yet here we are debating on a subject that we as a nation should understand that the education system does not teach it and our people do not understand it and the federal government of Nigeria do not recognize, he said remorsefully.
“If the federal government could not recognize a fundamental problem in our educational system, a fundamental problem in how television is viewed across the country, then we have a fundamental problem.
“We most address the problem from the source. What is the problem? We are the problem. It could be Biafra today, it could be south- south tomorrow, it could be north-east the other day, it doesn't matter.
“The problem is: we are not addressing the problem that unite or divide us and this must be addressed. Our educational system is one of the worst system I have ever seen anywhere in the world. It is terrible, our policy of information make no sense of what so ever and here we are talking about an impending crisis.
“How many people remembered December 31, 1983 when there was military coup, a lot of people forget? I was in the office at Punch newspaper Oluwabodinyi; I don't know he was dying of cancer. Bodinyi said to me ‘Nigeria must change' and we will do whatever it would take to bring down the Shagari administration.
“He did an editorial three to four days before the military coup, front page, back page and inside front page. Within three days military struck and democracy ended. For the people of this country, who do not pay attention to history, who do not read and watch television and to the government that pretends to be deaf and dumb, the government should pay attention to the least of us, they should pay attention to history, there is a way out but to pretend like when she erased the bights of Biafran from the map of Nigeria. No one has the right to erase a name, bight of Biafra from the map and if it is the bight of Biafrans put it back. You have no right to take the bight of Biafrans from the map let's fix our problem,” he finally said.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 23, 2018--Citi has established a service for clients facing the SEC's Rule changes affecting the U.S. mutual fund industry later this year. The SEC's sweeping reporting modernization and liquidity risk management rules place an added operational burden on asset managers. Compliance with the rules requires additional market data, analytics and new reporting infrastructure.
The upcoming rule changes will have a dramatic impact on mutual funds as they will substantially increase automation, data collection and reporting requirements. Regulators and investors will have a level of visibility into mutual funds never before obtained.
Citi has partnered with MSCI and Confluence to help clients satisfy the SEC's reporting modernization and liquidity risk management rules. This collaboration will result in an efficient and effective model that will assist Citi's clients in meeting the new requirements.
“We look forward to helping our clients meet the rigorous demands of the SEC's new mutual fund regulations. Together with MSCI and Confluence, we will create a set of user-friendly services that will help mutual fund managers navigate this complexity with transparency and control,” said Jay Martin, Head of North American Custody and Fund Services, at Citi.
“Asset managers are making their final decision on what solutions to implement as the SEC compliance deadline approaches. MSCI seeks to help them establish prudent liquidity risk management practices and an efficient N-PORT reporting solution,” said Jorge Mina, Head of MSCI Analytics. “We are very pleased to have been selected by Citi to support their plans to comply with the new regulatory requirements.”
Citi's clients will experience a streamlined service designed to assist clients in complying with the SEC's new requirements. MSCI will optimize the delivery of its data and risk and liquidity analytics for easier integration into Confluence's Unity NXT® Regulatory Reporting solution. These analytics include the calculation of market risk sensitivities at a portfolio and position level, and the classification of funds' investments into liquidity buckets, as outlined in SEC Rule 22e-4. Citi's clients will receive easy and efficient access to the data and analytics they can leverage to comply with the SEC's Form N-PORT requirements.
“The depth of data that Citi Fund Services has already consolidated on the Confluence platform during our 20-year partnership will provide a strong basis for the sharing and reuse of data required by SEC Modernization,” said Todd Moyer, Chief Operating Officer at Confluence. “Reusability of data is the cornerstone of regulatory reporting. With the Unity NXT® Regulatory Reporting platform, Citi can leverage a single, validated regulatory data set that can be reused across the entire enterprise rather than having to exchange multiple data files to meet multiple filing obligations.”

But the Europeans argue that none of these issues are covered in the agreement, which was specifically limited to Iran's nuclear program; they are instead subject to separate sanctions.
Mr. Trump cannot wreck the nuclear deal with a stroke of the pen. If he refuses to certify it, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Even if that happens, a dispute resolution process written into the deal provides another month before it is clear that the United States is no longer a party to an agreement accepted by its main allies, the rest of the United Nations Security Council and Iran.
Traditionally, opposition to Iran runs deep in Congress, even among many Democrats. But there are indications that Congress has little appetite to reimpose sanctions, and analysts have said that if Mr. Trump quietly asks Republican hawks on Iran, like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to hold off, they probably would.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis came out publicly on Tuesday in favor of sticking with the deal, while saying that Iran continued to support terrorism and was failing to comply with what he called “the spirit” of the agreement. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson also supports the agreement, though his differences with President Trump have exploded into view lately.
Reports in Washington nevertheless suggest that Mr. Tillerson and others around the president are working on a plan under which Mr. Trump would decertify Iran, but Congress would not reimpose sanctions. After that, Congress would rescind the current law requiring Mr. Trump to issue an opinion on Iran's compliance every 90 days.
Instead, the administration would work with Congress and the Europeans to toughen other sanctions against Iran for its other troublesome activities, including new sanctions against its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, headed by hard-line military commanders and an important economic driver of the Iranian economy.
Mr. Tillerson floated the idea to European counterparts at the United Nations last month, a meeting the Europeans orchestrated so that China spoke first of its support for retaining the deal, and then Russia, before the Europeans did.

The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed in July 2015 by the five permanent members of the Security Council – Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain – plus Germany; the European Union led the negotiations and did a lot of the legwork.

It was devised to ensure that Iran could not build a nuclear bomb, which Iran has said it never intended to do, by severely limiting uranium enrichment for weapons purposes and eliminating the production of plutonium, while allowing for intrusive new inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure compliance. In return, punitive economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union were lifted.
The I.A.E.A. has certified Iran's compliance with up to 400 inspections so far, including 25 unannounced inspections, the diplomats said.

Mr. Trump has twice certified Iran's compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, first in April and then in July, but only after telling his national security team that he was very unhappy with doing so and wanted more options.
Trump supporters like John R. Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, have urged Mr. Trump simply to abandon the deal. Mr. Trump “should cut and cut cleanly,” Mr. Bolton argued recently in The Wall Street Journal. “The ayatollahs are using Mr. Obama's handiwork to legitimize their terrorist state, facilitate (and conceal) their continuing nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile programs, and acquire valuable resources from gullible negotiating partners.”
He argued against the reported Tillerson compromise, calling it “too cute by half.”
For Pierre Vimont, a former senior European diplomat and French ambassador to Washington, what is at stake is a larger effort to manage and limit Iranian influence in the Middle East – the very issue that drives Mr. Trump and Washington's Sunni allies.
“The Sunnis say they are more concerned about Iranian influence generally than the nuclear program,” Mr. Vimont said, “and the nuclear deal was part of the whole process to bring Iran back to a better path.
“But if you start with the Americans decertifying and more sanctions, it's a field day for the extremists in Iran, for the Revolutionary Guard, and the supreme leader will back them, and we fear that any hope to bring more stability in the region will vanish.”
There is also the question of American credibility and reliability, Mr. Vimont said, pointing to North Korea and Russia. Already, he noted, traditional American allies like Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are exploring better ties with Moscow, which is seen as “more predictable, more serious and more rational” now than Washington, he said.

The European diplomats also say that decertifying the Iran deal would complicate matters with North Korea. The North would be far less likely to negotiate a dismantling or a halt to its own overtly military nuclear program if the UnIted States failed to keep its commitments in the Iran deal.
“What kind of signal would this send to countries like North Korea?” asked Peter Wittig, the German ambassador to the United States, during an appearance in Washington where he was joined by his counterparts from Britain, France and the European Union in strongly backing the Iran nuclear agreement. “It would send a signal that diplomacy is not reliable, that you can't trust diplomatic agreements, and that would affect, I believe, our credibility in the West when we're not honoring an agreement that Iran has not violated.”
There are “larger issues” at stake, Mr. Wittig said, including an increased danger that Iran would resume uranium enrichment, the risk of a nuclear arms race in an unstable region and the impact on global nonproliferation efforts.
In sum, said David O'Sullivan, the European Union's ambassador to the United States, “We agree that the demise of this agreement would be a major loss.”
They say opposites attract. But these days, maybe not so much.
A growing number of singles are adding a clause to their online dating profiles telling either Trump haters or Trump supporters — depending on their political preference — that they need not apply.
"This was like a dealbreaker for me," says 50-year-old Elizabeth Jagosz from the Detroit area. "If you are Trump supporter, I'm not even going to consider meeting you for coffee."
It's not just an issue of party politics, Jagosz says. It's about core values. Love, she says, cannot conquer all.
"If you don't care about a person who says you can grab women by the pussy and that's OK — I don't wanna date you if you think that behavior's OK," Jagosz says. "If that's not a dealbreaker for you, then you and I have nothing to talk about."
As another single put it in her profile, "Red hats need not apply."
But the people wearing those red hats — the ones stamped with "Make America Great Again" — have been feeling the same way.
This lack of desire from liberals and conservatives to date each other is what David Goss says prompted him to launch TrumpSingles.com.
"Yeah, it's both ways," Goss says. "You know, like a liberal doesn't want to date a Nazi. And a republican doesn't want to date, well, a whiny snowflake, and that's what they're viewing each other as."
TrumpSingles.com is a kind of safe space for Trump supporters who say they're sick of the "lefties" refusing to even give them a chance.
"[The liberals] are just repeating this left echo chamber of 'Oh, you must be a racist; oh, you must be a homophobe; oh, you must be a misogynist,' " Goss says. "They're judging the people based on who they voted for without actually getting to know them."
Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to the Internet dating website Match.com, says new research from the website shows both liberals and conservatives are moving away from the center of the political spectrum.
"There's a real distinct difference that we're seeing today, and all singles are becoming more rigid in their views," she says.
The data also shows that singles are more likely now to shun those who are at the other end of the political spectrum. And liberals are more likely to spurn conservatives than the other way around.
"I think it's very natural to the human animal to bring it into the idea of 'OK, you like this person, well, you must be like that person then,' " Fisher says. "America is taking this very, very personally. No question about it."
Looking back now, it seems almost unfathomable that even two opposing campaign advisers could cross the aisle and then actually walk down the aisle as James Carville and Mary Matalin did in 1993.
As Carville famously put it once, "You can love the sinner and hate the sin."
The couple says their secret to survival and harmony at home is simply agreeing to disagree.
But today, singles seem to be saying they just can't do that.
"I mean, I wish I could just go out and tell everyone to knock it off and be cool with each other, but it's just not going to work that way," Goss says.
His Trump Singles dating site is up to 35,000 members. LiberalHearts.com, founded by Salvatore Prano, is up to nearly 50,000.
"There's more activity now than ever," Prano says. "I knew liberals would only find comfort in each other's arms."
But there is one other option for lonely liberals. Single Joe Goldman founded MapleMatch.com, a dating site that helps Americans find Canadians "to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency." Goldman became his own first client.
"I can't tell you the sinking feeling I felt [after the election]," he says. "That's not the country I want to live in. So why not consider places that might be more in line with my values, like Canada."
It may be better than the alternative. According to the new Match.com survey, a growing number of liberals today are simply choosing to not date at all.
HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) — A federal judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against Indonesian Christians who are in the U.S. illegally but are seeking to gain legal status, including one man honored for his work helping to rebuild more than 200 homes after Superstorm Sandy.
The order was issued Friday by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and applies to Indonesians who have orders of removal dating to before 2009.
The order affects roughly 50 people in New Jersey who had identified themselves to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2009 as part of a program to obtain work authorization and stays of deportation, according to the ACLU and Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of a church where some of the immigrants sought sanctuary.
The lawsuit came after several enforcement actions by immigration authorities in New Jersey that targeted Indonesian Christians and rekindled fears in a community that includes people who left Indonesia years ago to escape religious persecution.

Two men were arrested last month after they dropped their children off at school. Harry Pangemanan, who has been in the country since 1993 and lives with his wife and two daughters in central New Jersey, sought sanctuary at the Reformed Church of Highland Park, where he is an elder and where he spent nine months in 2012 under similar circumstances.
Two other men, Arthur Jemmy and Yohanes Tasik, already were living there to avoid detention.
“The response from Harry and Arthur and Yohanes was tears, honestly, and just a big sense of relief,” Rev. Kaper-Dale told WCBS 880's Ethan Harp.
The men feared being deported and facing torture back home.
“These are all individuals who escaped the collapse of the Suharto regime in the late ‘90s, and the bloodbath that ensued that was largely targeted against ethnic Chinese Christians,” said Kaper-Dale. “Folks came here, they overstayed VISAs.”
Salas ordered both sides to file briefs over the next month.
“There's no promise in that order that says that ICE cannot detail individuals, but we would hope that the spirit of the ruling would lead ICE to exercise tremendous discretion,” Kaper-Dale added.
A spokesman for ICE's Newark office didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Pangemanan has been staying in a room that doubles as a children's library at the church and had to move his belongings when the library is in use. His family joined him recently after their home was broken into and vandalized after his name was included in news reports.
“We are trying to stay strong as a family, take one day at a time,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press last week. “You do your best today, do something useful, and tomorrow is in god's hands.”
Pangemanan came to the country in 1993 on a tourist visa that was to lapse in five years, he said. His wife came in 1998 during a period of turmoil in Indonesia when Christians were being targeted. They cite that as one reason for not going back.
“A thousand churches were burned to the ground between 1996 and 2003,” said Kaper-Dale, of the Highland Park church. “Some islands are safer than others, but it's too simple to say it's safe now.”
Pangemanan concedes he didn't know enough about immigration law when he first arrived, and wasn't aware he had one year to apply for asylum. At the time, it didn't seem to matter.
“Nobody asked you, as long as you are a good man, you work hard and help your company, and you pay your taxes,” he said. “You're working like everybody else, you don't bother anybody. Then everything changed after Sept. 11.”
Working through the church after Sandy devastated the New Jersey coast in 2012, Pangemanan organized more than 2,000 volunteers, matching their skills with the needs of homeowners whose homes had been destroyed. He said he traveled to other areas of the country to perform similar work, including the Carolinas, West Virginia and Texas.
A system put in place after Sept. 11 required non-citizen men and boys from predominantly Arab or Muslim-majority countries to register and be photographed and fingerprinted.
Pangemanan and Jemmy said they complied, and have repeatedly tried to gain legal status since then, without success.

PASCO COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) — Students in Pasco County head back to the classroom early Monday morning as the first day of the new year began.
Some students in Wesley Chapel stepped foot into a brand-new school. Cypress Creek Middle High School has students in grades 6-11 this year and is expecting about 1,500 kids to be enrolled.
School principal Carin Hetzler-Nettles has been with the school system for several years and even graduated from Pasco County schools.
“It's making those connections with kids and getting them engaged in school so they can do the right work, get their academics and head out into this world and knock it out of the park,” she says as the year begins.
Cypress Creek Middle High is one of two new schools to open in Pasco County this year. The other new school is Bexley Elementary in Odessa. Both were built to help ease the big issue of overcrowding.
Other than building new schools, the school district also rezoned several school boundaries which has many parents and students outraged.
News Channel 8 has spoken with dozens of parents, who say they chose to buy the house they live in based on where they wanted their children to attend school.
“I mean, I brought my family here, and I did what I needed to do and now I'm no longer welcomed at that school,” one parent says.
Superintendent Kurt Browning says that no matter where kids go to school in the county, they are sure to get a good education.
“Kids are resilient, they can adapt, kids can adjust and that's what they are going to do,” says Browning.
Because Pasco is still one of the largest growing counties in the state, the school district is doing its best to keep up with growth. Four more new schools are in the works to help relieve some of the overcrowding.
To help fund these new schools, county commissioners are expected to approve a plan Tuesday, Aug. 15 that will increase school impact fees.
Developers are charged that fee for every new home that is built.
Right now they pay roughly $4,800. Under the new plan, we're told the fee goes up to $8,300 over the next three years.
Some parents argue that isn't enough for the county to build enough schools.
“I mean, it is a step in the right direction what we're doing but we really need all the money. We're way overcrowded,” says parent Claudine Judge.
Like her, many parents are pushing for the full impact fee, proposing roughly $12,000 added on to some new homes.
District officials say they need five new schools because of the exploding growth.
We're told revenue from the raised impact fees will only cover the cost of four schools.
The commission is expected to make a final tomorrow, August 15th.

If you still can't wrap your head around the fact that Netflix is publishing a comic book, maybe this trailer can help. The streaming giant has released an animated trailer for The Magic Order by Mark Millar's comic book empire, which Netflix snapped up last year. It's a six-issue series written by Millar himself with art by Olivier Coipel who's mostly known for his work with Marvel (Avengers, X-Men, Thor). The story revolves around five families of magicians sworn to protect our world from forces of darkness and who are now being hunted and picked off one by an enemy.

This is his bailiwick, though, and there's plenty of it on this strong album. On “Hard Piano,” he's sneering, and “The Games We Play” is staggeringly good: “Caviar facials remove the toxins/This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters.” On “Come Back Baby,” he traces the path from illegal business to legal, from anonymity to fame back to anonymity:
Blew through thousands, we made millions
Cocaine soldiers, once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas, took care children
Let my pastor build out buildings
Rapped on classics, I have been brilliant
Now we blend in, we chameleons
Pusha-T doesn't hurry; he's sniper patient. On songs like “If You Know,” he sometimes raps so crisply and sparsely — “A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us/But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff” — that he almost feels disconnected from the song's rhythm. His syllables have hard edges, and rarely does he let feeling get in the way, though the one exception is “Santeria,” inspired by the murder of his road manager. On this song, you can almost hear the wetness in Pusha-T's rhymes, his typical stoicism traded for something a little short of breath.
Image Pusha-T's fourth solo release is “Daytona.”
“Daytona” was produced in deeply satisfying fashion by Kanye West, with additional production by his longtime collaborators Andrew Dawson and Mike Dean. It is a return to Mr. West's early days as a seeker and reinterpreter of deep samples, but overlaid with the coldness and menace of his “Yeezus” era.
When “Daytona” was released last week, it was met with a fevered response. But in a desert, water has a way of appearing not just wet, but sweet. “Daytona” may stand alone in this moment — particularly in contrast to the woozy, blown-out rap albums dominating the charts because of the primacy of streaming — but it isn't as effective as “My Name Is My Name,” Pusha-T's 2013 full-length solo debut album. “Daytona” is terser, leaving only nits to pick; say, that the second and third verses of “Come Back Baby” lack the fire and wit of the rest of the album.
Authority, of course, is regionally and temporally specific — what's acknowledged as certitude now sounds nothing like it did when Pusha-T was growing up. “I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair,” he raps on “Hard Piano,” a sidelong shot at the excesses of the SoundCloud generation. Pusha-T stands out amid the meditative, louche koans of Playboi Carti or the creaky whine of Lil Baby.
President Donald Trump is making an evening visit to the hospital where the US congressman who was critically wounded Wednesday at baseball practice is receiving treatment.
Trump planned to make the stop past 8 p.m. ET to Medstar Washington Medical Center, where Rep. Steve Scalise, the number three House Republican, underwent surgery earlier Wednesday for wounds sustained in the shooting, which took place outside Washington.
The hospital said after the surgery that Scalise remained in critical condition. A US Capitol Police officer who was also hurt in the gun attack was also receiving treatment at the facility, situated about three miles northeast of the White House.
Ahead of his visit, a White House official said Trump may only be able to visit Scalise's family, which has gathered at the facility, since the lawmaker himself remains critically ill.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump called for unity across party lines during a subdued statement from the White House. He avoided issuing partisan blame for the attack, which was carried out by an assailant who had expressed anger at Trump's election and support for Democratic candidates.
It's the first major domestic incident that has prompted a response from Trump, who spoke straight into the camera during his brief statement from the Diplomatic Reception Room. During his remarks, Trump disclosed that the shooter had died, the first confirmation from any official of the death.
His appearance was shorter than his predecessor's post-shooting statements, and did not contain political overtures, as President Barack Obama's reactions often did. But Trump did strike a similar tone of solemnity, which has become rare during his public appearances until this point.
"Everyone on that field is a public servant -- our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated members of Congress who represent our people," Trump said.
"We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country."

ORLANDO, Fla. — The goal the United States national team needed arrived after only eight minutes. Soon there was another. And another.
By halftime, the whispered pregame fears about the unthinkable — that the United States might stumble and bumble its way right out of a place in next summer's World Cup in Russia — were long forgotten. By the final whistle — after the United States had polished off an encouragingly comprehensive 4-0 dismantling of Panama on Friday night — there were only cheers, and relief, and the acknowledgment that while there was still one more important step toward Russia, the job was nearly done.
The result moved the United States back into third place in its six-team regional qualifying group. That is the final automatic qualification spot — Mexico won the first weeks ago, and Costa Rica entered Friday poised to claim the second. Now, the United States needs only a victory or a tie in its final game, at Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night, to punch its ticket to Russia 2018, and to extend its streak of consecutive World Cup appearances to eight.
Salvation arrived, as it so often has this year, off the foot of Christian Pulisic, the 19-year-old sensation who has quickly become the centerpiece of the American team. Pulisic has scored or assisted on 11 of the 16 goals the United States has scored in the final round of qualifying, and so it came as little surprise when he had a hand in the first two on Friday.

First, he sliced Panama open in the eighth minute, taking a deft touch from Jozy Altidore in midfield and hurdling Panama center back Román Torres like a speed bump before rounding goalkeeper Jaime Penedo. Pulisic's finish, from an awkward, wildly obtuse angle to the right of goal, skimmed into the net. The roar that greeted it was both exultant and cathartic. The Americans had the lead.

Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon's film/TV series ‘The Trip‘ started as a one off adventure. Pals Coogan and Brydon drove around great British eateries and spawned an internet sensation with their dueling Michael Caine impersonations interspersed with human drama and delectable food porn. Three years later, ‘The Trip To Italy‘ found the duo taking their schtick on the road, with Alanis Morissette backing them up. Now, they're completing their triptych, taking on the gastronomic paradise of Spain.
In the Spanish leg of this odyssey, Coogan and Brydon joke and stumble their way through the countryside and taste some of the best food the nation has to offer. In honor of this noble quest, we've decided to pull all the beautiful food from their journey. Below are the six restaurants that Coogan and Brydon eat, drink, and try their best impressions in. Their imitation of Mick Jagger doing Michael Caine is pretty spot on… but rest assured the food is even better.

Five Must-See Destinations In ParisWithin the 41 square miles of Paris, France there are over 60 main attractions for visitors to discover ranging from Museums, Churches, Monuments and Squares as well as examples of contemporary and traditional architecture. This is far too many sites for the average tourist to attempt to visit during a short stay in the city of lights. Thus a list of the five most famous and must see attractions is in order.
SACRAMENTO – California's capital has emerged as a leading destination for Afghan refugees who were awarded special visas because of their service to coalition forces in the war. But life in the United States for them has proven a constant struggle.
These former translators, engineers and doctors awarded Special Immigrant Visas must start over in bug-infested, low-rent apartments with minimum-wage jobs while dealing with PTSD and other health problems, the Sacramento Bee reported.
More than 2,000 such visa holders and their family members have settled in Sacramento since October 2010, and many of them say they are struggling with anxiety and depression that have developed or been greatly exacerbated by their struggles in the United States. They say they feel helpless and abandoned, lacking decent jobs, housing or an understanding of U.S. culture.
One of them is Faisal Razmal, a former interpreter for U.S. soldiers battling the Taliban in Afghanistan who was shot in the face in front of his Sacramento apartment in August 2015 by an assailant wielding a flare gun. A neighborhood teenager and alleged member of a gang has been charged and is awaiting trial. Razmal, 28, who lost the sight in one eye after the attack, said he feels like he also lost a piece of his soul.
“I feel like I'm drowning here,” said Razmal, a father of two and whose wife is expecting.
Before he was shot, Razmal worked as a security guard at a shopping center. Since then, he has tried working as a taxi driver, gas station attendant, security guard and dishwasher. But his limited vision and PTSD have compromised his ability to keep a job, said licensed clinical social worker Jason Swain, who has counseled Razmal 18 times since the assault.
The state Department of Rehabilitation said a decision on his application for disability payments may take a year, Swain said.
Razmal, who survived roadside bombs and firefights during the war, said he was never evaluated for PTSD in Afghanistan or the United States.
Razmal's therapist, Homeyra Ghaffari, said she thinks he was already afflicted with PTSD from his experiences in Afghanistan, and he was “re-traumatized” by his shooting here.
“People hear about America and think it is a dreamland and everything is law and order and they are going to be absolutely safe,” said Ghaffari,
“They feel isolated, don't have any clear direction,” she said. “Their dream shatters right away.”
Auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips are companies with high overheads whose way of doing business hasn't changed that much since the 18th century. Their challenge is to keep up with the growth of global wealth — and make money out of it. Each of the three is pursuing a distinctively different strategy.
“It is a key moment for auction houses, which have struggled for significant profitability,” said Edward Dolman, chief executive of Phillips. Mr. Dolman was referring to the way that in recent years, auction houses have sacrificed large portions of their fees to sellers in order to secure high-value consignments.
Mr. Dolman said that Phillips, owned by the Mercury Group, a luxury goods distributor based in Moscow, had decided to “focus on areas of the market showing significant lines of growth that follow the evolution of taste.”
Twentieth-century and contemporary art is the company's key selling category, raising $421.8 million at auction in 2017, or 60 percent of the annual total. The top auction price was the $28.8 million given in May in New York for the 1991 painting “Rosedale,” by the Scottish-born artist Peter Doig.
Phillips's art auctions are complemented by sales of 20th- and 21st-century design, photography and prints, with further revenue generated by luxury items such as watches and jewelry. In October, the company set a record for a wristwatch sold at auction when Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona sold for $17.8 million.
Phillips is banking on live auctions of art and of luxury goods from the past 100 years to deliver growth from the global 0.1 percent. The company has preferred to invest in high-profile specialists, such as its new chairman, Cheyenne Westphal, formerly worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby's, than in technological innovation. Last year, Phillips held just two online-only auctions, both in collaboration with the web platform Artsy.
By contrast, Christie's, owned by Artemis, a company controlled by the French luxury retail magnate and art collector François Pinault, looks to its own well-established program of online-only auctions to attract new buyers. It held 85 digital sales of luxury goods and lower-value collectibles in 2017, raising £55.9 million, or about $80 million. This represented 1 percent of annual overall sales, but 37 percent of Christie's new buyers.

“We realized the primary advantage of online is not the revenue generated, but the clients we attract through digital,” said Mr. Cerutti, the chief executive.

The art trade is “a market of unique goods and not so many buyers,” Mr. Cerutti said. Last year Christie's sales were fairly evenly spread across the Americas, Europe and Asia. Looking to expand its global client base to places where new wealth is being generated, Christie's opened a gallery in Los Angeles in April. It then closed its second London salesroom in July. Underperforming categories have been rationalized. Christie's decorative arts departments have lost 45 employees worldwide, Mr. Cerutti said, 38 percent of their work force, and no longer hold traditional specialist auctions of English or French furniture.
Last year, auctions generated about 90 percent of sales at both Christie's and Phillips. How can this market expand significantly when traditional collecting areas are falling out of fashion and when just 25 artists generate almost half of all auction sales of contemporary art?
Obviously, valuable, one-off consignments will always boost the figures. Christie's estimates that its forthcoming estate sale of the collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller will raise about $500 million.
Otherwise auction houses “have to be very creative,” Mr. Cerruti said, pointing to Christie's inclusion of Leonardo's “Salvator Mundi” in a New York postwar and contemporary art sale. Nineteen minutes of bidding duly confirmed that this had been a marketing masterstroke. But it was also significant to note that last year, Christie's regular auctions of old master, 19th-century and Russian art were down 11 percent at £205.4 million, or about $293 million.
And, of course, the market can also grow by buyers simply paying more. An extreme case in point occurred in May at Sotheby's, when the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa gave $110.5 million for a 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat painting of a skull.
“New buyers are attracted by well-known brands,” said Anders Petterson, managing director of the London-based analysts ArtTactic. “High prices signal a sense of quality, which reinforces the brand, creating a circuit at the top end of the market,” he added.
In December, Sotheby's said that it sold $4.7 billion of art and collectibles at auction in 2017, a 13.1 percent annual increase. That was short of the $6.6 billion of auction sales achieved by Christie's. But unlike its longtime rival, Sotheby's has diversified into areas such as financial services; art advice, including managing artists' estates; and even image recognition technology. Forthcoming full-year results will reveal how much of its revenue is now derived from such 21st-century business models.
But for the moment, the 18th-century model of live auctions continues to do nicely, tracking global economic growth.
“The market has rebounded in all categories and all geographical areas,” said Mr. Petterson of ArtTactic, which published a review last month of auctions worldwide in 2017. “But we just don't know how technology is going to change things. No one knows the endgame.”

US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania on Monday welcomed more than 20,000 children and parents to the White House to hunt for Easter eggs and participate in egg-rolling races, a tradition that dates back to 1878.
The annual “Easter Egg Roll” revolves around children, who set about finding hidden coloured eggs in the garden bushes around the presidential residence and later roll them toward a finish line aided only by wooden spoons.
“On behalf of the president and (our son) Barron, we wish you great fun and beautiful days coming ahead of us,” Xinhua news agency quoted the first lady as saying.
Specifically, the first lady was in charge of the activities, just like every year, and this was the 139th egg race hosted at the White House, although it was the first time the Trumps had been involved.
A military band was on hand to perform for the guests and White House personnel and volunteers worked “tirelessly” to create a “memorable” experience for all concerned.
Melania and Barron, who travelled to Washington from New York — where they are living until the 10-year-old finishes the school year — appeared with Trump, accompanied by a human-sized white Easter rabbit, on the Truman Balcony to address the invited guests.
“We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before, and we are right on track … I've seen those kids, and they're highly, highly competitive,” Trump said just before blowing the whistle to launch the egg rolling race.
The children attending the event, some wearing red caps with Trump's campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” on them, took part in the race and egg hunt, decorated cookies, wrote thank-you letters to US soldiers and participated in other fun activities.
The smaller children also received visits from several Easter bunnies, along with Elmo from Sesame Street, Peppa Pig and Dr Seuss, among other well-known personalities, who strolled through the crowd on the White House lawn and entertained them.
The president and his family, meanwhile, sat at the decoration workshop tables and helped children compose letters to the troops, along with greeting the guests.
The first lady also took part in another traditional aspect of the Easter event, reading portions of “Party Animals,” written by Kathie Lee Gifford, to the kids.
This year, due to rain in the forecast, the White House had announced that the event would be somewhat curtailed, with only 20,000 guests on hand rather than the more than 35,000 of previous years.
A total of some 18,000 Easter eggs were made available to the kids, however, by the White House.
Also on hand for the event were the president's two older sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, along with their families.
Participating in a conference in the Binyamin Region own of Psagot on Tuesday night were former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, MK Yehuda Glick (Likud), Biinyamin Regional Council Deputy Head Yisrael Gantz, Rabbi Avraham Gisser, and Yigal Dilamoni.
The conference was held to support Judea and Samaria, and Huckabee brought with him a group of 400 American tourists.
The conference began with the MC quoting the verses in the Bible in which G-d promises to give Israel to Avraham's descendants.
Rabbi Gisser said, "After fifty years, it is time we apply sovereignty to all of Judea and Samaria! Half a million people were killed in a five-year civil war in the Middle East. You all know and understand that only sovereignty will bring G-d's blessing and freedom. This is what G-d wants."
Rabbi Gisser also thanked Huckabee for his contributions to Israel.
Glick said, "Shalom (peace) is one of G-d's names. Shalom is also one of the names of Jerusalem. May G-d bless those who bless Israel. And may you be blessed in the Name of G-d. I thank Mike Huckabee from the depths of my heart for being a true friend of Israel,."
Huckabee said, "Israel is an amazing land. Most of these people are visiting here for the first time. It is important for us, as Americans, to visit and to know that we have friends on both sides of the world.
"The settlers live here, in the Binyamin Region, because they believe G-d gave this land to their forefather Avraham, and they live this promise every day. I thank these Jews, who are living in Israel, for allowing us to come here and to see this miracle of a place."
Speaking to Arutz Sheva, Glick said, "There's a new religion in the world and its called 'Political Correct.' And you're not allowed to say that may somehow not sound politically correct.
"We have to do what's right, and we have to face the consequences... Netanyahu has to talk about the need to reach peace through a win-win situation. meaning we build and we build and we recognize the minority and give them their human rights. In the Middle East, Israel is not what is wrong. Israel is what is right in the Middle East. We're the only democracy, we're the most moral country and nation in the Middle East.
"The American people and people with values should support Israel building in Judea and Samaria, together with the Western world, to fight radical Islam.
"Everybody who comes to Israel and sees whats happening here...understands that Israel is whats right in the Middle East and they immediately become ambassadors of the people of Israel, of the state of Israel, and of G-d...and they take with them back the blessings of this holy land, of this special wonderful people."

But as a growing body of research suggests that youth tackle football is harmful to children's brains, not everyone is cheering.
“Why bring girls into it? We should be taking the boys out of it,” said Dr. Robert Stern, director of clinical research for Boston University's C.T.E. Center, which studies chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head. “It doesn't make sense to expose our children to repetitive head impacts during periods of incredible maturation of the most important organ in our body, the brain.”
The number of girls playing tackle football is still low compared to boys — of the 225,000 athletes in Pop Warner youth football programs, for example, just 1,100 are girls. According to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, of the 5.5 million Americans who report playing tackle football, 596,000 — or 10.9 percent — are female.
It is notable that more girls want to play even as annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations reported that participation in high school football went down 3.5 percent over the past five years.
Valerie Palmer-Mehta, a professor of communication at Oakland University whose work focuses on women and rhetoric, said the change is evidence of larger cultural shifts.
“We can thank a constellation of cultural forces for women's involvement in football today, from Title IX to the women's movement, to strong female athletes who have persisted in pursuing their athletic dreams despite a lack of broader cultural support,” Dr. Palmer-Mehta said.

Team sports like football provide well established social, physical and psychological benefits. But a Boston University study released last year found that kids who played tackle football before age 12 may be at higher risk for emotional and behavioral problems later in life. Another study took MRIs of the brains of kids before and after a single season of tackle football, removing from the study anyone who had a diagnosable concussion. Those researchers found that there was a change in the brain's white matter after just one season of play. And a study published in January in the journal Brain found the kind of changes typical of C.T.E. in the brains of four teenage athletes who had died after impact injuries.

Dr. Stern said that it is important to understand that the real danger for C.T.E. is not necessarily concussions, but subconcussive impacts. That is, repeated hitting is damaging — even if it doesn't cause a concussion.
Crystal Sacco, league president and co-founder of Utah Girls Tackle Football, which started in 2015 and is expecting about 400 girls this season, said she doesn't hear many concerns from parents about their daughters playing tackle football.

“I think they feel safe because they're playing against other girls,” she said. And Dr. Stern noted that it is not possible to say whether the research — which looked only at boys — can be generalized to include girls because in an all-girls league, the force of the hits could be different.
But several studies have found that in sports with comparable rules between girls and boys, the rates of concussion are actually higher in women. Not only that, a 2012 statement from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine highlighted research showing that female athletes sustain more concussions than their male counterparts, report more severe symptoms and have a longer duration of recovery than men.
“When it comes to female athletes' participation — regardless of age — we're lacking in truly understanding their experience around head injury,” said Donna Duffy, co-director of the Female Brain Project, a research team at the University of North Carolina Greensboro studying head injuries in female athletes. “We're on the cusp of this; there's a growing body of literature suggesting that biological sex hormones may be impacted or disrupted when a head injury is sustained.”
But while Dr. Duffy cautions more research is needed, she agrees with other researchers that prepubescent kids should avoid playing tackle football.
Parents whose daughters want to play football may feel they have a difficult decision to make. Several programs suggest flag football as a healthier option for both boys and girls, because they learn the strategy of the game and develop agility skills without risking the injuries of tackling.
Last month, the Concussion Legacy Foundation, composed of doctors and former N.F.L. players, recommended that no children play tackle football before age 14. They've created the Flag Football Under 14 program to encourage kids who want to play football to start with flag football until they're older, and Chris Nowinski, the foundation's co-founder and chief executive, says those guidelines apply to both boys and girls.
The N.F.L. has also been promoting its flag football program, which partners with U.S.A. Football to allow kids who play flag football to sport the uniform and logo of an N.F.L. team. The N.F.L. Flag program is open to both girls and boys, and according to Mr. Mumtaz, participation increased 45 percent in the past five years to more than 409,000 in 2017.

Girls varsity flag football has been sanctioned as a high school sport in five states. Jen Welter, the first female coach in the N.F.L., founded Grrridiron Girls, a flag football camp program designed to allow girls of all experience levels to participate. Her most recent camp in Boston had 90 participants.
Dr. Welter suggested that if a girl is interested in playing football, rather than shutting down the conversation entirely, parents could discuss what drives her desire to play and consider ways to play safely.
“Flag is one of those ways,” she said, to allow them “to learn about the game and to develop their skills.”
In an exclusive interview with The Sun newspaper, the winner of the 2017 Big Brother Naija reality TV show, Efe Ejeba, talked about his time in the show and how he will spend his N25million prize money.
The upcoming rapper who spoke during the car presentation in Lagos, and still couldn't believe what has hit him, said his joy knew no bound as he held the keys of his brand-new SUV at a welcome back ceremony.
Here's an excerpt from the chat;
Congratulations, Efe, how do you feel emerging winner of Big Brother Naija?
I am very happy and blessed. I can't thank you people enough for your love, votes and prayers. God bless you a million times.
Now, what are your plans?
You will hear from me.
When you were in the House, some of your fans went as far as climbing the mountain to pray for you, how did you react when you heard about it?
Na so I hear o. You know, in Nigeria, we are very passionate about prayer; when we want a particular thing, we pray over it and I'm glad their prayers for me were answered.
Do you think your humility got you the prize?
I was surprised when I came out and people were saying I'm humble. Well, I would say I'm just me. I'm just the normal Efe, the rude Efe, the street boy.
What would you be your winning strategy?
I didn't go to the Big Brother House with any strategy. The way I lived in the House, na so I dey live for my house. I speak Pidgin English everyday not only because I'm in the Big Brother Naija House. I am an artiste but I'm not the type that sings on the street or at home, I only do it when I'm in my studio, and there was a time in the House when I said I should bring out that my singing side, all my friends know say if you do me, I clear you. I no dey hide my feelings at all.
How do you plan to spend the N25 million you won?
Well, I will spend it based on logistics (Laughs).
Do you have any plan for Marvis after the BBN House?
All those kisses have ended with the show (Laughter).
Did you have any girlfriend before going into the BBN House?
No, I didn't have a girlfriend. Why now? It's because I'm not really particular about girls. I do my thing the way it comes.
By taking you to South Africa, Big Brother Naija gave you the opportunity of your first flight ever. What was the experience like?
Omo na so I dey o. Yes o, na my first experience to fly be that o. I just dey shake like yoyo throughout the journey. Na the Lagos own first shake me but the South Africa own worst because there was turbulence. The man wey dey gist with me, na so the thing lift am. As I don't see the man, na so I double the belt. I pinned my seat belt down till I got to Johannesburg. Yes, it was when we were ascending and descending that I saw hell (Laughter).
What are the lessons you are taking away from the show?
Okay, first is tolerance. Before I went into the House, certain characters were unacceptable to me. But now, I've discovered that there are nice people but they still have some bad characters you have to contend with.
Who was the most annoying housemate?
The most annoying housemate na Efe o. Na me kolo pass for that house.
Who was your crush in the house?
Crush? It was Marvis.
After Big Brother Naija, what's next?
It's music, music all the way. I also look forward to working with Olamide Baddo. He voted for me and promised to support my career. God bless him.
A man and a woman were taken into custody Tuesday morning in a police action in Phillipsburg overseen by the Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office, authorities confirmed.
Town police and the Warren County Tactical Response Team assisted at 25A Cedar Alley. The entrance to the apartment in the white-sided home is around the side.
Neither person struggled or said anything as they were led away.
It wasn't immediately clear why the two people were arrested. The prosecutor's office didn't immediately return requests for more information.

General News of Saturday, 7 October 2017
Source: citifmonline.com
2017-10-07
Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, Minister of Health
The Akufo-Addo government feels that simply paying nursing allowance without any fanfare would not do enough justice to the return of such a policy.
The launch of the restoration of the nurses' trainee allowance, set for to take place in Sunyani in the Brong Ahafo Region on October 10, will see about 58,000 trainee nurses and midwives receive their monthly allowance after they were scrapped in 2016 by the John Mahama government.
The decision to have an occasion just to symbolize the restoration has been criticized as simply a frivolous move from the government by some sections of the public.
The Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, defended the launch, asking why the people would expect the government to restore the allowance quietly.
“We are launching [the restoration of the allowance] to demonstrate to Ghanaians that the government has honored its promise. We don't want to hide in a room somewhere, pay the allowance and that is the end of it. Ghanaians should know what we are doing,” the Minister of Health stated to the Media after appearing before Parliament.
He stressed that, it was important “to communicate the good works of our President and that is why are we being launching. People are happy; they want to jubilate about it and we want them to jubilate about it.”
The trainee Nurses allowance was initially scrapped to allow the various training colleges to admit more students in a decision which was met with wide condemnation.
The National Democratic Congress (NDC) earmarked a students' loan scheme in place of the allowance.
But the Mahama government had agreed to pay a reduced allowance for the trainees temporarily, until such a time that they are finally moved onto the students' loan scheme.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed complete vindication from a congressional memo that alleges the FBI abused its surveillance powers during the investigation into his campaign's possible Russia ties. But the memo also includes revelations that might complicate efforts by Trump and his allies to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry.
The four-page document released Friday contends that the FBI, when it applied for a surveillance warrant on a onetime Trump campaign associate, relied excessively on an ex-British spy whose opposition research was funded by Democrats. At the same time, the memo confirms that the investigation into potential Trump links to Russia actually began several months earlier, and was “triggered” by information involving a different campaign aide.
Christopher Steele, the former spy who compiled the allegations, acknowledged having strong anti-Trump sentiments. But he also was a “longtime FBI source” with a credible track record, according to the memo from the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and his staff.
The warrant authorizing the FBI to monitor the communications of former campaign adviser Carter Page was not a one-time request, but was approved by a judge on four occasions, the memo says, and even signed off on by the second-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, whom Trump appointed as deputy attorney general.
Trump, however, tweeted from Florida, where he was spending the weekend, that the memo puts him in the clear.
“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump' in probe,” he said. “But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2018
The underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the memo. As a result, the document only further intensified a partisan battle over how to interpret the actions of the FBI and Justice Department during the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation that Mueller later inherited.
Some Republicans are citing the memo, released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department, in their arguments that the Mueller investigation is politically tainted.
A closer read presents a far more nuanced picture.
“Having decided to cherry-pick, the Nunes team picked a bunch of the wrong cherries for its own narrative,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University professor and former Bush administration official, wrote in an email.
The memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion had been partially funded by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.
Republicans say a judge should have known that “political actors” were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently and strenuously denied.
Steele's research, according to the memo, “formed an essential part” of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, a firm initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to do opposition research on Trump. Steele didn't begin work on the project until after Democratic groups took over the funding.
The FBI this week expressed “grave concerns” about the memo and called it inaccurate and incomplete. Democrats said it was a set of cherry-picked claims aimed at smearing law enforcement and that releasing the memo would damage law enforcement and intelligence work.
For one, Democrats said Friday that it was misleading and incorrect to say a judge was not told of the potential political motivations of the people paying for Steele's research.
Beyond that, though, the memo confirms the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was “triggered” by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with Mueller's investigation.
The timing makes clear that other Trump associates beyond Page, who was part of the election effort for only a short period and was not in Trump's inner circle, had generated law enforcement scrutiny. The memo also omits that Page had been on the FBI's radar a few years earlier than part of a separate counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence.
The memo focuses on Page, but Democrats on the House committee said “this ignores the inconvenient fact that the investigation did not begin with, or arise from Christopher Steele or the dossier, and that the investigation would persist on the basis of wholly independent evidence had Christopher Steele never entered the picture.”
Other details in the memo could also challenge Republican claims of bias. The warrant requested was renewed on three additional occasions, meaning that judges approved it four times. One of the Justice Department officials who signed off on it was Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.
Trump, who lambasted the FBI and Justice Department on Twitter, was asked if he was more likely to fire Rosenstein and if he still had confidence in the official. The president simply said, “You figure that one out.”
The memo had been classified because it deals with warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The White House declassified it Friday and sent it to Nunes for immediate release.
That disclosure is extraordinary because it involves details about surveillance of Americans, national security information the government regards as among its most highly classified. The release is likely to further escalate the conflict between the White House and Trump's law enforcement leaders.
Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray had personally lobbied against the memo's disclosure, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent.
The memo's release also comes amid an effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to discredit Mueller's investigation. His probe focuses not only on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia but also on whether the president sought to obstruct justice.

Sunderland's survival hopes could depend on owner Ellis Short being able to back David Moyes on the transfer front.
The January window was expected to remain closed to the Black Cats – certainly in terms of any incomings.
Ellis will speak with me and I'll speak with Ellis, I've got no doubt DAVID MOYES
Chief executive Martin Bain last month admitted that Sunderland would not be in a position to go on any shopping spree, given the club's debt, and more pertinently, the fact their wage bill is almost at its ceiling.
But Moyes hopes there could be some leeway, especially in the aftermath of Saturday's 4-1 crushing at Burnley, where the Black Cats lost talisman Victor Anichebe to a hamstring injury.
“We've always said if we could do, we would [try to make signings],” said Moyes.
“But everyone knows we've got restraints.
“I think with what we've got [huge injury problems and Africa Cup of Nations departures] everybody would say of course Sunderland need help, so let's hope maybe something happens and we're able to do that.
TURN TO PAGE 22
“I think the supporters have known the situation.
“The club have made it clear.
“I spoke with Ellis and he's saying ‘let's see what's out there and maybe we can try to do something'.”
Anichebe joins a colossal injury list which includes Lee Cattermole, Lynden Gooch, Jan Kirchhoff, Paddy McNair, Jordan Pickford and Duncan Watmore.
Lamine Kone also damaged his hamstring and came off in the 24th minute of Saturday's depressing afternoon at Turf Moor.
Kone is due to fly out to the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Gabon, where he will be representing Ivory Coast, with Wahbi Khazri (Tunisia) and Didier Ndong (Gabon) also involved for their nations.
Javier Manquillo, Steven Pienaar and Jack Rodwell all returned to the squad on Saturday at Burnley, Pienaar coming on in the second half for Anichebe.
But even with that trio back it still leaves Moyes desperately low on senior player numbers.
The manager says he is in constant contact with the owner over the situation.
“Ellis will speak with me and I'll speak with Ellis, I've got no doubt,” added the Scot. “We'll see what we can do.”
But Moyes admitted tempting players to join a club at the wrong end of the Premier League is not easy.
“It's difficult,” he said. “It will even be difficult to attract the type of players we need.
“We have to say ‘we need you' but that's not going to be easy.”

Two Views of the Putin/Trump Summit
Two Views of the Putin/Trump Summit
Paul Craig Roberts
The meeting that the Deep State strived to make impossible with fabricated "Russiagate" assertions and an orchestrated "investigation" by Mueller has now been set in place by no less that Deep State neocon operative John Bolton. Patrick Lang explains how this came about:
Many see benefits from the Putin/Trump meeting. For example:
Putin himself sees benefits in the meeting as does Trump. Putin sees hope of improving relations between the two governments. Of course, the "strained relations" are entirely due to Washington, which has demonized both Russia and Putin with false accusations and hostile acts such as illegal sanctions. It was miscalculation for Washington to expect Russia to give up its Black Sea naval base to Washington's coup in Ukraine.
What can an agreement be based on? Bolton's position has been opposed to making any agreement with Russia or cooperating with Russia in any way. From the neoconservative standpoint, Russia is in the way of US world hegemony. As the neoconservative foreign policy doctrine states, it is a principle US goal to prevent the rise of any country that could serve as a check on American unilateralism. Russia is a challenge to the American World Order because Russia stands in the way of the American unipolar world.
A successful summit will require Trump to reject this neoconservative doctrine. If Trump can pull this off with Bolton sitting by him, Trump's critics will look very silly. Do Bolton and the Deep State have a way of baking failure into the summit that will ensure the continuation of Russia's enemy status, thereby sustaining the enormous budget and power of the US military/security complex? Is Trump a superman who can overcome this powerful vested interest about which President Eisenhower warned Americans in 1961? How much stronger is this complex more than half a century later after being nourished by decades of Cold War and War on Terror?
Assad and no doubt Iran are convinced that negotiations with Washington are a waste of time. Assad has concluded that "the problem with US presidents is that they are hostage to lobbyists. They can tell you what you want to hear, but they do the opposite. That's the problem, and it's getting worse and worse. Trump is a stark example. That's why when talking to the Americans, discussing something with them does not settle anything. There will not be any results. It's a simple waste of time."
Assad's view has the evidence on its side. One of Trump's first actions was to unilaterally pull out of the multi-nation Iran nuclear agreement. There is no evidence that supports the hopeful Russian view.
It would be an interesting exercise to list all the agreements Washington has made over the course of US history and to calculate the percentage that Washington kept. If Putin doesn't want to be taken for a ride, he should contemplate the words of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce summing up his negotiations with Washington: "I have heard talk and talk, but nothing is done. I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and broken promises."

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday condemned Venezuela's decision to order Spain's ambassador out of the country in response to the EU slapping sanctions on seven senior Venezuelan officials.
The Spanish government, meanwhile, announced it was expelling the Venezuelan ambassador in a tit-for-tat move.
European Commission spokeswoman Catherine Ray said the decision to impose travel bans and asset freezes on the seven Venezuelan officials accused of human rights abuses or breaching the rule of law was made unanimously the EU's 28 member countries.
The EU is in "full solidarity with Spain," Ray said.
In response, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called his country's ambassador to Spain, Mario Isea, back to Caracas for consultation.
Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting Friday that Isea was being expelled "in a strict application of the rule of reciprocity."
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza tweeted that "we won't accept aggressions from governments subordinated to U.S. imperialism."
French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday he was "rather favorable" to increasing European sanctions on Venezuela.
Speaking after a meeting with Argentina's president in Paris, Macron denounced what he called "a new shift toward more authoritarianism" from the Venezuelan regime.

FILE PHOTO - Newly named National Security Adviser Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster listens as U.S. President Donald Trump makes the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida U.S. February 20, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo
By Kay Johnson
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser met Pakistan's prime minister and army chief on Monday and emphasized "the need to confront terrorism in all its forms", while praising democratic and economic development.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed hope that the new U.S. administration might mediate between Pakistan and longtime foe India over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
H.R. McMaster was on his first South Asian trip since the new U.S. administration took office in January, earlier stopping in Afghanistan, Pakistan's war-ravaged neighbor to the west.
Official statements on Monday gave little indication of whether the Trump administration would adopt a new, tougher policy on Pakistan, as some Afghan officials and Islamabad's arch-foe India would like.
Afghan officials have long accused Pakistan of providing Taliban insurgents shelter, and perhaps support, on its side of the countries' porous border.
Pakistan denies it shelters the Afghan Taliban and says it fights against all the region's jihadist groups with equal vigor.
McMaster - a U.S. Army general who served in the American-led international force in Afghanistan - indicated frustration with Pakistan in an interview with an Afghan news channel on Sunday.
"As all of us have hoped for many, many years, we have hoped that Pakistani leaders will understand that it is in their interest to go after these groups less selectively than they have in the past," he told TOLO News in Kabul.
"And the best way to pursue their interest in Afghanistan and elsewhere is through diplomacy not through the use of proxies that engage in violence."
In Pakistan, McMaster's gave no interviews and the official statement on his visit was more diplomatically couched.
"General McMaster expressed appreciation for Pakistan's democratic and economic development, and stressed the need to confront terrorism in all its forms," the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
McMaster met Prime Minister Sharif and Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa as well as top foreign policy and national security officials.
"The prime minister conveyed Pakistan's readiness to work with the international community to explore ways in which the Afghan crisis can be resolved," Sharif's office said in a statement.
It also said Sharif would welcome U.S. mediation in Pakistan's disputes with India.
"(Sharif) welcomed President Trump's willingness to help India and Pakistan resolve their difference particularly on Kashmir and noted that this could go a long way in bringing sustainable peace, security and prosperity to the region."
The Indian-administered side of Kashmir has seen a recent spike in separatist violence amid accusations of brutality against supporters of the 28-year-old insurgency that India accuses Pakistan of fomenting. Pakistan denies the accusation.
The nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.

Q. Is it safe to take pictures of the sun with my digital camera during the solar eclipse this month?
A. The total solar eclipse headed for parts of the United States on Aug. 21 will be an opportunity for amateur and professional photographers alike, but precautions should be taken to protect both eyes and cameras. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an extensive guide to viewing the event, with a page of frequently asked questions that covers the specifics of photographing the eclipse with either a standard camera or a smartphone.
The safest time to look up or snap photos during the eclipse is at the “moment of totality” when the moon fully moves into place to block out the sun, and only the faint ring of the sun's corona is visible from behind the moon. Looking directly at the sun during a normal day or a partial eclipse can injure your eyes. Experts advise wearing a pair of special-purpose “eclipse glasses” or looking through a solar viewer device. (Make sure you purchase the products from a reputable vendor, like those recommended by the American Astronomical Society, as unsafe frauds have already been reported.)

If you are using a digital S.L.R. camera with its large sensor, definitely put a solar filter over your camera lens to reduce the sun's intense brightness and protect your gear from damage. A solar filter is also a good idea for a point-and-shoot camera.

High-quality mobile cameras, like those used by the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S Android phones, have lenses and auto-exposure settings that should be able to take quick pictures of the sun without suffering damage. But to protect your eyes (and lingering doubts about sensor safety), taping on a solar filter is safer; a smartphone photography tipsheet on NASA's site recommends using the filter.
Andrew Symes, who specializes in astrophotography with his iPhone 7, also has tips on his Canadian Astronomy blog. The cameras in the iPhone 7 line, which include optical stabilization and exposure controls, can handle lowlight photography for pictures down on the ground during the full eclipse; Apple Watch owners can also use those devices as a camera remote for the iPhone.
That no-no was the first for the A's since Dallas Braden's perfect game against Tampa Bay in 2010. It had been almost exactly 25 years since the Red Sox were held hitless.
Manaea's father settled in Indiana after being stationed there in the Army, so except for his own family, he didn't grow up around the Polynesian-like culture known for producing big football players, many of them now in the NFL, instead of big league pitchers.
"I played basketball from fourth grade to my sophomore year. I was tall and it was something to do in the winter," he said. "It was fun for a while, but after my sophomore year, I was like, 'Yeah this isn't for me.' I can't dribble the ball, I'm not physical enough. I'm skinny."
Manaea continued to progress and excel in baseball. He went to Indiana State and had a standout summer in the Cape Cod League before the Kansas City Royals picked him 34th overall in the 2013 amateur draft.
The Royals traded Manaea to Oakland in 2015 when acquiring Ben Zobrist. Manaea made his big league debut the next season, and in his 58th career start Saturday threw his first complete game.
"The thing that impresses me the most is he's doing it differently than he did when he first got here," Melvin said. "Just his stuff, he could get away with making some mistakes. ... He's a three-pitch pitcher now. He commands both sides of the plate."
Melvin describes him now as a "true pitcher" and not just a thrower anymore.
Manaea didn't really get any sleep Saturday night.
"My mind was going a million miles a second, and I just couldn't get that moment out of my head," he said. "It's something I never really dreamed of. ... It's just a really, really cool moment."
Before watching the highlights over and over throughout the night, he had a video call with his parents, who over the years have become obsessed with baseball like their son.
"They love everything about the A's," Manaea said. "Ever since I started getting more and more advanced with baseball, they were always there for me, and they drove me to practices, drove me to games. They're all in on baseball."

Choice of schools for students: Qualities parents should look for
By Dayo Adesulu
IN making a choice for a good school, children rely absolutely on the decision of their parents. The outcome of such decisions made by parents either makes or mars the education of the children.
It has been discovered that parents want the best for their children, but in many cases, their choices may not be good enough for the wellbeing of such children. Often, what many parents believe to be qualities of a good school are far from what makes up a good school.
Parents choose different schools for different reasons. Some of the reasons are proximity of the school to the home, low fees, high fees, name, or beautiful school environment. Some parents are known to even raise loans to place their children in an ivy league school. It's no longer news that in their quest to see their children socialise with the rich in society, some poor parents do go to any length to place them in ivy league schools in the belief that the child could end up marrying into a rich family.
Meanwhile, the core value which is key to quality education that parents should look for in schools are missing in their quest.
Quality education
In examining the issue, former Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, NUC, Professor Peter Okebukola, listed three things parents seeking good schools for their children should look for. According to him, academic standing, safety and level of focus on values and 21st Century skills are key variables to look for while searching for good schools.
Speaking on academic standing of a school, he said that the primary goal of sending the child to school is for the development of knowledge and skills, adding that the academic standing of the school will largely play a role in meeting this goal.
He maintained that if a school is well rated academically and the products are known to excel in school and public examinations, parents should encourage their children or wards to select such a school. He explained, however, that high standing in the academic profile of a school will come with other features such as good quality teachers and good quality environment for teaching and learning. “These collateral features are great attractions for prospective students,” he said.
Closely allied to academic standing is the safety of the child in the school. Okebukola urges parents to be reasonably satisfied with the safety of the school environment and the safety procedures in place at the school before taking their children there.
He said:, “in recent times, this factor is rising to greater prominence on account of kidnappings and cult-related killings in our schools. Parents will have to directly or indirectly assess the safety profiles of schools and advise their children and wards to select those schools with minimal safety threats.”
The third factor that parents should look at while searching for good schools, according to Okebukola, is the values that are promoted by the school. He said, “parents will be excited to send their children to schools where good morals, values and 21st Century skills are taught. Parents will have embarrassing moments if after a semester or two, their children come home with obnoxious manners and depraved values.
“On the other hand, they will be pleasantly surprised and happy if their children attend a school and after a year or so, they are better behaved and there is a positive turnaround in their negative behaviours.
So, parents should have an ear to the ground to get a picture of schools where good morals and values are taught and advise their children to gravitate towards selecting such schools.”
Speaking in the same vein, Professor of Educational Psychology and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, University of Calabar (UNICAL), Prof. Florence Banku-Obi, said quality teachers, security, curriculum, size of class and facilities should be considered while making choice of schools.
She said: “The watch word for parents is the quality of teachers. Are the teachers in the school we covet to place our children really trained? There are expensive schools all around without teachers. What many parents think of is the big edifice without quality teachers. However, the quality of teachers should be numbed one. Moreover, parents should look for the security of the student.
“Is the place called school adequately fenced? Is it so close to the road, so that the kid while playing could run to the road? This should be considered first in your choice of schools. The curriculum in use is another factor for consideration. The curriculum is important, because we are Nigerians. I know some private schools that tell you that they are using American curriculum. They are running American curriculum in Nigeria environment.
“Meanwhile, the children in the school are being prepared for the Nigerian society. Such students in the future will sit for WAEC, NECO and JAMB that are Nigeria-based. If ever they must use foreign curriculum, they must ensure to blend it with the Nigerian curriculum. Once teachers are trained and they know what to do, they will be able to relate well with the children.”
Classroom management
On number of children in a class, Banku-Obi said: “Parents should not send their children to schools where the class population is too large. Forty to fifty children in a class should be discouraged. Twenty to twenty-five should be the maximum in an ideal class for good classroom management and individualized attention of the children.
“For parents to pay huge amounts of money for their children in any school, their children should be given the maximum attention and teaching, because some children are high performance, while some are low performance children. In private schools, we need to individualize our teaching so that slow learners could be easily carried along. Parents have to consider the type of attention the school use in teaching, whether individualized attention in teaching or collective teaching.
“Besides, we need to think of the facilities in the school. What type of building are they using? Do they have teaching aides to guide the children while teaching? We are to look at the library and the computer library of every school if they are adequate for the pupils. Parents should not use the huge fees paid in a school to determine the quality. High fees do not necessarily determine the quality. Many parents take delight in saying, ‘I pay N500,000 a term for each of my children, how much do you pay for yours?' Many of such parents know nothing about quality of the school, but the high fees. This should be discouraged.
“We have seen cases where parents send their children to private schools and when they come to the university, we still found them wanting. We have some of these private schools where their teachers are not well trained, but want to give this impression that their schools are good and doing well. These are the schools that keep exposing answers to the children to make good grade at that elementary level. You may think the children are doing well, but when you examine them one-on-one, the children are not able to perform well.”

Nothing on earth is forever permanent so everything under this sun apart from the Holy Religious Scriptures will definitely come to an end someday. So in reality, no man will stay on top in life forever,­ likewise also be at the bottom forever.
In similarity to our local music indu­stry, whiles some art­iste gets their break­through in a particular year with on­e or two music singles which makes all the waves for them, maj­ority also keep struggl­ing to get hit songs despite several efforts making them get less recognition in the industry.
Last­ year 2015, Bisa Kdei­ had his breakthrough­ in the music industry with his ‘Mansa and ­Brother Brother's' hit­ songs as it enjoyed massive airplay on radio, TV and also became t­he peoples' favorite ­songs for their parti­es and festivities.
But in t­he year 2016, times have changed a bit for Kdei because he has been struggling to get a hit these days. Sarkodie has enj­oyed some good times ­with his hit songs li­ke ‘Baby, U Go Kill Me, Adonai, etc' in the past y­ears but he is still struggli­ng to get another hit song ­that will be on the l­ips of many Ghanaians including kids. Although, he keeps making waves because of the brand he has created over the years.
Nothwithstanding, thi­s piece will seek to ­throw more light and ­acknowledge some few young and ­upcoming artistes who­ stand the big chance of taking over the Ghanaian music scene in years to come and continue the legacy left behind by rappers like Sarkodie, Obrafour, Okyeame Kwame, etc…
Their effort of taking over the future mantle of the industry is being measured in relation to their output so far in the industry in 2016­ provided they still ­keep pushing without becoming complacent in years to come. The young and upcoming artistes to be looked at not arranged in any order of importance are below:
MEDIKAL­ Medikal to take rap crown after Sarkodie Medikal, real name Samuel Adu Frimpong, is currently one of Ghana's fastest rising ­and youngest hip hop ­artistes. He is currently signed to Criss ­Waddle's AMG (The Ara­b Money Gang) Busines­s record label. Medik­al had his breakthrough when he released the ‘sick track' titled ‘connect' when he mimicked the rap style­s of seven great arti­ste in Ghana. Right a­fter, he has been featured on a lot of tracks in the year under review. He has released songs including Co­nfirm, Forever My Lo­ve (featuring Bisa Kd­ei), Confirm Remix (featuring Sarkodie), ­By Heart Boy, Connect, Too Risky and others. Ther­efore, as we've entered into a New ­Year of hope, entertainment pundits and music lovers in the country are expecting an­d hoping to see Medik­al breaking boundarie­s with his rap style and kind of music he does.
KOFI KINAATA­
The High Grade Family­ member Martin King Arthur popularly known­ as Kofi Kinaata is k­nown for his Fanti ra­p and freestyle dexte­rity to combine humou­r to rap lyrics. The ­self-acclaimed Fanti ­Rap God has proven be­yond doubt that he w­as born to do music. ­He won the Song Write­r of the Year and Bes­t New Artiste of the ­Year awards at the 20­16 edition of the Vodafone Ghana Music Awa­rds with his single ‘­Susuka'. He just rele­ased the much anticip­ated hit single title­d ‘confession' which ­is doing well in the ­airwaves. I believe i­t's just a matter of ­time for Kofi Kinaata­, because he's defini­tely part of the future of the Ghanaian music industry.
STRONGMAN­ Vincent Kweku Osei kn­own on stage as Strongman is part of those­ who holds the future­ of rap music in Ghan­a. Forget his age, th­e nature of his raps ­shows that he is a fo­rce to reckon with in­ Ghana's rap music industry. T­ruly, when I look bey­ond this Sarkodie era­ in Ghana's rap music­, I clearly see the S­trongman era! His abi­lity to fuss proverbi­al sayings with rap m­ake listening to him ­enjoying in any day. He won the Next Big T­hing In Gh Hip-Hop fe­w years ago which sho­t him into fame on the ­national level and mo­ved ahead to sign unt­o the Mic Burners Lab­el. It's the expectat­ions of music lovers ­in the country to see­ strongman continuing­ the rap legacy laid down by ­Sarkodie in some time­ to come through hard­ work.
PERSONAL OBSERVATION However, ­many young Ghanaian musicia­ns have come to spice­ our music scene with­ some one-time hit songs which­ was embraced by the ­majority just like how these young acts has been predicted as the future of GH rap are doing but sadly, those artists impact in the music­ industry became short lived as they could­n't live up to the expectations and some are listed below with their hit tracks allocated: Atom – ‘Ye Wo Kurom', O­D4 – ‘Darling', Secur­e Pabene – ‘Secure', ­Dr Slim – ‘Seke' feat­. Dobble, Mimi – ‘Lea­ve Me Alone' feat. 4X­4, Diamond – ‘Popping­', Zigi – ‘You Say We­y Tin', Nana Boro – ‘­Aha Ye De', Okuraseni­ Samuel – ‘Homework',­ Eduwodzi – ‘Yenko Nk­oaa' feat. Stay Jay a­nd many others.
There­fore, we're hoping ac­ts like Medikal, Strongman, K­ofi Kinaata, TeePhlow­, and many other hardworking upcom­ing acts will not rel­ax but keep the fire ­burning with back to back hit tracks into the Ghanaian music industry till the worl­d acknowledges and recognises them.
I Did Not Want To Sell James Rodriguez – Zinedine Zidane
Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has claimed that he did not want James Rodriguez to leave the club last summer.
James Rodriguez struggled for regular action at the Bernabeu during the 2016-17 campaign, and completed a surprise loan move to Bayern Munich for the 2017-18 season.
Rodriguez will be eligible to take on his parent club in the semi-finals of this season's Champions League, with the first leg due to take place at the Allianz on Wednesday night.
Zidane, however, has said that he wanted to keep the 26-year-old in the Spanish capital.
“I didn't want James to go, he decided to go. I never had any problem with James and it's more about what is said in the press,” Zidane told reporters.
“I think he will be motivated because he is a football player. He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone. Anyone that thinks I am against James is wrong. He will want to go out and prove himself but because he likes football and that's it.”

Chrome OS version 64 has made its way to stable channel, which means it's hitting your device very, very soon if it hasn't yet. It'll add a handful of new features and improvements, including a screenshot shortcut if you have a Chromebook with a 360-degree hinge like the Acer Spin. You only have to press the power and the volume down buttons at the same time, like what you'd do on an Android phone. It also adds a flag to make Split View easier to activate and gives Android apps the ability to run in the background. In addition, the update improves your lockscreen's performance, presumably making it faster, and finally enables the use of VPN for apps downloaded from Google Play.

‘NFF Must Learn Lessons From Eagles' Defeat To Bafana'
Nigerian international and Fulham forward, Sone Aluko has urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to learn lessons and move on from Super Eagles' stunning defeat to South Africa last weekend in Uyo, saying there are lots of improvements to be made.
Goals from Tokelo Rantie and Percy Tau were all Stuart Baxter's men needed to silence Nigeria at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo – a result that could have big implications in the race for 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
Though hurt about the three-time African champions losing their invincibility to Bafana Bafana, the 28-year-old whose brace rescued the team from defeat in 2014 is trusting the Eagles can make adjustments from the frustrations of their performance against the 1996 African champions.
‘'It was painful and every time Super Eagles lose it's always painful,'' Aluko told Goal.
‘'I'm a fan first and foremost and as somebody who wants to go back into the team it is even more frustrating because you feel like there is something you can help offer the team.
‘'It's just ironical; same stadium, same two nil. We lost this game 2-0 and when I played [against South Africa in 2014]; I scored two goals though there's no saying if I played this game I'd have scored two goals.
‘'But we shouldn't even be looking for miracles because the Super Eagles are big enough to win games. Any team can lose games, that can happen but I think the manner of the loss is what pains people the most.''
Nigeria face Cameroon on August 28 as the race for 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia gets hotter, and Aluko reveals the kind of change Rohr's men need.
‘'Well, success is not a very good teacher. Sometimes when you keep winning you're successful you don't actually learn much,'' he continued.
‘'But sometimes when you lose, it highlights the small errors and small margins you have to improve on.
‘'So if we take lessons from that defeat, the Super Eagles will be back. We were missing key players and the defending wasn't great.
‘'The team didn't seem like it gelled well, so there are lots to take from the game. Even the attacking seems disjointed. Before facing Cameroon, there are lots of improvements that can be made.''

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State of the Union is ...
Great again? Or not quite?
However he describes the country's condition on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will defend his accomplishments and lay out his plans before a chamber packed with members of Congress, the Cabinet and the Supreme Court plus a few choice guests — and with millions of Americans watching on television. It will be the former reality show star's first State of the Union speech, a formal report to Congress that the Constitution requires of the president "from time to time."
For any president, the prime-time speech is a high-stakes statement of purpose. A year into his presidency, Trump stands before the nation to account for his promise to "make America great again" amid talk of a rising threat of nuclear war and special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of the president and his 2016 campaign.
For both parties, the speech operates like the pop of a starting gun for the midterm elections, when Republicans will defend their majorities in the House and Senate.
A look at what to watch:
___
HOW SUPERLATIVE?
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday previewed the speech by describing the State of the Union as "incredible."
But will the hyperbole-loving president tone down his bombastic speaking style a bit? The White House is setting expectations as close to "yes" as possible — but only for as long as the speech itself lasts. Expect the president to cast the tax overhaul he signed in December and the strong economy as Trump initiatives that help all Americans. Thematically, Trump is expected to speak of having built the foundation for a safer and stronger nation.
But can Trump stay on message — and off Twitter — after the reviews come in?
___
THE ELEPHANT IN THE CHAMBER
Will Trump make any mention of Mueller's probe of Russian connections and obstruction of justice, or his own expressed willingness to be interviewed under oath? Trump told reporters last week he'd "love" to be interviewed under oath about the matter. But his lawyers didn't seem as enthusiastic and are still negotiating.
___
FLOTUS
First lady Melania Trump will face extra scrutiny this year — and not just because of the former model's fashionable couture.
Mrs. Trump's movements have been closely ever watched since The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the president's lawyer had arranged a payment to an adult film star, Stormy Daniels, to keep her from talking about an alleged 2006 affair with the future president. The couple's 13th wedding anniversary passed without public comment last week, and Mrs. Trump abruptly announced she was skipping a trip with her husband to an economic summit last week in Switzerland.
___
WHO'S THERE
Often who is in the chamber reflects the president's priorities. Seated around Mrs. Trump will be more than a dozen guests, including small-business owners, beneficiaries of tax relief, victims of gang violence and a police officer who adopted a baby from parents addicted to opioids.
Democrats are strategically populating their guest lists, too — with faces of the immigration debate that is roiling Congress and vexing Trump. Their guests will include immigrants who are among the nearly 700,000 people who received protection from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Trump canceled the program last year but gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative fix.
___
WHO'S NOT
Traditionally, one member of the Cabinet stays away from the address for security reasons. One question is whether Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump nominated for the Supreme Court, will attend the speech. Justice Samuel Alito, who shook his head and mouthed "not true" at President Barack Obama during the 2010 State of the Union speech, has not attended a presidential address since.
Some Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott the president's address.
___
WHAT THEY WEAR
Typically, some female lawmakers wear bright colors so they will stand out on television. But this year, several Democratic women plan to wear black to protest sexual harassment after a season of scandals toppled male leaders across industries. Congress is no exception: Accusations have forced resignations and retirements in both parties. Trump, too, has faced sexual assault allegations.
___
REBUTTAL
Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts will deliver the Democratic response to the president's address. He is the grandson of the late Robert F. Kennedy, the senator and U.S. attorney general, and the son of former Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, who served in the House from 1987 to 1999. Democratic leaders are pitching Kennedy as someone who can champion Democratic policies to the middle class.
___
THEN THIS HAPPENS
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is scheduled to appear on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following Trump's address. She said she had an affair with Trump shortly after he married Melania Trump.

Have you taken a moment to think about our IWGP Heavyweight Champion (Gedo voice) THE RAINMAKER (end Gedo voice) Kazuchika Okada yet today? Hey, if you haven't, that's okay. We all slip up sometimes. But now AXS TV, the exclusive American broadcaster of New Japan Pro Wrestling, is making it easier for fans to appreciate the 700+ day champ.
On weeknights from May 30 to June 14, leading up their broadcast of his historic twelfth successful title defense at Wrestling Dontaku against Hiroshi Tanahashi, AXS will air each of the matches from Okada's current championship reign at 5 a.m. Eastern/2 a.m. Pacific Time.
Here's the Okada marathon schedule, per AXS TV press release:
5/30 – Okada vs. Tetsuya Naito – Dominion 6.19 – June 19, 2016
5/31 – Okada vs. Naomichi Marufuji – King of Pro-Wrestling 2016 – Oct. 10, 2016
6/1 – Okada vs. Kenny Omega – Wrestle Kingdom 11 – Jan. 4, 2017
6/4 – Okada vs. Minoru Suzuki – The New Beginning in Sapporo 2017 – Feb. 5, 2017
6/5 – Okada vs. Katsuyori Shibata – Sakura Genesis 2017 – April 9, 2017
6/6 – Okada vs. Bad Luck Fale – Wrestling Dontaku 2017 – May 3, 2017
6/7 – Okada vs. Omega – Dominion 6.11 – June 11, 2017
6/8 – Okada vs. Cody – G1 SPECIAL IN the USA – July 1, 2017
6/11 – Okada vs. EVIL – King of Pro-Wrestling 2017 – Oct. 9, 2017
6/12 – Okada vs. Naito – Wrestle Kingdom 12 – Jan. 4, 2018
6/13 – Okada vs. SANADA – The New Beginning in Osaka 2018 – Feb. 10, 2018
6/14 – Okada vs. Zack Sabre Jr. – Sakura Genesis 2018 – April 1, 2018
6/15 at 8pE/5pP – Okada vs. Tanahashi – Wrestling Dontaku 2018 – May 4, 2018
For those who primarily keep up with NJPW on New Japan World, this block of programming could also be a fun way to catch up with Okada's defenses (including 2/3 of the acclaimed Omega/Okada trilogy) before he faces Kenny Omega at Dominion on June 9.
(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File). FILE- In this June 17, 2017, file photo, Bill Cosby exits the Montgomery County Courthouse after a mistrial was declared in Norristown, Pa. On Thursday, March 15, 2018, a judge agreed to let five additional Cosby accusers ...
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A judge is pushing back the start of Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial just a few days after rejecting his lawyers' demands for a three-month delay.
Judge Steven O'Neill on Monday moved the start of jury selection to April 2 from March 29. He scheduled hearings March 29 and 30 to resolve pretrial issues.
Cosby's lawyers were pressing for a longer delay after O'Neill ruled last week that up to five additional accusers could testify. They argued they needed more time to investigate the women's allegations and work up a defense.
Cosby has pleaded not guilty to charges he drugged and molested Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004.
Cosby's first trial last year ended in a hung jury.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has.

Camfed's mission is to eradicate poverty in Africa through the education of girls
Mr John Asibi Ali, National Director for Campaign for Female Education (Camfed) Ghana has commented government for taking the bold step to implement the Free Senior High School (SHS) policy to alleviate the plight of parents.
He said Camfed would complement government's efforts in intensifying its campaign to ensure that children were adequately resourced to enhance education in the country and lessen the challenges parents faced.
Mr Ali gave the commendation during its 2017 National Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Tamale, on the theme: “Leveraging resources for girls' education and transition to secure livelihood: Every stakeholder counts”.
He said access to free and quality education should be indispensable for national development, saying “Camfed would continue to provide educational opportunity to girls to empower them to become leaders of change”.
Mrs Matilda Bannerman Mensah, Board Chairperson of Camfed Ghana indicated that, the five year strategy plan of Camfed was focused on three thematic areas aimed at impacting on the life of the girl child and young women to secure better livelihood.
She said the three areas were to unlock new resources for girls' education; unleashing new potential for young woman's leadership; and igniting new action to accelerate change, to transition the girl child to be a better woman.
Alhaji Mohammed Haroon Cambodia, the Northern Regional Director of Education said the advocacy for girl child education in the region is yielding positive results, especially with the implementation of the free SHS policy.
He said the ration of boys to girls at the low primary and Junior High School (JHS) was one to one and expressed optimism that with Camfed in the picture, more girls in the region would gain access to secondary school education.
Alhaji Cambodia lauded Camfed Ghana for the enormous strides made towards improving the girl child education to transition them towards becoming prominent future leaders.
The national AGM provides a unique opportunity for Camfed Ghana to report on major team and programmatic activities that have been undertaken in the year and to receive input from stakeholders that would inform strategies and approaches for the coming years.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The start of Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial is being pushed back a few days to give both sides more time to wrangle over pretrial issues.
Judge Steven O'Neill issued an order Monday moving the start of jury selection to April 2. It had been scheduled for March 29.
O'Neill says he'll instead hold final pretrial hearings March 29 and 30.
Cosby has pleaded not guilty to charges he drugged and molested Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004.
O'Neill hasn't ruled on whether jurors can hear about Cosby's settlement with Constand or if his lawyers can mention another accuser by name in their opening statement. Cosby's lawyers are objecting to O'Neill's ruling allowing up to five other accusers to testify.
Cosby's first trial last year ended in a hung jury.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

Niagara West–Glanbrook MP Dean Allison says he has yet to be reassured about the safety of a plan to ship liquid nuclear waste possibly through Niagara.
“I'm just not convinced that it could potentially be safe.”
Allison hopes to meet with Niagarans this spring to discuss concerns about the U.S. Department of Energy plan to ship liquid nuclear waste from a facility in Chalk River, Ont., to a disposal site in Savannah River, S.C., 1,700 kilometres south.
A U.S. court ruling Feb. 2 supported claims by the DOE that the material poses no more danger in its liquid form than it would as a solid, clearing the way for as many as 150 shipments over four years that could travel through Niagara.
Allison wonders if the court decision took into consideration “what could actually happen should there be some kind of accident.”
“All things being equal, if there's no accident there's no issue. The material is just as safe, but that's the wild card we don't know.”
He says hundreds of thousands of vehicles travel back and forth on the QEW each day.
“That would be catastrophic if we ended up with some kind of freak or unfortunate accident that should show up there during the middle of the summer, or whatever,” he says.
Allison says he's primarily concerned about first responders, “the ones that always are on our front lines dealing with this stuff.”
Environmental groups have said the material, a byproduct of the creation of medical radioisotopes at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, includes cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239.
The material is being shipped to the U.S. as part of a 2010 agreement to repatriate radioactive material that was produced in the U.S., to ensure it's disposed of properly.
Allison says his staff is organizing a meeting for constituents, and they hope to include representatives from organizations such as the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, “either to assure us or convince us, but we'll also like to have the other side of the coin there, too, which would be the potential huge risk that's involved there as well.”
Allison also intends to shed light on the issue by discussing it during question period in the House of Commons.

Greed, cause of cyber crime – Don

A PROFESSOR of Computer Security and Dean, Caleb Business School, Caleb University, Imota, Lagos State, Professor Babatope Longe, has described cyber criminality and cyber victimization as crimes tied to the exploration of human frailties such as greed, gullibility and the untamed quest for getting rich syndrom and not crimes that are necessarily influenced by social factors such as poverty, inequality and unemployment.
Longe made this remark during the second inaugural lecture of the university themed, ‘Can Anything Good Come Out of Nazareth? Synergizing The Scalable Complex Adaptive Relationships Between Humans and the Cyberspace', delivered by the erudite scholar at the university multipurpose hall recently.
Negative popularity
The distinguished Fulbright Fellow, who acknowledged the impact of ICT revolution in the country's technological growth with software and internet penetration, however, described as unhealthy the increasing negative popularity accorded to Nigeria and Nigerians by researchers and scholars globally as the hub for advance fee fraud e-mails and other nefarious activities that pervade the cyberspace.
He noted that the country had the potential of joining the tiger nations and other upcoming countries whose economies were being driven by digital innovations that had propelled their economies, changed the face of their society and earned them respect in the comity of nations by entrenching the culture of commitment, entrepreneurship, patriotism, dedication and excellence, which were the components for building a virile ICT – driven society.
The professor of Computer Security, who listed vices such as hacking, phishing, cyberstalking, online pornography, advance fee fraud and cyberterrorism as examples of those cybercrimes traceable to Nigeria, however, charged the law enforcement agencies to revisit their mechanism for reporting, apprehension and prosecution in the light of emerging technologies in order to secure the internet from cyber abuse, stressing that both the internet community and law enforcement agencies must harness efforts to rid the internet of image tarnishing crimes.
In semblance of the theme of the inaugural lecture, ‘Can Anything Good Come Out of Nigeria, the university don noted that in spite of the fact that Nigeria occupies a place in the cyberspace that had long been perceived as negative, good things that had come out of the country that gladdens the heart as far as the cyberspace is concerned included the use of TMA for remittances into the coffers of the government, signing of the cybercrime bill (The Patriot Bill), the BVN registration in banks, SIM registration for mobile phone users, limits placed on hard currency remittances and spending as well as the initiation of e-governance platform that encourages e-democracy,
He further stressed that despite the global hues and cry about corruption, economic misfortunes, insecurity, poverty, unemployment and other challenges plaguing the country, other positive impacts of the cyberspace in the country were the deployment of the galaxy backbone for internet access and transmission, the initiation and deployment of the ng. domain platforms..

LONDON (AP) — As Roger Federer was winning 35 consecutive service points at Wimbledon on Wednesday — yes, 35 in a row — a Centre Court spectator cheered him on while wearing a red shirt with white lettering that said, "PeRFect."
The Swiss great comes pretty close to living up to that at times.
Federer moved into the third round at the England Club as he chases his record-extending ninth championship there, using close-to-impeccable serving to beat 73rd-ranked Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
The 36-year-old Federer compiled 48 winners and just 11 unforced errors. He won 40 of 43 first-serve points, never faced a break chance, and delivered 16 aces.
"Sometimes your serve matches up better against certain players," he said. "There's no doubt about that."
Talk about an understatement.
At 4-3, 40-30, Federer hit a 118 mph ace to hold and start his roll that included the last five points he served in the first set, all 20 in the second, and then the first 10 of the third. By then, it was so dominant that one television announcer was moved to jokingly exclaim, "Come on, double-fault!"
Federer did not oblige, but moments later, he did lose a point he served at 4-1, 30-love, when Lacko smacked a down-the-line backhand passing winner.
"I think (what's) important when you want to serve well is your point-for-point mentality, saying, maybe, 'The first point is as important as a break point,' so the concentration is the same," Federer explained. "Trying to remember all the things you've done throughout the entire match — what has worked, what hasn't worked."
Very little did not work on this day, and he's allowed his two opponents to collect a total of 17 games through six sets.
Very little hasn't worked for him over the years at Wimbledon, even now that he's in his mid-30s.
Wednesday's result increased Federer's streak to 26 straight sets at Wimbledon, equaling his second-best run, which came in 2003-04. His best was a 34-streak sequence from 2005-06.
A year ago, Federer became the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to win the title at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament without ceding a single set.
So what, Federer was asked, makes him so successful on grass ?
"I don't know. I don't know," he began, before offering quite a list for someone who doesn't know.
"Maybe it's that it helps my slice. That maybe the footwork on grass comes easier to me than for other guys. I'm not sure. Then because I have a decent speed on the serve, and I can serve kick and slice. Maybe also the grass helps me just a little bit to get a few more free points than what it would on some other surfaces."

Wise-cracking, lecherous homicide detective Lieutenant Al Wheeler investigates the disappearances of pretty ‘dames,' a complex hit-and-run case, and murders at a science fiction convention in three entertaining entries in the phenomenally successful Carter Brown mystery series.
Written in the 1950s and long since out-of-print, No Harp for My Angel, Booty for a Babe, and Eve, It's Extortion are a trio of swift-paced, tongue-in-cheek stories by the incredibly prolific Alan Geoffrey Yates, writing under the house name Carter Brown.
Yates, primarily a writer of pulp fiction, used many pseudonyms in his long career and contributed almost all of the 300 Carter Brown books.
Born and raised in London, he emigrated to Australia in his mid-twenties, signed a thirty-year publishing deal that required him to produce two novelettes and one full-length novel a month, and rapidly became Australia's biggest literary export.
Remarkably, he managed, for the most part, to fulfil the demanding publishing contract and, from 1954 to 1984, produced 215 novels and around 75 novella-length stories. The books, which have been translated into fourteen languages and published in 23 countries, have sold in the region of eighty million copies.
In No Harp For My Angel, the first tale in this newly published collection, Lieutenant Wheeler's vacation to Ocean Beach, Florida, turns sour when he upsets big-shot gangster Johnny Lynch, a casino owner with mafia connections.
Beaten up and arrested for theft, drunk driving and criminal damage, Wheeler is strong-armed by the Florida police department into playing the role of ‘a big-noise racketeer' from Chicago in order to help them with their investigation into Lynch and his possible connection with four missing women.
Employing unorthodox methods and using his considerable charm with the ladies, the quick-thinking, hard-punching Wheeler battles a psycho gangster, a gorilla-like henchman and a devious red-headed beauty as he unravels Lynch's imaginative, lucrative side operation.
An investigation into the murder of a professor shot in the heart with a steel dart while giving a lecture at a science fiction convention in California is the focus of Booty for a Babe, the rather wacky second story.
Wheeler, who has a torrid time weeding through the 80 suspects, some of whom offer time-travel theories and tales of extra-terrestrials, time-warps and planetoids, begins hallucinating about creatures with ‘heads like squashed oranges,' fifteen arms, tendrils, and three eyes on eight-foot long stalks as he tries to get to the bottom of the strange killing.
Lies, deception, and false accusations follow him around, and when a further corpse turns up, it takes all of Wheeler's guile and cunning to unravel the mystery and expose the culprit.
In the final story, Eve, It's Extortion, Wheeler suspects foul play when a widow lands a large life insurance pay-out after her lousy husband is killed in a hit-and-run crash.
His inquiries, which lead him to shady debt collection agents, turn problematic when further deaths occur and he gets a little too intimate with a murder suspect. Soon, the unorthodox cop is striving not to become a humiliated ex-cop.
The playful humour, fast-paced action and lean, uncomplicated plots help make these Carter Brown mysteries quick, pleasurable reads. These three in particular highlight Yates' ability to add a fresh spin to a familiar story and inject a heavy dose of fun into American ‘gangster' fiction.

play videoMinister for Zongo and Inner City Development, Boniface Abubakar Saddique
The Minister for Inner City and Zongo Development, Alhaji Abubakar Saddique Boniface has appealed to the residents of Old Fadama in the Odododiodiooo Constituency of the Greater Accra Region to eschew their political differences and embrace development no matter which government is making it available to them.
If it had not been partisan politics Accra's famous inner city otherwise known as ‘Sodom and Gomorra' would have been developed some ten years ago with the Korle- Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project (KLERP) sponsored by the World Bank with an amount of 73 million Euros the worried Minister told a gathering of inner city dwellers in Accra.
The Minister who is also the Member of Parliament for Madina Constituency made this appeal at a town hall meeting organized by the EIB group, owners of GHone Television in the area as part of their one year anniversary celebration.
“It is about time politicians in this country must be straight forward with the people and tell them the truth,” he posited.
He said development is development and it should be accepted whichever government is making it available to them in the area.
He lamented, “Now people have to suffer at the least down pour in the city, when a project like KLERP was rolled by the Ministry of Water Resources Works and Housing in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Local Government and Rural Development under the first New Patriotic Party (NPP) led by ex-president John Agyekum Kufuor to control flooding in the city. I signed the agreement for the KLERP as the then Minister for Works and Housing and I know what it entails.”
“Like the relocation of the residents in the area to Adjen Kotoku area near Amasaman also in the region but for partisanship the project was left to rot under the watchful eyes of the then ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) in 2009,” he said.
The project, he said, came with water transport on the lagoon as well as the recreational centres where people in the city can pay to have their wedding receptions done along the lagoon.
He explained however that, for partisan politics, leaders of the area were prevailed upon by some elements in the NDC to refuse their relocation to the Adjen Kotoku area where massive infrastructure like markets, schools among other had been made available as part of the project.
Alhaji Boniface revealed that elements in the NDC succeeded in pitching the people against the NPP by using all manner of crook tactics in the area, they could not continue with the project when they assumed office and the loan of 73 million euros could not be accounted for.
“Ten years down the line the project is in a sorry state with some of the associates of the control panel for pumping the flooded waters through an underground means into the sea all stolen,” he said.
According to him, the project was with the aim of restoring the ecology of the lagoon to remedy the flood situations in the country by pumping flood waters that join the lagoon by an underground 2.5 kilometres High Definition pipe into the sea.
He minces no words to say this could have been a flagship project in the country that could have saved the lives of the innocent people who died in the June 3, 2015 twin disaster adding that what happened was man-made.
The project was also to make the ambience of the lagoon a laudable recreational centre that will attract tourists by water transport in the city.
The project which was operated for only two years was stalled in 2009 when the NDC led by the late Prof. John Evans Atta-Mills assumed office as the President of the country.
He told the people that the NPP will not deceive them and that the Ministry created for Inner cities and Zongos by president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has come to stay and it will not deceive them.
He assured the residents that his Ministry is in talks with the World Bank to find a way of rejuvenating the project.
He took the opportunity to commend the organizers for bringing their operations closer to the inner city dwellers, saying “The norm has always been celebrating such days in the plush hotels but you chose Sodom and Gomorra”.
Nana Ama Anamoah, News Editor of GHone TV took the opportunity to thank the residents for their calmness and promised the station will keep piling pressure on the Minister and his Ministry to redeem the promise he had made to them.

Gombe Students: Learning Under Harsh Conditions
Ugo Aliogo was in Gombe State,
visited some public schools and writes on the sorry state of
infrastructures which make learning an uphill task
From Gombe metropolis to Akko, Nafada and
Balanga, from Billiri to Kaltungo, Shongom to Yamaltu-Deba, Kwami, Dukku and Funakaye, are shameful sights of dilapidated buildings, absence of learning materials let alone welfare packages to motivate the students. The infrastructures are nothing to write home about; some buildings are on the verge of collapse, while some are swimming pools during rainy season. Renovations are not done. The working condition is bad, classrooms are small, broken chairs and tables litter the floor. Walls are now used as chalkboards. New students are admitted every year with no adequate plans for the erection of buildings and facilities. Ventilation is poor.
Teachers go to classes with towels and handkerchiefs to wipe sweat from their brows and faces coupled with hand fan to aid ventilation. The staff rooms are stuffy. Both the students and teachers sit on woods in some schools. The environment is not conducive for learning and teaching. Students were seen in small groups, while some were discussing, others were cooking in an unhygienic setting. To also make pocket money, one of them was seen cutting the hair of others and charging them N50. Such is the fate of students in Government Science Secondary School in Kaltungo Local Government Area of the state.
Some teachers were on ground and gladly took this reporter round the large expanse of land hosting the secondary school. All the laboratories are no longer functional. Nothing seems to be working in the entire school. One of the teachers who preferred anonymity told THISDAY that the poor working condition and the absence of motivation and remuneration reduces teachers' commitment.
“Salaries are not paid regularly, teachers are only motivated by their intrinsic values and that is for those who love teaching. The absence of the extrinsic values in terms of regular and high salaries, good working condition and promotion at the appropriate time drain the teachers' morale to teach.
“If they are not motivated, they will not give their best and only the God-fearing ones will go to classes to teach, and if teachers don't teach, the appropriate learning process will not take place. The students come to school with nothing new to learn.” Another teacher who wouldn't want his name mentioned, said Hassan Governor Dakwambo has completely neglected the sector just like other areas of the economy. He regretted that the same governor is seeking to contest for presidency despite his failures in the state.
One of the students who introduced himself as
Ismaila Aliyu, said they were writing their examination and
that was why they are still around. “We are suffering.
Nobody cares about us but we are just determined to endure
and pass through this stage. The government has abandoned
us. It is a boarding school but there is no food for us to
eat. Even our hostels are all in bad shape. There are no
roofs in many of the buildings as you can see and when it is
raining, all of us here will move to one of the hostels that
is still manageable.
Another sad development noticed in Gombe State beside the primary and secondary schools is that there are higher institution that are inaugurated but are not yet functional in spite of the fact they were declared ready and inaugurated for take-off. One of these is the University of Science and Technology in Kumo. From the main gate, gigantic buildings, lecture halls and other administrative buildings have been taken over by bushes. The institution that should be churning out graduates has become home for reptiles and other animals. One imagines why the resources that were sunk into building those structures were wasted. Another is the College of Education in Billiri. Although functional, the only visible building beside the main gate is the administrative building and a few lecture halls.
THISDAY spoke with a second year Integrated Science student, Aishat Bello. She complained of the deficit in infrastructure and appealed to the governor to equip the school. According to her, they have a clinic but it is like a mortuary because there are no drugs at all to take care of their medical needs. The state also boasts of an abandoned College of Nursing and Midwifery in Dukku. Bushes have overtaken the school. No academic programme is going on there in spite of all the billions of naira that went into it.
“Sadly, the level, quality and standard of education in the state has witnessed a geometric
drop and this unfortunate trend has made the state rated low in national examinations. As the administration of Dakwambo comes to a close next year, it is expected that the people would elect a governor that is education-friendly.
“An administrator who would overhaul the education sector and introduce world-class learning facilities with a dedicated workforce; pay special attention to education and ensure that all tiers of institutions are equipped with adequate manpower and conducive learning environment. World class education is needed to empower the people and the best investment is in the intellectual development which only quality education can guarantee.”
The education system needs to be cleaned up. There are no facilities in virtually all the government-owned primary and secondary schools visited. No toilets, no water and no electricity. The current administration has neglected the sector and other areas of the economy that could have improved the lives of the people despite the enormous financial resources it has received.
Without education, every other empowerment is nothing. Majority of the indigenes are out of school. Gombe needs someone that will invest in education and turn around the sorry state in order to ensure the prosperity of the people. Teachers need to be empowered and learning made enjoyable to all students. School drop-out should be encouraged to return to school and generally make living better for the people rather than pay lip service to governance.”Education is the fulcrum of the nation's development. It is the foundation upon which all other sectors are built. If the foundation is faulty, it is not likely to produce any good product.
Sadly, the poor citizens are at the receiving end. The bourgeoisie is exploiting the proletariat. The rich politicians are sending their children to study abroad sponsoring them with the nation's resources. The children of the poor citizens are struggling and competing for the available pieces of the junk and remnants of the National cake.
No wonder Karl Marx said the society will always be in status quo. The rich will become richer while the poor poorer. Occupants of the upper social class are protecting their children from witnessing the consequences of their actions leaving the innocent ones to bear the brunt.
Financial resources are not used for what they are meant for. The allocated budget for the sector is being embezzled for personal use. The government no longer focuses on the education sector. There is no more free education and the so-called free education is not free. Exorbitant money is paid as school fees and all sorts of levies. Some people drop out of school as a result of the inability to pay fees. Students lose admission into tertiary institution due to lack of financial resources. Scholarships are reducing at a rapid rate. The scholarships that are meant for the less privileged are being channeled to the rich. There is politics in the educational sector. Schools have turned into financial institutions and business centres.
Hence, teachers go on strike in order to make demands and negotiations. There is always a conflict between the union leaders (ASUU and NUT) and the government as to the problems encountered by the education sector. Schools are closed down for months and the government will not move an inch in trying to resolve the disagreement. The lackadaisical and selfish attitude is so because their wards and children are not schooling in the country. Gombe, usually referred to as Gombe State to distinguish it from the city of Gombe, is located in the north-eastern part of Nigeria. The boundaries of the state roughly correspond to those of the Tangale-Waja Chiefdom and Gombe Emirate, a traditional state.
Demography
Gombe State is a multi-ethnic society which comprises the dominant Fulani tribe, which inhabits the northern part of the state and Tangale which occupies the southern part of the state.
Other ethnicities such as the Tera, Waja, Bolewa, Kanuri and Hausa with their different cultural as well as lingual affiliations. The second largest ethnic group is the Tera which occupies greater part of Yamaltu Deba Local Government. Gombe State is also blessed with some minority ethnic group among others Dadiya, Waja and which occupy a sizeable part of some areas of southern part of the state. The state capital, Gombe, is a reflection of the heterogeneity of the state.
The state, nicknamed the Jewel of Excellence, was formed in October 1996 from part of the old Bauchi State by the late Abacha military government. Its location in the north-eastern zone within the expansive Savannah, allows the state to share common borders with the Borno, Yobe, Taraba, Adamawa and Bauchi States.
The state has an area of 20,265 km². Gombe has two distinct climates, the dry season (November-March) and the rainy season (April-October) with an average rainfall of 850mm. Gombe has 11 local government areas and 14 emirates/chiefdoms.

Ambode's wife seeks women empowerment, capacity devt
WIFE of the Governor of Lagos State, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, has admonished women on the need to seek economic empowerment, noting that empowerment will guarantee stable income, which will help them to be focused and committed to their most cherished ideals.
Ambode stated this at the recently concluded All Sisters Regional Conference of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Region 19, Ogba Lagos, with the theme, “Occupy Till I come”. She advised women not to entirely depend on their husbands for survival, noting that having sustainable source of income will also make them better Christians. “While we occupy, it is important that we get economic empowerment. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor advice, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest”. She urged the women, as true children of God, “to occupy till He comes so that when He finally arrives, we will not be found wanting like the servants that buried his talent”.
In her remarks, Wife of Pastor in Charge of Region 19, Pastor Helen Oyitso, said the programme was aimed at refocusing the women as individuals and as a group while also listing topics considered during the conference to include Occupy in the home front, Occupy in the work place, Occupy in the marketplace, Medical Screening, and Mission Support.

UCONN 71, QUINNIPIAC 46 Napheesa Collier scored 23 points as top-seeded Connecticut beat its in-state neighbor Quinnipiac in Storrs, Conn., to advance to the round of 16 for the 25th straight time.
Azura Stevens added 14 points and Kia Nurse chipped in with 13 for the Huskies (34-0), who found themselves in a much slower-paced game than their 140-52 first-round rout of St. Francis of Pennsylvania. But UConn was not threatened in this one, either; it opened with a 9-2 run and never trailed.
Jen Fay had 12 points to lead the ninth-seeded Bobcats (28-6), whose team -record 23-game winning streak ended.
Quinnipiac got plenty of open looks but hit just 4 of 24 shots from 3-point range, including 1 of 12 from in the first half.
UConn shot 59 percent, held Quinnipiac to just 17 baskets on 56 shots (30 percent) and led by 33-18 at halftime. A pair of free throws by Stevens gave the Huskies their first 20-point lead late in the third quarter, and it was 54-31 going into the fourth.
The Huskies were too big for the Bobcats, who had no player on the court over 6 feet tall. They also outrebounded Quinnipiac, 33-21, and outscored them by 28-14 in the paint.

Except that it does. And the result is that Rendon was arguably the best overall player on the Nationals this season.
Consider these credentials: He posted a .301 average with 25 home runs and 100 runs batted in. Advanced statistics and scouts rank him among the elite third basemen defensively. While he stole only seven bases, he is an astute and swift base runner. “That's the best part of Rendon's game that is really under the radar,” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said.
This season, Rendon was one of only seven qualified hitters with a batting average of at least .300, an on-base percentage of at least .400 and a slugging percentage of at least .500, putting him in the same category as two former winners of a Most Valuable Player Award — Joey Votto and Mike Trout — and a potential future winner, Jose Altuve.

His peers, of course, are aware of all this.
“He's always been great,” Harper said.
“There are always two or three guys that fit into that mold that are really good players that nobody really knows about,” Zimmerman said. “They don't really get the recognition that they should. The problem is that Tony likes it better that way. He'll continue to stay that way because he wants to.”
Chicago Cubs Manager Joe Maddon, who will have to deal with Rendon repeatedly in a first-round series that started on Friday, said: “I've been a fan since I've seen him, but didn't know much about him before. He's a really good baseball player. He looks like he has a high baseball I.Q.”
On the other hand, few baseball fans probably know that it was Rendon who ended up tied with Miami's Giancarlo Stanton, at 6.9, for the National League lead in FanGraphs' version of wins above replacement for position players — the advanced statistic that attempts to quantify everything a player does on the field.
Rendon is from a working-class neighborhood in Houston and played his college baseball at Rice. He spends some of his free time volunteering at the Nationals' baseball academy for inner-city youngsters in Washington. And he shuns the spotlight so much that he is either difficult to pin down for an interview or provides such brief answers that he can come off as a little bit sarcastic. He clearly seems to like playing on a team where other players command more attention.

“Early on in his career, we bounced him around from third to second, and that perception maybe kept him under the radar,” Rizzo said. “His personality is such, with some bigger personalities on this team, his hype has been stifled a little bit. I think he likes it that way.”

The only advertisement Rendon can remember being a part of was a Pepsi marketing campaign two years ago, but even those details escape him. “Was it even a commercial?” Rendon said. “I thought it was just an Instagram post or something.”
He wears Under Armour gear, but unlike his teammate Harper, who is the company's lead baseball pitchman, Rendon is nowhere to be found on its advertisements.
“They know better than to ask me,” he said, adding that he has declined invitations to visit the company's headquarters in nearby Baltimore.

Rendon also has a laid-back demeanor on the field, noticeable enough that it can be confused for lackadaisical. In past seasons, he has been caught yawning during an at-bat or in the dugout. He once said he would rather watch the History Channel than baseball in his free time.
But Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said Rendon was simply wired to be low-key. Rizzo said Rendon paid as much attention to small details as any other player he has been around. Zimmerman, who shares Rendon's approach, said a gung-ho, maximum effort in a sport like baseball, where there are games every day, just means you are “going to kill yourself.”
“He does a lot of stuff that looks easy,” said Nationals outfielder Brian Goodwin, who is one of Rendon's closest friends on the team. “People don't see the work that he puts in, and even then, he's still chilling.”
Despite those occasional yawns and the swing that looks so effortless, Rendon says baseball is anything but easy, and indeed he has had several seasons in which he has dealt with injuries or significant slumps.
“I just try to stay cool, calm and collected,” he said. He said that his swing has been nearly the same since childhood and that his hitting philosophy is so simple — “stay inside the ball, put the barrel on it, and swing hard” — that it feels like a ruse.

Trea Turner, the Nationals' shortstop, loves Rendon's all-around play so much that he has referred to him as his favorite player. Television cameras caught Turner yelling, “You're my favorite player!” at Rendon after he hit a grand slam in September 2016.
In return, Rendon has called Turner his favorite player. The Nationals printed corresponding shirts for the pair, but soon the entire team was wearing “Anthony is my favorite player” shirts as they campaigned, unsuccessfully, to get Rendon to the 2017 All-Star Game.
“He can do everything on the field, which is obviously something I try to do personally, so I like other players that can do that,” Turner said. “Guys like Trout, Altuve, who can steal a bag, hit a home run, hit for average, power, etc. He can do everything on the field and he's a really humble guy. It makes him really likable and easy to talk about.”
If Rendon's strong play continues, and he is thrust more into the spotlight than before, perhaps more people will end up talking about him. Not that he will necessarily be overjoyed.
PATARA, Turkey (WFLA/NBC) – It's that time of the year when baby sea turtles hatch and crawl from the beach to the sea.
Turkish biologists supervised eleven miles of a beach which contains important nesting grounds for loggerhead turtles.
Early Monday morning, 138 babies reached the Mediterranean Sea.
The beach is so important to the turtles, people are only allowed to use it from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The biologists believed 2,000 hatchlings will reach the sea of 6,800 eggs.
Only four babies are expected to reach maturity and lay eggs of their own.

Food waste has become a moral issue in my household. An ardent recycler, my wife admirably seeks ways to reduce the amount of trash our family generates. When I get lazy and toss some food scrap into the garbage can, rather than the green waste bin, she dutifully pulls it out and puts it in the right place.
Food waste seems to be taking over my life outside the home, as well. I recently authored a book, Big Hunger, critiquing the failure of the anti-hunger field to address systemic issues that cause hunger. Attendees at my book talks frequently ask my opinion on food waste as a solution to hunger.
The more I immerse myself in this topic, the more I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth. And watching the new Rockefeller Foundation-funded film Wasted! The Story of Food Waste only serves to exacerbate this feeling. Narrated by celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, Wasted! does provide an important contribution. It calls into question the obscene amounts of food that we waste from farm to table, along with the environmental damage such waste causes.
The film provides examples of how such waste could be repurposed, following the Environmental Protection Agency's food recovery hierarchy of using surplus food for people, animals, bioenergy, compost, and landfills, in that order. Wasted! entertains and educates as it seeks to inspire cultural change in the way we approach such factors as cosmetically imperfect produce, expiration dates, and the numerous unused parts of plants and animals that get plowed under or turned into pet food.
But the film goes bad in the first few minutes when it skips over source reduction, reducing the volume of surplus food generated, which is the first step in the EPA's inverted pyramid hierarchy. It fails to address the much more complicated question of why we waste so much food in the first place.
As a nation, we seem to have the tendency to avoid these sticky political questions in favor of technological solutions, and in doing so ignore the economic system, policies, and incentives that encourage 40 percent of all food to go to waste .
Historically, food wasn't wasted in lean times, when cultures had to survive literally on the crusts. Yet today, the industrialization of agriculture has rendered food relatively inexpensive, although the 12 percent of the population considered food insecure would likely disagree.
According to the USDA, Americans spend just 6.4 percent of their household income on food, less than any other nation.
Food is cheap not just because of mechanization, but also because we externalize the costs of its production onto the public till. Likewise, the price of food at the checkout does not reflect the full cost of labor. Companies such as Walmart, for example, routinely underpay their workers and encourage them to patronize food pantries or enroll in public food assistance programs to supplement their wages.
According to the Food Chain Workers Alliance, food chain workers are the lowest paid of any sector, earning on average $10 per hour as compared to the median wage for all industries of $17.53. Food-chain workers are more likely to rely on public assistance and be more food insecure than in any other economic sector.
Thus, the low cost of ingredients and labor enable food waste. And if the food industry is addicted to overproduction, then the emergency food system is its enabler. Shelves at food pantries overflow with donated bakery products—things like breads and pastries. Why? Cheap sugar, wheat, butter, and labor make it economically viable for supermarkets to overproduce or over-order. They have found, by and large, that shoppers prefer an appearance of abundance and a wide selection from which to choose.
What if we taxed food waste rather than gave companies a tax break?
And when the unpurchased baked goods pass their “sell-by date,” retailers earn a tax deduction for donating them to charities at the generous midpoint between retail and wholesale price, allowing them to recapture part of their overhead. In addition, charitable donations can help retailers reduce their garbage disposal costs as well as improve their public image.
But what if these products are so unhealthy that dumping them onto the poor, who typically suffer from high rates of diet-related diseases, such as diabetes, just reinforces structural inequities in our society?
To their credit, many food banks around the country have dramatically increased the amount of fruits and veggies they distribute. A smaller number is refusing to accept junk food, especially soda. For example, the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C., has removed 84 percent of unhealthy foods from its distribution stream by refusing full-calorie sodas, holiday candy, and sheet cakes, among other items.
At a recent talk I gave in Madison, Wisconsin, one attendee mentioned that after being provided information on diet-related health disparities and healthy food pantry initiatives, one food bank wanted to reduce the amount of pastries it distributed to customers. Following the EPA Food Recovery hierarchy, it found a pig farmer who would take the baked goods. All was fine, until a month later when the hog farmer informed them that he could no longer take the pastries because his pigs were getting too aggressive since consuming them. The similarities between pig and human physiology are well-documented.
It makes little sense to be rewarding companies with $200 million in tax deductions for donating surplus food to charity if our goal is to reduce food waste in the first place. Seen through a health lens, providing these tax deductions for junk food contradicts our nation's dietary guidelines, which discourage consumption of foods high in sugar and salt.
And the food banks have become hooked, as well. I write in my book that the preservation of the tax deduction that companies receive for donating wasted food has been at the top of the legislative agenda of the nation's food banking hub, Feeding America.
We need to shift our charity culture, to view food waste through the lens of the dignity of the poor.
Perhaps what we need, as the film Wasted! suggests, is a culture shift, in which surplus food donations are seen as a badge of shame rather than one of corporate social responsibility. What if we taxed food waste rather than gave companies a tax break? What if, at minimum, we limited the tax deduction to only healthy foods, such as produce? What if food banks sought to make themselves obsolete within two decades by eliminating poverty rather than just perpetuating themselves by encouraging food waste?
In November, I was in Scotland, where the government is doing just that: looking for an exit strategy from the rapid growth of food charity, because they believe relying on food banks to be an inherently undignified way of life. Earlier in the year, I heard Toronto food activists liken the low quality of surplus food to the patronizing attitude with which the poor are too often treated. These critics said that food banks distribute “garbage food for garbage people.”
Here in the U.S., we badly need to shift our charity culture, to view food waste through the lens of the dignity, not to mention health, of the poor rather than through the prism of logistics and efficiency. During my years of research for Big Hunger, I have discovered racism and oppressive power dynamics within food pantries, as typically white and middle-class volunteers, such as myself, control the food that working-class and often people of color receive.
So, what should the industry do about existing food waste? Distributing surplus healthy food to people is clearly a superior option to throwing it away. Yet, food pantries are not the only option. Social enterprises such as L.A. Kitchen, Food Shift in Oakland, California, and Real Junk Food cafes in the U.K. provide other benefits, such as job creation and skills development. Many food banks have also moved in this direction, creating food processing and catering businesses.
Let's be clear. Food waste distribution is not the solution to hunger except on a temporary basis. Hunger is a symptom of poverty. Eliminating poverty will not be achieved by giving people day-old baguettes or even carrots and kale, but by working in solidarity to help them build their skills, education, wages, and political power. A bag of groceries is a measly substitute for political power.
LAGUNA BEACH — Efforts are underway by a local disentanglement team to free about 50 feet of fishing line and an orange buoy from a gray whale slowly swimming north along the Orange County coast.

The approximately 25-30 foot whale was first spotted by Capt. Steve Burkhalter aboard the Dana Pride, a whale-watch boat operated by Dana Wharf Whale Watching before noon Tuesday, April 24 off Beach Road in Capistrano Beach. At that time, Burkhalter wasn't sure whether the whale was tangled-up.
As it word spread, Capt. Marie Clark on Capt. Dave Anderson's Manut'ea and her deckhand, Tanner Rollins, saw the whale pass near the mouth of Dana Point Harbor.
A private boat, the Serendipity, stayed with the whale for five hours until the disentanglement team was able to make it out near Strand Beach, said Clark.
The team, including Justin Greenman from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, caught up with the whale about three miles off the coast of Laguna, parallel to the Surf & Sand Resort.
By 6 p.m.efforts to cut the line from the whale had been unsuccessful, said Rollins. He and Greenman, along with a representative from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center and another boat captain, were on board with Capt. Dave Anderson, who operates Capt. Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari.
“It's traveling north with big heavy breaths,” Rollins said. “That's making it hard for us.”
The group planned to continue their efforts until dark.
Anyone seeing the whale is asked to call NOAA at 887-767-9425.
In 2016, 71 entanglements were reported, according to NOAA. Of those, 52 were off the California coast. In 2017, at least 20 entanglements were reported off California and 30 off the West Coast.
“Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency — a ploy that Venezuela's democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,” he said.
The announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation's vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.
Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.
Whether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.

“It's part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Wilson Center's Latin American Program. “But it's usually the case that governments dig in their heels all the more when they feel that sanctions are aimed at removing them from power instead of producing a change in behavior, and what this will do is certainly increase the suffering and the shortages that are happening now.”
Mr. Mnuchin, who is attending a gathering of finance ministers in Argentina, said he and his counterparts had discussed “how to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro's economic policy.”
“We urge Maduro to distribute humanitarian aid and stop blocking much-needed foreign assistance to the suffering people of Venezuela, and we again call upon the Venezuelan military to respect and uphold the Constitution,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

The four people sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Monday are current and former officials who played key roles in Mr. Maduro's government and political network. Américo Alex Mata García is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro's presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.

The four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.
The sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.
One Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.
Venezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could “expose U.S. persons to legal risk.”
The executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.
Risa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela — the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro's grandiose claims, she said — the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.
“It's more symbolic,” Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday's measures. “The Trump administration's desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,” both in Venezuela and in the United States.
The International University Sports Federation (FISU) will make a final decision on the Naples 2019 Summer Universiade Athletes' Village on June 15.
Erik Saintrond, FISU's secretary general, has confirmed the date according to Italian news agency ANSA.
Two options remain on the table with a facility at Mostra d'Oltremare believed to be the preferred choice for organisers.
A second possibility is housing athletes across various venues - including the Agnano Racetrack, cruise ships and hotels.
The plan for Mostra d'Oltremare emerged earlier this month when initial plans to use cruise ships hit a stumbling block.
Naples 2019 extraordinary commissioner Luisa Latella revealed the Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority had informed them not to not enter relations with MSC - the company it had contacted to host the athletes on ships.
It forced the Organising Committee to find a new Athletes' Village venue at short notice, with the event due to run from July 3 to 14 next year.
Latella admitted it would be a challenge to build the Village in time at Mostra d'Oltremare but insisted organisers had the necessary support and backing from stakeholders.
According to ANSA, the proposal would see the Village created in three cemented areas "without any impact on the surrounding architecture or landscaping".

The plan includes 2,561 housing units and each athlete would have between seven and eight square metres of personal space.
The second option would return to the cruise ship idea but only 4,000 beds would be based there, with another 3,000 at the racetrack.
There would also be 600 beds at two hotels, one in Fuorigrotta and one in Pozzuoli.
Saintrond hinted to ANSA that the Mostra d'Oltremare would get the nod when FISU's Executive Committee decides on June 15, but he also said cost would be an issue.
"We can't be certain that between ships, Agnano and two hotels there will be the same standard for all the athletes," he said.
"In addition, we recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Olympic Committee on the Olympic Agenda 2020 to reduce Organising Committee costs.
"Two of the mainstays of the 2020 Agenda are budget control and legacy."
FISU gave a vote of confidence to organisers after an inspection visit to Naples earlier this month.
The city has had limited time to prepare as they took over the hosting rights from Brasilia, which withdrew as the Universiade venue in January 2015.
The Brazilian capital was unable to meet financial commitments.
HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's new leader has publicly named more than 1,800 companies and individuals accused of illegally stashing hundreds of millions of dollars overseas and not bringing the money home under a now-expired amnesty deal.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has vowed to fight corruption after the dramatic resignation in November of longtime leader Robert Mugabe, whose government was accused of widespread mismanagement of the once-prosperous country.
Mnangagwa announced the amnesty deal in December. He now says $591 million of the $1.2 billion suspected to be illegally stashed overseas has been returned.
His list shows China as the main destination for the money.
Four Zimbabwe state-owned diamond-mining firms are among those accused of moving the most money abroad in "illicit financial flows."
Mnangagwa says those on the list should "take heed" or face prosecution.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines canceled 1,375 flights Dec. 8-9 as an early winter storm brought over two inches of snow to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Delta's largest hub.
Delta said the snowfall over the weekend nearly equaled the Atlanta region's full-year average annual total of snow accumulation.
The storm, which had earlier impacted southeastern Texas and much of the US deep south, continued up the east coast Saturday Dec. 9, causing delays at airports in the mid-Atlantic, New York and Boston, which reverberated to domestic and international flights transiting through the affected airports. Aircraft de-icing requirements were enacted at the airports in the storm's path all day Saturday.
Back in Atlanta, Delta said its operations at ATL fully stabilized Saturday. By Sunday Dec. 10, operations largely returned to normal at east coast airports as the storm moved on.

As Southern California enters its second week engulfed in flames, fire officials anticipate more growth and danger due to continued strong wind gusts, no rain and decades-old dry vegetation.
A powerful flare-up on the western edge of the largest and most destructive wildfire sent residents fleeing Sunday, as wind-fanned flames ripped down hillsides toward coastal towns northwest of Los Angeles. New evacuations were ordered as the fire sent up an enormous plume near Montecito and Carpinteria, seaside areas in Santa Barbara County.
"The winds are kind of squirrely right now," said county fire spokesman Mike Eliason. "Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it's blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we're in."
Southern California's gusty Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region's most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.
Gusts of up to 40 mph (64 kph) are expected through Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
Containment increased Sunday on other major blazes in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. Resources from those fires were diverted to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the 270-square-mile (699-sq. kilometer) fire that started Dec. 4 in neighboring Ventura County.
As of late Sunday, the Thomas Fire had destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191.
Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a yearslong drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.
"This is the new normal," Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura fire. The governor and experts said climate change is making wildfires a year-round threat.
High fire risk is expected to last into January.
The air thick with acrid smoke, even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave, fearing another shutdown of U.S. 101, a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week. Officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.
"Our house is under threat of being burned," Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at midday Sunday. "We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters."
Ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities.
In San Diego, which is 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the south, the Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained. The flames erupted suddenly Thursday in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.
The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Downs training center, where it killed more than 40 elite thoroughbred race horses, and destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in a retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape the fire that continued to smolder Sunday.
Despite the size and number of wildfires burning in the region, there has only been one confirmed death: A 70-year-old woman, who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city where the Thomas Fire began.
Most of last week's fires were in places that burned in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air that burned six homes and another in the city's rugged foothills above the community of Sylmar and in Santa Paula.

Ten-year-old Eli O'Bryan gets companionship from his canine friend, Einstein, plus a lot more.
The black labrador helps to keep Eli healthy.
Eli was diagnosed at 4 years old with type 1 diabetes, a disease formerly called juvenile diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin.
Einstein is trained as a medical-service dog to detect when Eli's blood sugar spikes or crashes, and to signal -- with a bark or by placing a paw on Eli -- when Eli and his family need to check his blood-sugar levels.
Before Eli got the dog, he had to wear a sensor that would monitor his blood sugar throughout the day, which he said was awful.
“[The sensor] was stuck in my leg with a giant needle and it hurt so much,” said Eli. “It beeped all the time and it malfunctioned.”
But no longer.
“Now we have Einstein,” Eli said.
ABC News
A living dog over a technological device
The sensor Eli wore before Einstein was not only uncomfortable, it interrupted his education, sometimes beeping as many 12 times a day during school.
“He wore a pump all the time, he wore a sensor all the time," Amy O'Bryan, Eli's mother, told ABC News. "We tracked him with an app through his sensor because he's so brittle that he has to be constantly monitored for him to stay functioning.”
ABC News
But one of the worst things about the sensor is that it gave Eli more control over his blood-sugar levels, which meant he could hurt himself.
A mother's fear
“The scariest for Eli is when he was in fourth grade, he very calmly told me that he didn't want to live anymore,” O'Bryan said. “And to hear that as a mom and for him to be so casual about it, it was just matter of fact.”
Amy feared that Eli could harm himself with the devices and medicine he used to maintain his blood-sugar levels.
So she sought an alternative.
"That's really what started our journey with Einstein," O'Bryan said. "Not only was he suicidal, but he also wore a device on him 24-7 that would have made it very easy for him to end his life."
Amy reached out to CARES Inc., a non-profit based in Concordia, Kansas, that trains service dogs.
ABC News
The organization works with a prison system that uses the dog training as a work program for the prisoners. And then, the dogs are sent to families to get used to being in a home and school setting.
A dog's expert nose is what allows Einstein to be trained to pick up on Eli's blood-sugar changes.
“They say it's actually one of the hardest things to train a dog to do because it's not a constant smell,” said Amy.
The waiting list for dogs from the organization is so long that Eli's family had to wait almost three years from when his mother first inquired before he was approved to get a dog. Even then, it wasn't a guarantee.
“Eli has to certify that he can handle him in public,” explained Amy about the process of getting to keep Einstein after a week of training and bonding at the Kansas organization. “They have to show that they can handle them in restaurants or social situations …[Eli] was really nervous, ... we didn't want to leave without Einstein from Kansas.”
Eli and Einstein now
In October 2017, the O'Bryan family welcomed Einstein into their home, and Amy considers him another one of her children now.
“It helps to have a dog,” said Eli. “Just in general, even if it's not a service dog. Just feels like having a best friend.”
ABC News
Now, Einstein goes with Eli almost everywhere from school to band practice. The lab knows when it is time to be serious and work, but when the vest comes off, Einstein acts like the 2-year-old pup that he is.
”It's greatly impacted our life,” said Amy. “Just his quality of life, that he doesn't have to wear the sensor, I think it's helped me be more confident that Eli is independent and he can handle it.”

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is expected to take a leave of absence due to back issues, multiple sources told ESPN.
One source said Krzyzewski is likely to coach Wednesday against Georgia Tech and then step away for an unspecified amount of time.
"His back has been bothering him way worse than he's let on," a source told ESPN. "The plan is for him to be back at some point this year."
Krzyzewski had back issues in 1995, following surgery in October, and he stepped away in January 1996 for the remainder of the season. Duke was 9-8 overall at the time and 0-6 in ACC play.
He had offseason knee surgery this past April and missed the Georgia Tech game a year ago after feeling under the weather and being taken to the hospital for tests.
Krzyzewski, 69, has led the Blue Devils to five national titles and has a team that was ranked No. 1 in the preseason.
The Latest on migration into Europe (all times local):
1 p.m.
Aid groups say France's system for handling the unprecedented number of unaccompanied migrant children is arbitrary and hurts those who need help the most.
In a report Wednesday, Human Rights Watch described a confusing system that is stacked against minors. The aid group Medecins Sans Frontiers echoed the finding, saying France's default is to assume someone claiming to be under 18 is lying.
Around 25,000 young people claiming to be unaccompanied migrant children arrived in France last year. Of those, the claims of around 14,000 were accepted, the groups say.
But they say reasons for rejection were contradictory — children were denied for being too articulate, or not articulate enough. Those whose claims are accepted receive housing and education; those rejected can be expelled or jailed.

The Portuguese picked as the next leader of the U.N.'s migration agency predicts that the number of migrants heading from North Africa to Europe will grow and that European countries will increasingly refuse to let them in.
Antonio Vitorino says "I have no illusions. I know that in coming years the flow of migrants will increase and (destination) countries will close in on themselves."
Vitorino told Portuguese television channel SIC that cooperation between the migrants' countries of origin and European Union countries "is the only response" that will solve the issue of migration to Europe.
He says refugees seeking asylum must be guaranteed protection. He says the admittance of economic migrants depends on whether European labor markets can absorb them.
Vitorino was selected last week as the next director-general of the International Organization for Migration and takes office Oct. 1.

A rescue ship carrying 60 migrants has arrived in a Spanish port after being refused entry by Italy and Malta, the second time in a month that a humanitarian group has been forced to travel for days to unload people rescued in the central Mediterranean.
The Open Arms ship docked Wednesday in the northeastern port of Barcelona, where the group — including 5 women, a 9-year-old toddler and four teenagers — will be going through health checks and identification procedures.
The Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms said the migrants come from 14 countries and are in good health.

Fayose predicted becomes real, as CCT absolves Saraki of all charges (See list of his predictions)
Lere Olayinka who is Ekiti state governor, Ayo Fayose's media aide, says the governor had earlier this year predicted that the Code of Conduct Tribunal would absolve Senate President, Bukola Saraki, of all charges. Posting a newspaper cutout outlining Fayose's 2017 prediction, Lere wrote; “See how Gov (Prophet) Ayodele Fayose predicted Senator Bukola Saraki's victory …

Setting the Cam Pan up is a breeze. It only took a few minutes to sync it to Wyze's smartphone app, which pipes in livestreamed footage atop an intuitive dashboard. As with its predecessor, the software is the system's strong suit, and I was setting complex recording triggers in no time. Should it alert my phone when it detected any sound, or just when it heard the high pitch of a smoke alarm? And did I want to be notified when anything moved or should I dial down the sensitivity until only humans trip the camera? Whatever you choose, Wyze freely stores alert recordings in the cloud for two weeks.
Many of those features were available in the original WyzeCam, though. The big upgrade here is the rotation. There are several settings, like motion tracking and simple pan-and-scan, that work well enough alone or in concert to surveil an area, especially with the camera's wide 120-degree field of view. It isn't weatherproofed, so you'll have to keep it indoors, but the base is threaded for screws to allow for mounting. Maybe that means securing it on a rickety shelf, but you can also install the camera on the ceiling (there's a helpful setting to flip the footage 180 degrees so it appears right-side up).
Of course, if you're looking for a camera to keep tabs on something really expensive or precious, you probably won't skimp out and pick the $30 security solution. Wyze's devices are cheap enough for low-stakes surveillance -- say, watching to make sure pets or kids don't get into places they aren't allowed.
The Cam Pan still musters a surprisingly robust feature set for the price. It records at a respectable 1080p, capturing surprisingly sharp and colorful footage. Recording in HD fills up the integrated 128MB storage quickly, though a microSD slot lets you expand that with up to 32GB cards. Six infrared lights help shoot in darkness up to about 30 feet, and the integrated speaker lets you talk (or yell) through the app at whomever's on the other end.
The Cam Pan doesn't double as a smart home hub or Alexa speaker, differentiate people from pets or even work outdoors. But for the price of one of those more advanced security cameras, you could get two or three of Wyze's and cover more space. The Cam Pan's feature list is respectable, but its the app's complex recording criteria that make this a more robust choice than its budget price would suggest.

Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo
Ms. Sophia A.B. Akuffo, the Chief Justice, on Friday said the General Legal Council (GLC) would not close its eyes on any infractions on the part of lawyers if its attention is drawn to it.
Justice Akuffo therefore cautioned lawyers against indiscipline and the desire to get rich in pursuit of their legal profession.
According to her, the increasing number of disciplinary cases before the GLC against younger lawyers was as a result of lack of self-discipline and the desire to “get rich quick”.
She was speaking at the enrolment of 208 lawyers at the Banquet Hall, State House, in Accra.
Mr Isaac Danso Egyiri was adjudged the overall best student and winner of the John Mensah Sarbah Memorial Award.
Ms Akuffo, who admonished the newly trained lawyers with Biblical quotations from: I Timothy 6:10 and Proverbs 22:1, tasked the young lawyers to allow the two biblical texts to be their guiding principles.
The Chief Justice took them through their undertaking and said the study of law had no end because every day the law develops and changes. She urged them to research in order to be abreast with the developments in all fields of the law.
“Do not delude yourselves into thinking that your education is over, this is the beginning of your career and you cannot predict the destination of your journey,” she said.
According to the Chief Justice, as newly trained lawyers, they would soon realize that they would not be able to rely exclusively on the legal knowledge acquired during their training.
“To prove yourself worthy of the study of law, you need to read on a wide range of topics and develop a legal mind that can be very incisive to help solve problems of the community in which you live.
“This has become imperative in our contemporary world characterized by new evolving technologies, challenges and opportunities,” she added.
She said as they were being called to the Bar, it was important that they play a crucial role in the maintenance of law and order as well as rule of law in whatever endeavour they found themselves.
“I remind you of your special duty to the legal profession, to the court, to your clients and to the country as a whole. You have to be disciplined, truthful, diligent, courteous and humble in all you do.
“As new lawyers, you are the eyes of the communities in which you live and the society's expectation of you to live beyond reproach cannot be overemphasized.''
Ms Sophia A.B. Akuffo, the Chief Justice, Justices William Atuguba and Sophia Adinyira, both Supreme Court Judges, Ms Gloria Akuffo, Minister of Justice and Attorney General and Mr Emmanuel Kofi Diaba, President of the Western Regional Bar Association, took turns to present certificates to the newly enrolled lawyers.
The freezing, miserable, arctic conditions at the Stadium of Light on Saturday and the predictable – almost routine – defeat to Preston seemed to sum up perfectly the bleak situation Sunderland football club is in right now.
Even before a ball was kicked, news came through that Darron Gibson had embarrassed himself and the club again, so with all the problems Chris Coleman has he certainly didn't need more news that shows the club in a bad light just before a game.
For the second game in succession, Sunderland went into the interval with nothing between the two teams and the game there for the taking if they wanted it enough.
But just like last week at QPR, they managed to go down to 10 men and never even threatened Preston.
Everybody knew the importance of Saturday's game, and the lift a win would give – can you believe it would have moved Sunderland to just two points from safety?
Yet we can't even finish a game with 11 men, never mind grind out a much-needed three points.
Jake Clarke-Salter might have all the promise and trappings that come from being a prospect at champions Chelsea, but he has let himself and Sunderland down with his dismissal just an hour into his comeback game from another three match suspension.
Coleman again made changes, three this time but it didn't work and afterwards in his press conference he said he is trying everything; formations, personnel etc but maybe that is part of the problem.
In seasons gone by, when Sunderland have survived, it has usually coincided with the manager finding a settled starting XI but I don't think Coleman is anywhere nearer knowing his best team now than when he first joined, although injuries and suspension are making that almost impossible.
His frustration is clear to see in his interviews, as game after game he has to explain ridiculous goals conceded like the first one which came from a long straight free kick that should be meat and drink for any defence but somehow ends up with a free header for Preston's Sean Maguire.
Sunderland and the rest of the league go into a two-week international break now but I don't know any SAFC fan who doesn't wish the break was a lot longer.

The Detroit Pistons are still in the market for a head coach, as the team decided to fire Stan Van Gundy at the beginning of the month. While a report indicated that Detroit's “primary option” to replace Van Gundy was former Toronto coach Dwane Casey, a new report indicates the Pistons will also consider doing something a little unconventional.
According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, Detroit plans on bringing TNT analyst Kenny Smith for an interview for their head coaching vacancy. There is no word on when the interview will take place, or whether the Pistons are legitimately interested in Smith or just doing their due diligence in their search.
The Detroit Pistons plan to interview TNT analyst and former NBA champion Kenny Smith for the franchise's head coaching job, league sources tell Yahoo. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) May 30, 2018
Smith doesn't have any head coaching experience, and has been an analyst for TNT's coverage of the NBA for nearly two decades. He did win a pair of rings during his NBA career as a player for the Houston Rockets, and has been a candidate for head coaching gigs in the past, most recently when he interviewed for the New York Knicks' vacancy that eventually went to David Fizdale.
Detroit is certainly a team that could use a hard reset — the franchise has made the postseason once in the last nine years — although it's fair to be skeptical about whether a first-time coach like Smith would be a good fit. Regardless, Kenny Smith having a head coaching gig would make Inside the NBA especially fun on nights when the Pistons are on national television.
DALLAS (AP) -- Former ESPN reporter Ed Werder, who has covered the NFL for 34 years, has won the Dick McCann Award from the Professional Football Writers of America.
Werder spent the last 19 years at ESPN before being let go earlier this year.
The McCann Award is given to a reporter who has made a long and distinguished contribution to pro football through his or her coverage. The award is named the first director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1962-67) who also was a longtime reporter in New York with several newspapers.
During his time at ESPN from 1998-2017, Werder appeared weekly on several studio shows, covered games and the draft. He also worked for CNNSI, CNN, the Dallas Morning News (1992-96) and Fort Worth Star-Telegram (1989) covering the Cowboys. Before that, he was an NFL beat writer for the Orlando Sentinel and the Boulder Daily Camera from 1984-89.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A Norwegian aluminum maker operating in Brazil is apologizing for polluting a river and promising to make changes so that it doesn't happen again.
In a statement Monday, the CEO of Norsk Hydro, Svein Richard Brandtzaeg, called the discharge of rain and surface water into the Para River "unacceptable." Brandtzaeg went on to apologize and say an ongoing environmental review of its practices would be expanded.
The company's plant is located in the city of Barcarena in the northern state of Para. Last month, residents alerted environmental authorities to a reddish hue in puddles and flooded areas near the river after some heavy rains.
Authorities said they found areas of irregular discharge. The company initially said it had not released untreated water into the environment, then said it would investigate.
Police have confirmed that they made one arrest amid violent scenes before Liverpool's Champions League semi-final, first leg game against Italian side AS Roma at Anfield which led to one person being taken to hospital with injuries.
Television images from the BBC showed groups of youths fighting outside the stadium before the game, with one person seen lying in the street receiving attention while fighting continued. One male was filmed carrying a hammer.

“We can confirm a man has been arrested following an assault near to the Albert public house earlier this evening,” said a statement from Merseyside Police on Twitter.
“He has been taken to a police station where he will be interviewed by detectives. The 53-year-old victim is currently being treated for his injuries.”
Earlier, police said they were investigating “a serious assault of a man” outside the Albert pub at about 7.35pm, 10 minutes before the game, which Liverpool won 5-2, kicked off.
The BBC reported that a group of Roma supporters attacked Liverpool fans using belts

John Dramani Mahama, Former President of Ghana
Former President John Dramani Mahama on Thursday advised Liberians to respect all the electoral laws and conduct themselves well as they go to the polls on Tuesday, October 10, this year.
“What we all need to understand is that, there is only one winner in every election… and the success of an election is not about winning, but about losing and how you conduct yourselves afterwards.”
Former President Mahama was addressing Liberians when he arrived there as the head of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) observer group for the Liberian general election on October 10.
The Former President who arrived in the Liberian capital on Thursday would return to Ghana after the October 10 polls.
He urged the Liberians to respect the rules and regulations of the game by avoiding anything that could undermine the exercise in the coming days.
“Not a single drop of Liberian blood is worth political power and I therefore urge all of you to conduct yourselves well before, during and even after the polls.”
He said 21 short-term and 50 longterm ECOWAS observers had arrived in the West African country and would be deployed in all corners of the country to observe the polls and called on Liberians to collaborate with them to ensure successful polls.
Former President Mahama said Africa was consolidating democracy by holding general elections and hoped Liberians would live up to expectation to be counted among leading democratic African countries.
He urged all those who had grievances to channel them to the right quarters for redress.
Dear Diary:
I was at 7th Avenue Donuts in Park Slope. There was a young couple a few tables over. They were laughing and holding menus.
“Are you ready to order?” the waitress asked with a smile.
“Sorry, not yet,” the young man said.
“Just a few minutes,” the young woman added.
“No problem,” the waitress replied. “It's great you're engaged.”
The couple looked at each other. The waitress chuckled.
“Sorry, I mean engaged in conversation,” she said. “Take your time.”
Ten minutes later, they were putting on their coats. They did not seem to be laughing.

"Last year we lost both houses of the Legislature and suffered a devastating defeat," reads the letter from the Coalition to Draft Rick Nolan for Governor. "We need a candidate for governor who appeals to the broadest number of Minnesotans, based on proven DFL policies and principles."
The group warns: "If we lose the governorship in 2018, we will become Wisconsin," a reference to the Republican control of the Badger State's Legislature and governor's seat.
Nolan's spokeswoman in January said Nolan is considering a run and didn't have a timeline for making a decision.
The coalition that sent the letter includes current and former state legislators such as Joe Begich, Ron Dicklich, Rob Ecklund, Jason Metsa and David Tomassoni. The group also includes Iron Range businesspeople and mining interests and is chaired by 8th District DFL Chair Justin Perpich.
"At a time when the DFL Party is reeling from significant losses in the 2016 elections, Congressman Nolan is the perfect candidate to stop the party's hemorrhaging of working class voters," the group said in an email Tuesday.
Nolan would join a growing field of DFL contenders for governor: State Auditor Rebecca Otto, St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and state Rep. Erin Murphy of St. Paul all have thrown their hats in the ring. Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Keith Downey, Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt and Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson are also vying for the nomination from their party.
Incumbent DFL Gov. Mark Dayton has said he will not seek re-election in 2018.

Jordan Gavaris, who plays Felix Dawkins, the gay brother of Sarah Manning on Orphan Black, came out as gay in an interview with Vulture.
The reason he came out now was because he's never been asked before:
What is your sexual orientation?
Oh, I'm gay.
I wasn't sure.
Nobody ever asks me. I've never been asked. Like, the whole course of the series.
I guess that's where I'm at in terms of coming out publicly: I had this position when I started on the show that it shouldn't matter. And I believe that. I hope that one day, the world gets to a place where you don't need to politicize your sexuality any more than someone needs to politicize their race — that we can just act and we can exist in this Zeitgeist, telling stories about one another. And that no one's afraid, maybe, to come out. But also that no one's really hyperobsessed with knowing whether or not someone's gay. That would be an amazing world to live in, where people don't feel the need to protect themselves and other people don't feel the need to launch an inquisition.
Gavaris added that there's a real fear (expressed also in an interview by Colton Haynes earlier this week) of losing work as a gay actor.
This is a tricky thing to say and I've never actually said it out loud before, but I do believe that jobs will be lost and I do believe jobs will be gained. Maybe not even for the right reasons. There's been a lot of conversation in the industry about hiring openly gay actors for gay parts, and I think that's really important. But frankly, I'm not interested in doing any kind of work where I couldn't bring myself in totality to the character. And if that would mean that I am ultimately not the right fit in terms of casting, then I probably shouldn't play that part anyways. That's not to say that's an open license to discriminate against openly gay actors. There's a big distinction. It's just that if whatever somebody sees as gayness, whether it's femininity or hypersexuality or whatever they've decided constitutes being gay — if those parts are not right for their character, chances are I don't want to work with those people and I probably don't want to play that character. I'm much more interested in playing characters, even hetero characters, where I can bring all of myself. All of my sexuality. Everything I've learned about my own femininity and my own gender fluidity, I'd be interested in playing characters that explore that. And I think we're going to start seeing more of them.
Gavaris goes on to talk about femininity, masculinity, and much more in the excellent interview which you can read in full HERE.
Here's Gavaris talking about feedback he received on his character from the LGBT community:

The developer of a Motel 6 has sued Phillipsburg, claiming the town changed its zoning rules specifically to block the motel.
The bias against the motel was evident when a zoning board member said the town was "not about to approve an (expletive) motel for a slum lord like the plaintiff."
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday, Dec. 5, in federal court by Lehigh Land Developers of Allentown. Joe Clark owns the development company. He previously ran the now defunct Crocodile Rock club in Allentown.
He wants to put the 56-room motel at 540 Marshall St., a group of offices once called the Norton Business Campus, according to the lawsuit. The property was owned by Norton Partnership. Richard Norton owned an oil business that went bankrupt across the street from the proposed hotel property.
When Lehigh Land Development bought the 2-acre property in 2013, it was zoned to allow the hotel, according to the lawsuit.
Lehigh Land Development submitted the motel plan for approval in December 2014, but by January 2015 the town changed the zoning to exclude hotels, the lawsuit says.
Is Motel 6 a good fit for this Phillipsburg property?
A zoning permit for the motel was denied March 1, 2017, and an appeal was denied March 21, the lawsuit says.
Lehigh Land Development didn't receive notice to challenge the zoning change prior to the vote in 2015, the lawsuit says. There was no basis for the zoning change except to punish Lehigh Land Development, the lawsuit says.
Town attorney Rich Wenner said he hadn't see the lawsuit yet. Typically the town doesn't comment on pending lawsuits anyway, he said.
The town as well as its planning board were named as defendants in the lawsuit.

ORLANDO, Fla. (WESH) — The Great Movie Ride and Ellen's Energy Adventure, two classic Walt Disney World rides, closed for good on Sunday.
The first to close was Ellen's Energy Adventure at Epcot. The ride will be replaced by a Guardians of the Galaxy attraction. Wait times for the ride weren't too lengthy on Sunday.
The wait to ride the Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios was much longer, with many people waiting almost two hours to ride it one more time.
The Great Movie Ride will be replaced by the first Mickey and Minnie ride.
Disney announced last month that the rides would be replaced by the new attractions. Since then, commemorative souvenirs such as T-shirts and mugs have been available for sale in the parks.
Disney officials said they sometimes offer unique items to “commemorate special moments in our parks.”

A Northern California city has agreed to pay $2.65 million to the family of a mentally ill Gulf War veteran fatally shot by police in 2014 after his family called 911.
The Sacramento Bee reports Tuesday the agreement between the city of Lodi and the family of Parminder Singh Shergill settles a federal lawsuit the family filed accusing the officers of excessive force.
Shergill was killed after his sister-in-law called 911 and said he was a paranoid schizophrenic who was "going crazy" and was attacking his mother. Shergill's family says he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after participating in Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s.
Officers fatally shot Shergill as he walked through his neighborhood after they said he charged at them with a knife. Shergill's family disputes that account.

Lumina News publisher/editor Pat Bradford and news director Terry Lane have reached terms on Lane taking over the weekly newspaper's publishing and ownership. The Thursday Feb. 16 issue will be Bradford's last as publisher, with Lane taking over the publisher/owner role for print and online editions the following week.
Bradford founded Lumina News in May 2002. Lane joined the paper in July 2015.
Lumina News has been a consistent first place award winner in its North Carolina Press Association newspaper category, including 9 new top awards for 2016, which will be awarded on March 9th.
“I am excited and pleased by this passing of the torch. Lumina News is an outstanding community paper and I am confident Terry has everything it takes to make it thrive in this new age we are in. He loves the paper and he loves this community,” Bradford said Thursday, Feb. 9, when the news was released.
Bradford said she is proud of the status Lumina News enjoys in the Wrightsville and greater Wilmington community.
“When I went to Raleigh in years past to join the fight against legislation that negatively impacted newspapers, one of the heartwarming eye-openers was how widely read Lumina News was by state legislators including those who do not even represent this district,” she said.
Bradford said she will focus more of her attention on the stellar monthly sister publication she co-founded in fall of 2000, Wrightsville Beach Magazine.
“I am excited to go to work every day,” she said. “The magazine has never been more exceptional. It blesses me mightily to hear readers repeatedly express their increasing delight in the quality of Wrightsville Beach Magazine. Over our 17-year history I never dreamed we would reach so many people with stories of such importance. It is an honor to do what we do every month.”
Bradford also indicated she would be filing for local office for the next election cycle.
“I came to Wrightsville Beach on an impulse and wound up falling in love with it here. I'm humbled and honored to have this opportunity to deliver the news and stories about this wonderful place,” Lane said. “I've promised Pat that I will put every effort into preserving and growing the distinguished legacy she built at Lumina News. It will be a challenge, but one I enthusiastically accept.”
DEVON, Pa. (AP) — It's a top equestrian event, but all eyes are on the hats, not the horses.
Women and girls showed off their fanciest headwear Wednesday on Ladies Day at the Devon Horse Show in the suburbs of Philadelphia. The event was first held in 1896 and lasts for 11 days. It's known as one of the nation's last old-fashioned horse shows.
The show made headlines after a horse bolted Tuesday evening, jumped a fence and fled into the crowd.
But by the next day, feathers, feathers bows, ribbons and chiffon were the story.

Maybe that was all a smoke screen, maybe not.
Maybe they love one of them, maybe they don't.
Elway has done a good job of hiding his intentions, saying only that he'll take "the best player that is best for the Denver Broncos" regardless of what position he plays.
"I'm open to trading," too, Elway added, although it would certainly take a blow-me-away offer for him to move out of the fifth spot in a draft so deep in high-level, even generational talent outside the enticing quarterback group.
Elway always tries to fill his biggest needs in free agency so he won't have to reach in the draft and can simply take the best player. Signing Keenum gave him that safeguard this year.
Elway won't have to settle for anything less than the QB atop his wish list, and if he's not there, Elway can bypass the quarterbacks altogether to grab a prime playmaker at another position.
RUN ON RUNNING BACKS
Elway suggested the Broncos will dive into the deep pool of running backs after releasing sixth-year pro C.J. Anderson last week.
"It's a deep running back class as I'm sure you've heard," Elway said. "We feel good about the fact that we'll be able to get a good one."
KUBIAK COMEBACK
Gary Kubiak, Elway's former backup, play-caller and head coach who returned to the team in a scouting role last summer has a much bigger role in drawing up the Broncos' draft blueprints.
"Gary is a very good evaluator," Elway said. "He has suggestions and his are very important and those go into the pot."
HITS, MISSES AND BARGAINS
Since former GM Brian Xanders' departure in 2012, Elway hasn't drafted a single Pro Bowl player. Only the Saints and Browns join Denver in that ignominious category.
Elway's best pick since assuming more power was CB Bradley Roby at No. 31 in 2014. But his other top selections include Sylvester Williams, Shane Ray, Paxton Lynch and Garett Bolles. His second-round record is even spottier: Montee Ball, Cody Latimer, Ty Sambrailo, Adam Gotsis and DeMarcus Walker.
Center Matt Paradis, a sixth-round gem in 2014, is just about his only bargain in Elway's past five drafts.
A bounce-back season in 2018 might very well come down to Elway having a draft as he did with Xanders in 2011, when they teamed up to pick Miller, Rahim Moore, Orlando Franklin, Nate Irving, Julius Thomas and Virgil Green.

BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles have claimed utility infielder Jace Peterson after he was placed on waivers by the New York Yankees.
Peterson, a left-handed hitter, is expected to report Wednesday.
He provides depth to an infield that is without injured second baseman Jonathan Schoop and could potentially lose Tim Beckham, who left Monday's game against Cleveland with a groin injury.
The 27-year-old Peterson played in three games with the Yankees this season, going 3 for 10 with a walk.
In Wisconsin for the Foxconn groundbreaking and a tech-center announcement, CEO Terry Gou also made an unannounced stop – at ginseng farm near Wausau.

PAPILLION, NEB (KMTV) - Walking a dog in Papillion led to a vicious attack, when another dog pounced on a small pooch.
Tonight authorities are still trying to find the bigger dog.
Copper is in really bad shape after he was attacked Friday.
He had surgery and is at home recovering.
Tonight his owners are looking for his attacker.
Copper is clearly in pain.
"I feel devastated every time I look at him."
Ed Melechson says Copper was walking with his son and a family friend Friday, when he crossed paths with what the family says may be an American Bulldog.
"Less than five minutes later they came back, the dog had his tail in between his legs, ran upstairs coward in the corner."
Melechson says two tall teenage girls were walking the other dog when their dog became aggressive.
"As soon as the dog saw Copper he charged, the girls fell to the ground and lost control of the leash."
A family friend says within seconds he stepped in and pulled the dog by the neck off of copper.
"If I didn't something bad would have happened to Copper, and I didn't want that to happen."
Copper's owners say they immediately drove around the neighborhood looking for any signs of the girls or their dog.
"We could not find them; they ran away with their dog."
The Nebraska Humane Society is calling it a public safety matter, it could have easily been a child.
"We will be cruising that area to locate that dog but we are really hoping someone will call, so we can have a talk with them.”
The Melechson's are now offering a $500 dollar reward for anyone who can help find Copper's attacker.
The Nebraska Humane Society is asking anyone with information to come forward.
The other dog owner may face citations and up to six months in jail.
Mystery Solved? DNA Reveals the Truth About the Yeti
Huge, ape-like and hairy, the yeti has roamed its way into legend, tantalizing explorers, mountaineers and locals with curious footprints and fleeting appearances. Now researchers say the elusive inhabitant of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau has been unmasked.
Scientists studying nine samples -- including hair and teeth -- supposedly from yetis, say the samples are not from a huge hominin but in fact mostly belonged to bears.
Just one sample, taken from a curious stuffed "yeti," bucked the trend -- the creature turned out to be a taxidermy mash-up boasting the hair of a bear and the teeth of a dog.
"It demonstrates that modern science can really try and tackle some of these mysteries and unsolved questions that we have," said Dr Charlotte Lindqvist, an expert on bear genomics and co-author of the research from the University at Buffalo.
The study is not the first time it has been suggested the yeti might be more ursine than abominable.
A recent study, based on genetic analysis from samples purportedly from yeti-like creatures the world over, found that while most of the samples came from known animals, two from Bhutan and the Indian Himalayas were more mysterious. The team suggested they might be from an unknown species of bear, or a descendant from a hybrid of a polar and brown bear.
But Lindqvist was unconvinced, pointing out there was too little data to rule out a more mundane explanation. "I just didn't trust these claims," she said.
Lindqvist and colleagues examined nine samples gathered by a company shooting a film on the topic. Sources included mummified animals found in monasteries, hair collected by nomadic herdsmen, bone from a spiritual healer and a stuffed "yeti" from the Messner Mountain Museum.
The team also analyzed 15 other samples from zoos, national parks and museums, the majority of which were known to be from Himalayan brown bears.
The analysis, which was based on sequences of DNA from the energy powerhouses of the cell known as mitochondria, involved a comparison of all of the samples with genetic data from a large international database.
"Of those nine samples, eight of them matched local bears that are found in the region today," said Lindqvist, adding that the ninth sample was the dog tooth from the stuffed yeti. "The purported yetis from the Tibetan plateau matched Tibetan brown bears, the ones from the western Himalayan mountains matched the Himalayan brown bear and then, at possibly slightly lower altitude were Asian black bears."
Lindqvist added that the finding produced mixed emotions. "That was obviously very interesting to me, perhaps slightly disappointing to the film company," she said, adding that the new samples also helped the team to gain new insights into the evolutionary "family tree" of bears.
But Lindqvist says she doubts the study will be the final word on the yeti. "I am sure, though, that the legend and the myth will live on," she said. "You can never for sure prove that there is nothing out there."
The results, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are likely to disappoint cryptozoologists. Jonathan Downes, director of the Centre for Fortean Zoology, said that while he applauded the scientific work and agreed that many samples are obviously from bears, he believes the mystery is not yet solved.
"I think there is still a possibility that there are unknown species of higher primate which are still awaiting discovery in what used to be Soviet central Asia," he said.

The letter specifically says, "it is important to understand that the FCC's proposed Order is based on a flawed and factually inaccurate understanding of Internet technology." These problems were outlined in detail and sent to the FCC as part of a 43-page-long comment back in July. The FCC did not correct its misunderstandings, but instead "premised the proposed Order on the very technical flaws the comment explained," according to the letter.
The letter also calls out the problems with issues with the FCC's comment system. FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote a powerful op-ed at Wired asking for an investigation into the public comments on the proposal, after it came to light that around a million comments were fraudulently filed using the names of real people. Another half million were from Russian email addresses. The letter makes it clear that the FCC has failed to respond to a FOIA request from the attorney general of New York about these problems.
We've discussed in detail how the repeal of net neutrality would be disastrous, and also how it would hurt artists and small businesses the most. Plenty of companies and organizations have come out against the repeal, but it's unclear whether the ongoing commentary surrounding the issue is having any effect on the FCC. Apparently we'll find out on December 14th.

The Latest on problems with an emergency spillway at the nation's tallest dam (all times local):
7:25 a.m.
The Oroville Reservoir is continuing to drain as state water officials scrambled to reduce the lake's level ahead of impending storms.
The Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/2lKMK5I) that the reservoir was down 20 feet since it reached capacity on Sunday when it overflowed and sparked an evacuation order for nearly 200,000 people south of the dam.
Officials say the lake is draining at 100,000 cubic feet per second, reducing the reservoir about a foot every three hours. The Department of Water Resources wants to drop the reservoir's level 50 feet overall by Sunday.
Forecasts call for 2-4 inches of rain and snow in the foothills and mountains starting Wednesday night or early Thursday. But the storm was looking colder than initially projected, meaning less rain and less runoff than last week's storms.
—————
12:30 a.m.
The stress of evacuation and an uncertain future were enough for Donald Azevedo and his family to opt to stay a few more nights in an emergency shelter rather than risk having to do it all again.
The family was among the nearly 200,000 Californians who live downstream from the country's tallest dam who were told they could return home but warned they may have to flee again if repairs made to the battered Oroville Dam spillways don't hold.
The fixes could be put to their first test later this week with the first of a series of small storms forecast for the region expected to reach the area Wednesday night.
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (WFLA) – Monday evening, you may of heard Chris Blue's amazing performance on NBC's “The Voice.” It was enough to get the Florida native, who was born and raised in Winter Haven, America's vote to stay on the show.
News Channel 8 spoke to Chris Blue's mother before the show and you can bet she's one proud lady. She tells us he's had this talent since the age of three.
“He's always had this special touch, this special gift,” said Janice Blue-Williams.
It was that gift, along with his passion for music, that got Alicia Keys out of her seat and dancing along with Blue's performance.
Born in Winter Haven, Blue spent his spare time perfecting his pitch, and as his mom tells us, he definitely has a favorite genre of music.
“Gospel. He loves soulful music,” said Blue-Williams. “He loves pop, jazz, but most of his life he's always done gospel.”
Blue said it's part of why he leans on God in his most frustrating times, like when his long distance girlfriend was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.
“I remember just sitting on my floor like, ‘God are you really about to take her away?' I just sat on my floor and I cried like a baby.”
After her recovery, he realized he could trust in God and dare to dream big.
“I went and auditioned. Never thought I was good enough to even get through that first stage. So, I went and stood in that 6,000 person line.”
It's a good thing he did, because his vibe, vocals and talent caught the eye of pop star Alicia Keys.
“She had one spot left on her team, and she would not push her button….and then she told me ‘I waited on you.'“
Now that Blue survived the all-important playoff round thanks to America's vote, he's now officially in the top 12.
All of us here at News Channel 8 and Great 38 wish Chris Blue the best of luck!

In the last year, there's been a big drop in support for charter schools, while other forms of school choice are getting a little less unpopular. That's the top line of a national poll released today.
President Trump and his education secretary Betsy DeVos have put school choice front and center on their education agenda. The general idea of "choice," however, takes many forms.
Charter schools are paid for by tax dollars, charge no tuition and are managed independently of public school districts.
Vouchers allow students to use tax dollars to pay tuition at private schools.
Tax-credit scholarships, now available in 17 states, which allow individuals and companies to get a tax credit for donating to scholarship funds that are used in turn for private school tuition.
U.S. opinion on these ideas seems to be shifting, according to a new poll from EducationNext, an opinion and policy journal associated with free-market education reform ideas. They've been asking similar questions for the past decade.
Here are the latest results:
Charters: Last year 51 percent of the public supported "the formation of charter schools"; this year it's just 39 percent, a 12 point drop in one year.
Vouchers: 45 percent are either strongly or somewhat supportive of universal vouchers. That's a bounce from last year, but more or less in line with the five years before.
Tax credits: This was the most popular form of school choice with 55 percent of the general public supporting this year; also a one-year bounce, but in line with longer-term trends.
There's no one obvious explanation for the change in opinion on charter schools. The drop was seen among both Democrats and Republicans and amongst all racial and ethnic groups.
"That's the largest change on any survey item, and one of the largest single-year changes in opinion that we've seen over the 11-year history of the survey," Martin West, the editor-in-chief of EducationNext, said on a press conference call.
The wording of the question — about the formation of charter schools — may hold a clue. In theory, it might be possible to have very positive feelings about the charter schools currently in your community, yet still oppose new ones.
And the expansion of charters is exactly what communities around the country have been fighting over.
Last year the NAACP and Black Lives Matter called for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools (the NAACP called more recently for a ban on for-profit management of these schools). The state of Massachusetts saw a bruising fight over its charter cap. Detroit's proliferation of charters has been labeled "a glut" and "chaos." And charter expansion was the central issue in the school board race in Los Angeles, one of the biggest public school districts in the country.
The nationally representative poll breaks down respondents by political party, and there's a clear partisan divide on many issues, even as public opinion shifts. Last year, for example, 57 percent of Democrats favored universal vouchers, against 45 percent of Republicans. This year they've switched places: 62 percent of Republicans like them and only 50 percent of Democrats agree.
Zeroing in on that political divide, pollsters also measured what they called the "Trump effect." That is, how do responses change when some people are told that the president supports or opposes a particular issue?
They found that self-identified Republicans are more likely to support an issue if they are informed that Trump also supports it, while Democrats are the opposite. However, Trump's net influence is nearly nil, which makes him less of a force than President Obama was in this poll in 2009. Back then, when respondents on all sides were told the new President supported an education issue, they were more likely to back it, by double digits.
This poll, then, serves as a snapshot of what some have called the breakdown of a long-standing bipartisan consensus on education that dated back to No Child Left Behind.
Still, there is one enduring issue where blue- and red-state opinions are near-identical: approval of the local public schools. 55 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of Democrats give local schools a B or an A.
Ex-Minister Seeks $1bn ECA for Research in Tertiary Institutions
Emmanuel Addeh in Yenagoa
A former Minister of Science and Technology, Prof. Turner Isoun has called on the federal and state governments to agree to withdraw another $1 billion from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) for research and innovation in tertiary institutions in the country if they are serious about education.
Isoun, who spoke at the first matriculation ceremony of the University of Africa, Toru-Orua (UAT), funded through a public-private arrangement by the Bayelsa State government, said Nigeria would continue to lag behind if serious funding is not devoted to research to be overseen by exceptional academics in Nigerian universities.
In his lecture, ‘The University of Africa: In pursuit of an Innovative and Sustainable University, Responding to the Challenges of a State and a Nation', he said beyond the long speeches during workshops, the government must begin to fund research in Nigerian tertiary institutions.
“The federal and state governments must consider that their contributions to the funding of tertiary education is an investment in their self-interest, as opposed to an expenditure with no returns.
“I wish to challenge the federal and state governments to allocate $1 billion from the excess crude account from which they have certain statutory rights to a fund established by law for use by tertiary institutions.
“If these funds are used to address specific (relevant) problems and needs, through innovative research and its application to products and services, there will be high returns on investment, both financial (to the government) and through improvement to the quality of life and employment opportunities for civil society.
He added: “This fund could for example enable an academically diverse team of innovative academics and students to design a practical means of providing renewable energy systems targeted for use in our remote schools.” Isoun said while some people many argue that the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) was set up to achieve that aim, over 80 per cent of the fund is devoted to physical infrastructure, rather than intense scientific academic research.
While also calling for the establishment of more
universities, he regretted that the 160 universities in the
country could only provide admission for one third of the
average of 1.5 million candidates that apply for university
education annually.
In his remarks, Governor of Seriake Dickson bemoaned the
existing model for funding tertiary education in the country
and argued that it was not realistic to have quality
university education, considered the bedrock of societal
development which is cheaper than nursery education even
within the country.
Dickson also stated that the university is owned by the
Bayelsa government though with a different model designed to
make it self-sustaining through exploring creatives means of
generating revenue.
“The universities owned by the federal and state
governments rely totally on the government for their
running. Look at the decline in the standard of education,
the tendency of our elite to send their children to schools
abroad, whose funding model is different.
“We have announced a policy that the tertiary institutions
in Bayelsa would have to look inward. government would give
grants, build infrastructure, give loans for business
development. That is the new direction in Bayelsa.
“When university education is cheaper than nursery
education, we are not realistic. When it is cheap, it cannot
give us the quality and the innovation that we seek. When
university education becomes cheaper than nursery education,
then something has gone wrong,” he said.
The former Minister of Education, Alhaji Ibrahim Shekarau,
who was chairman of the event, urged the matriculating
students to take advantage of the opportunity of the
admission offered them to excel in their academics and
conduct so that the institution would be proud of them.
The acting Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Valentine Aletor also
warned the students against anti-social behaviour, saying
that the institution has zero tolerance for cultism,
forming of gangs, use of hard drugs, indecent dressing,
bullying and insubordination.

× Expand Photo by Sarah Finnegan. The Park Trace subdivision sits across the street from Trace Crossings Elementary School.
Trace Crossings, a planned community begun in 1987, has earned a place in Hoover history.
With the exception of Riverchase, it's the city's oldest, largest planned development, said planning consultant Bob House.
It's home to Hoover Metropolitan Stadium and Hoover High School – both of which have iconic sports-world status.
The Hoover Met hosts the annual SEC Baseball Tournament and was home to the Birmingham Barons for 24 years.
Hoover High has won 12 state football titles and was featured in the MTV series “Two-A-Days.”
And adjacent to The Met, Hoover is building an $80 million sports complex that city officials say should attract out-of-town visitors and additional commercial development.
Trace Crossings – developed by U.S. Steel, or USS Real Estate – is a mixed-use area, with residential, commercial and light-industrial uses.
It originally contained about 1,200 acres, with about 260 for houses or apartments, House said.
However, the development has been expanded and now has about 2,225 total acres, said Karen Furlow of Associa McKay Management, which manages the development.
Most of that additional land was for houses. The building of Brock's Gap Parkway, which was completed in 2001, opened up several new neighborhoods.
Today, Trace Crossings has about 1,270 houses built, House said.
There are plans for about 40 more in the Brock's Gap area, plus 499 houses on the Lake Wilborn property, where Signatures Home plans to start building this year.
At press time, negotiations were under way to annex another 211 acres into the city and add 235 acres to Trace Crossings. Plans called for adding 421 houses to Trace Crossings.
Most of the commercial land has been developed, House said.
However, USS Corp. has been trying to arezone additional industrial land for commercial use. This was unpopular, and negotiations have been under way for a resolution.
The 155,000-square-foot Finley Center — an indoor facility for sports, trade shows and other events — is expected to open in May 2017.
When combined with the outdoor sports fields, the complex is expected to have a direct economic impact of $33.4 million in its fifth year.
Councilman Mike Shaw said it's exciting to think about the positive impact it will have on the community.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A doctor who saw Prince in the days before he died had prescribed oxycodone under the name of Prince's friend to protect the musician's privacy, according to court documents unsealed Monday that revealed nothing about how the pop superstar got the fentanyl that actually killed him.
The affidavits and search warrants were unsealed in Carver County District Court as the yearlong investigation into Prince's death continues. The documents show authorities searched Paisley Park, cellphone records of Prince's associates, and Prince's email accounts to try to determine how he got the fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times more powerful than heroin.
They don't reveal answers, but do shed light on Prince's struggle with addiction in the days before he died. Oxycodone, a painkiller, was not listed as a cause of Prince's death.
Prince was 57 when he was found alone and unresponsive in an elevator at his Paisley Park home on April 21.
A search of Prince's home yielded numerous pills in various containers. Some were in prescription bottles for Kirk Johnson, Prince's longtime friend and associate. Some pills in other bottles were marked as if they were a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone — but at least one of those tested positive for fentanyl, meaning the pill was counterfeit and could only be obtained illegally.
The documents show Prince was struggling with an addiction to prescription opioids. Just six days before he died, Prince fell ill on a plane and made an emergency stop in Illinois as he was returning home from a concert in Atlanta. First responders revived him with two doses of a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.
One affidavit says Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince April 7, 2016, and again on April 20, admitted to authorities that he prescribed oxycodone for Prince the same day as the emergency plane landing “but put the prescription in Kirk Johnson's name for Prince's privacy.”
Authorities also searched Johnson's cellphone records, to see who he was communicating with in the month before Prince died.
Messages left with attorneys for Schulenberg and Johnson weren't immediately returned Monday. Schulenberg has an active medical license and is currently practicing family medicine in Minnesota. His attorney, Amy Conners, told the AP last week that there are no restrictions on his license.
Investigators haven't interviewed either Johnson or Schulenberg since the hours after Prince died, an official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.
While authorities have the power to ask a grand jury to investigate and issue subpoenas for testimony, that step hasn't been taken, the official said.
Prince did not have a cellphone, and authorities searched multiple email accounts that belonged to him, as they tried to determine who he was communicating with and where he got the drugs that killed him, according to the search warrants. The search warrants don't reveal the outcome of the email searches.
The documents say some of the drugs in Prince's bedroom were in a suitcase with the name “Peter Bravestrong” on it. Police believe Bravestrong was an alias that Prince used when he traveled. The suitcase also contained lyrics for the song “U Got the Look” that appeared to be in Prince's handwriting.
Investigators have said little about the case over the last year, other than it is active. The official who spoke to the AP said the case has taken investigators to Illinois and California, as authorities have interviewed friends, family and any potential witnesses, including the flight crew and hospital staff that were present when Prince overdosed on the plane.

“I wish I lived in an area where my kids could play outside any time of day.”
“I wish I lived in an area where my kids could play outside any time of day,” said Esther Bejarano, a mother whose two children suffer from asthma. She is an educator for Comite Civico del Valle (CCV), a local organization that supports the health of the area's disadvantaged residents. She knows the risks, regulates how much time her own children spend outside depending on the levels of pollution, and makes sure they have their medication and inhalers with them at all times. Despite taking these steps, she still lives in a state of fear. “I expect the worst and pray for their health.”
Even before Trump took office, government response to air pollution in the region has been lackluster. Luis Olmedo, executive director of CCV, said that especially as the recession came to a head in 2008, environmental health concerns took a backseat to economics, and it is now clear that environmental protection will not be a government priority. “With this administration we are back to the [George W.] Bush era, but we are ready and we are prepared, because we have been there before,” he said.
"Low-income communities of color throughout the nation are exposed to toxic pollutants."
In 2013, the CCV began an effort to put the power of scientific data into the hands of community members. Through a partnership with the California Environmental Health Tracking Program, University of Washington, and with funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Imperial Valley Air Quality Control project installed 40 air quality monitors throughout the valley and set up a website to gather pollution information and community-generated reports. The project's goal is to track particulate matter—the hazardous sum of pollution that includes pollen, dust, smoke, and soot—and inform residents of the presence and distribution of possible health risks.
“It gives the community a record on what the government is doing and not doing,” Olmedo said. That information can be used to hold agencies accountable and to inform local, state, and national efforts. Olmedo is confident in the Imperial Valley community's continued support. “We are not dependent on the federal government, and we never have been,” he said.
Residents of Imperial County are predominantly Hispanic and average about half the California per capita income, according to U.S. census data. Due to the placement of highways and fossil fuel refineries, low-income communities of color throughout the nation are exposed to toxic pollutants at significantly higher levels than upper-income Whites, and the CCV air quality control project sought to involve the most affected people from the outset to address this disparity. Imperial Valley residents worked with researchers to select locations to set up the air monitors. The online tool, called Identifying Violations Affecting Neighborhoods (IVAN), was launched in September and allows residents to access air quality information from each monitor, which update every 5 minutes, easily report an environmental issue, and see others' reports.
“We are not dependent on the federal government, and we never have been.”
On Jan. 25, for example, a user submitted a report from El Centro: “Pesticide being applied while farmworkers harvesting.” The site admin then responded, “The [Department of Toxic Substances Control] Imperial CUPA has forwarded this complaint to the Imperial County Ag Commissioner's Office Department of Pesticide Regulation.”
Farther west, San Diego County sits sandwiched between the Imperial Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and it also suffers from extreme levels of air pollution. The district of San Ysidro, located immediately north of the Mexican border, where an estimated 50,000 vehicles cross every day, is at particular risk. Last year, it devised its own community-based air quality project, based on and using the same low-cost monitors as the Imperial Valley project.
The federal government wouldn't mitigate any of the adverse effects from pollution.
“The goal is less about seeing if communities meet those EPA standards and rather understanding where the hot spots are for pollution in the community,” said Edmund Seto, an associate professor with the University of Washington Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Services, who helped develop the air quality monitors. The two-year study, a partnership with the California EPA, University of Washington, and San Diego community organization Casa Familiar, is funded by a $225,000 grant, and currently operates 12 monitors throughout the San Ysidro area.
Results show that the border crossing is a notable hot spot. David Flores, Casa Familiar's community development director, said his organization saw a rise in community involvement in 2007, three years after news broke that the federal government would spend $750 million to rebuild the San Ysidro border inspection facility. This renovation included new vehicle inspection procedures that created longer queues on the highway and more greenhouse gas emissions from idling vehicles. Flores said the federal government wouldn't mitigate any of the adverse effects from pollution.
Their organizations are community-driven and sustained.
Thus, Casa Familiar led the community in developing bottom-up approaches, like the study, to protect themselves. “This study is putting the power in the community residents' hands. This is their data,” said Vanessa Galaviz, a staff toxicologist with the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. She said this is especially important for marginalized communities like San Ysidro.
Both Luis Olmedo, of Imperial Valley's CCV, and David Flores, of San Ysidro's Casa Familiar, were not worried about federal disinterest in climate justice. Their organizations are community-driven and sustained. And Flores is confident in the continued support of the state. “I think the state of California will continue to lead efforts of environment,” he said.
He hoped the results from the current study would qualify San Ysidro as an impacted community, opening the door for greenhouse gas reduction program funding from the state's cap-and-trade proceeds. This would allow the community to take the next step, from monitoring pollution, to investing in sustainable housing and transportation to cut it back.

Lee Brennan provided Tyrone manager Mickey Harte with a timely reminder of his scoring prowess when blasting 3-14 in a club game on Saturday.
The 2015 All-Ireland U21 winner, who only saw three minutes of action in the recent Allianz League campaign as a sub in Tyrone's first round win over Roscommon, racked up the huge tally in Trillick's Division 1 league encounter against Strabane Sigersons. Of the 3-14, 3-8 came from play as the St. Macartan's ran out easy 4-19 to 0-10 winners.
Brennan's haul betters the 2-16 the Allianz League's top scorer John Heslin famously posted for St. Loman's in their 2013 Westmeath SFC semi-final victory over Garrycastle.
Typewriter enthusiasts gather at an Albuquerque restaurant to experiment with vintage Smith Coronas. Fans in Boston kneel in a city square and type stories about their lives during a pro-immigration demonstration. A documentary on typewriters featuring Tom Hanks and musician John Mayer is set for release this summer.
In the age of smartphones, social media and hacking fears, vintage typewriters that once gathered dust in attics and basements are attracting a new generation of fans across the U.S.
From public "type-ins" at bars to street poets selling personalized, typewritten poems on the spot, typewriters have emerged as popular items with aficionados hunting for them in thrift stores, online auction sites and antique shops. Some buys antique Underwoods to add to a growing collection. Others search for a midcentury Royal Quiet De Luxe — like a model author Ernest Hemingway used — to work on that simmering novel.
The rescued machines often need servicing, leading fans to seek out the few remaining typewriter repair shops.
"I haven't seen business like this in years," said John Lewis, a typewriter repairman who has operated out of his Albuquerque shop for four decades. "There's definitely a new interest, and it's keeping me very busy."
Renewed interest began around 10 years ago when small pockets of typewriter enthusiasts came together online, said Richard Polt, a Xavier University philosophy professor and author of "The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist's Companion for the 21st Century." Since then, the fan base has grown dramatically, and various public events have been organized around the typewriter.
"It's beyond the phase where this is just a fad," Polt said.
It's almost impossible to gauge recent typewriter sales. Almost all of the original manufacturers are out of business or have been bought out and become different companies. Moonachie, New Jersey-based Swintec appears to be one of the last typewriter makers, selling translucent electronic machines largely to jails and prisons.
But operators of thrift stores and estate sales say typewriters are some of the quickest items to go.
"That's part of the fun: the hunt," said Joe Van Cleave, an Albuquerque resident who owns more than a dozen typewriters and runs a popular YouTube channel on restoring the machines. "Sometimes, like a little luck, you might find something from the 1920s in great condition."
Doug Nichol, director of the upcoming documentary "California Typewriter," said the interest stems from "digital burnout" and people wanting a connection to the past. That interest seems to transcend age, he said.
"Kids who grew up knowing only mobile phones and the computer are excited to see a letter typed with your own hand," Nichol said. "It's a one-on-one interaction that doesn't get interrupted by Twitter alerts."
In his film, set for release in August, Nichol interviews Hanks, who said he uses a typewriter almost every day to send memos and letters.
"I hate getting email thank-yous from folks," Hanks says in the film. "Now, if they take 70 seconds to type me out something on a piece of paper and send to me, well, I'll keep that forever. I'll just delete that email."
Hank owns about 270 typewriters but often gives them to people who show an interest.
One way the typewriter craze is growing is through organized "type-ins" — meet-ups in public places where typewriter fans try different vintage machines. Such events have been held in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Seattle, Los Angeles and Cincinnati.
During a recent type-in at Albuquerque soul food restaurant Nexus Brewery, around three dozen fans took turns clicking the keys of an Italian-made 1964 Olivetti Lettera 32 and a 1947 Royal KMM, among others.
Rich Boucher spent most of his time on a 1960s-era Hermes 3000 crafting poetry.
"I haven't used a typewriter in forever," he said. "This is a real refreshing way to spend a summer afternoon."
After finishing his work, Boucher grabbed his phone and sent a Facebook status update about the experience. He then started looking online for a Hermes 3000.
"That's the typewriter I want," he said. "I'm going to find one."

Unfortunately, the influenza virus is a ruthless master of disguise.
“Not only does flu change, but it's a survival strategy for the virus. Its change is how it makes people so sick,” Dr. Karron explained. That's because the part of the virus that changes is the very part the immune system targets.

Meet the influenza virus
Like all viruses, the flu virus has one goal: replicate. And it can do that only by hijacking other cells. The virus enters a cell and takes over, shutting off the cell's antiviral response and then using the cell's machinery to make copies of itself. It's like bootleggers sneaking booze into a coffee shop, turning off the burglar alarm and using the kitchen to make cocktails instead of cappuccinos.
Once the immune system learns what a flu virus looks like — whether from a vaccine or a past infection — it seeks out and destroys flu viruses before they enter more cells. (Soldiers are watching out for those bootleggers.) But the virus needs to replicate to keep surviving. If the parts the immune system recognizes change slightly, the immune system won't see the virus. (If the antibody army identifies bootleggers only by their clothing, soldiers won't stop bootleggers wearing brown trench coats if they're looking for ones wearing black coats.)
And the flu virus gets lots of chances to change its wardrobe every time it replicates. Those wardrobe changes are mutations.
How the influenza virus mutates
DNA is made of two strands — the double helix you may have heard of — and each strand has building blocks that match in pairs.
The flu virus's genetic material, called RNA, is similar to DNA but with one crucial difference. RNA viruses don't have “proofreading capacity,” Dr. Karron said.
“If for some reason the machinery that puts in the building blocks is wrong in DNA and it doesn't match, it has to be fixed,” Dr. Karron said. But RNA has only one strand.

“In RNA, if there's a mistake, it doesn't have to be corrected to survive,” Dr. Karron said. “The viruses play this roulette. It's not that they know which changes will outwit the human immune system, but they're replicating very rapidly.”
So rapidly that lots of mistakes — mutations — occur. Hijacked cells release new viruses after just six hours.
“If there's a change in one of those viruses that the human immune system doesn't recognize so well, that gives that virus an advantage,” Dr. Karron said. Those changes often happen in two proteins, called hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the H and the N in flu names like H1N1. These proteins are also the parts of the flu virus that the immune system recognizes — the trench coats — so viruses with a slightly different HA or NA can escape the immune system's attention.
It's evolution at work: Tiny mutations help the virus evade detection, and as it evades detection, it's more successful at multiplying.
“The vaccines we have target the part of the virus that changes so rapidly, so our vaccines have to evolve along with the virus,” Dr. Karron said.
How big changes in viruses start pandemics
That whole evolutionary process of small changes helping the flu virus escape the immune system is called antigenic drift. Drifts happen within flu seasons and from one to the next. But there's another much larger, and more sinister, change called antigenic shift. This isn't changing trench coat colors. This is swapping a coat for a bikini.

The flu virus genome has eight separate segments, including one for the HA protein and one for NA. These proteins determine a flu virus's subtype (such as H1N1 or H3N2), and nearly all subtypes occur in birds, the natural host of the influenza virus. (This chart shows which types occur in humans, birds, pigs and bats.) If two subtypes infect the same cell, their gene segments can mix and match, called reassortment. This often happens in pigs and birds.
Humans often catch flu infections from pigs and birds at places such as state fairs, farms and live animal markets, but these avian and swine viruses don't replicate well in humans.

“It has to be readily able to pass from person to person,” Dr. Karron said. “A lot of these animal-human interfaces that happen are one-off.”
But what if a bird virus and a human virus end up in the same cell together? That's called a superinfection (yes, for real). Now reassortment becomes possible.
“You can get a hemagglutinin and a neuraminidase protein from the avian virus and the other six from the human viruses,” said Dr. Scott Hensley, an associate professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Now there's a new, mostly human virus that will replicate easily in human cells, but the avian HA and NA make it look very different from any other known human flu viruses, Dr. Hensley said.
That's an antigenic shift — reason to worry.
“When that happens, you have a pandemic because the human population doesn't have immunity against those viruses, so the viruses can spread very quickly,” Dr. Hensley said.
The largest pandemic in history was the Spanish flu of 1918, an H1N1 subtype. It infected one-third of the world's population and killed an estimated 50 million people, hitting young adults especially hard.
“That circulated in humans for about 40 years and continued to acquire HA and NA mutations that allowed it to infect people already exposed to the 1918 strain,” Dr. Hensley said.
An H2N2 subtype replaced the 1918 H1N1 subtype in 1957, causing a new pandemic. But remember when scientists freaked out about the new H1N1 virus in 2009? They had good reason.
“The H1N1 was a triple reassortment, with the gene segments of three viruses,” Dr. Hensley said. And the HA in the new subtype was very similar to the HA in the 1918 subtype, which had been circulating in pigs all that time.

What this means for your annual flu shot
Considering all the influenza virus's tricks for infecting humans, it's remarkable we've created a vaccine that works at all. And in fact, the vaccine prevents thousands of deaths every year. Most years, the vaccine cuts your chance of catching the flu in half, but it's hard to get much better odds than that from it.

“Our vaccine process is sort of always one step behind because of this long production process and trying to update the vaccine to what's circulating,” Dr. Hensley said. The World Health Organization meets twice a year, once for the Southern Hemisphere and once for the Northern Hemisphere, to examine global flu surveillance and recommend the flu strains they expect will cause the most illness.
“This puts a huge burden on manufacturers,” Dr. Karron said. In the Northern Hemisphere, they learn the W.H.O. recommendations in February and have only about six months to make vaccines. They sell it very cheaply, Dr. Karron said, about $10 to 20 a dose, and have to throw away anything unsold at the end of the season. “The flu vaccine is not a blockbuster moneymaker,” she said.
Understanding the flu virus's trickery explains some of the vaccine's quirks. Why do some vaccine strains partly protect against nonvaccine strains? The HA and NA may look similar enough to the vaccine strain that antibodies attack it anyway.
Why isn't there a universal flu vaccine yet? The immune system can't learn every possible combination of HA and NA. Scientists are trying to develop a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize a different part of the virus than HA or NA, but that's hard to do when the immune system automatically notices those proteins first.
Why does the vaccine work better in some people than in others? Different people's bodies can respond to different parts of the same virus, Dr. Hensley said. Both genetics and the microbiome, for example, can influence immune response.
“My thought is that the minor antigenic changes happening are much more significant than we appreciate,” Dr. Hensley said. Scientists used to think major antigenic changes happened only every few years. But emerging research suggests even tiny changes occurring each season “are actually very big changes for some individuals,” he said.
His research team also recently discovered that growing flu viruses in eggs to make vaccines, the way many flu vaccines have been made for decades, causes small mutations that might lessen the vaccine's effectiveness. Viruses that replicate well in chicken cells differ slightly from ones that replicate well in human cells.
Finally, it's impossible for vaccine strains and circulating strains ever to match perfectly when circulating strains accumulate mutations all season long. But getting the flu vaccine means your body has at least some sense of the viruses out there.

“Even when you have these mismatches, you probably are preventing severe disease,” Dr. Hensley said, “which in my mind is one of the most important goals, preventing someone from dying.”

The vertebrae are the bones that make up the spinal column, which surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The intervertebral disks are soft tissues that sit between each vertebra and act as cushions between vertebrae, and absorb energy while the spinal column flexes, extends, and twists. Nerves from the spinal cord exit the spinal column between each vertebra.
A federal appeals court dealt former Rep. Aaron Schock a major legal blow on Wednesday, refusing to throw out his criminal indictment on 22 corruption charges including filing false tax returns, mail fraud, wire fraud, submitting false reports to the FEC, false statements, and theft of government funds.
Politico reports: “Schock's arguments for appealing the indictment centered on two main points. First, under the Speech or Debate Clause, a constitutional protection given to lawmakers and staff for legitimate legislative activities, he can't be charged with falsifying reimbursement claims. Secondly, in a more technical argument, Schock's lawyers asserted that since reimbursement regulations were created by House rule, it would be a violation of separation-of-powers principles for the executive branch, via the Justice Department, to charge him with a crime. Under Schock's approach, only the House could interpret whether he violated House rules.”
Schock has been trying to get the charges, which originally numbered 24, thrown out for years. His last unsuccessful attempt was last fall.
In August 2017, Schock's lawyers asked for the case to be dismissed because, according to the attorneys, witnesses were asked “distasteful, offensive,” and “prejudicial” questions about every part of Schock's sex life including whether he is gay and if his girlfriend was a beard. The lawyers accused investigators of “prosecutorial misconduct on a variety of grounds” over the invasive questions and asked for the case to be dismissed.
Schock's troubles began when photos of his Downton Abbey-inspired congressional office leaked and it was then discovered that he illegally accepted a designer's services for free.
In March of 2015, the FBI began an investigation into Schock's spending habits, an investigation that ultimately revealed “untoward allegations” about Schock that would damage his reputation, according to his lawyers. Schock faces a 24-count indictment for filing false tax returns and covering up fraud schemes, and using government and campaign funds improperly.
The disgraced anti-gay Illinois lawmaker resigned from his seat in 2015 after questions arose about his alleged misuse of funds.
Schock can appeal Wednesday's ruling to the full 7th Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
Bitcoin's debut on a major U.S. exchange is a hit so far, with the price of the first-ever futures contract for the virtual currency rising 18 percent.
The futures contract that expires in January surged $2,730 to $18,190 Monday morning on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Trading began Sunday, and the price rose as high as $18,850, according to data from the CBOE.
The CBOE futures don't involve actual bitcoin. They allow investors to make bets on the future direction of bitcoin.
The first session of futures trading fit right in with the frenzy surrounding bitcoin. Traffic to the CBOE website was so heavy right after the start of trading that the site experienced outages. The exchange also halted trading twice Sunday to stem volatility. The exchange operator has rules in place to stop trading after price swings of 10 percent.
Another large futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will start trading its own futures on Dec. 18 but will use a composite of several bitcoin prices across a handful of exchanges.
The price of a bitcoin has soared since beginning the year below $1,000, hitting a peak of more than $16,858 Dec. 7 on the bitcoin exchange Coindesk. As of 10:15 a.m. CST, it was at $16,510 on Coindesk.
Futures are a type of contract in which a buyer and a seller agree on a price for a particular item to be delivered on a certain date in the future, hence the name. Futures are available for nearly every type of security but are most famously used in commodities such as wheat, soy, gold, oil, cocoa and, as dramatized in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd movie "Trading Places," concentrated frozen orange juice.
The futures signal greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin but also open up bitcoin to additional market forces. The futures will allow investors to bet that bitcoin's price will go down — a practice known as shorting — which had been very difficult to do.
There have been other attempts to bring bitcoin investing into the mainstream. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin brothers who own large amounts of bitcoin, tried to create an exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin, but federal regulators denied their application.
How much actual investor interest there will be in these bitcoin futures is still up in the air. Many larger Wall Street brokerages and clearinghouses, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are either not allowing customers to trade bitcoin futures or only allowing select clients to do so. Other brokerages are putting restrictions on the amount of margin a trader can use in bitcoin futures, or putting limits on the amount that can be purchased.
The digital currency has had more than its fair share of critics on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin "a fraud." Thomas Peterffy, chairman of the broker-dealer Interactive Brokers Group, expressed deep concerns about the trading of bitcoin futures last month, saying "there is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may assume any price from one day to the next."
Peterffy noted that if bitcoin futures were trading at that time, under the CBOE's rules those futures likely would experience repeated trading halts because 10 percent or 20 percent moves in bitcoin prices have not been unusual in recent months.
Bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded.
A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Four explosions have rocked Texas' capital in less than three weeks and authorities say a serial bomber is likely to blame. But they don't appear closer to making any arrests.
Three package bombs left on doorsteps over 10 days starting on March 2 killed two people and injured two others. Then, on Sunday night, an explosive triggered by a nearly invisible tripwire wire injured two more.
Police originally pointed to possible hate crimes, but the victims have now been black, Hispanic and white and from different parts of the increasingly diverse city.
They looked for common threads among those hurt and killed, but now concede that a tripwire means who gets hit could be totally random.
Investigators have been left with more questions than answers, as fear spreads through Austin.
Woodroffe, who was from Vancouver Island, said before going to Peru that he hoped an apprenticeship with a plant healer from the Shipibo tribe would help his goal of changing careers to become an addiction counsellor using hallucinogenic medicine.
"A recent family intervention for a relative with an alcohol addiction has opened my eyes to what I should be doing for work," he wrote on the Indiegogo crowd-funding website seeking financial help to advance his studies.
"The plant medicine I have the opportunity of learning is far deeper than ingesting a plant and being healed. It is not about getting 'high' either. It is true some of the plants I will be learning about do have a perception-altering effect, but these are a few plants out of thousands I will be working with," he said.
A close family member of Woodroffe declined to comment on Woodroffe's death in a Facebook message to The Canadian Press.
In December 2015, Winnipeg resident Joshua Stevens fatally stabbed a fellow tourist from England after the two drank ayahuasca together in a spiritual ceremony a few hours' drive from where Woodroffe was killed.
Stevens, 31, said he found relief from a rash that covered 40 per cent of his body by drinking the brew at a ceremony in Winnipeg and went to the Phoenix Ayahuasca retreat near the town of Iquitos to "pay homage to the natives down there and to learn with them."
He and British tourist Unais Gomes, 25, drank the hallucinogenic brew, but things quickly went wrong, Stevens said.
Gomes attacked the Canadian and two workers at the retreat with a large butcher knife and Stevens said he was forced to make a life-or-death decision to stab the British man, who died a short time later.
"I still have a hard time with it myself because on one hand I was cured and on the other hand what happened to me and what happened with this man, it's making me wonder and question it," Stevens said. "I'm not sure what to think of it because I hold very dearly onto the suffering I had for three years and I was able to receive relief through the plant, so I'm confused about it."
The British newspaper The Guardian reported that police concluded Stevens had acted in self-defence.
Also in 2015, Canadian Jennifer Logan died in Peru after drinking a "tobacco purge" tea at the Canto Luz Centre outside Puerto Maldonado.
Logan's sister said the tea was not the hallucinogenic ayahuasca, but it caused the 32-year-old to vomit until she lost consciousness. The centre described her reaction to the tea as "extreme and unusual."
Initial autopsy results found Jennifer Logan died of pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that can cause respiratory failure.

Bullock County Residents Petition to Save Historic School
by Danielle Wallace
One of the oldest schools in Bullock county could be burned or torn down, if supporting citizens don't take steps to save it.
According to Billie Hazzard there is a lot of history inside of Aberfoil School, that closed it's doors in 1964.
“It's been here for over 50 years. People like dr. Martin luther king jr have been here,” says Hazzard.
That's just one reason why Hazzard started a petition to preserve the school after some church members at elizabeth baptist church across from the school want it burned or torn down.
“The younger people that didn't go to Aberfoil school would like to see it burned down or torn town. The other people, especially the middle-age people and all those that went to this school do not wish to see it torn down,” says Hazzard.
Hazzard believes the historic school can be restored for a number of reasons.
“We would like to use it as a community center, have meetings in it, family reunions, and at one time we were able to have the ged classes here and we want to restore it for one of those reasons,” says Hazzard.
She's been working since the beginning of this month, getting people in bullock county to see its worth, while she collects grants for the school from the Black Belt community foundation.
“We have a 126 signatures total. We will present it at the next church meeting,” says Hazzard.
It's her hope that others will see the value of the school, before letting it go.
“It just could serve the people in this community.”
Hazzard plans to present her petition to the church at the beginning of next month.

Noted aviator and actor Harrison Ford flew his private plane over a jet airliner on the ground at a Southern California airport Monday. It's not the first time the Star Wars and Indiana Jones star has had problems landing.
The 74-year-old Ford was instructed to land on a runway at Orange County's John Wayne Airport but mistakenly landed on a parallel taxiway, passing over a Boeing 737 carrying 110 passengers and six crew members.
On a recording, Ford asked air traffic controllers, "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" according to NBC News, which first reported the incident.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the pilot heard and read back the correct landing instructions, according to The Associated Press. Gregor did not confirm it was Ford who was piloting the plane, a single-engine Aviat Husky. The AP reports that he didn't say how close Ford's plane came to hitting the jet on the ground.
No one was injured and the jet, American Airlines Flight 1456, took off for Dallas shortly after without incident.
The FAA is now investigating, which "could result in a simple warning letter to a suspension of Ford's pilot's license," NBC reports.
Ford collects vintage planes and has been flying for decades. According to NPR's Russell Lewis, Ford is "a highly-skilled and highly-rated pilot. He's qualified to fly single and twin engine planes, seaplanes, helicopters and he's also an instrument-rated pilot." In 2015, Ford said he owned "eight or nine various types of airplanes," according to NTSB documents posted on AirSafe.com.
Ford reported on a medical certificate application that he had logged at least 5,200 flight hours, according to the NTSB.
He was a 2008 honoree and received the Legends Aviation Legacy Award from Kiddie Hawk Air Academy, and subsequently had an award named after him.
Ford was seriously injured in March 2015 when he crash-landed a restored World War II-era trainer plane on a golf course near the Santa Monica Airport shortly after takeoff. A National Transportation Safety Board report found the crash was caused by a loose engine part.
In 2000, Ford's plane "departed" a runway in Lincoln, Neb., because of a gust of wind, according to AirSafe.com. He was flying a Beechcraft Bonanza which "sustained minor damage," though Ford and his passenger were not injured.
And in 1999 he crash-landed a helicopter during a training flight in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, according to the AP. "Although the helicopter rolled over on its left side, neither Ford nor the instructor were injured," AirSafe.com notes.

Just now, a huge portion of this burning construction site in Concord collapsed. Lots of smoke #abc7news pic.twitter.com/MDHbCwzjKw — Leslie Brinkley (@lrbrinkley) April 24, 2018
A massive apartment construction fire early Tuesday morning destroyed a two-block area near Todos Santos Plaza in Concord and ATF is joining the investigation into whether or not arson could be involved.Dispatchers were inundated with calls at 1 a.m., with one person describing an explosion followed by a massive fire erupting at a construction site near downtown Concord. Assistant Chief Terrence Carey, the incident commander, said fire crews arrived to find a large fire at a five-story apartment complex under construction with wood framing engulfed in flames.At least 70 firefighters converged at Galindo and Concord boulevards to fight the blaze, while 250 residents of the apartment complex across the street were told to evacuate. " I looked out the window and all I could see was a wall of flame and fire. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the cat and the apartment started to smell like smoke and we had to get out. The dog was next to me and I grabbed her," Emily Scheffler said.Three people were taken to hospitals for smokes inhalation, but no other injuries were reported.ATF investigators are joining local fire officials to pinpoint the cause just as they did in three other construction site fires in the East Bay over the last two years. Two blazes at an Emeryville construction site and another on Valdez st in Oakland last summer were deemed suspicious. "It's way too early to know if this is accidental or intentional. Also, it's too early to know if this is connected to other fires across the Bay Area," Jill Snyder with ATF said.Ash and debris rained down on nearby streets as the health department issued a warning. "Residents should avoid washing or sweeping ash and debris into storm drains as this could contribute to pollution accumulating in nearby creeks," according to Maria Duazo with Contra Costa Health Services.Evacuated residents had 10 minutes to retrieve medicine, clothes and pets from their apartments late Tuesday afternoon. One man said, "I am alive, everyone's alive, at least we made it out OK."

Disco, anyone?
To give a warm welcome to 2017, Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick braved the cold weather of Aspen, Colorado — and danced on the wing of an airplane!
“Disco disco,” Kardashian, 37, captioned an Instagram video of herself and Disick, 33, sporting wintry clothing while showing off their dance moves on the wing of a jet.
The exes, who share three children together — Mason, 7, Penelope, 4, and Reign, 2 — rang in the new year with one another, along with their three kids, in Aspen's winter wonderland.
Just two days prior to the new year, the former couple, who also spent Thanksgiving together, hit the snowy slopes of Colorado.
“Mom and Dad,” Kardashian captioned a shot of the pair sitting side-by-side on a ski lift.
In November, PEOPLE reported that the duo, who ended their nine-year relationship last July, are getting along great and are now living together again.
“For a long time, it really seemed like Kourtney was completely over Scott. She was acting very disappointed. It seemed she would never take him back. Then Scott decided to turn things around,” a source said of Disick's decision to change his behavior. “It was like he finally realized that he needed his family. For the past few months, Scott has been amazing. He isn't sober, but very well behaved. He has shown Kourtney that she and the kids are his number one priority.”
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A United Nations prosecution lawyer has urged appeals judges to convict former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on a second genocide count and increase his 40-year sentence for overseeing Serb atrocities during the Bosnian war to a life sentence.
Prosecutor Katrina Gustafson told a five-judge appellate panel at the U.N. Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals that Karadzic "abused his immense power to spill the blood of countless victims. Justice requires that he receive the highest possible sentence — a life sentence."
Karadzic's lawyers said Tuesday that not only should he not be convicted of a second genocide count, but the genocide conviction imposed by trial judges in 2016 for Karadzic's role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre should be overturned on appeal.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — LaMarcus Aldridge scored 30 points and the San Antonio Spurs escaped with a 106-104 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night.
The Spurs had four players in double figures, including 18 points each from Kyle Anderson and Pau Gasol.
Every Denver starter scored in double figures with Jamal Murray leading the way with 18 points and Gary Harris adding 17.
San Antonio had to battle to win its 11th straight at home over Denver. There were 18 lead changes and the Nuggets came within inches of a game-winning 19th.
Jamal Murray's 3-pointer with 31.6 seconds remaining pulled Denver within 106-104. After Danny Green missed a 3-pointer, the Nuggets raced down the floor and furiously passed the ball three times to set up Will Barton for a 25-foot 3-pointer that rattled in and out of the rim.
Denver finished 10 for 23 on 3-pointers while shooting 47 percent from the field while San Antonio shot 50 percent.
The Nuggets made their first five three-pointers in taking a 17-12 lead, but the Spurs responded by making their first three 3s. It set the tone for a back-and-forth, high-scoring duel.
It was a welcome change for San Antonio, which struggled offensively in its two previous games of a five-game homestand.
The Spurs scored 60 points in the first half against the Nuggets after averaging just 40 against Philadelphia and Sacramento, including a season-low 31 against the 76ers on Friday.
Manu Ginobili finished with 14 points, including six in 31 seconds in the first quarter. After sinking a free throw after being fouled on a reverse layup, he drained the first of his three 3-pointers. Ginobili would later stretch for a low pass and then throw it behind his back to Davis Bertans, who would score on a runner.
TIP-INS
Nuggets: Mason Plumlee did not play after straining his right calf against Boston on Monday night. Plumlee remained in Denver for an MRI while the team flew to San Antonio. Nuggets coach Mike Malone said Plumlee is "going to be out for a little while." . Wilson Chandler was available to play but did not enter the game after being listed as probable with an illness. . Darrell Arthur established a season high with seven points in the first half and finished with 10 points. Arthur's previous high was five points against Detroit on Dec. 12.
Spurs: Aldridge has scored 20-plus points in 33 of 50 games this season. His previous best for 20-point games was 31 in 74 games during his inaugural season with the Spurs in 2016. . Aldridge was assessed his third technical foul this season with 4:30 remaining in the third quarter after arguing about a non-call against Denver's defense. Aldridge has 18 career technical fouls but only one ejection. . Anderson established a career high with 363 points. His previous season's best was 350 points in 2016. . Ginobili joined Sacramento's Vince Carter as the only 40-and-older players with 40 3-pointers in a season.

Nuggets: Host Oklahoma City on Thursday night.

PHILADELPHIA -- He wouldn't say it directly, but Eagles head coach Doug Pederson implied something about running back Wendell Smallwood's status for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals:
He ain't playing.
Pederson wouldn't rule Smallwood out, listing him as questionable with a knee injury, but with the second-year running back did not practice on Friday and missed the entire week of practice. His chances of playing are slim.
Smallwood led Eagles running backs with 35 snaps in last Sunday's 26-24 victory over the L.A. Chargers, and he had 79 total yards -- 34 on the ground, 45 on receptions. Running back Darren Sproles is out for the season with a torn ACL.
10 reasons the Cardinals are a tough matchup for Eagles
The Cardinals are allowing 3.2 yards-per-run this season, sixth in the NFL.
So what will be the Eagles' strategy at running back -- and which Philly back should you start on your fantasy team?
With Pederson indicating that backup Kenjon Barner, signed last week, won't get much playing time, the Eagles will be leaning on LeGarrette Blount and rookie Corey Clement.
Blount has 224 total yards rushing and two total touchdowns on 29 touches in the past two games, most among the Eagles' running backs.
Clement, who had 10 carries for 34 yards against the Chargers, likely will see an increase in touches and more chances to score. Clement has scored a touchdown in 11 of the last 15 games he has registered a carry, dating back to last season at Wisconsin.
The reality is, however, that the Eagles could abandon the run early.
The Eagles have been run heavy the past two weeks because they have faced poor run defenses. The Cardinals will be tougher to run against, and Pederson has shown he isn't afraid to let quarterback Carson Wentz throw 50-plus times.
It would be wise to avoid starting Smallwood, Blount or Clement.

It always makes me laugh when a manager comes out and criticizes the opposition for making their team work hard for a win.
There's more than one way to win a football match and not everybody has the luxury of millions of pounds to throw at a squad, when the eventuality of that means most games will be won due to the quality of the players brought in.
Lee Cattermole was sent off
Wolves are obviously a very decent team and were slightly off the boil on Saturday. Sunderland were well organised, resilient and ultimately deserved the point at Molineux.
Well organised and resilient; now there are two words you wouldn't associate with Sunderland over the last year and a half.
In the four games Chris Coleman has taken charge of we've looked far more organized. We've had a game plan that, in most cases, has been well executed.
Unfortunately, in the last two games, individuals have let the team down by getting themselves sent off. The way we were set up at Wolves meant it didn't affect us too much, unlike the Reading game a week earlier.
Still, though, that doesn't excuse Lee Cattermole.
I think the red, overall, was pretty harsh. The first yellow was very harsh. The second was probably justified but the referee couldn't wait to get over and gleefully brandish the red card in Cattermole's direction.
In the second incident, Cattermole's greatest crime was simply not being the player he was two years ago.
As we've seen so often this season he was ponderous, failing the get the ball into his grasp when it looked simpler to do so. His lunge at the player on his blindside was a cardable offence, but it doesn't happen if he doesn't lose possession in that moment.
In the first half, the Wolves No 8 put a dreadful challenge in on Donald Love. A definite yellow card, but I don't even think he got a word in the ear from the referee.
I know we're supposed to be all about the respect campaign now but let's be honest, nobody on the pitch truly is. I want to see Sunderland be more streetwise.
I'd have like to have seen Cattermole, or a few senior players, in the ear of the referee after that challenge on Love – “If that was me, it's a booking.” Make the referee think about getting that first yellow out of his pocket, which was so costly to Cattermole in the end.
Then there's the Wolves team jackknifing through the air under any slight touch. Why don't we make more of contact when backing in? Play the game. If you don't you can guarantee the opposition will be.
It's early days but it looks as though Chris Coleman is having a positive influence on the way we set up and approach games. We must keep it going at home to Fulham. Even if we can't win the game, just don't lose it.
Build the momentum and rebuild that fragile confidence.
Nigerians are hungry, Mbaka tells Buhari
Adeboye, Oyedepo, Olukoya hopeful
Pope preaches peace
Enugu Catholic priest Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ease the economic pains many Nigerians are suffering.
The coordinator of the Adoration Ministry, who is famous for his fiery sermons, spoke at the weekend in his New Year message at the “crossover service”.
”Many Nigerians are suffering,” he said.
“Though the President is trying on corruption and security, Nigerians are hungry; they want to see more changes.
“There is the need to assist businessmen and women in their businesses.”
The cleric advised the President to appoint experts who would help him to revive the economy.
Besides, he should consult Church leaders and eminent men of God to advise him and tell him the truth about the economy, he said.
“We cannot reach him for advice because of the kind of people around him,” Rev. Mbaka added.
He urged Nigerians to be patient and be prayerful “as your sufferings and hardship would be over in 2017.
“Nigeria is set to be great again,” he said.
In Ota, Ogun State, the presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church, Dr. David Oyedepo, urged Christians to obey God's word to be successful this year.
Rev. Oyedepo, who spoke on Saturday ‎during the night service to usher in 2017 at the church's headquarters, said: ”In 2017, the quality of life of any Christian is dependent on the level of his obedience to God.
”The obedience of any child of God can silence every opposition on his life.”
Christians do not need to make noise to be relevant in the society, as they are distinguished by being obedient.
He said every commandment of the scripture was applicable at all times and to all children of God, irrespective of their denomination.
Bishop David Abioye, also of the Winners Chapel reminded Christians to obey to God as it is more important than the economic crisis facing the country.
Bishop Abioye his 2016 cross over message at Living Faith Church Durumi, Abuja, with the topic “Commanding noiseless breakthrough in hard times''.
He said obedience to God had more relevance because it would naturally enhance the quality of one's steps in life.
He called on Christian to practise God's covenant of obedience to flourish even in hard times, adding that opportunities would still come because no circumstance on earth can render it useless.
“Covenant people that obey the Holy Bible usually flourish even in difficult times.
“If the covenant is on the path of grace, God's covenant is committed to deliver it.
“The quality of your life is a result of the quality of obedience you give God; this is the time to be close to God.
“Seeking the kingdom of God first will always pay to the covenant of obedience like our salaries and allowances being paid,'' Abioye said.
Cleric, Rev. Fr. Leonard Ojorgu, says the security challenges in the country will soon come to an end.
The Assistant Parish Priest of St. Peter's Catholic Church, Ediba, Calabar, the Cross River State capital, Rev. Father Leonard Ojorgu, said during the New Year service that this country's challenge would end “as God will restore peace.”
According to him, Nigeria would overcome its current security challenges and rise above its problems through prayers, obedience to God and good leadership.
The cleric, who drew his homily from the book of Isaiah 52:7-10, said Nigeria was faced with serious security challenges that needed collaboration of stakeholders to overcome.
He added that “one of the major problems facing the country today is insecurity. The North East has been under series of attacks by insurgents.
“The sect has carried out attacks on villages, churches, schools and mosques in the Northeast. But in this 2017, God will restore peace and unity in affected areas and the country in general,' he said.'
In Enugu, the Archbishop of Anglican Arch-Diocese, the Most Rev. Emmanuel Chukwuma, urged Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of tolerance to build a peaceful nation.
Rev. Chukwuma made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday, saying: “no nation could develop under an atmosphere of hatred and unforgiving spirit'.'
He urged leaders to continue to preach peace and support the government's programmes that would promote peace.
The cleric urged Nigerians to be security conscious “so as to easily fish out mischief-makers that are architects of the crisis in some communities and areas of the country''.
Rev. Fr. Clement Mato of St. Rita's Catholic Church, Mararaba, Nasarawa State urged Christians to ensure peace among themselves in the new year and shun malice to
promote unity.
He made the call in his sermon , stressing that Jesus Christ preached love all his life and Christians should to emulate him.
The cleric said: “Many Christians are praying for blessings and good life in this year, but how can we get all our heart's desires in a world or country filled with violence?
“Some Christians pray against people who have wronged them, raining fire and brimstone on them in their prayers.
“As a child of God, learn to forgive and not keep malice; that is how love works and make sure you desist from sin to attract God's blessings.”
In Abeokuta, the Ogun capital, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese, the Most Rev. Peter Odetoyinbo, urged leaders to be alive to their responsibilities in addressing the prevailing hardships in the country.
Rev. Odetoyinbo, in his New Year Message, said Nigerians needed to pray for God's intervention “and for the fear of God in leaders as we look into year 2017 with revitalised hope''.
In Minna, the NigerState capital, Bishop Martins Nzuokwu, the Catholic Bishop of Minna Diocese, urged Nigerians to seek spiritual revival to sustain good democratic governance .
Rev. Uzoukwu, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna, added that “prayers would greatly assist leaders to fashion out policies and programmes that would improve the lives of Nigerians''.
He said President Buhari needed the support in his commitment to repositioning the country for optimal growth. He lauded the political commitment demonstrated by the President in dealing with the activities of insurgents in the Northeast and the fight against corruption.

Why Don't I Take the Wheel? Future Cars May Detect Stress, Rage
The potential for cars to tune into their driver's emotions is being explored by manufacturers, who believe awhich understands feelings could make driving safer.
Researchers hope to integrate biometric sensors into cars, allowing the vehicle to understand when a driver is tired or stressed. It could then issue prompts or alerts, or potentially take over the wheel in extreme circumstances.
Cars would be able to combine facial recognition technology with sensors tracking pulse, breathing rate and sweat.
Scientists at Ford are collaborating in an EU-funded project developing advanced driver-assistance systems to enable cars to better respond to drivers' needs, by recognizing human emotional states rather than just physical road conditions.
Ford demonstrated an early-concept prototype, a customized Ford Focus RS, in London on Tuesday, which lit up according to the mood of its driver, who was wired up with fitness trackers and skin sensors. A computer then interpreted the biometric data to make thousands of LED lights in the side windows flicker along with the driver's stress levels.
On a cold, wet day in Stratford's Olympic Park, under the tuition of stunt driver Paul Swift, the Guardian put the emoting Focus through its paces: pedal to the floor and steering wheel locked hard left, with every bead of sweat illuminated in patterns on the windows.
A succession of barely controlled doughnut maneuvers culminated with a panicked lurch and solid contact between the driver's cheekbone and the internal circuitry. The Focus flashed a brilliant white.
"That was what we call a 'buzz moment,' a peak moment of emotional activity," said Dr Cavan Fyans, chief technology officer of Sensum, the Belfast-based empathic technology company which souped-up Ford's car. "Your heart rate was elevated by 25%, your galvanic skin response was up by 25% -- roughly one microsiemens."
Such moments, Fyans said, are good for the driver -- a claim which Ford is using to shift more sports cars. However, the applications will go beyond that, he said. "If you're stressed, nervous, distracted, we can detect these things. This is a big emerging market. A lot of automobile manufacturers are working out how to humanize the technology: the autonomous vehicle people know how to map the world and track other cars, but not much about the people inside them.
"A self-driving car which knows how you are feeling could reassure a stressed passenger, or if you're happy about it being in control, just do its thing."

Not everyone can be Kevin Durant, i.e. kicking back while the Big 3 sneaker companies – Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour – all clamor to sign you to an nine-figure shoe deal. Yet there are plenty of other opportunities out there for professional athletes who are on the up and up but who may not quite be on the same superstar marketability echelon.
For instance, Klay Thompson made headlines earlier this summer when he signed a 10-year deal to remain with Chinese shoe company Anta for a reported $80 million (despite previous signs that he was less than thrilled with their products). Now, another Chinese company has staged a coup by signing Blazers guard C.J. McCollum.
McCollum announced his partnership with Li-Ning via Instagram on Friday.

New Year's Eve saw plenty of drama on this side of the pond, including Mariah Carey's mesmerizing trainwreck performance and Don Lemon's entire evening that may have brought one hell of a hangover. So, anyone would be forgiven for missing this Tom Hardy BBC appearance, which presents the perfect opportunity for a reliving some holiday magic. No? Don't judge me.
The rough-and-tumble bloke appeared on CBeebies Bedtime Stories to read a fetching tale — You Must Bring A Hat — for the kiddies, but adults will enjoy it too. There's truly something here for everyone, including a chance to see Hardy soften up and temporarily abandon his tough-guy exterior. The persona has served him well in a number of movies, but the pressure to maintain had to give at some point.
One can choose to listen to the story itself, since Hardy took great pains to pepper his portrayal with different character voices. However, the big distraction here is Hardy's dog, Woody (“Woodstock” for those who feel fancy), happily lounging on his owner's lap. The pup previously won the red carpet while looking even more dapper than his dad, and here, that fancy hat easily won the night.
Happy New Year, indeed.

According to WEMA director Joey Cooper, the deputies were in the area when a call came in from 810 Muscogee Way in Mt. Juliet for a fire around 9:24 a.m. The deputies were able to use their fire extinguishers to keep the fire from spreading until WEMA firefighters arrived.
“The fire would have been much worse if these vigilant deputies had not used their fire extinguishers,” said Cooper.
Firefighters were able to get the fire extinguished at about 11:30 a.m. and contain damage to a detached gazebo close to the house. According to Cooper, the fire was electrical in nature.
No injuries were reported in the incident.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — First came the ping of bats, a familiar sound of the leafy neighborhood's morning. Then the crack of gunfire, which isn't.
It started with a single pop, which for a split second was not alarming to the Republican members of Congress who had gathered for a final practice before a charity baseball game with Democrats this week. As one lawmaker would later note, it could have been a car backfiring.
Then, after a pause, the gunshots came in quick succession and the horror unfolded in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, home to many federal workers, lawyers and lobbyists who commute across the river to Washington.
A congressman, two Capitol police officers, a lobbyist and a legislative aide were wounded as lawmakers, some fighting back tears, sought to understand what had happened and why. In a hail of bullets, police killed the gunman.
“You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq,” said Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Army reservist who served as a combat surgeon in Iraq and was on the field Wednesday when the shooting began. “But this morning it did.”
They had gathered on this muggy morning, trading suits and ties for sneakers and baseball caps, to practice for Thursday's annual left-right match-up, a friendly Democratic-Republican rivalry for charity in a capital otherwise poisonous in its partisanship. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks had bicycled nine miles to make the 6:30 a.m. start.
The baseball park, home to the T.C. Williams High School Titans, sits in a lively part of Alexandria. On weekdays, locals head off to work and school. People come and go at the nearby YMCA. Homeowners stroll the sidewalks, walking their dogs.
So it hardly seemed unusual when a man approached Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina in the baseball field parking lot.
His question was pointed: “‘Excuse me sir, who's practicing today? Democrats or Republicans?'” Duncan recalled. “And I said it's the Republican team. He said, ‘OK, thanks' and turned around.” Duncan then left, saying later, “It was the guy they've identified as the shooter.”
Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico was taking swings in the batting cage along the first base side when he noticed a bystander near the third base dugout. Within seconds, as Pearce left the batting cage and headed toward the dugout, the shooting started. “I saw the shooter clearly with his rifle, aimed and shooting around one corner of a building,” he said in a video statement.
Chaos ensued. Lawmakers dove for cover. Gravel bounced as shots hit the ground.
From inside Swing's coffee shop directly across from the field, manager Jon “Scott” Mosel described the popping of gunfire. “Then a wave of players frantically running. It was absolutely frantic. We didn't know if they were being chased.” The players ran from the first base side of the field across a basketball court and either jumped a fence into a nearby dog park or ran up the hill and crossed the street toward the coffee shop, he said.
Brooks hit the ground with a few others behind the batting cage, but quickly realized that didn't provide much cover. The gunman wasn't spraying bullets but rather taking aim, so there was a “little bit of time between shots.”
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking Republican in the House, was fielding balls on second base when a gunshot crumpled him, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said. The 51-year-old Scalise, serving his fifth congressional term, dragged himself 10 to 15 yards into the outfield to try to get away, Flake said, leaving a bloody trail.
Marty LaVor, a retired Capitol Hill worker, was taking pictures by first base when he saw a man holding a rifle behind a chain-link fence by third base. LaVor saw Scalise go down, then a Capitol police officer.
“Almost within an instant, and I don't remember the time, somebody saidm ‘Get in the dugout.' And they said it with such authority. You remember when you were a kid, and your parents said something? This was that sound.”
LaVor got in the dugout.
The 911 call went out at 7:09 a.m. To those in the line of fire, it seemed an eternity before city police arrived, but in reality it took just three minutes. Brooks said the Capitol officers were armed only with pistols, and “taking on a guy with a rifle from 90-120 feet away. It wasn't a fair fight.”
When Capitol police began firing, Brooks said, they were so close that he initially feared a second shooter was involved. Congress members helped apply a tourniquet to the injured leg of Zachary Barth, legislative correspondent for Rep. Roger Williams of Texas, as the shooting continued. Scalise, too, was attended to by his colleagues on the field.
Katie Filous, an attorney who was walking her dogs near the field, dropped to the ground when she heard “a lot of shots.” A uniformed officer got out of a car, drew a handgun and shouted something to the assailant, she said. She saw the officer get hit with a bullet, and later evacuated by helicopter.
Three hours after the attack, Brooks still wore a batting glove, with dirt from lying face first in the dugout still smeared across his navy blue T-shirt, as he and other lawmakers at the scene described the attack to the AP.
Falisa Peoples, who teaches an exercise class at the YMCA, was walking to her car when she saw a man in shorts and a T-shirt firing. She thought, at first, it was a drill or a paintball game.
“He was very calm,” she said. “He was just walking and shooting as if it was just like he was practicing.” She recalled no other noise until she heard a police officer command, “Get down!” Peoples dropped her belongings and ran back to the Y, banging on the side door until someone let her in.
Rep. Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee passed the shooter on his way into the dugout to hide. “He decided not to shoot me,” he would later tell CNN. “The fear factor was horrific. There was blood all over, it was horrible.” He said if the gunman had come after them in the dugout, “we would have been sitting ducks.”
It was over in a matter of minutes. Members of Congress credited the Capitol police officers with shooting the gunman, though authorities did not immediately confirm who shot him. He died in the hospital.
Scalise underwent surgery for a wound to the hip, and was in critical condition. Matt Mika, the lobbyist and a former congressional aide, was also in critical condition, with multiple wounds. Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner of the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Barth, were expected to recover fully.
The attacker was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said on the Senate floor that Hodgkinson apparently was a volunteer for his campaign last year. Police are investigating the attacker's motive, his associates and his social media posts.
Hours later, surrounded by crime scene tape, the field was still set for batting practice. A mobile backstop curved behind home plate, near metal bats. A crate full of baseballs sat near the pitcher's mound, and balls were scattered on the field among medical bags and supplies. Behind first base, next to a large medical bag, sat a single baseball shoe.
Off the field on the first base side, a medical gurney.

During the MCM Comic-con show held in London from Friday until today, Black Panther star Letitia Wright who plays Shuri, suggested that there is a high chance of her becoming future leader for Wakanda.
When answering a question from a member of the audience asking if Wright was ready and prepared to step up as ruler after Thano's actions in Avengers: Infinity War left the leadership position. She answered, “To be comic-book accurate, yes.”
Although Shuri's fate was left unclear at the end of the Infinity War film, taking a glimpse at the comic books, shows that with her genius intelligence, martial arts skills, along with transmorphic ability would place her as an appropriate role to take over Wakanda. It is sure that with her brilliant and innovative inventions will result in success.
Through social media and online communication, Wright is now seen as a typical Disney Princess.
“I was like, ‘what's this Disney Princess pressure? Do I have to be perfect?',” she said. “Then I realized that everyone's just so geeked about having a different kind of female character in Marvel universe and the Disney universe. And there's going to be much, much more – I'm not the only Disney Princess to come to the surface and claim that title.”
She continued: “I'm so honored, seriously. I grew up on the Disney movies and grew up with Disney Princesses and they didn't really look like me. But now, you can go buy action figures and say ‘this is a Disney Princess' – right on.”

Drake has been in his share of publicized feuds in hip-hop. From Common to Joe Budden and most infamously Meek Mill, Drake has seen his beef count rise the further he ascended in the rap game. For his part, he's handled himself well. But there's one crew he probably doesn't want any beef with – and ironically, neither do they. PETA, famous for ruining book signings, pressing Nintendo, and tossing red paint on furs, recently lauded Drake for his vegetarian lifestyle. Drake noted in his historic Fortnite Twitch stream that he's a vegetarian, but he does enjoy pineapple pizza.
PETA wrote an open letter to Drake which started off friendly enough. They announced that they sent him a vegan gift basket – which naturally contained passionfruit. After the pleasantries were over, however, they reiterated a demand they've made before:
“Since you've made the great, kind, and forward-thinking choice not to eat animals, please, please, please, take one more step: Stop wearing them, and end October's Very Own's partnership with cruel company Canada Goose immediately.”
Drake has been partnering with Canada Goose for years, and recently unveiled a line last December (which included pink satin bombers). Who knows how he feels about the letter – or if he enjoyed the vegan basket. Maybe the extremist vegans who is a Waka Flocka called “the f*cking cops” will get their response via a one-liner on a future Drake record.
AIG Hit Contractors Association Over Incessant Building Collapse In Nigeria
The Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 5 Benin, Abubakar Mohammed has decried what he described as the unwholesome activities of the National Association Contractors of Nigeria over the spate of collapse building in the Country saying conspiracy between contractors and building engineers are largely responsible.
The police boss who stated this in Benin City , the Edo State Capital yesterday while playing host to the executive members of National Association of Contractors who were in his office to seek for collaboration between the body and security agencies however tasks the group to avail the police on any useful information regarding criminal activities of shylock contractors.
According to Abubakar “We are law enforcement agent committed to enforcing the law. When you talk of building collapse contractors knows the cause and should be held responsible. If they adhere to the lay down rules building will not collapse rather contractors cut corners to maximize profit which eventually lead to this kind of disasters we have witnessing in the construction industry today.
While lampooning the group warned “In terms of security anybody whose building collapse, we will go after such person. Anybody sells sub-standard material will face the full wrath of the law, we need information as quickly as possible in the construction industry.
President of the group, Hon Onuche Okoh, had earlier disclosed that over 75 buildings collapse had been recorded in Nigeria in the last 3 years lamenting that most Nigerians are unaware of the fact that the building requires to be re-enforce after 30 years.
Explaining reasons for the visit stated “We decide to embark on this visit because of the things happening in the Country today. We are visiting security agencies so that they can support us and we are looking into many ways contractors have failed so we want to collaborate with them to ensure efficiency in our activities.

Don wants judiciary give special attention to anti-corruption fight
A don, Dr Ferdinand Ottoh, has urged the judiciary to give special attention to the anti-corruption fight of the Federal Government by accelerating hearing of corruption-related cases.
Ottoh, a lecturer in the Department of Political Science, University of Lagos, made the appeal in an interview with the Newsmen on Monday in Lagos.
“Nothing meaningful will be achieved in the current anti-corruption fight without the unalloyed support of the judiciary.
“If it requires reviewing its jurisprudence in matters of corruption cases, let it be so,'' he said.
Ottoh said that corruption in public offices was a major setback to Nigeria's development, warning that the country would not be able to record any meaningful progress until eradication of the menace.
“We can only talk of the Nigerian state when it has the capacity to provide welfare for the people and meet its obligations as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution.
“The corruption in the country before the Muhammadu Buhari administration rendered Nigeria incapable to protect lives and property and provide education and other necessities to its citizens.
“A situation in which individuals have pillaged the resources of the country, thereby making Nigeria unable to meet the obligations of a state will further her dependency and crises.
“The truth is that the Buhari administration's stance on anti-corruption is a redemption course that this nation needs for sustenance,'' he said.

Officers went to Don Pancho Mexican Restaurant at 300 Pleasant Grove Road at about 12:13 a.m. in response to the burglary. An officer arrived and saw the suspects leave the restaurant in a Ford F250 pickup. The suspects didn't stop.
Officers chased the suspects to Interstate 40 westbound, where the chase ended at the Nolensville Road and Thompson Lane intersection in Nashville.
The suspects' truck hit a minivan with a man and woman inside it at the intersection. Officers arrested both suspects without incident. One officer was injured, but it was not related to an assault. Wilson County sheriff's deputies assisted Mt. Juliet officers in the chase and arrest, and Metro-Nashville police officers investigated the crash.

Galindo's driver's license was revoked, and he has a lengthy criminal history related to assault, illegal drugs, burglary and theft. The passenger, identified as Donnie Meadows, 31, of Nashville, also had a revoked driver's license and a lengthy criminal history related to assault, illegal drugs, burglary and theft.
Mt. Juliet detectives were investigating two recent Mexican restaurant burglaries, and it is possible Galindo and Meadows are suspects in multiple Mexican restaurant burglaries in Mt. Juliet and across Middle Tennessee, police said.
Galindo was charged with conspiracy to commit burglary, criminal attempt to commit burglary, unlawful possession of burglary tools, theft of a motor vehicle, felony evading arrest, misdemeanor evading arrest, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, resisting stop, felony vandalism and third offense driving on a revoked license. He was booked in at the Wilson County Jail, where he remained on $65,000 bond.

MILLARD, Neb. (KMTV) - Millard Public Schools began Monday with excitement and issues.
On one hand, eighth graders in the district will receive laptops for the first time as part of the district's technology initiative, known as One-to-One.
At the beginning of 2017, all high school students in the district received laptops. The 2017-2018 school year will be the first full year students will have their own laptops from eighth grade all the way through high school.
The One-to-One program costed $2 million to launch and will cost an additional $1 million each year to maintain.
At the same time, however, MPS is in the midst of a budget crisis. The district is facing a more than $6 million deficit because of lack of government funding.
While the district continues to grow, teachers and administrators have already been cut.
YouTube video views have gotten a lot of attention lately thanks to the record for the most watched video shifting so much. Well, if you want to keep up with how may people are watching "Despacito" with you while you're using YouTube's mobile app, now you can. Only a few people can at the moment, as Android Police reports. The counter sits just underneath the video title and looks pretty unobtrusive.

Boston Red Sox's Mookie Betts (50) celebrates with Xander Bogaerts after Betts hit a solo home run off Philadelphia Phillies' Jeremy Hellickson during the fourth inning of a baseball game, Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Derik Hamilton)
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Red Sox sure didn't look like a team that didn't get to bed until the sun came up Wednesday.
Mookie Betts homered twice, Xander Bogaerts had three RBIs and the bullpen continued to be lights out as the Boston Red Sox beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-3 for their third straight win.
It would have been understandable if Boston were sluggish in this game after travel issues didn't have their plane land in Philadelphia until 4 a.m.
But the Red Sox weren't looking for excuses and came out from the first pitch and pounded the Phillies.
''It just kind of happened,'' Betts said. ''One guy follows the guy in front of them and it just kind of worked out. It feels great after all the things that went into getting here. I'm happy we did it under four hours and we can get a little rest before tomorrow.''
Betts had four hits and drove in three to lead an offensive barrage off Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson (5-5). Boston tagged him for six runs on nine hits in just five innings.
Betts led off the game with a single, had an RBI double in the second, but his biggest hit was a solo home run, his 10th of the season, in the fourth inning after the Phillies had scored three runs to close within 5-3.
He had a chance to get the cycle in the ninth inning, but instead of a triple connected for home run No. 11 to put the game out of reach. It was his eighth career multi-homer game.
''When Mookie gets a lead off base hit we were trying to create some energy because of the time we got (into town),'' said Red Sox manager John Farrell. ''We were able to string a bunch of hits together and Mookie had some big swings to get it started and we were able to build a five-run lead.''
Betts was dazzling defensively as well, and made a stellar diving catch in right field to rob Howie Kendrick of a hit in the fifth inning.
Bogaerts was also impressive, with a two-run double off Hellickson in the first and a single that scored Betts in the second. He also had a fine defensive play robbing Hellickson of an infield hit, squashing a potential Phillies rally in the fourth.
Andrew Benintendi drove in the other Red Sox run with a sacrifice fly.
Both teams had multiple highlight plays defensively. Aside from Betts and Bogaerts, Benintendi made a leaping catch in foul territory taking a ball out of the stands, Pablo Sandoval made a pair of diving plays at third, Dustin Pedroia stretched his errorless game streak to 88, which included some difficult chances and Jackie Bradley Jr. made a running, over-the-shoulder grab to end the game.
''We made a number of great defensive plays tonight,'' Farrell said.
For its part, Philadelphia did a fine job defensively as well, turning four double plays.
The Phillies scored three runs off Boston starter Brian Johnson in the third inning on a two-out single by Kendrick and a two-run home run by Aaron Altherr, his 10th of the season.
Johnson left the game with an arm injury, but the Red Sox bullpen shut the door on the Phillies, as four different relievers combined to allow just two hits over the final 6 1/3 innings. Hector Velazquez (1-1) was credited with his first major league win.
The Boston bullpen has now gone 21 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing a run.
Not much is going right for the Phillies who have the worst record in baseball. They have lost eight consecutive games as well as all eight interleague games this season, matching a franchise record for consecutive interleague losses since games between the two leagues started in 1997.

Red Sox: Starting pitcher Brian Johnson left the game in the third inning with what the Red Sox indicated was left shoulder discomfort. He will be reevaluated in Boston Friday. Johnson said he started to feel tightness in warmups and came out as a precaution. After two strong innings, Johnson lost a lot of velocity on his pitches, leading to the Phillies only offensive outburst of the game.
Phillies: 2B Cesar Hernandez will be out of action for at least six weeks with an oblique strain, but that doesn't mean the Phillies are going to call up red hot prospect Scott Kingery, who leads all minor league baseball with 18 home runs at Double A Reading. Kingery isn't on the 40-man roster currently and Phillies GM Matt Klentak said before the game that Kingery isn't ready for a call-up. He did suggest, though, that Kingery will likely be moved to Triple A soon.

Quit notice: Osinbajo meets Ohaneze, South East Govs
By Johnbosco Agbakwuru
ABUJA – ACTING President Yemi Osinbajo Wednesday said that the Federal Government will not shy away from its responsibilities and vowed that the government would do everything within its power to defend and uphold the terms of the nation's constitution, which declares that Nigeria is ‘one nation under God.'
The Acting President stated this when he met with the leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo, the five governors of the South Eastern zone and the leadership of the zone in the National Assembly and other stakeholders from the area.
The meeting was on the wake of the recent agitation for the Sovereign State of Biafra, the sit-at-home order by the Indegenous People of Biafra, IPOB and the ultimatum by the coalition of Arewa Youths that Igbos should vacate the 19 states of the North on or before 1st October.
In his opening remarks before going into close session, the Acting President reminded the Ohaneze and other leaders from the South East that violence and war were terrible things, stressing that they were easy to start but impossible to end.
He further stated that one of the reasons for the consultative session was to see a way of addressing the agitations and proclamations urgently and decisively, adding, “Burying our heads in the sand and expecting the storm to blow over of their own accord is not an option.”

TOMORROW'S LADBROKES Challenge Cup quarter-final between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions will inevitably revive memories of the clubs' Wembley meeting 47 years ago.
Alex Murphy, many good judges' choice of the most gifted British player of all time, inspired Leigh to what was one of the biggest upsets the competition has ever seen.
Syd Hynes leaves the field after being sent off in the 1971 Challenge Cup final.
Star-studded Leeds were huge favourites to win the 1971 Cup final, but were embarrassed by a Leigh team who produced a near-perfect 80-minute performance.
The game is best remembered for an incident in the second half when Leeds' Syd Hynes became the first player to be sent off in a Cup final at Wembley.
Referee Billy Thompson dismissed the Leeds centre for allegedly butting Murphy. Leigh's player-coach was carried off on a stretcher and there are Leeds fans who, to this day, swear he sat up and winked at them as he departed the field.
Murphy returned soon afterwards and was fit enough to lift the Cup when the final whistle blew to confirm Leigh's 24-7 triumph.
It is hypocritical to condemn them [referees] for their mistakes while also trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Peter Smith
Hynes has always protested his innocence, while Murphy claims he didn't wake up until arriving in the stadium changing rooms.
In an interview for the Rugby Leaguer and League Express newspaper this week, Leigh's hooker on the day, Kevin Ashcroft, was asked about the incident. He recalled: “Hynes never touched him. Murph did his John Wayne act and deserved two Oscars for it. I told him not to get up and said that Syd had been sent off. So Murphy carried on the act and was stretchered off, but he was back on in five minutes. It didn't win us the game, but by God it helped.”
Leigh led 17-2 at the time, with 15 minutes left and red and white ribbons were already being attached to the trophy, but the incident suggests taking a dive to win a penalty or get an opponent dismissed is nothing new.
It has,however, been in the news this season with several coaches complaining about it being used as a tactic by opposing teams. Last weekend Leeds Rhinos' Brian McDermott alleged Greg Bird “stayed down to try and get everybody's attention to what wasn't a crusher tackle at all,” during Catalans Dragons' win in Perpignan.
Brian McDermott.
McDermott insisted he will “always tell my players to get up” and that is certainly what happened when young full-back Jack Walker was tackled high by Catalans' Jodie Broughton. It wasn't a vicious challenge and wouldn't normally have deserved anything more than a penalty, but as a foul that prevented a try, it should have been punished with a yellow card.
However, rather than hitting the deck and staying there, Walker tried to continue his run and that may be why referee James Child decided against sin-binning the Catalans winger. That was a case of honesty making the referee's job more complicated. It may not be the most pressing issue and there is no real culture in rugby league of faking injuries – exactly the opposite in fact – but players trying to ‘milk' penalties makes the game harder to watch
Whether it is a growing trend or simply one that's increasingly obvious because of more television coverage is open to debate, but it also adds difficulty to what is already a tough job for referees.
The men in the middle – plus those on the touchlines, in-goals and television van – are themselves coming under more scrutiny.
Players and coaches have a right to expect a certain standard from the officials, but it is hypocritical to condemn them for their mistakes while also trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Perhaps going down like a sack of spuds to the lightest touch may be the more successful approach, but the one Walker took is how the game should be played.
Back in 1971, Leigh's players turned up for the eve-of-final Wembley walkabout in suits and ties, while Leeds were casually dressed. Murphy apparently used that to gee-up his side, claiming it suggested Leeds thought they had the game won.
That won't be the case tomorrow. Leigh is the form team, though at a lower level and Rhinos know if they don't play well another – arguably even bigger – upset could be on the cards.

After President Trump “both sides”-ed the hatred and violence seen in Charlottesville over the weekend, he was castigated by many, included fellow Republicans, for not condemning white supremacists specifically — which was roundly praised by, you guessed it, white supremacists. President Trump finally read from a teleprompter Monday to denounce hate groups, “including KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists” while calling racism “evil,” but it might be a case of too-little, too-late as his Gallup poll approval ratings fell to 34%, the lowest they've been during his seven month presidency.
According to Gallup's own analysis, President Trump's approval rating was already hovering near 34% on Friday after a week of bluster about North Korea during his planned 17-day vacation at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, but the number dropped further after the violence in Charlottesville that left one woman dead and countless injured. Moreover, Gallup reports that President Trump's approval among Republicans is at the lowest its been since taking office, as well, and was at 77% for the period between Friday and Sunday.
Trump's approval rating is the lowest for a newly elected president at this point in his first term, but other presidents like both Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter, both Bushes, and Richard Nixon all fell below 34% at one point. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, never did.

ORANGE — A 611-space parking structure in Old Towne near the Metrolink station has secured the final approval needed for construction to start.
A groundbreaking on the $26.3 million structure at Lemon Street and Chapman Avenue is expected in August.
The Orange County Transportation Authority board approved the construction contract on Monday, June 12. Now, planning for construction can get under way.
The project is a joint venture between the city and OCTA – with federal and state funds footing a majority of the bill.
The new structure will sport two levels of parking below ground and three above. In service of the Orange Transportation Center, 500 spots will be earmarked for those using buses or trains from the nearby depot and 111 will be open for general use.
Planning for the structure dates back to 2009. Years of delays started in 2011 when the state started dissolving redevelopment agencies.
While the project languished without funding, Old Towne continued to grow busier. Earlier this year, a committee of merchants, property owners and city staffers began meeting to brainstorm other ways to combat the historic district's parking woes. One of the group's suggestions, a valet service utilizing nearby city lots, will soon start a three-month test drive.
The current 172-space city parking lot at Lemon and Chapman that also serves the Metrolink station will close once ground breaks for the five-story structure. During construction, Chapman University has offered alternate parking options to offset the temporary loss of spaces. More details are coming soon, officials said.
Construction is expected to take 18 months from groundbreaking, for which an exact date has yet to be set.
Ogier has advised Serena Data Ventures, Europe's first Big Data and AI-focused fund, on its investment in CybelAngel International.
An Ogier team, led by the firm's head of Luxembourg corporate law advice Bertrand Geradin, provided Luxembourg legal advice on the investment to acquire a 17 per cent stake in the company by way of subscription of series A preference shares.
CybelAngel is a high-profile French cybersecurity start-up that specialises in using Big Data solutions to detect data leaks.
Serena Data Ventures is an 80 million euro venture capital fund established in January to invest in tech firms in the fields of Big Data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things. Bertrand said: “This project is representative of the work that we are seeing in the tech space – there is significant interest in investing in European tech start-ups, and we expect to see more activity in this innovative area.”
Opposition lawmaker, Albay First District Rep. Edcel Lagman, on Saturday described as weak and flawed the newly created Philippine Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) of the administration.
Lagman's reaction came after Malacañang issued Executive Order No. 43 creating the PACC, which is mandated to “directly assist the President in investigating and/or hearing administrative cases primarily involving graft and corruption against all presidential appointees.”
Lagman said PACC is “congenitally infirm” and flawed from the very beginning as it was created out of spite and vengeance.

“It is flawed from the beginning, since no less than (President Rodrigo) Duterte himself projected the establishment of the PACC after the Ombudsman ordered the investigation of the unexplained wealth of Duterte and his family,” Lagman said in a statement.
READ: Duterte creates Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission
Lagman said PACC violates the Constitution and R.A. No. 6770 or the “Ombudsman Act of 1989,” which created the Office of the Ombudsman, “for illegally duplicating and intruding into the authority and powers of the Ombudsman to investigate public officials and employees, including those in the military and police establishments, for graft as basis for prosecution or impeachment.”
The lawmaker also noted that the “President does not have any jurisdiction, through the PACC, to investigate presidential appointees,” such as the Ombudsman, top officials of constitutional bodies, and those who are outside of the executive department.
Malacañang, however, said the creation of PACC was necessitated to aid the needed reforms and cleansing of agencies in the government. /jpv
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian police arrested a woman Wednesday in connection with the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother.
Police released a statement saying the woman was carrying Vietnamese travel documents when she was arrested at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
Kim Jong Nam died Monday after suddenly falling ill at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, said a senior Malaysian government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy.
Kim, who died on the way to a hospital, told medical workers that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, the official said.
Malaysian officials have provided few other details. Police said an autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death.
Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.”
South Korea's spy service said Wednesday that North Korea had been trying for five years to kill Kim. But the National Intelligence Service did not definitively say that North Korea was behind the killing, just that it was presumed to be a North Korean operation, according to lawmakers who briefed reporters about the closed door meeting with the spy officials.
The NIS cited Kim Jong-un's alleged “paranoia” about his half brother. Still, the agency has a history of botching intelligence on North Korea and has long sought to portray the country's leaders as mentally unstable.
Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong Nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.
Police were searching for clues in the closed circuit television footage from the airport, said Selangor police chief Abdul Samah Mat. The airport is in Selangor, near Kuala Lumpur.
According to the Malaysian government official, Kim Jong Nam was in a shopping concourse and had not yet gone through security for a planned flight to Macau when the incident occurred.
Kim was estranged from his half brother, the North Korean leader. Although he had been originally tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his late dictator father, Kim Jong Il, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.
He reportedly fell further out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970.
Ken Gause, who is with the CNA think tank in Washington and has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong Nam had traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971.
While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim's purges.
Mark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong Nam was not killed on the orders of his half brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in the past.
“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong Nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his half brother.
Among Kim Jong-un's executions and purgings, the most spectacular was the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.
Gause said Kim Jong Nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his half brother's legitimacy in the past.
Kim Jong Nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong Nam in China in 2010.
Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong Nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong Nam may have become more vulnerable, as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui — Kim Jong-un's aunt and the wife of his executed uncle — appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.
Kim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It's unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government.
A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un's gatekeeper, Gause said.

Scott Peterson, who was found guilty of murdering his pregnant wife and unborn child nearly 15 years ago, is breaking his silence for the first time since the conviction, saying, "I was staggered by it. I had no idea it was coming."
Peterson spoke out from death row in an interview for an upcoming A&E documentary series, "The Murder of Laci Peterson," which premieres Tuesday. The series takes a new look at the case that riveted the nation, after Laci Peterson disappeared on Christmas Eve in 2002, while eight months pregnant. Her body and the body of her unborn child were later found in San Francisco Bay.
John Marks, one of the Executive Producers of the documentary, said Scott Peterson may have decided to speak out for the first time since his conviction now, more than a decade later, because he is in the process of appealing his sentence.
"There's an appeals process that's ongoing, so his case is under appeal," Marks told ABC News. "So it felt like a moment, I think, for him, and for his lawyer to step up and ... say something about the case."
In the documentary, Peterson also described the moment he found out about his guilty verdict.
"It was crazy, just this amazing, horrible, physical reaction I had," Peterson said, adding that he "couldn't feel my feet on the floor. I couldn't feel the chair I was sitting in. My vision got a little blurry."
The documentary series revisits most of the key players in the case, including Scott Peterson's former mistress, Amber Frey.
Frey recalls how scared she was when she learned Scott Peterson was actually a married man with a missing wife, and when she had to pretend everything was fine as Scott Peterson continued calling her after Laci Peterson vanished.
In a never-before-broadcast audio recording from 2004, Scott Peterson addresses why he decided to talk to Frey after his wife had gone missing, saying, "The overriding reason throughout it all was she starts giving media interviews, there is no more search for Laci and Conner," referring to the unborn child they had planned to name Conner.
"I'd seen what had happened to the search for Chandra Levy with Gary Condit as soon as it was revealed that he had sex with her, there was no more search for her," Scott Peterson added.
Marks told ABC News that even as the 15-year anniversary of the case approaches, the new documentary reveals details that many have never heard before.
"I think when you listen to the witnesses who say they saw Laci in the park, I think that will be really ... that will be kind of a surprise," Marks said.
Marks, who maintained that the documentary is not an exoneration piece, also opened up about what he is hoping to accomplish with the series, telling ABC News, "I just want people to say, 'What actually happened here?'"
"The Murder of Lacie Peterson" premieres on the A&E Network on Tuesday, August 15 at 10 p.m. ET.
Ah, Balenciaga: at it again. Pushing all those social media buttons and getting everyone het up to such an extent that they have just become complicit in making an item in the men's collection a veritable phenomenon simply on the back of an Instagram post.
When will we stop swallowing the bait? One moment there's a picture online, and the next it has spawned 1,000 memes — all of which lead back to the source, and all of which play right into the hands of the very canny designer Demna Gvasalia.
He understands as well as anyone how to ride the hype cycle and bend the free-floating and often indiscriminate desire of the digisphere to use fashion as target practice to his own advantage.
I am speaking, of course, of the T-shirt shirt, a men's wear product from the Balenciaga fall 2018 collection that is exactly what it sounds like: a cotton T-shirt twinned to a cotton button-up shirt in complementary colors that can be worn with the long-sleeved shirt draped on the front, or the T-shirt draped off the back.
This fun, fluffy doc lacks guts, grit and integrity

Always at The Carlyle
Studio 7
Opens July 6
Real-Life Goldfinger Donald Trump can call it “a joke” all he wants, but The Carlyle really is one of New York's most legendary hotels. The grand old establishment is known for its classy art deco design, impressive clientele (from Jack Nicholson to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) and, above all, a fierce code of silence.
Never mind the staff's refusal to gossip: the documentary Always At The Carlyle has stories for days. The hosts may refuse to blab but the guests are happy to. Some of the events that took place in the hotel are the stuff of legend: Marilyn Monroe's killer rendition of “Happy Birthday”; Paul Newman's experiments with vinaigrette; an elevator ride including Princess Diana, Michael Jackson and Steve Jobs. And that's just what we know.
More than following a cinematic structure, the film focuses on the hotel's most popular areas one at the time: the ridiculously expensive rooms, the Bemelmans Bar and the mythical Café Carlyle. The tone is relentlessly positive, so much so, it feels a bit like a 90-minute long infomercial. Clearly the hotel wouldn't have been as accommodating otherwise.
I have two major problems with Always At The Carlyle. As fascinating as the New York landmark is, the film feels like a celebration of the rich and famous, even though the staff (the majority of whom are immigrants) have more compelling stories than any A-listers. Of all people, Harrison Ford comes the closest to hitting the nail on the head by pointing out the irrationality of paying $1,100 a night for an hotel room.
The second issue is the decision of the film's producers to excise a Woody Allen interview. As problematic as the filmmaker may be, Woody is one of the most recognizable mainstays of the Carlyle (he's played clarinet every Monday at the Café for decades), and a couple of passing references just don't cut it. Of all genres, a documentary needs the courage of its convictions — even a fluffier doc like this.
Regardless of my misgivings over the film I'll be damned if I wouldn't stay at The Carlyle given an opportunity.
Perhaps there is some person with talents to rival those of Annabel Crabb. Perhaps there is one who could radiate that Crabb-type credible warmth on TV. In the unlikely case such a genial authority exists, they shall not serve Our ABC -- that Australian organisation now so estranged from Australian reality, it pretends its new pretend dress-up show Back in Time for Dinner is “factual” programming. No. They shall command all of us on Earth, should this planet survive liberalism to a liberal dystopian future.
Let's not consider the propagandist potential of Chairman Crabb, but look back instead at last night's debut of that “factual” moment you sensibly elected to miss.
Jaya's death: HC dismisses plea for inclusion of IAS official in probe panel
Press Trust of India, Chennai, Oct 6 2017, 20:57 IST
The Madras HC said that it found no ground to allow the PIL in the court, and also dubbed it a 'publicity interest litigation'. PTI file photo.
The Madras High Court today dismissed a plea for a direction to the state government to include U Sagayam, IAS, and also a member nominated by the DMK, the main opposition party, in the inquiry commission set up to probe the death of former chief minister Jayalalithaa.
The First Bench, comprising Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar, dubbed the PIL as publicity interest litigation and dismissed it.
The bench asked the petitioner to show the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act which would enable the inclusion of any member, as prayed by him, for which he said there was no such provision.
When the bench raised another query on the appointment of the one-man commission of inquiry, headed by Justice (retd) A Arumugasamy, the petitioner replied that he was not making any comment about the integrity and competence of Justice Arumugaswamy.
Referring to their order last month upholding the constitution of the inquiry commission, the bench said: "In the absence of any provision in the Act and in the light of the fact that we have already upheld the constitution of the commission on the earlier occasion, we find no ground to entertain the petition on the same set of reasons."
The bench also warned the petitioner B.Balamurugan, who is working as an Assistant Commissioner, Customs Excise and Service Tax Tribunal, while referring to his contentions with regard to then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul by name in his affidavit.
"The averments are unfortunate and uncalled for and contumacious," it said.
Last month, demonstrators took to the streets of Los Angeles to call for protections for undocumented immigrants after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would be repealed (AFP Photo/DAVID MCNEW)
Los Angeles (AFP) - California became the first "sanctuary state" for undocumented immigrants Friday, a decision criticized by the Trump administration which believes the move will compromise security.
California's governor, Democrat Jerry Brown, signed the landmark legislation -- Senate Bill 54 (SB54) -- which grants better protections to people who are in the US without permission, including those who have committed crimes.
It also limits cooperation between local police forces and federal authorities in operations to track down undocumented immigrants.
The legislation, which will come into effect on January 1, 2018, is part of a series of laws which protect the almost 3 million undocumented immigrants living in California -- most of whom are from Mexico and Central America.
Brown insisted in his signing statement the measure will not "prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way" -- but it will stop local authorities from assisting.
"They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California," he wrote, adding that the new legislation will not deny ICE access to prisons.
But in a statement, ICE acting director Tom Homan responded: "The governor is simply wrong."
The law will "undermine public safety and hinder ICE from performing its federally mandated mission," Homan said.
"Ultimately, SB54 (...) creates another magnet for more illegal immigration," he insisted, adding ICE will have "no choice but to conduct at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at worksites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests."
ICE said it will also likely send immigrants arrested in California to detention centers outside of the state, "far from any family they may have in California."
A number of cities in California, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, have already banned police officers from collaborating with ICE on operations to capture undocumented immigrants.
Last week, ICE detained 450 undocumented immigrants in the United States -- 101 of whom were in Los Angeles.
The bill signed into law by Brown also includes assistance for students and measures to combat abuse of tenants.

A 2007 Australia Institute study identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland – Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
A 2007 Australia Institute study identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland – Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
THE Turnbull Government will be urged to consider developing a nuclear power industry under a plan to be debated at the LNP convention.
The controversial resolution, proposed by Fairfax MP Ted O'Brien's branch, could lead to a plan for generators across the country if it is adopted by the party and then acted on by the government.
The branch does not list possible sites for nuclear power plants in the resolution but urges the Federal Government to "consider the feasibility of nuclear powered energy generation in Australia".
A 2007 Australia Institute study identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland – Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
A 2007 study by the left wing Australia Institute identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland - Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
That study chose locations using key criteria including existing electricity infrastructure, centres of demand, transport infrastructure and access to large quantities of water for cooling and warned setting up a nuclear industry in Australia could prove unpopular.
"If the Federal Government decided to promote the establishment of a nuclear power industry in Australia, the siting of the power plants is likely to be one of the most politically contentious issues," the report said.
"In Australia, approximately half of the population opposes nuclear energy and two thirds say they would oppose a nuclear power plant in their local area."
The Fairfax LNP branch has proposed three separate resolutions on energy policy to be debated at the convention, which starts in Brisbane on Friday.
Other resolutions from the branch call on the government to "reduce the high level of subsidy paid to the renewable energy industry" and "support the building of new Coal Fired Power Stations that have the capacity to produce reliable and economic power".
Resolutions that are adopted by the LNP convention are not binding on the government. Mr O'Brien could not be reached for comment.

The Madina District Police Command has commenced investigation into the stabbing to death of a 7 year old boy, Prince Martin.
According to the Police Commander, Gladys Mpere, some substance at the crime scene where the class 2 pupil of New Nation School at Ashaley Botwe was murdered has been collected and sent to the Police Foresnsic lab for testing.
Narrating the circumstance leading to the death of her son, a tearful Madam Gladys Antwi told Kasapa FM's Daakyehene Ofosu Agyemang, that the deceased had returned from school hale and hearty and decided to do his homework at her shop.
She said later, her son moved to the staircase leading to the shop and sat there to play. Not long after, a lady came shouting that she'd seen the boy lying in an awkward position and had called him several times without responding.
Madama Gladys Antwi said, out of fear, she rushed to the place only to see her son lying supine motionless. She added that she quickly picked up her son and conveyed him to a nearby hospital where the boy was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.
She added that an examination of the boy's body revealed that he had been stabbed twice in the abdomen with a sharp object which led to his untimely death.

Trump says memo "totally vindicates" him
-- President Donald Trump said the GOP memo accusing the FBI of abusing its surveillance authority "totally vindicates" him from the Russia investigation.
In a Saturday tweet, President Trump said, "This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2018
The memo, declassified by the president on Friday, was spearheaded by GOP House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The memo alleged then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the committee no surveillance warrant would've been sought for a Trump campaign aide without a disputed opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia, CNN reported.

Trudeau warns Canada "will not be pushed around" on NAFTA
-- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the U.S. that the country "will not be pushed around" on trade negotiations related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Reuters reported.
“We will not be pushed around. At the same time we can remain confident about NAFTA,” Trudeau said Friday, according to Reuters. “The negotiations are complex and challenging ... I've said many times, we are not going to take any old deal ... Canada is willing to walk away from NAFTA if the United States proposes a bad deal.”
Both Canada and Mexico officials have said the countries are trying to address U.S. demands for NAFTA reform without disrupting the highly integrated North American economy.

RED DEER: Local deer expert Paul Rattray believes the sounds in the Gympie region are coming from the red deer during mating season.
STRANGE noises in the early and late hours of the day are causing a stir around the Gympie region.
No, it isn't yowies, it is the resident red deer population in the middle of their mating season, known as the "roar” or the "rut”.
Red deer are an introduced species and are listed as feral in Australia.
Valley deer expert Paul Rattray has been studying the region's red deer population for years and recently wrote a book on the subject.
"I think that the Mary Valley and Gympie regions has a pretty healthy population of red deer, which is most of what people are hearing around the place,” he said.
"The male red deer make these calls when they are in mating season - around March and April.”
He said people generally confuse their sounds.
"Initially, someone might think it is a bull.
"It is more drawn out than a bull.
"Often they will give a couple of barks at the end of the call.
"Most people think it sounds like a strange cow, then realise it's not a cow and they begin to wonder what it is.”
Mr Rattray said the growth in population had brought the deer into contact with humans as they roam.
"One local farmer had never heard deer in his region before.
"He heard it and was concerned, he thought it was a yowie or something like that.
"I know their movement through the region.
"Like fishing spots, you don't share that information.
"During the roar, they travel all over the place. They call out to see if they can find any females.
"There is a limit; there are some red deer up around the Woolooga area, not too far north of Gympie.
"West to Murgon and Goomeri and even Kingaroy area.
"It hooks back to the Brisbane Valley area and up into the Sunshine Coast and Mary Valley region,” Mr Rattray said.
He said there is very little physical threat imposed by male deer, but the main issue was environmental.
"There are a few anecdotal cases where people have been chased by stags. As a rule, red deer will run the other way.
"My understanding from the Australian Deer Association is they don't carry any significant diseases to humans or cattle. They do cause damage to waterholes and waterways.
"They will carry some weeds on their coat, or eat certain weeds and deposit them as they travel along.
"People with cattle especially, they feed from the tops of hills rather than coming up from the bottom. In winter, they will come down to finish off the legumes before the cattle get to them.
"In large numbers they can compete with cattle quite significantly.”
Mr Rattray has worked as a consultant in deer management.
"My interest in them is really sustainable management. I don't think it is realistic to cull them completely.
"My view is that it is far better to to maintain them sustainably,” he said.
"Female red deer primarily compete with cattle. Stags not so much - they eat more woody plants and tend to be more up in the hills.
"We have an issue in the Mary Valley and Brisbane Valley where the shooters primarily shoot males, which leads to a disproportionate female population which compete with cattle.”

Jahan Worth has always been a hard-hitting player, even before he stepped on the gridiron.
As a youngster, he played soccer. The only problem was that he had a fondness for tackling his opponents to the turf.
It was around that time that Worth's parents, Tracy and Michael, decided that football might be a better fit.
And Jahan has been leveling people ever since.
The Parkland High School senior smashed ball-carriers from his middle linebacker spot and rumbled over defenders as a running back, while he helped fulfill the Trojans' lofty expectation of success during a season in which outside opinions had dipped.
For leading his team to a sixth consecutive district title while putting together impressive production on both sides of the ball, Worth is the 2017 lehighvalleylive Football Player of the Year.
He is the second Trojan to win the award during the short time that Parkland players have been eligible. De'Vante Cross earned the accolade in 2015.

The Latest on violent protesting in Virginia and related developments around the nation (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
A group that hosts a ceremony every year to re-dedicate an Atlanta monument depicting a Confederate soldier vows that it will be repaired after protesters spray-painted it and broke a chunk from it.
John Green, past commandant of the Old Guard of the Gate City Guard, said Monday it appears his group must now raise money to repair the 105-year-old statue damaged during a Sunday protest after the deadly weekend violence in Virginia.
City officials haven't commented on any plans for repairs or whether city funds would be used for that.
Green said removing the statue from Piedmont Park, a city park, is not an option.
He said the angel standing over the soldier represents peace, and it was created to help bring the nation back together after the Civil War.

7:40 a.m.
A prominent white nationalist website that promoted a Virginia rally that ended in deadly violence Saturday is losing its internet domain host.
GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it has given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated GoDaddy's terms of service.
GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race tells the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by labeling a woman killed in an attack at the event in Charlottesville "fat" and "childless." Heather Heyer was killed Saturday when police say a man plowed his car into a group of demonstrators protesting the white nationalist rally.
Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down.

7:25 a.m.
Protesters spray-painted and broke a chunk off a statue depicting a Confederate soldier at an Atlanta park after they marched through the city to protest the weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that a lone policeman at Piedmont Park on Sunday night was surrounded by black-clad protesters shouting "pig" as demonstrators used chains to try and destroy the Peace Monument.
The statue depicts a winged angel standing over a Confederate soldier.
Video from local news outlets showed red spray paint covering much of the monument following the demonstration.
The Atlanta protest was among several around the nation over the weekend that were organized after a chaotic white supremacist rally in Virginia ended with deadly violence.

7:25 a.m.
The German government is condemning the white nationalist rally in Virginia that turned violent Saturday, expressing solidarity with peaceful counter-protesters.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters Monday that it was an "absolutely repulsive scene at this extreme-right march."
He said "there was outrageous racism, anti-Semitism and hate in its most despicable form to be seen, and whenever it comes to such speech or such images it is repugnant."
He added that it's "completely contrary to what the chancellor and the German government works for politically, and we are in solidarity with those who stand peacefully against such aggressive extreme-right opinions."
Seibert says Merkel also regrets the death of a counter-protester and sent her sympathies to those injured.

3 a.m.
An Ohio man accused of plowing his car into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia is set to make his first court appearance.
Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, says 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. has a bond hearing Monday morning.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say he drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
Fields has been in custody since Saturday. Jail officials told The Associated Press they don't know if he's obtained an attorney.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his "deeply held, radical" convictions on race.
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — On a day when riders on at least seven subway lines experienced delays due to “signal problems,” a new report blames the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the massive delays and cost overruns.
As CBS2 Political Reporter Marcia Kramer reported, calls continue to mount for repairs on the out-of-date system.
“Many, many delays,” said Michael Van Winkle of the Upper West Side. “I actually came from 139th Street and I had to take an Uber to 96th Street in order to get here. Always delays – delays, delays, delays. I'm very angry. It's cost me more money than it should.”
Van Winkle was one just one of the many riders stranded – delayed because of signal problems on each and every line represented by a number – the No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 lines.
The problems Wednesday came on the heels of a scathing finding by the Independent Budget Office that the MTA is many years behind in fixing the 1930s-era subway signal system that causes the frustrating delays that infuriate riders.
“They're doing very badly,” said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. “It would be 2045 before they would complete the signal upgrade modernization.”
Brewer requested the study, which discovered, among other things, that:
• Nineteen of 33 signal upgrades in the two previous capital plans were either delayed or are still unfinished;
• Eight of the 14 projects scheduled to being this year are delayed.
What riders see are the red, green and yellow lights that tell the train conductor when to move. But it is way more complex than that – a defective signal can stop a train and ripple through the system.
The MTA admitted that it desperately needs to change its current hard-to-repair “fixed-block” signal system, which is so old that the only way the agency can get parts is to manufacture them itself.
An MTA video shows how the system limits the number of trains it can run by automatic spacing that keeps the trains far apart, and can bring the system to a standstill.
The system is enforced by stop arms that can activate the brakes of a train.
In the video, the MTA concedes that there are many limitations, no precise location of speed control, and no way really to know where trains are.
“Lot of delays on the 2, 3 trains these past couple of months,” one woman said.
“Frustrating – I try to take the express bus as much as possible,” said Alex Parker of Co-Op City, the Bronx.
The MTA said it is working hard to upgrade the signals, including a new communication-based train control system that would allow them to run trains closer.
On The Lexington Avenue line, such a system would mean three more trains an hour to ease overcrowding.
The ground shook from the percussion of a low-frequency boom after 200 tons of molten steel mixed with scrap metal at a massive U.S. Steel Corp. mill near Pittsburgh. It's the same kind of explosive chemical reaction that's been rocking the site since Andrew Carnegie built the plant 145 years ago -- an investment that set him along a path from middling railroad manager to world's richest man.
Back then, Carnegie Steel Co.'s Edgar Thomson plant was state-of-the-art. It mass-produced the metal at lower costs than nearby competitors, and upgrades in the 1880s and 1890s left rivals scrambling to keep up. When J. Pierpont Morgan successfully merged a collection of assets with Carnegie in 1901 to create U.S. Steel, Edgar Thomson became the crown jewel of the new company.
But U.S. Steel's once dominant position in American manufacturing through much of the 20th century has been eroded by cheap imports and the emergence of domestic rivals like Nucor Corp., which use electric-arc furnaces to melt recycled metal rather than forges fueled by coal-based coke that process iron ore.
After reporting losses in seven of the past eight fiscal years, Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel was forced to close plants and delay many improvements. Even as the outlook began to improve in 2017 -- prices nearly doubled from a 2015 low as the government restricted imports, inventories fell and the economy began to pick up -- the failure to revitalize aging facilities was choking earnings. In April, the company announced a huge multiyear plan to get its assets back in top shape, before disclosing in July that the price tag would be $1.2 billion. The cost and scope of the plan stunned investors.
“It's not crazy to be investing in blast-furnace assets right now, but it's just sort of a shame that they're having to invest in a big maintenance program right now when this is prime time to be making money,” said Lee McMillan, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities Inc. in New York. “They've just been so relentlessly focused on cost cutting that some people believe maybe they under-invested in their assets over the past few years.”
Century-Old Assets
Workers at the Edgar Thomson plant -- part of a larger complex known as Mon Valley Works -- stride across layers of dark soot and breathe air that tastes of metal the minute they enter the building. It's so unkempt and busy that a visitor would be hard-pressed to figure out where the company invested $2 million recently to upgrade the facility, one of many century-old assets that require a lot of spending on upkeep.
The question for investors is whether U.S. Steel has left too much too late, with maintenance costs eroding the benefits of a market rebound. From 2006 to 2011, the company spent an average of $50.93 per ton shipped on capital expenditures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. From 2012 through 2016, that investment had plunged 26 percent to $37.85.
In April, the company cut its profit forecast and said it would embark on an unprecedented revitalization of key assets. On the day of the announcement, the shares plunged 27 percent, the most since at least 1991.
From 2017 to 2020, U.S. Steel plans to spend $200 million improving blast furnaces, $400 million on steel-making applications, $300 million on hot-strip mills and $300 million on cold rolling and coating. That's more expensive and will take longer than many analysts had expected. While the company raised $439 million selling shares in August 2016 to cover some of the cost, that's about a third of the total bill.
Leadership Change
The strategy already has cost former CEO Mario Longhi his job. In May, less than a month after the share plunge, he was replaced by David Burritt, who had been chief operating officer and is pushing ahead with the same spending plan.
“When we get very focused on revitalizing our assets and we give our people the money to spend in those areas, we see the benefits through the rest of the year and into the future,” Burritt said on a conference call with analysts.
Investors had expected a U.S. Steel rebound in 2017. Before the revitalization plan was disclosed, the shares had quintupled from the historic lows of early 2016, when the company reported a quarterly loss of almost $1 billion and said it faced significant headwinds. The outlook changed when the government levied trade duties on imported steel from countries including China, whose shipments to the U.S. fell to a five-year low.
Donald Trump's surprise victory in the November presidential election was a boon to the domestic steel industry. He campaigned on an America-first trade policy and pledged $1 trillion in infrastructure spending. The S&P Supercomposite Steel Sub Industry Index of 13 U.S. companies is up 26% from a year earlier.
‘Poses Challenges'
The gains were short-lived. U.S. Steel shares have yet to recover from the plunge in April and are down 19% this year -- despite eight straight gains amid reports the company may sell its Slovak unit. And imports from China, which fell the past two years, are up 6.7 percent in 2017 as the government failed to follow through on threats to boost tariffs.
“Where are their competitors going to be when this revitalization program is done?” Novid Rassouli, an analyst at Cowan & Co., said in a telephone interview. “No one is stopping for them to get their assets back to where they want them, so I think that poses challenges for them.”
Burritt helped to soothe the concerns of some analysts in July with a detailed explanation of plans for eight major upgrade projects this year, as well as the benefits of increased production and profitability once the work was completed. The company also maintained its guidance for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
‘Very Volatile'
“This whole theory that some people have out there that U.S. Steel has grossly underinvested for years and the place is falling apart and they'll have to reinvest every penny here on out to get back on equal footing with their competitors is a stretch,” said Michael Gambardella, a steel analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. “It's just a very volatile sector.”
There's also still a strong possibility that Trump will pass tariffs, quotas or a mix of both on steel imports, which would provide a major boost to U.S. Steel and other domestic producers, Gambardella said.
U.S. Steel still has an advantage over mini-mills in supplying higher-purity steel preferred by automakers. These products sell at higher profit margins than rebar produced from recycled metal by Nucor and Steel Dynamics Inc. for use for construction and infrastructure, though those companies are working to improve quality to expand their market share.
“It's a very pivotal moment in U.S. Steel's life as a company here, and execution is key,” Cowan's Rassouli said. “There's been a fair amount of investor confidence that's been eroded, so it's a long journey to build that back. It takes a lifetime to build trust, and one second to lose it.

The Evolution of Technologies Over the Years
Remember Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) from the 1990s? I do. Well, maybe some of the younger readers won't. VRML was way ahead of its time. But now pure VR is in vogue. What happened along the way? This article at Motherboard tells the story. “VR Was the ‘Next Big Thing' 20 Years Ago. What's Different Now?”
Plus, from the next article, comes a new concept (for me anyway). Diminished realty.
Augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality are three realities that exist on the reality-virtuality continuum—and they are probably the three terms you have heard again and again. However, there is a fourth reality you probably haven't heard of—diminished reality.
For the details, see: “New opportunities for augmented reality.”
Moving on….
Over at 9to5Mac Zac Hall lays it out: “WWDC Wishlist: How Apple TV could improve with tvOS 11 this year.” He covers it all, and there's more opportunity for tvOS than you may have thought about. A good read.
Human beings just aren't designed for boring, repetitive, strenuous jobs. But we've pressed them into service for that kind thing for centuries because there was no other recourse. So when you see videos like this, you may think, robots will put us all out of work! But that's also a good thing. Humans should be freed up to do much more interesting, creative things. That's what my wife tells her college students. (Some aren't yet listening.) Anyway, for a tasty, intriguing video (reminiscent of an ant farm), see: “Good news: the robot that takes your job might be cute enough to go viral.”
Next. We haven't heard much about Apple's car project. The wind seemed to go out of those sails when we learned that Apple likely wouldn't elect to go toe-to-toe with Tesla. Instead, Apple may be looking at designing the software for an autonomous system, a system that Apple would market to other car companies. Personally, I don't think that's going to work out because car companies want ownership/control and transparency into this kind of software. Even so, Apple seems to be moving forward. “Apple Receives Permit From California DMV to Test Self-Driving Cars.”
We often hear about how Apple may have peaked. Claims are made that Apple is now substituting extracted revenue for innovation. In any case, companies struggle to become large and powerful—at which point a whole new set of problems arise. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is aware of that. Here's how he intends to avoid the fate of a big company gone wrong. “This is the Jeff Bezos playbook for preventing Amazon's demise.” As an exercise, read the article a second time and replace “Amazon” with “Apple.” See how it works.
Finally, remember when Google was going to scan every book in print and make them all available on the Internet? The project was Google Book Search. Backchannel tells the story about lawsuits stalled Google's early efforts. Fifteen years later, the momentum and passion is gone.
Google Book Search is amazing that way. When it started almost 15 years ago, it also seemed impossibly ambitious: An upstart tech company that had just tamed and organized the vast informational jungle of the web would now extend the reach of its search box into the offline world. By scanning millions of printed books from the libraries with which it partnered, it would import the entire body of pre-internet writing into its database.
The article goes on to explain how this project foundered a bit.
Yet the Books fight was never as central to Google's corporate being as that kind of all-consuming conflict. And it wasn't all a waste, either. It taught Google something valuable.
It's easy in this age of the fiber Internet, exabyte storage, and supercomputers to conceive of grand plans. But whether a tech giant can stay with the vision, retain its key people, deal with legalities, implement the plan soundly, scale it, and extract long term value, before the technology landscape changes, is another thing altogether. This article is an excellent case in point.

Particle Debris is a generally a mix of John Martellaro's observations and opinions about a standout event or article of the week (preamble on page one) followed on page two by a discussion of articles that didn't make the tmo headlines, the technical news debris. The column is published most every Friday except for holidays.
The 2017 Galaxy A5 now has 16-megapixel f/1.9 front and rear cameras, 3GB of RAM compared to 2GB last year, a faster 1.9GHz octa-core processor and a slightly larger 3,000 mAh battery with fast USB-C charging. As before, it packs a metal, glass-backed body, but it now has IP68 water and dust resistance, meaning it'll stand up to rain and dust, even though you can't swim with it.
The new 720p Galaxy A3, meanwhile, has a 13-megapixel rear camera, as before, but now packs a larger front 8-megapixel selfie camera. RAM goes up from 1.5GB to 2.0GB and the battery is a slightly larger 2,350 mAh and fast-charging, again thanks to USB-C. Both devices now have "enhanced" MicroSD, letting you add up to 256GB of storage, along with Android 6, an always-on display and Samsung Pay support. You can get them in four colors: Black Sky, Gold Sand, Blue Mist and Peach Cloud.
The premium materials and new features should help them better fulfill their intended missions as camera and social-media platforms, but there's a lot of competition in that price range: The Galaxy A3 runs €329 and the A5 is priced at €429 (around $350 and $450, respectively). For a bit more than the latter price, for instance, you could get a much faster OnePlus 3T, although that model doesn't have MicroSD storage. Samsung didn't specify UK pricing yet, but pre-orders open on January 20th. There's no word on US availability.
A fixture of the London landscape and soundscape, Big Ben, is falling silent for four years. The bell will cease its regular tolling while extensive repairs are made to the famous clock tower that looms over the Palace of Westminster, the home of the British Parliament.
The massive bell will mark the hour for the last time at noon on Aug. 21 and then pause for four years while the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the Great Clock and the Great Bell, aka Big Ben, is restored. A larger restoration of the Parliament buildings is likely to begin in the early 2020s, according to a Parliament website.
Quieting Big Ben's mighty bongs will help preserve the hearing of workers involved in the project.
The keeper of the Great Clock, Steve Jaggs, said in a statement that the pause "is a significant milestone in this crucial conservation project." If you're in London next Monday you may want to accept Jaggs' invitation to gather in Parliament Square "to hear Big Ben's final bongs until they return in 2021." However, Big Ben will still bong for important national events such as New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday.
The Great Bell has chimed nearly every hour for the past 157 years. It has had previous breaks in service for maintenance and conservation in 2007, in 1983-1985 and in 1976. The 13.7-ton bell, which was forged in the 1850s, is accompanied by smaller chimes that ring out each quarter hour.
The Great Clock has a Victorian-era clockwork mechanism that triggers the bell and chimes. That mechanism and the clock's four faces will also get refurbished, which will require the faces to be covered.
To make sure Londoners don't get completely disoriented and lose track of the correct time, Jaggs says at least one clock face will remain visible. It will keep time with the aid of a modern electric motor, while the Victorian mechanism is being repaired.

The HBO limited seres The Young Pope is now over, and it's never coming back. There's no point in trying to predict Lenny Belardo's next move, or debating the show's final, unanswered questions: Did he actually die? Did he have a heart attack, or did he die from natural causes? Did he really see his parents in that final vision through the telescope? Do any old hippies actually look like that? Paolo Sorrentino, the estimable writer and director of Young Pope, even made sure to inscribe “END” across the final frames of the finale. It is superimposed over a computer-generated vision of Earth from space, as if to say that if anyone was still wondering what this show was about, the answer is … everything. But really, if you stuck with this compellingly outrageous show for the full 10-plus hours, then why would you still be wondering that?
It's hard to imagine anyone who actually made it through the full series not thinking it was great. It wasn't something that could be watched casually, or just out of morbid curiosity–to stomach it required an honest investment and some level of concession to its outlandish pseudo-realism. It felt both ambitious and haphazard, mixing sharp, silly, meme-ready moments with lugubrious atmosphere. Sometimes Sorrentino's ideas felt more patently stupid than obliquely profound, like even that imagined depth of vision might be the accidental upshot of some improvisational weirdness. But without its chanciest, most loosely-threaded elements–say, the pope trying on outlandish outfits for his cardinals' address to the strains of LMFAO's “Sexy and I Know It” or Lenny's right-hand man Guiterrez's (Javier Cámara) unexplained relationship with a mysterious, bedridden, morbidly obese woman in Queens–the show would certainly not have been so engaging and singular.
So the show was best for those ready to give themselves over entirely to its highly mannered dramatic and aesthetic space. Unlike Game of Thrones or Westworld, there's little in the way of cliffhanger drama or intense anticipation to sustain one episode-to-episode. Most installments just kind of fade out gracefully: Sorrentino's camera soars over an empty garden, an ambassador from Greenland character dancing to an Italian-language pop song, Voiello (the show's best character) in obscure, private reflection, whatever. Sometimes, they cut to black out of nowhere, like they simply ran out of time. It's hard to remember the last show a major “event” TV show was so actively challenging to watch–so absent of the normal plot catnip.
After all, all of the major questions of the show are either abandoned suddenly, or evaded up until the series' final moments. Will Pope Lenny ever meet his parents? How destructive will his hyper-conservative policies become? Will he ever betray his vows with his devoted acolyte Esther (Ludivine Sagnier), while nostalgic for his youthful California beach tryst? Will his opposition to diplomacy bankrupt the church? As one focal point was abandoned in favor of another, it became hard to identify what the central tension of the show was–if there was one. Sorrentino required that viewers fall in love with getting lost in his weird parallel universe, and revel their subjective impressions of it without searching for clear cues about what to think.
Still, there are clues to the potential overarching meaning, or mad logic, that underlies Sorrentino's unwieldy show–far closer in style to art-film epics like Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz than Six Feet Under. Belardo, as Pius XIII, believes that creating an aura of mystery and anticipation around himself is key to engaging and “illumining” his followers, and Sorrentino obviously feels this way as well. Creating cycles of conflict and resolution is not the director's project, but rather maintaining a thick, intoxicating sense of mystic ambiguity. Both Pius and the viewer spend the series reaching toward a larger truth that is never accessed. Crucial to the crisis of Pius' papacy in the Vatican is the rumor that he may not, in fact, believe in God.
By the end of the series, The Young Pope proved to be as manifold and contradictory as the passages of scripture the pope spends his days wrestling with. Lenny doesn't know whether to interpret them tyrannically literally (see his almost-10-minute debate about pro-life biblical passages in Episode 9), or to just cite them as points of subjective inspiration on his larger journey toward self-actualization. His final speech in the finale–as hallucinatory as the one he dreams during the premiere, and consisting almost entirely of a list of unresolved questions and riddles–is the only time in the show the 50-year-old pope manages to connect with his public in a way that seems inspirational and mutually beneficial. He speaks honestly, voicing both hope and indecision, and then, appears to perish from the strain. For a moment, he finally becomes a symbol–a public, flawed face, open for interpretation–rather than an engineer of dire, idealized action behind closed doors. Perhaps–as his spiritual guru and erstwhile rival, Cardinal Spencer (James Cromwell), recommends on his deathbed–Pius finally becomes the “door” and not the “hinge.”
Okay, cool, that all seems very nice, but, still … what does any of that have to do with that one kangaroo? Do you recall, by now, the CGI kangaroo who shows up slain on the garden path one day following a couple of tense stare-downs with Pius? What was that little door with the glowing light behind it that Lenny pulled out for his address to the cardinals? Why and wherefore that subplot with the narco kingpin, and that orgy scene, and that part where Flume blasts over Lenny's speech dragging that African dictator? If we're being honest, is The Young Pope just incredibly dumb?
At times, sure–but gloriously so. Many of its kangaroo-esque moments are, in many ways, as breathtaking that the more explicitly cathartic parts of the shows. Even if Sorrentino's show is all just treacly bullshit underneath the hood–a stoned, self-important, Religious-Studies-201 fever dream–it wouldn't change the fact that little to nothing like it has ever aired on television. As Belardo murmurs in the series finale, “power” can is a “banal platitude.” The Young Pope set up conditions that encouraged meaningful, fraught reflection. It asked something of the viewer rather than prostrating itself, in unseemly or desperate ways, to get us to keep watching. The Young Pope was designed to attract “fanatics,” not “part-time believers,” just as its protagonist wanted for his Church–and luckily, that's a business model on which a show can feasibly survive in the era of Peak TV.
Several businesses are vying for one of the most central spots in Old Towne Orange as the plaza's beauty school prepares to move to Anaheim after more than 50 years in the city.
Coba Cosmotology Academy will head seven miles north to Anaheim by early next month, a move several years in the making, said owner Carol Malkasian.
Malkasian said the school has outgrown its Orange location. The new Anaheim building, nearly twice as large, will allow students to enroll in new aesthetician and barbering programs that aren't feasible with their current space.
“We've had clients who have been coming here for 30 years,” Malkasian said. “We'll definitely miss our neighbors and the vibe of this whole town.”
With Coba preparing to move, the property is now up for lease. The location, a cornerstone of the plaza, has already caught the eye of several businesses. The Orange Grove Masonic Lodge, which owns the property, is determining who would be the best fit for the building, officials said.
“This is obviously a very prime piece of real estate overlooking the plaza,” Masonic Temple Master Steve Craven said. “I really don't think there are any other spaces that have that good of a view over the plaza.”
Craven said choosing the owner will be a balancing act between finances and finding an ideal fit for the surroundings, he did not give a timeline.
“We want to make sure that whatever comes in is going to fit with the Old Towne community,” Craven said. “Everybody knows that the beauty college was a fixture there for years. We'd like to find something else that will be a fixture for years to come.”
Lena Quezada and Walid Alarja co-founded D'Vine, a Mediterranean restaurant with spots in Fullerton and Brea, four years ago.
D'Vine's two locations bring as much flavor from the old world to the west as possible, from the food itself to the Moroccan lanterns, Jerusalem-styled doors and traditional arches. The atmosphere is designed to evoke the feeling of being invited to a Mediterranean family's home for a party, Quezada said.
“Eating is not something they just do and be done with,” Quezada said. “It's an event. It isn't something you come, eat and leave.”
D'Vine offers a cigar lounge, hookah and belly dancers on Fridays and Saturdays.
“Hookah is part of any kind of partying in this culture,” Alarja said. “If you are inviting someone to your house for a meal, they have to have the hookah and either before, in between or after the meal.”
Alarja, born and raised in Bethlehem, runs the kitchen like one from his homeland. He honed his cooking skills in Alexandria, Egypt, and now serves up chicken shawarma, baba ghanoush and kebab cooked on the bone.
Quezada said the restaurant is a chance to introduce Americans to a culture they may not be familiar with, while keeping things as authentic as possible to the old world parties that first inspired the eatery. True to the hospitality expected from hosts of those feasts, both Quezada and Alarja said they man the restaurant from opening to close, welcoming regulars and getting to know them personally.
“Customers like to talk. They like to know to go to places where the owners say ‘Hey! Hi George, Jimmy, William, or whatever,'” Alarja said. “They know you, and you know them.”

SANTEE, Calif. (KGTV)--A sex offender who served time for molesting a seven-year-old boy was arrested shortly after his move to Santee, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.
Michael Bauer was convicted of molesting a boy he didn't know inside a fast food restaurant bathroom in 2009, a Sheriff's spokesperson wrote in a news release.
The Sheriff's Department said Bauer was released from prison and monitored through a GPS anklet by his parole officer.
Bauer lived as a transient in the city of San Diego until he recently moved to 10380 Prospect Ave. in Santee, said deputies. He was banned from having contact with anyone under the age of 18, or being in the vicinity of places where children gather.
The Sheriff's Department released a bulletin Tuesday to alert the community of Bauer's release.
On Wednesday, Bauer was arrested in Santee for violating the terms of his parole and banned from returning to the Prospect Ave. location, according to deputies.
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has a registration website for the public to receive email alerts when a sex offender moves into the community.

James Alex Fields Jr., the 20-year-old Ohio man police say deliberately accelerated his car into a crowd of counterprotesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a young woman, appeared in court today for the first time and was denied bail.
Heather Heyer, 32, an activist who was protesting against a white nationalist gathering that was taking place in the city that day, was killed in the crash. At least 19 others were injured.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions told ABC News on Monday that the incident "does meet the definition of domestic terrorism" under U.S. law, and confirmed that the Department of Justice is pursuing what Fields allegedly did "in every way that we can make a case."
Here's what we know about Fields, his background, and the alleged crime he perpetrated:
Abermarle Charlottesville Regional Jail
An alleged admirer of Hitler and concentration camps
Fields "thought Nazis were pretty cool guys" in the words of Derek Weimer, who told ABC News that he taught World History to Fields, as well as a course called America's Modern Wars, when Fields was a student at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Kentucky.
Weimer described Fields as being "fairly quiet" and "smart" and also claimed Fields was an open admirer of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
He said that he challenged Fields' point of view as a teacher, and that the two had many private discussions on the subject of Nazis.
Two of Fields' classmates told ABC News about a trip to Europe that a group of students took after graduation in 2015, when they visited the Dachau concentration camp in Germany. When they arrived at the concentration camp, Fields allegedly said, "This is where the magic happened," according to the two students.
At least 28,000 people, including countless Jews, died at the Dachau complex and its "subcamps" located elsewhere in Germany, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum. Horrific experiments were conducted on many of the prisoners who were kept there.
Samantha Bloom, Fields' mother, denied to The Associated Press that her son was a white supremacist, and claimed that she thought the rally had "something to do with Trump."
"I just knew he was going to a rally. I mean, I try to stay out of his political views. You know, we don't, you know, I don't really get too involved, I moved him out to his own apartment, so we ... I'm watching his cat," Bloom told the AP.
"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist," Bloom added about her son's appearance at the white nationalist gathering.

From an area of the country lacking in diversity
Weimer said that Fields had little interaction with non-whites at school, at least as far as he could tell.
"We had between 1,200 and 1,300 students at that time," Weimer told ABC News. "Maybe 4 percent were black. There were only a handful of Jews. The school was just about 6 percent Latin-American."
Bloom told the AP that her son "had an African-American friend" in response to a question about whether or not he was a white supremacist.

'A car careening through a crowd'
Tommy, an organizer for the Richmond, Virginia, chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a socialist organization that claims to have seen a major surge in membership following the election of Donald Trump, was there when Fields allegedly rammed his car into the crowd of people.
Tommy, who asked ABC News not to use his last name to protect his identity, said he and other activists were in a celebratory mood until a car careened through the crowd, sending people scrambling.
Kristin Adolfson, a graduate of the University of Virginia who works as a graphic designer at a nonprofit, told The New Yorker that she experienced a "sudden movement through the crowd, sound, bodies in the air" at the scene.
The incident was captured on video from both the front and back of the accelerating car, and the tapes appeared to show the vehicle ramming wildly into the back of other cars, sending the bodies of activists flying through the air.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The Jets could soon have a new owner.
Well, not in the true sense of the word, but it's looking more and more likely that Woody Johnson won't be officially calling the shots in 2017.
According to ProFootballTalk.com, Johnson is expected to cede control of the day-to-day operation of his football team to his brother if he takes a position in President-Elect Donald Trump's administration.
Johnson, 69, is expected to become the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. If so, his brother, Christopher Wold Johnson, would reportedly step in and run the Jets.
That could explain why the Jets are trying to maintain some stability in their front office and on the sideline. Though the team just suffered through a highly disappointing 5-11 season, both general manager Mike Maccagnan and head coach Todd Bowles will return, the team announced shortly after New York's 30-10 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

Should he move into the owner's box, Chris Johnson, 57, will be inheriting a team with a plethora of problems, but it's unknown just how much power he would wield. What's also unknown is how long Woody Johnson would be out of the picture. An ambassadorship can last up to three years.
Over the last six years, the Jets have gone just 41-55 in the regular season without a playoff appearance. They have made the postseason just six times in 17 seasons since Woody Johnson bought the team in January of 2000, and are 136-146 overall, including the playoffs.
Maccagnan is expected to make wholesale changes to the Jets' roster this offseason, but it could prove difficult unless he finds a way to free up salary cap space. There have been reports the Jets could choose to part ways with several players who are under contract in 2017, including wide receiver Brandon Marshall, center Nick Mangold, cornerback Darrelle Revis, and linebacker David Harris.
Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who signed a one-year, $12 million deal prior to training camp, is not expected to be retained.
When Pensioners Threaten Politicians
Executive Briefing
Elsewhere, workers look ahead to their retirement with joy. But not in Nigeria.‎ Here pensioners are owed over N285 billion in liabilities.‎ James Emejo considers the decision of the pensioners to mobilise themselves to vote against those who owed them.
The liabilities of the Federal Government to pensioners came to the fore again last week when the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, and her Budget and National Planning counterpart, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, appeared before the House of Representatives in plenary.
Their appearance was sequel to the recent House of Representatives' resolution summoning them to come and explain what the executive arm was doing about the over N285 billion liability to pensioners under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) and over N174 billion owed those who retired under the defined scheme.
The Chairman of the House Committee on Pension, Hon. Hassan Shekarau, who moved the motion leading to to summon described the condition of pensioners as “alarming and embarrassing” and a breach the constitution.
He expressed worry that despite the noted challenges, there was no adequate provision in the 2017 budget to take care of the problem.‎
Senator Emmanuel Paulker and Hon. Toby Okechukwu, had also moved motions in the Senate and the House leading to resolutions calling on government to defray its pension indebtedness.
N54 Billion Controversy
It was, however, a pleasant surprise for Nigerians who woke up Thursday morning to read in the news that the FG had released the sum of N54 billion to ‘clear' its pension liabilities to the CPS. This was announced by the Minister of Finance the night preceding her appearance before the House.
While some saw it as a welcome development, others saw it as a move to assuage the feeling of the lawmakers , given the anger among them over the issue of government's indebtedness to the pension scheme.‎
On its part, the Nigeria Union of Pensioners, in a statement faulted the announced release, insisting that the “approval of N54 billion has not cleared FG's pension liabilities”.
The pensioners also reminded the minister that even at that, “approval of payment is not the same as payment”.
“It will be good for the minister to tell us when the fund was transferred to the National Pension Commission, and when it will hit pensioners' accounts”, they stated.
The statement also reads in part: “We also appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari for his show of humaneness and for the promise, through the Honourable Minister of Finance, that henceforth ‘the monthly allocation to the PENCOM based on the appropriation of 2017 will regularly be paid along with monthly salaries of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)', to avoid future accumulation of arrears.
“However, the NUP feels the compelling need to put the facts straight as the FG's indebtedness to the CPS is well over N280 billion. Therefore, the release of N54 billion cannot be said to have cleared FG's backlog of pension liability.
“It is a known fact that the FG has consistently under-appropriated for the CPS over the past few years as pension benefits have consistently been treated in installments as though it is a capital expenditure rather than salary for those who have served their fatherland.
“NUP has it on verified record that whereas the sum N93.067,441,000.00 was needed to service FG's statutory obligations to the CPS in 2014, but only the sum of N30,582,553,824.00 was approved, resulting in N62,484,887,175.00 deficit.
“Whereas N98,705,155,450.00, was needed for the year 2015, the Budget Office only proposed the sum of N60,251,158,884.00 to the National Assembly. That alone was a shortfall of N38,453,996,566.00.
“The year 2016 was even worse asN91,914,899,000.00 was required, but the Budget Office proposed onlyN50,195,808,918.00 to the National Assembly, which also approved it, leaving a deficit of N41,719,090,082.00. Worst still, of the N50,195,808,918.00 approved in the 2016 budget, only the sumN18,823,428,342.00 or mandates for four months was released and cash-backed, while N31,372,380,576.00 or mandate for seven and half months was never cash-backed and released.
“Importantly, we are saddened that the FG is claiming to have cleared pension arrears when the mnister did not say a word regarding the over N174 billion owed pensioners who retired under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS). Does it mean that pensioners under this scheme have finally been condemned to life of eternal hardship, sickness, and untimely death?”
They warned that “the way retirees are treated would decide whether those in service and the younger generation would cue behind government's anti-graft war or engage in looting to prepare for life after service”.
Udoma, Adeosun take the stage
It was a barrage of questions for the two ministers after their presentations. Mrs. Adeosun, however, gave an assurance that the issue would be resolved when a planned reconciliation and verification processes were sorted out as government had no resources to handle the liabilities at a go.
She said it would be handled over time.
Earlier in his presentation, the Minister of Budget, Udoma had said that government would constitute a special committee to evolve creative measures to raise funds towards resolving the huge pension liabilities.
Udoma said: “The committee is headed by the finance minister; it is to reconcile all the numbers to see how additional adjustments can be made to the 2017 budget.
“We don't have the money and the truth is that we have to look for some creative ways to raise money after the reconciliation has been done.”
House insists no excuses for renege
But, while recognising the difficulties faced by government in a recessed economy, lawmakers rose in their numbers to ask that pension arrears be treated as a matter of urgent national importance.
In his contribution, the Majority Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ado Dogowa, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts. He, however, told the ministers that it was not enough to say that government had no money, but to table the demands before the National Assembly.
On the released N54 billion, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, told the ministers that “there is a difference between release of funds and cash-backing of releases”, insisting that “while we hope that this N54 billion release was not hurriedly announced because you are appearing before us, we want to know when the much you have released will get to PenCom and pensioners”.
He lamented a situation where the FG treated pension in pits and bits as though it is a capital expenditure.
“No, pension obligations should be recurrent and in fact even be on first line charge because it is a kind of salary for vulnerable members of our society who have served this country”, he reiterated.
Standing with his colleagues, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara, explained how he personally met with the president over the matter and how the president' immediate intervention led to the release of N54 billion.
Dogara said the president kept his words when he promised to provide bailout funds to states for payment of backlog of salaries and would also keep his words to clear this pension arrears.‎
“I don't know where you got the money to bail out the states from. But wherever you got the money from, that is where we are going to get the money to solve this problem. And for the ministers who are representatives of the president, I believe you won't make him (Buhari) break his words because his words are cherished. I want to believe this will be the last intervention we will be having with regard to the issue of pensions in this country. That is my charge.” The speaker told the ministers.
We wait for you in 2019
When he was given the opportunity to speak on behalf of Nigerian pensioners, the President of the National Union of Pensioners, Dr. Abel Afolayan, who was also admitted into the House Chamber along with a number of the elderly retirees, thanked President Buhari, the House of Representatives, the Hon. Dogara for their concern over pensioners' plights.
He, however, set the floor on a laughter galore when he told the ruling party to keep its promises as “2019 would soon be here”.
The octogenarian said: “2019 is coming. We have thousands of votes. Some of us have four wives and three wives, but I have one wife. We should start seeing the payment by next month”.
Although the mention of 2019 sent the entire House into laughter, it nevertheless sent the needed message to the politicans, especially the ruling party, that pension matters had become an election decider and that the senior citizens were now out to mobilise for or against politicians, depending on how far they go in paying them their benefits.

Cribbin's Lake men "getting there slowly" 15 February 2017
Westmeath manager Tom Cribbin.

Steady improvement is the objective for Westmeath football manager Tom Cribbin.
Having drawn their league opener at home to Carlow, the midlanders got their Division Four promotion hopes back on track with a nine-point victory in Limerick last weekend.
"The performance was better. We have to get consistent in our performance and if we get that we will slowly get better in each game and we will get to where we need to be," Cribbin told The Westmeath Independent.
"Every single week, it's about trying to improve. We have to improve, we have to get consistency and we have to try and get it for 70 minutes.
"It's great to get a win. We needed a win badly after the last day. We're still probably not flowing properly, even though it was a good score, but we have a few issues that we are dealing with and we are getting there slowly."

MONDAY'S $800 million Federal Government commitment to fund and fast-track the Gympie Bypass, also known as Section D, between Woondum and Curra, would add to the $200 million the Queensland Government had committed to the project during its 2017 election campaign.

RACQ head of public policy Rebecca Michael said the project would be critical in saving hundreds of lives and would also reduce the risk of flood on one of the State's busiest roads.

"It's so important we get this bypass around Gympie as soon as possible because we've already lost too many lives on the Cooroy to Curra stretch. This road is also very susceptible to flooding and can force freight to a standstill during weather events,” Dr Michael said.

Dr Michael said despite the funding announcement, RACQ remained concerned about the lack of detail from both the State and Federal governments around the Bruce Highway Trust.

"Despite the Bruce Highway Trust being touted by the Queensland Government in its election campaign, we still have no idea on how this trust is going to work. At the moment, it's really nothing more than a bunch of commitments that are dependent on federal funding,” she said.

According to TMZ, Meek Mill is a free man and will be released from prison today, April, 24th. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overruled Judge Genece Brinkley's poor decision to keep Meek Mill behind bars. The unfair judge was holding a personal grudge against Meek Mill. Prosecutors asked that his conviction be overturned because of a dirty cop. Meek Mill thanked God, Jay-Z, his family, his friends, his attorneys, and more in a statement to TMZ.
“I'd like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time.”
“While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive.”
Meek adds, “To the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice – not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct. Although I'm blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump administration officials and members of Congress are in talks over including federal funding in a spending bill likely to be voted on this week for a new train tunnel under the Hudson River connecting New York City and New Jersey, three people briefed on the talks said.
At issue is the Gateway project, which would build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River to replace the existing century-old tunnel that is relied on by both Amtrak for its busy Northeast Corridor Service and New Jersey Transit commuter trains.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other Republicans have said that President Donald Trump has threatened to veto a funding bill if it included funding for the $30 billion Gateway project.
But negotiators in Congress and Trump administration officials have been in talks since the weekend over the project's status in an omnibus measure, the people briefed on the talks said.
Republicans in the House of Representatives are set to meet later on Monday to talk about the bill to fund the government through the end of September. A vote is expected on Wednesday, the people said, but the timing could slip. The government's current funding authorization expires March 23.
In July, a House panel backed $900 million in new funding for the tunnel, which backers say is essential for transportation in the northeast United States. Proponents have described the language in the earlier measure as ensuring the funding for the project as well as a significant portion of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor $328 million in funding would be used for Gateway.
One possibility is a significant portion of the $900 million may remain in the bill, but the language overseeing the funding in several programs may be changed, which would make Gateway eligible but not certain to receive funding, the people said.
Chao has repeatedly said that New York and New Jersey must provide direct funding for the project and not rely on federal loans for their share of the project costs.
"New York and New Jersey are two of the richest states in the country. ... They need to step up," Chao said earlier this month.
In addition to funding a new tunnel, the project would replace the Portal North Bridge in New Jersey, which is a source of many trains delays, and rebuild the North River Tunnel that connects New Jersey and New York's Penn Station.
The project focuses on a 10-mile segment of the Northeast Corridor, which carries over 200,000 Amtrak and New Jersey Transit passengers a day.
Trump's opposition to the project angered Democrats and some Republicans. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York blocked many of Trump's key transportation nominees for months over the issue before relenting last month.
Failure of the lines in the current tunnel, which was heavily damaged during 2012's Superstorm Sandy, could come within a decade and would hobble commuting in the metropolitan area that produces 10 percent of the country's economic output.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The newest generation of the Kennedy political dynasty will be introduced to a national audience Tuesday night as he delivers the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union.
Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a 37-year-old Massachusetts congressman and grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, says Democrats should focus on the economic worries of working-class voters who bolted the party in the 2016 elections.
To drive home the message, Kennedy will deliver his speech at a vocational high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, a gritty former textile hub 55 miles (89 kilometers) south of Boston.
"From health care to economic justice to civil rights, the Democratic agenda stands in powerful contrast to President Trump's broken promises to American families," Kennedy said in a statement, adding that his speech will be "guided by a simple belief that equality and economic dignity should be afforded to every American."
Kennedy, the red-haired son of former Rep. Joe Kennedy II, D-Mass., was elected to the House in 2012, returning the family to Congress two years after the retirement of Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who is the son of Joe Kennedy III's great-uncle Ted.
Besides his famous last name, Joe Kennedy III also is among a wave of younger Democrats in a caucus whose three top leaders are all in their 70s.
A former Peace Corps volunteer, Kennedy was an assistant district attorney in two Massachusetts districts before being elected to Congress. He has focused on economic and social justice in Congress and has advocated on behalf of vocational schools and community colleges and championed issues such as transgender rights and marriage equality.
To illustrate that message, Kennedy has invited Staff Sgt. Patricia King, a transgender infantry solider, to represent him at the State of the Union. King, an 18-year Army veteran, has twice been deployed to Afghanistan and has been awarded the Bronze Star.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Kennedy "a relentless fighter for working Americans" and said he "profoundly understands the challenges facing hard-working men and women across the country."
Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the campaign arm of House Republicans, could not conceal his glee as he welcomed the latest Kennedy as the voice of Democrats.
"Democrats using the multi-millionaire scion of a political dynasty as the face of their party shows they've learned absolutely nothing," Gorman said in an email, adding that the only way to give the GOP an easier target would be for Kennedy to make the speech "live from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis," Massachusetts.
Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley said Kennedy will focus on education and the importance of preparing future generations for jobs while also pointing out "how Republicans fall short, and certainly the president."
Kennedy "will be talking to the forgotten men and women — the people the president says he is speaking to but since has shown he has little or no regard for," said Crowley, D-N.Y.
The speech is an opportunity for the three-term lawmaker to "step out a bit and make his own mark" in national politics, said Crowley, who recommended Kennedy for the role.
"He's young, talented and smart. He's got a great last name, but on his own, he's a wonderful man and that will come through as well," Crowley said. "The sky's the limit for him, frankly."
Before this speech, Kennedy's best-known moment was a 2017 speech criticizing House Speaker Paul Ryan for defending the GOP effort to repeal former President Barack Obama's health care law as "an act of mercy."
Kennedy called the GOP effort "an act of malice" in a late-night speech that was viewed millions of times on social media.
Kennedy's speech will be followed by a Spanish-language response delivered by Elizabeth Guzman, one of the first Latinas elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.
OAKLAND, Calif. -- On Wednesday during exit interviews, Kevin Durant dismissed the notion that the Golden State Warriors are constructed as a superteam. In making his point, he directed attention to the organization's drafting prowess and recruiting targets rather than just focusing on the fact that the team has four All-Stars in himself, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.
"First of all, if everybody wanted Steph, he would have been the No. 1 pick," Durant said. "A lot of people passed on him. A lot of people doubted Steph, saying he wasn't going to be this good. Klay Thompson, he was just supposed to be this OK shooter in the league, like that's what you thought of Klay Thompson when he came in. Draymond, nobody wanted him. He was a 6-5 power forward. [They said] he couldn't play in the league, he couldn't start in the NBA. Shaun Livingston had a crazy knee injury.
"Nobody wanted him. Nobody thought that he would get back to being Shaun Livingston. Andre Iguodala, he got traded a couple of times. Nobody wanted him. A lot of people didn't expect these guys to be where they are today. Superteam? No, we just work extremely well together. Coach puts us in position to maximize our strengths."
Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James also took exception to the superteam moniker. After the Game 5 loss in the 2017 NBA Finals, he stated that he was never a part of a superteam.
"I don't believe I've played for a superteam," James said. "I don't believe in that. I don't believe we're a superteam here."
Golden State has a cumulative 207-39 record in the last three regular seasons. In his lone season with the team, Durant said it's the selflessness that stands out to him. He cited that, not just their talent, in explaining why the Warriors are so successful.
"We make each other better and it's not about who gets the credit," Durant said. "It's like, really just about having fun playing ball and let's see how we can win together and that alone just helps the ego. So, sorry I went on a little rant, but that's how I feel about the team. A lot of these guys beat the odds and came out and played a great brand of basketball and put the team first. That should be rewarded, and it did get rewarded with a championship."
BLOWHARD COPS
Victorian police officers faked more than 250,000 roadside breath tests over a five-and-a-half year period, an internal investigation has revealed.
The Age reports that roughly 258,000 alcohol breath tests, or about 1.5% of the total 17.7 million tests, were falsified over the time period out of a combination of police apathy and need to meet targets. Victoria Police were tipped off late last year from unusually quick breathalysing data and believes officers, in what the agency's new head of Professional Standards Command has labelled a breach of community trust, may have circumvented the system by blowing into breathalysers themselves.
THE LATEST FROM LIVE EXPORTS
Australian cattle have been shown arriving in Israel while covered in faeces, in the latest footage of the live export industry leaked by activists.
The Adelaide Advertiser ($) reports that the group Israel Against Live Shipments recorded cattle loaded onto the controversial live export ship Bader III from Adelaide and Fremantle, then entering Eilat covered in faeces and enduring a 44-degree heatwave. The Federal Agriculture Department spokesperson has since rejected the group's claims of mistreatment, saying “the footage does not reflect the conditions of the cattle throughout the journey” and that the animals were washed down every second day.

Although the subject is frequently in the news and being talked about the diagnostics coined by doctors, professors and scientists in relation to it are often disconnected from my life, and the lives of autistic adults and children. All the puzzling terms, labels and categories can make it harder for us to receive help when we need it and harder for the rest of the world to understand us.”
Commercial TV's rare leadership on Roseanne is a breath of fresh air — Liz Giuffre (The Conversation): “Roseanne has described her ‘bad joke' as being ‘in poor taste'. However, there is more to consider than ‘bad' and ‘taste' here. In fact, it was not actually a joke at all. Rather, it was a power exchange designed to directly belittle, marginalise and insult based on race. Racism causes actual harm.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The American workplace is grueling, stressful and surprisingly hostile.
So concludes an in-depth study of 3,066 U.S. workers by the Rand Corp., Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Los Angeles. Among the findings:
Nearly one in five workers — a share the study calls “disturbingly high” — say they face a hostile or threatening environment at work, which can include sexual harassment and bullying. Workers who have to face customers endure a disproportionate share of abuse.
Nearly 55 percent say they face “unpleasant and potentially hazardous” conditions.
Nearly three quarters say they spend at least a fourth of their time on the job in “intense or repetitive physical” labor. “I was surprised at how physically demanding jobs were,” says lead author Nicole Maestas, a Harvard Medical School economist.
Telecommuting is rare: 78 percent say they are required to be present in their workplace during working hours.
Only 38 percent say their jobs offer good prospects for advancement. And the older they get, the less optimistic they become.
About half say they work on their own time to meet the demands of their job.
“Wow — (work) is pretty taxing place for many people,” Maestas says. “I was surprised by how pressured and hectic the workplace is.”
In many cases, less-educated workers endure tougher working conditions. For example, fewer than half of men without college degrees can take a break whenever they want to, compared to more than 76 percent of men with college degrees. Likewise, nearly 68 percent of men without degrees spend at least a fourth of their time moving heavy loads.
Maestas wonders whether toxic working conditions are keeping Americans out of the labor force. The percentage of Americans who are working or looking for work — 62.9 percent in July — has not returned to pre-recession levels and is well below its 2000 peak of 67.3 percent.
The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low, and many employers complain they can't fill jobs.
“There's a message for employers here,” Maestas says. “Working conditions really do matter.”
Not everything about American workplaces is grim. Workers enjoy considerable autonomy: more than 80 percent say they get to solve problems and try out their own ideas. Moreover, 58 percent say their bosses are supportive, and 56 percent say they have good friends at work.
The first-time survey of Americans ages 25-71 was carried out in 2015. It is similar to a long-running European survey, and researchers plan to conduct another survey next year and eventually to draw comparisons between U.S. and European working conditions.

Arctic Voyage Finds Global Warming Impact on Ice, Animals
The email arrived in mid-June, seeking to explode any notion that global warming might turn our Arctic expedition into a summer cruise.
"The most important piece of clothing to pack is good, sturdy and warm boots. There is going to be snow and ice on the deck of the icebreaker," it read. "Quality boots are key."
The Associated Press was joining international researchers on a month-long, 10,000 kilometer (6,200-mile) journey to document the impact of climate change on the forbidding ice and frigid waters of the Far North. But once the ship entered the fabled Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific, there would be nowhere to stop for supplies, no port to shelter in and no help for hundreds of miles if things went wrong. A change in the weather might cause the mercury to drop suddenly or push the polar pack into the Canadian Archipelago, creating a sea of rock-hard ice.
So as we packed our bags, in went the heavy jackets, insulated trousers, hats, mittens, woolen sweaters and the heavy, fur-lined boots.
Global warming or not, it was best to come prepared.
If parts of the planet are becoming like a furnace because of global warming, then the Arctic is best described as the world's air-conditioning unit. The frozen north plays a crucial role in cooling the rest of the planet while reflecting some of the sun's heat back into space.
Yet for several decades, satellite pictures have shown a dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice that is already affecting the lives of humans and animals in the region, from Inuit communities to polar bears. Experts predict that the impact of melting sea ice will be felt across the northern hemisphere, altering ocean currents and causing freak weather as far south as Florida or France.
"Things are changing in the Arctic, and that is changing things everywhere else," said David 'Duke' Snider, the seasoned mariner responsible for navigating the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica through the Northwest Passage last month.
Researchers on the trip sought a first-hand view of the effects of global warming already seen from space. Even the dates of the journey were a clue: The ship departed Vancouver in early July and arrived in Nuuk, Greenland on July 29th, the earliest transit ever of a region that isn't usually navigable until later in the year.
As it made its way through the North Pacific -- passing Chinese cargo ships, Alaskan fishing boats and the occasional far-off whale -- members of the expedition soaked up the sun in anticipation of freezing weeks to come.
Twelve days after the ship had left Vancouver, the ice appeared out of nowhere.
At first, lone floes bobbed on the waves like mangled lumps of Styrofoam. By the time Nordica reached Point Barrow, on Alaska's northernmost tip, the sea was swarming with ice.
Snider recalled that when he started guiding ships through Arctic waters more than 30 years ago, the ice pack in mid-July would have stretched 50 miles farther southwest. Back then, a ship also would have encountered much thicker, blueish ice that had survived several summer melts, becoming hard as concrete in the process, he said.
He likened this year's ice to a sea of porridge with a few hard chunks -- no match for the nimble 13,000-ton Nordica.
Since the first orbital images were taken in 1979, Arctic sea ice coverage during the summer has dropped by an average of about 34,000 square miles each year -- almost the surface area of Maine or the country of Serbia. More recent data show that not only is its surface area shrinking, but the ice that's left is getting thinner too. Snider said he has seen the ice cover reduced in both concentration and thickness.
The melting ice is one reason why modern ships have an easier time going through the Northwest Passage, 111 years after Norwegian adventurer Roald Amundsen achieved the first transit. Early explorers found themselves blinded by harsh sunlight reflecting off a desert of white, confused by mirages that give the illusion of giant ice cliffs all around, and thrown off course by the proximity of the North Pole distorting their compass readings.
Modern mariners can get daily satellite snapshots of the ice and precise GPS locations that help them dodge dangerous shallows. But technology can be fickle. After two weeks at sea the ship's fragile Internet connection went down for six days: no emails, no Google, no new satellite pictures to preview the route ahead.
The outdoor thermometer indicated a temperature of 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8.3 Celsius), but in the never-setting sun of an Arctic summer it felt more like 60 F. Days blurred into nights. Distant smoke from Cape Bathurst signaled slow-burning shale fires, while giant white golf balls indicated the remains of Cold War radar stations.
At one point a row of shacks appeared on a hill. As the ship passed by Cambridge Bay -- home to Canada's High Arctic Research Station -- a brief cellphone signal flickered to life, allowing one homesick sailor to make a tearful call to his family.
The Finnish crew, meanwhile, took solace in the creature comforts of home, such as the on-board sauna and reindeer roast on Saturdays.
Even in their bunks, those on board heard the constant churning of ice as the ship plowed through the debris rolling beneath the hull, thundering like hail on a tin roof.
As the icebreaker entered Victoria Strait, deep inside the Northwest Passage, we looked for a shadow moving in the distance or a flash of pale yellow in the expanse of white that would signal the presence of the world's largest land predator.
At last, a cry went out: "Nanuq, nanuq!"
Maatiusi Manning, an Inuit sailor, had spotted what everyone on board was hoping to see -- the first polar bear.
The 1,000-pound predators are at the top of a food chain that's being pummeled by global warming because of the immediate impact vanishing sea ice has on a range of animals and plants that depend on it.
"If we continue losing ice, we're going to lose species with it," said Paula von Weller, a field biologist who was on the trip.
No Arctic creatures have become more associated with climate change than polar bears. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in January that about 26,000 specimens remain in the wild. Population counts of polar bears are notoriously difficult, and researchers are unsure how much their numbers have changed in recent years. But the Fish and Wildlife Service warned that melting sea ice is robbing the bear of its natural hunting ground for seals and other prey.
While some polar bears are expected to follow the retreating ice northward, others will head south, where they will come into greater contact with humans -- encounters that are unlikely to end well for the bears.
Still, being the poster child of Arctic wildlife may help the polar bear. Sightings are a highlight for adventure tourists who are flocking to Arctic cruises in increasing numbers.
Last year, the hottest on record in the Arctic, the Crystal Serenity took 1,100 high-paying guests on a cruise of the Northwest Passage, prompting environmentalists to warn of an Arctic tourism rush that could disrupt wildlife habitat. Crystal Cruises says it works closely with local guides, marine biologists and conservationists to ensure wildlife isn't harmed.
Von Weller said there are benefits to people seeing the region and its animals themselves.
"People are so far removed from the Arctic that they don't understand it, they don't know it and they don't love it," she said. "I think it's important for people to see what's here and to fall in love with it and have a bond and want to protect it."
That love may need to extend further down the food chain if the fragile ecosystem in the Arctic continues to fall apart. Some of the animals highly associated with the ice are not going to be able to adapt in a reasonable amount of time to keep up with climate change, Weller said.
"The walrus, for example, may spend more time on the mainland. They're very prone to disturbance so that's not a good place for walrus to be," said von Weller.
Research published four years ago rang alarms bells about the future of the red king crab -- a big earner for Alaska's fishing industry -- because rising levels of carbon dioxide, a driver of global warming, are making oceans more acidic. Scientists found that juvenile crabs exposed to levels of acidification predicted for the future grew more slowly and were more likely to die.
Algae that cling to the underside of sea ice are also losing their habitat. If they vanish, the impact will be felt all the way up the food chain. Copepods, a type of zooplankton that eats algae, will lose their source of food. The tiny crustaceans in turn are prey for fish, whales and birds.
Meanwhile, new rivals from the south are already arriving in the Arctic as waters warm. Orca have been observed traveling further north in search of food in recent years, and some wildlife experts predict they will become the main seal predator in the coming decades, replacing polar bears.
Humans are also increasingly venturing into the Arctic in search of untapped deposits of minerals and fossil fuels -- posing a threat to animals. The potential for oil spills from platforms and tankers operating in remote locations has been a major cause for concern among environmentalists since the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska killed a quarter of a million seabirds, as well as hundreds of seals and sea otters. Simply getting the necessary emergency response ships to an Arctic spill would be a challenge, while cleaning oil off sea ice would likely take months.
Last month, Canada's supreme court ruled in favor of the Clyde River community of Baffin Island, which is fighting the proposed seismic blasts used by oil companies to map the sea floor. The Inuit fear that the loud underwater noise caused by the blasts could disorient marine mammals such as whales that depend on sound to communicate, and affect the reproductive cycles of fish and shrimp stocks.
The Inuit and other local peoples are already feeling the impact of global warming because they rely on frozen waterways to reach hunting grounds or relatives on other islands. But some say it will not be all bad: Cruise ships offer potential revenue to those Inuit communities willing to engage with tourists.
The absence of sea ice for longer periods each summer, meanwhile, will allow boats to supply villages and mines for longer periods of the year. Where it used to be a hard and fast rule that ships had to be out of the Northwest Passage by Sept. 28, the operating season now stretches beyond October.
Tiina Jaaskelainen, a researcher at the Hanken School of Economics in Finland who was on board the icebreaker, said responding to these changes will require a better understanding of the social impact rather than just the science of climate change.
"Inuit communities need to be involved in planning each use of the passage and the Arctic in general," she said. "It's important they can play an active role in the region's economic development, while good governance may enable local communities to also maintain their traditions."
Upon entering the Atlantic, the FM radios aboard Nordica began picking up local stations again, including one that played David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust.' Nordica reached Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, after 24 days.
"The fact that we were able to plan and execute this transit so efficiently says something about the changes in the ice," said Scott Joblin, an expert on maritime and polar law from Australian National University in Canberra who studies the legal implications of climate change in the Arctic.
Scientists believe there is no way to reverse the decline in Arctic sea ice in the foreseeable future. Even in the best-case scenario envisaged by the 2015 Paris climate accord, sea ice will largely vanish from the Arctic during the summer within the coming decades.
In the end, the route that foiled countless explorers claimed little more than a camera and a drone.
But we did get a taste of the warming Arctic: Those heavy fur-lined boots never got used.

Spotify announced that it finally added producer and song-writer credits to its streaming platform, satisfying a frequent complaint from both users, artists, and music publishers. According to a post on Spotify's site, users can now right-click on a track and find information on songwriters and producers via the “Show Credits” option. With that in mind, the company asked for patience from listeners as they get the bugs worked out.
“We realize some of the label-provided credits are incomplete or may contain inaccuracies, but this is just the first step in displaying songwriter credits on Spotify,” the statement read. “The feature will continually evolve to become more efficient, provide better functionality, and incorporate more information from industry partners over time.”
Some of the producers behind the biggest names in pop gave the new feature thumbs up. From Spotify:
Songwriter Ali Tamposi (Justin Bieber, Kelly Clarkson, Camila Cabello, and others) said, “We're all artists in our own right, and every artist appreciates being recognized for their hard work. I'm excited and grateful to see this new feature on Spotify.” Songwriter Frank Dukes (Camila Cabello, Lorde, and more) added, “It's amazing to see Spotify give the unsung heroes of music some recognition on their platform. Definitely a step in the right direction.”
The next step in that right direction presumably includes increasing royalty payouts from streaming services to the musicians and producers whose work comprises the content from which sites like Spotify profit.
The platform filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.
UPDATE: Users of the mobile app will have to be especially patient as the feature is only available on desktop for now.
“This is just the first iteration of the Credits feature,” a Spotify rep told Spin.”We are constantly experimenting with new ways to make this feature more efficient and provide better functionality.”
Anyone having trouble finding the feature may want to try updating Spotify and then restarting the platform.
Eagles head coach Doug Pederson delivered the news no one wanted to hear during his press conference Monday at the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia, Pa.: starting quarterback Carson Wentz is out for the rest of the season with a torn ACL in his left knee.
Doug Pederson says Carson Wentz has a torn ACL. #Eagles -- Eliot Shorr-Parks (@EliotShorrParks) December 11, 2017
Out for the season, according to Doug Pederson. -- Reuben Frank (@RoobNBCS) December 11, 2017
Doug Pederson won't put any timetable on Wentz's return (in regards to next year). #Eagles -- Eliot Shorr-Parks (@EliotShorrParks) December 11, 2017
Wentz went down Sunday in the Eagles' 43-35 win against the Los Angeles Rams. Wentz left the game after throwing for 291 yards and four touchdowns. In his place, backup QB Nick Foles came on and finished off the game, clinching the NFC East division title in the process.
The win, when combined with the Minnesota Vikings' loss Sunday to the Carolina Panthers, moved the Eagles back into first place in the NFC. If the Eagles can hold onto the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the road to the Super Bowl will go through Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.
8 backup QB options
But that task will be much tougher without Wentz, who was having an MVP-caliber season.
His final numbers for 2017: 3,296 yards, 33 touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a passer rating of 101.9
The 33 touchdown passes lead the NFL through Sunday's Week 14 games.
So now the playoff push falls to Foles, who's no stranger to the huddle. For his career, Foles is 20-16 as a starter, with 56 touchdown passes and 27 interceptions.
In 2013, under first-year head coach Chip Kelly, Foles went 8-2 as the starter, throwing 27 touchdown passes and just two interceptions while leading the Eagles to a division title.
Foles and the Eagles lost to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round, 26-24.

For all its perks, celebrity has its downside — and Jessica Chastain experienced it with her weekend wedding.
The Martian actress, 40, married her longtime beau, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, in Treviso, Italy, on Saturday. He comes from one of Italy's most noble families and the star-studded wedding took place at their 17th-century Villa Tiepolo Passi estate, which is located outside of Venice. The redhead looked looked gorgeous in a custom dress made by Italian designer Riccardo Tisci. However, she wishes you didn't know anything about her wedding — or dress.
“Did you hear? Im off the market,” Chastain — who has largely kept her romance, which began in 2012, private — tweeted on Tuesday. “Gianluca & I got married! We wanted privacy & aren't selling photos, but Ill post something in the future.”
But along with that was an image with a longer statement that said: “Thank you for all the sweet comments about my wedding. I love you and it was a beautiful day. I am going to ask you to please stop sharing those photos. Helicopters disregarded a nofly zone & took the pics during the ceremony. Everytime I see them Im reminded of the insensitivity of that moment. I promise you that I will share pics with you in the future, but I would prefer to share photos that celebrate love not intrusion.”

Paparazzo photos from Chastain's wedding started circulating on Monday — and even we posted them because she looked gorgeous. Here's hoping that her honeymoon is a more private affair, and she's able to share as much or as little about both that she wants.

An out-of-control car careened Friday afternoon into the Verizon store and then into neighboring Holiday Hair off South 25th Street in Palmer Township.
Everyone inside the Palmer Town Center businesses escaped injury, township fire Assistant Chief Jim Alercia said.
It occurred about 4:20 p.m. as multiple hairdressers were with customers inside the salon, Alercia said.
"All patrons having their hair done were on the opposite side of where the car traveled, missing them by inches," he said from the scene. "The driver sustained minor injuries."

Milwaukee is getting forward Jabari Parker back just as its losing guard Malcolm Brogdon.
The Bucks announced Friday that Brogdon suffered a partially torn quadriceps tendon in the loss at Minnesota Thursday night and would be out 6-to-8 weeks. The injury comes on the heels of guard Eric Bledsoe missing the matchup with the Timberwolves because of an ankle injury.
Advertisement
The 2017 NBA Rookie of the Year, Brogdon was averaging 13.3 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists for Milwaukee this season.
His absence likely means a further increase in minutes for rookie Sterling Brown and veteran Matthew Dellavedova in the team's backcourt.
Milwaukee had been looking forward to getting its entire preferred rotation on the floor together for the first time in several years with Parker's return from a torn ACL planned for Friday night against the New York Knicks. That plan will apparently have to wait another month and a half or so.

NAFDAC boosts SMEs with registration fee waiver
NATIONAL Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has waived 50 percent of the registration fee for locally manufactured products in a move aimed at incentivising the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) sub-sector.
Abubakar Jimoh, NAFDAC spokesperson, in a statement, said the measure was in response to Federal Government's policy to promote local manufacturing companies in order to boost the domestic economy.
He explained that the new policy under the leadership of the agency's acting Director-General, Mrs. Yetunde Oni, would go a long way to promote economic development.
Jimoh noted that in the past, a lot of people and some licensed consultants had extorted money from innocent Nigerians in the name of NAFDAC registration. “Sometime back, we discovered that a lot of people were extorting money from Nigerians for registration fee of products. We decided to license some consultants who are professionals. But those unscrupulous elements fizzled into the consultancy firm that registered with us and continued their extortion from potential entrepreneurs. They collect as much as N250,000 to N300,000 for registration against official fee of less than N50,000, claiming that part of the money will be used to settle NAFDAC officials. The agency has taken decision to stop them after the expiration of their licenses; we will stop them and deal directly with intending manufacturers,” he said.
The NAFDAC spokesperson explained that in the last seven years, the former NAFDAC Director-General, Dr Paul Orhi, introduced a policy that all young graduates willing to establish businesses would be given waiver.
He said that the policy was still in existence but young graduates from NYSC were not taking advantage of the policy. He further noted that NAFDAC recently established a Small Business Desk to guide people going into SMEs on how to set up their small factories.

Anyone who gets to see the total solar eclipse on August 21 will be lucky — and humanity is lucky to live on a planet that even has this kind of celestial event.
Mercury and Venus, after all, don't even have moons. Mars has a couple, but they're too small to completely blot out the sun. Gas giants like Jupiter do have big moons, but they don't have solid surfaces where you could stand and enjoy an eclipse.
And, even with solid land and a moon, Earth only gets its gorgeous total solar eclipses because of a cosmic coincidence.
"They appear to be the same size because of their distance away from us," explains Amber Porter, an astronomer at Clemson University, which is in the path of the upcoming eclipse. The diameter of Earth's moon is about 400 times smaller than the diameter of the sun, but "even though the moon is about 400 times smaller than the sun, it's about 400 times closer to us here on Earth, which is how that perfect kind of magic happens."
Because of this quirk, the tiny moon can obscure the entire face of the sun and reveal its eerie corona, at least right now. In the past, Earth's eclipses did not look like this.
"The size of the sun hasn't really changed over the age of Earth, but the moon has been moving away from Earth over eons. So in the past it looked bigger," says Matija Cuk, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute.
The moon is still moving away from Earth, he says. Every year, it shifts outward about an inch-and-half.
"So actually for billions of years you can have a total eclipse, but this very evenly matched eclipse, where it is barely total, that happens for a relatively short amount of time," says Cuk.
In only about 600 million years, the moon will look small enough that it no longer completely covers the sun, and whoever is left on Earth won't see any more total solar eclipses. So, get them while you can.
A large wildfire north of Athens is threatening homes as it sweeps through pine forest for a second day, uncontained due to high winds.
Fire Service officials two planes and five helicopters are fighting the blaze at Varnava, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the Greek capital, while a main road in the area is closed to traffic to give fire trucks better access.
The fire burned out of control for a second day Monday after damaging at least 20 homes the previous day and forcing the evacuation of holiday campsites used in the area for children's vacations.
No one was hurt, and Fire Service spokeswoman Brigade Manager Stavroula Maliri described all the evacuations as precautionary.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) – A bill advancing in the General Assembly would require health insurance companies to cover a 12-month supply of prescription birth control.A Senate committee approved the measure Monday. It has already passed the House of Delegates with only one no vote.The bill's sponsor, Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, says it will ease a burden for women and prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Three physicians testified in support of the measure.The bill doesn't require that providers write a 12-month prescription.Opponents, including insurance industry representatives, said the bill could lead to waste.
JEFFERSON CITY, Tenn.—With a crowd that stretched the greater portion of the formerly known College Street, the Jefferson City City Council officially renamed the path Ken Sparks Way in honor of former Carson-Newman football coach Ken Sparks Tuesday afternoon on the steps of Stokely Memorial Cafeteria.
The street that runs right through the heart of campus from the intramural fields on the west side to where it intersects Branner Avenue on the east side and all the way in front of Stokely Memorial Cafeteria right before it ends at the entrance of the Maddox Student Activity Center will now don the name of the fifth-winningest football coach in NCAA history.
Jefferson City's City Council, represented by Mayor Mark Potts, Vice-Mayor Mitch Cain, Councilmen Rocky Melton and Kevin Bunch as well as Councilwoman Eileen Combs, made the change final during the resolution's second reading during its meeting on Feb. 6.
Though the name change has been a permanent fixture for the street for the past seven days, the releasing of the name change was made official with a ceremony Tuesday afternoon with hundreds of former and current student-athletes, coaches, C-N faculty and residents of Jefferson City.
“What Ken wants said more than anything else here today is that Jesus Christ is Lord,” Carson-Newman President Randall O'Brien said during the ceremony. “When we all discussed what we wanted the name of this street to read that honors Ken, several names were thrown around. In the end, the name was decided on Ken Sparks Way and I love that because you built your football program the way Jesus Christ would have wanted you to.
“The Ken Sparks way is to put Jesus Christ first. I believe that speaks more for you and of anything else we could have settled on. That is going to be the name of this street and we are so excited about that.”
Following remarks made by the President of the University, Jefferson City's Mayor, Mark Potts, took the microphone to say a few words on behalf of the council.
“This street runs through the heart of Jefferson City and through the heart of Carson-Newman,” Potts said. “The thing that keeps each and every one of us alive is the heart and I am just so glad to know that Ken Sparks Way will be in the heart of Jefferson City. As Jefferson City is a part of the Carson-Newman family, we want to honor you with this.
“Everyone immediately decided that this was a great idea to name this street Ken Sparks Way. We just want to say thank you and that we appreciate everything you have done for this campus and our community.”
C-N Athletic Director Allen Morgan also took the time to say a few words on the behalf of the Jefferson City residents to thank and honor Sparks once again for the impact he has made in the lives of so many throughout his 37-year tenure as the Eagle football coach.
“If I know you as well as I think I know you, I think you would have preferred this name to be Christ Way,” Morgan said. “That is indeed what it is. It's Christ Way—Ken Sparks Way. Coach exemplifies what Christ wants us to be each and every day. Every time I and the rest of the Jefferson City residents drive through this road and we see Ken Sparks Way, we know that it's Christ's Way.”
When the time finally came for Sparks to say a few works, the former coach closed the ceremony by challenging the audience, much like he did for nearly four decades with his teams on the gridiron. With the street that now bears his name, Sparks urged the crowd to live in a way that Christ would smile on.
“You know I'm going to make a request and I want you to honor this request,” Sparks said. “When you walk up and down this street or go in the buildings along this street, I want us to do one thing. We need to honor the God who has all the answers we are looking for. I want us to honor the God who has got everything we need in life.
“Wouldn't it be something that when we are walking up and down this street, if God would say ‘I'm getting lifted up.' That is the thing that I request out of you—that we lift the Almighty up.”
Sparks announced his retirement on Nov. 14 as he finished his Carson-Newman career after 37 seasons, 338 wins, 99 losses and two ties with a career winning percentage of .7699 that is the fourth-highest in college football history while the 338 victories amount to the fifth-best total nationally.
The Eagles won five NAIA National Titles and played for it six times under the coach. A move to NCAA Division II saw the Eagles play for the D-II National Title three times with a semifinalist season in 2009.
Sparks has recorded 21 South Atlantic Conference Championships, 25 NCAA or NAIA playoff appearances and was inducted into the inaugural NCAA Division II Hall of Fame Coaches Class in 2010 along with Northwest Missouri State's Mel Tjeerdsma and West Alabama's Bobby Wallace.
The lifelong Eagle is also a member of the South Atlantic Conference Hall of Fame, the Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame, the Carson-Newman Athletic Hall of Fame, the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and the NAIA Hall of Fame.
Throughout his life, Sparks has been honored with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes Lifetime Achievement Award and National Coach of the Year. In 2002, Sparks received the All-American Football Foundation's Johnny Vaught Lifetime Achievement Award.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, Sparks was surrounded by family, coaches and the Jefferson City City Council as the honoree cut the opening-ribbon on what hence forth will be known as the Ken Sparks Way.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on efforts in Congress to reach a deal on a $1.3 trillion spending bill (all times local):
2:40 p.m.
President Donald Trump has told two Republican senators that he supports adding proposals to a huge spending bill that would provide billions in federal subsidies to insurers to help curb health care premium increases.
Two congressional sources said Trump offered that support in a Saturday call with GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Maine's Susan Collins.
Alexander and Collins are among Republicans who want to restore federal payments to insurers that Trump halted last fall that reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for lower-earning customers. They'd also create a $30 billion, three-year program to help carriers afford to cover their sickest, most expensive clients.
Both proposals are in peril. Democrats oppose GOP language forbidding the federal money from being used to finance abortions.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the call publicly.

Congressional Democrats have rejected a White House bid to extend protections for so-called Dreamer immigrants in exchange for $25 billion in funding for President Donald Trump's long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.
The development came as talks continued on a massive $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill.
Aides said efforts to use the measure as a vehicle to extend protections for young immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or DACA, appeared likely to fail.
Trump killed the Obama-era program in September, but a court decision has essentially left it in place, for now.
The White House Sunday proposed a 30-month extension of DACA protections in exchange for $25 billion for Trump's border wall - but Democrats demanded protections for a broader pool of immigrants.
The aides required anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing talks.

12:51 a.m.
Congressional leaders and the White House are pressing to strike an accord on a $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill.
Standing in the way are disputes over immigration, abortion and a massive New York-New Jersey rail project that pits President Donald Trump against his most powerful Democratic adversary, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
An agreement by Monday would pave the way for a House vote on Wednesday. Action is needed by midnight Friday to avert another government shutdown.
The measure carries political and policy victories for both sides. Republicans and Trump are winning a long-sought budget increase for the Pentagon while Democrats obtain funding for infrastructure, the opioid crisis and a wide swath of domestic programs.
Coupled with last year's tax cut measure, it heralds the return of trillion-dollar budget deficits.

A manhunt is underway for a person of interest in the North Dallas shooting that injured two police officers and a civilian at a Home Depot, authorities said.911 dispatchers received a call to go to the Home Depot shortly after 4:12 p.m., Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall said in a press conference Tuesday night. After the responding officers arrived, a subsequent call for assistance was made after the shooting began.Two Dallas Police officers were critically wounded, the Dallas Police Department posted on Twitter shortly after the shooting. A civilian who is a loss prevention officer for Home Depot was also shot, Hall said. His or her condition is unknown at this time, police said.Police were actively searching for the person of interest in a nearby wooded area on Tuesday afternoon. Authorities identified him as 29-year-old Armando Juarez, who possibly left the location in a white pickup truck.Juarez is to be considered and dangerous, Hall said, adding that it is unclear "how he was able to get a gun and shoot all three of the victims."Hall asked the community to contact police if they see Juarez or have any information on who and where he is.The officers were transported by the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where they are getting the "best possible care," Hall said.Hall did not release their names or an update on their conditions when speaking to the media out of respect for the families, she said.Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings described the aftermath of the shooting as a "two-front battle," referring to the victims' battles for their lives at the hospital as well as "the battle out in the community" to find the person of interest.The police department asked for prayers for the victims and their families."I want to ask each and every one of you for your prayers ... for our officers, for their families and for our entire DPD family, because we need you right now," Hall said. "Our hearts are very heavy."State, local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the scene.In 2016, five Dallas law enforcement officers were shot and killed and seven more injured after they were ambushed by 25-year-old former Army reservist Micah Xavier Johnson . Johnson later died in a standoff with police.Former Dallas Police Chief and ABC News contributor David Brown said the most recent shooting on two Dallas police officers is "too much to bear for one department in such a short time frame.""Once again, it sobers us to realize what officers walk into day in and day out, how quickly they can become victims," Rawlings said.

TAMPA, FL. — Governor Rick Scott has already declared that Florida's opioid crisis is a statewide emergency, and has announced plans to introduce legislation that will fight the deadly battle.
On Friday, the governor asked those on the front lines for feedback on his proposals.
Scott attended the Florida Medical Association's Opioid Summit, a day-long series of panel speakers who approach the crisis from all angles, from regulations and legal concerns, to solutions, strategies and practices for treating addicts. Scott says he wants them to address his proposed change in strategy when it comes to fighting the epidemic.
He recently announced he plans to propose several measures for the 2018-19 budget, including,
Placing a three-day limit on prescribed opioids, unless strict conditions are met for a seven-day supply
Requiring all healthcare professionals that prescribe or dispense medication to participate in the Florida Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, a statewide database that monitors controlled substance prescriptions
Additional reforms to fight unlicensed pain management clinics require continuing education courses on responsibly prescribing opioids and create new opportunities for federal grant funding.
HOT ROD Power Tour 2017 Is Presented By Chevrolet Performance And Driven By Continental Tire
Sometimes problems arise beyond the pre-planning, planning, care, and 20-plus years of everything that could go wrong at Power Tour having already happened, when plunging over 5000 cars through small burghs and major cities in America. Such was the case in Galesburg, Illinois, when between the routes being nailed down and the beginning of the 2017 Power Tour, bridge construction forced detours to all entering Galesburg, including the Power Tour faithful. But the police department came through with every officer on duty participating in directing traffic at each detour wrapping around town getting Power Tour participants on their merry ways faster and safer than without the fine work of the department. For that we thank the city and police department of Galesburg, Illinois.

A stuntwoman for the upcoming Deadpool sequel has died on set, PEOPLE confirms.
The unnamed stunt driver died during a motorcycle stunt, according to a statement by the Vancouver Police. Vancouver Police Department officers responded to the scene of the accident, along with officers from WorkSafeBC.
“Today, we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool,” the film's star, Ryan Reynolds tweeted. “We're heartbroken, shocked and devastated… but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment. My heart pours out to them — along with each and every person she touched in this world.”
This was the stunt driver's first film as a stunt performer, according to Deadline, which reports that she was a motorcross expert and was not wearing a helmet during the scene because her character does not wear a helmet.
“We are deeply saddened by the accident that occurred on the set of Deadpool 2 this morning,” 20th Century Fox says in a statement. “Our hearts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time.”
The Vancouver Sun reports that the accident occurred just after 8 a.m. on Monday. Witnesses tell the outlet that the woman lost control of her bike during a stunt, jumped a curb and crashed through a plate-glass window at Shaw Tower. She was reportedly treated by ambulance personnel but police say she died at the scene.
According to Metro News, the stunt driver narrowly missed hitting two pedestrians when she lost control of the bike.

An eye witness tells the outlet that the stunt driver completed several rehearsals of the stunt, which involved driving a motorcycle down two ramps across several stairs, earlier that morning.
“She came out, went down the two flights of stairs, and it looked like she kind of hit the throttle because she picked up speed,” Nathan Kramchynski told Metro News.
“She was going full throttle,” he added, noting that it appeared as if the driver “missed two pedestrians” during the failed stunt.
CTV News reports that the lights and sirens of the ambulance were not turned on as it pulled away with the stuntwoman onboard.

Reynolds, who's reprising his role as Deadpool in the sequel, tweeted a photo with members of the Vancouver Police Department last week, jokingly thanking them for their support in filming Spider-Man.

Just last month, John Bernecker, a stuntman on The Walking Dead, died after sustaining “serious injuries” on the AMC drama's Georgia set.
The stuntman and actor, who also worked on The Fate of the Furious and Logan, was placed on life support after suffering massive head injuries that left him brain dead.
Sources told Deadline that Bernecker and an actor were rehearsing a fight scene that was supposed to end with a routine fall from a balcony, but he lost his footing and fell 30 ft. to concrete floor.
Deadpool 2 is set to hit theaters in 2018, and The Walking Dead is currently set to return for season 8 in October.

Most fans and critics are raving after the first screening of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" Monday.
The film is not out until May 5, but early moviegoers said the sequel is fun and emotional -- and that, of course, Groot "is everything."
Here's what some of the lucky few who saw the movie early had to say:
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a whole heap of fun. Gorgeous, a bit mad, and surprisingly emotional. And yes, Baby Groot is everything. — Haleigh Foutch (@HaleighFoutch) April 18, 2017
Holy smokes was Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol 2 fun! I had a smile plastered on my face nearly the whole time. Tons of Easter eggs too. pic.twitter.com/558Q7nw8yN — Dan Casey (@DanCasey) April 18, 2017

To be fair, there were a few who liked the first movie better and some who were not impressed.
GUARDIANS VOL. 2 feels like a solid one-and-done issue between big stories; lots of character bits, not much story. MVP: Dave Bautista. — Matt Singer (@mattsinger) April 18, 2017
Hate to be the Voice of Reason, but GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 isn't as good as the first. What felt fresh now feels forced. 2.5/4 stars — Jeff Sneider (@TheInSneider) April 18, 2017

PARIS (AP) — Floodwaters peaked in Paris on Monday and were threatening towns downstream as the rain-engorged Seine River winds through Normandy toward the English Channel.
Rivers swollen by France's heaviest rains in 50 years have engulfed romantic quays in Paris, swallowed up gardens and roads, halted riverboat cruises — and raised concerns about climate change.
The Meteo France weather service said January has seen nearly double normal rainfall nationwide, and the rains in the past two months are the highest measured for the period in 50 years.
"I'm amazed. I've come to Paris since 1965, most years, and I've never seen the Seine as high," said Terry Friberg, visiting from Boston. "I love Paris with all my heart but I'm very worried about the level of the river."
Flood monitoring agency Vigicrues said the water levels in Paris hit a maximum height of 5.84 meters (19 feet, 2 inches) on the Austerlitz scale early Monday.
That's below initial fears last week, and well below record levels of 8.62 meters in 1910, but still several meters above normal levels of about 1.5 meters on the Austerlitz scale.
And the waters are expected to stay unusually high for days or weeks.
That's bad news for tourists hoping to cruise past Paris sites on the famed "bateaux mouches" riverboats, or visit the bottom floor of the Louvre Museum, closed since last week as a precaution. Riverside train stations along the line that serves Versailles are also closed, and will remain that way for several more days.
Water laps the underside of historic bridges, and treetops and lampposts poke out of the brown, swirling Seine.
South African tourist Michael Jelatis, visiting Notre Dame Cathedral on an island in central Paris, was among many people linking the floods to global warming, blamed for increasing instances of extreme weather.
"Around the world we're all aware that things like this, unusual weather, are happening. I mean back home we are in a serious drought at the moment as well," he told The Associated Press.
Overall, Paris is better prepared than when it was last hit by heavy flooding in 2016, and Parisians have largely taken disruptions in stride this time.
Other towns on the surging Seine have seen it much worse.
The floods have caused damage in 242 towns along the river and tributaries already and more warnings are in place as the high waters move downstream.
In Lagny-sur-Marne south of Paris, Serge Pinon now has to walk on a makeshift footbridge to reach his home and its flooded surroundings.
His basement is submerged in water, as are the plants he was trying to grow in a backyard greenhouse tent. He lost a freezer, a refrigerator, a washing machine and dryer to flood waters.
"We're up to the maximum, maximum and now we're just waiting for it to go down," he said. "This year the flood has risen more rapidly than usual. Here it usually rises in a regular fashion and we have the time to see it coming we can save things. But this time it rose too quickly."
Elsewhere in the town, street signs stick out of the water and a lonely boat floats in the Marne River, once accessible from the riverbank but now unreachable on foot.
Mayor Jean-Paul Michel said that residents are used to seasonal floods, but this one is exceptionally long-lasting, now in its third week. "So it goes on and on, and we think it's going to carry on for (another) long week before the flood starts subsiding," he said.

“Until the firm makes sufficient improvements, it will be restricted from growing any larger than its total asset size as of the end of 2017,” the Fed said.
Wells Fargo said on Friday that it was working to address the problems, and the bank's shares slid sharply in after-hours trading.
The central bank's penalties are uncommon. The Fed's regulators have routinely penalized banks for misconduct, but they have not previously imposed strict limits on a major bank's growth.
The regulatory pendulum has recently been swinging in favor of big banks. President Trump and his advisers argue that regulators have gone too far in curbing banks' activities.
Mr. Trump, however, has taken specific aim at Wells Fargo as a rogue institution. He wrote on Twitter in December that penalties against the bank “will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!”
On a conference call with analysts and investors Friday night, Wells Fargo's chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, said the Fed's actions related to past conduct that the bank was already taking steps to fix and that they did not affect the bank's financial condition.
“We want to have this cap lifted as soon as possible, and we're going to work very hard to make sure that's the case,” Mr. Sloan said. He added that the bank remains open for business and will continue to make new loans even as the Fed's limits remain in place.

Wells Fargo said it would submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days for improving its board oversight and risk management practices. It will also submit to an independent third-party review that will be completed by the end of September.
Wells Fargo officials expect that they will be able to get the restrictions lifted within the next year, which they believe will minimize the financial impact of the penalty, according to a person close to the bank.

The Fed's action Friday stunned industry observers.
“I don't remember the last time the board has ever done anything quite as dramatic as that,” said Evan Stewart, a regulatory lawyer at the law firm Cohen and Gresser, referring to the Federal Reserve Board. “It's really quite a dramatic intervention by the major federal regulatory agency in the governance of a major bank.”
For years, Wells Fargo was the toast of the United States banking industry. It was showered with awards and praise for appearing to perfect the art of “cross-selling,” in which it found creative new ways to peddle financial products to its existing customers. The bank's savvy management of risk allowed it to avoid the worst of the financial crisis.
While others retrenched, Wells Fargo substantially expanded, snapping up ailing North Carolina lender Wachovia, in late 2008. That acquisition was engineered in part by federal regulators, who viewed Wells as one of the country's strongest, best-run institutions.
That reputation has crumbled recently, though. Wells Fargo was found by regulators to have systematically created fake customer accounts and misled customers and government officials.
It is unclear what impact the Fed's penalties will have on Wells Fargo's future. The bank had nearly $2 trillion in assets at the end of 2017. Going forward, the Fed will not let Wells Fargo's average balance sheet expand beyond that size, according to a senior Fed official. Because large banks' assets tend to expand as the economy grows, the Fed believes that this limitation will be a significant constraint on the bank's ability to grow.
One of Wells Fargo's primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, slapped significant restrictions on the bank last year, when it gave it a failing score on a key community lending metric. The low grade meant that Wells Fargo would need to clear extra hurdles to open new branches or otherwise expand its retail banking business.
Wells Fargo's board has already undergone a makeover in the wake of the scandal, although half of its current board — eight members — were there at the time the scandal erupted. Wells Fargo on Friday night declined to say which four directors would be stepping down as part of the agreement with the Fed.

Wells Fargo's current board chairwoman, Elizabeth A. Duke, took on the position last month, replacing Stephen W. Sanger, a 13-year board member who retired after a year filled with scandals. Two other longtime directors departed at the end of last year.
Last year, a longtime Wells Fargo investor, Gerald R. Armstrong, submitted a shareholder proposal calling for the bank's directors to be replaced. His proposal was voted down. Mr. Armstrong welcomed Friday's news. “I hope they bring in some very effective new directors,” he said.
A review that Wells Fargo's board commissioned last year, conducted by four directors and the outside law firm Shearman & Sterling, found that lax internal oversight allowed problems to fester for years.
The Fed, in letters sent Friday to Wells Fargo board members, leveled harsh criticism on their oversight of the bank and made clear that more changes need to happen quickly.
“Your performance in addressing these problems is an example of ineffective oversight that is not consistent with the Federal Reserve's expectations for a firm of WFC's size and scope of operations,” wrote Michael S. Gibson, the Fed's head of banking supervision, in a letter to John G. Stumpf, the bank's former chief executive. Mr. Stump retired under pressure in the wake of the scandal with a pretax payout of more than $80 million in stock options and other compensation.
“The bank is lucky it is too big to shut down,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. “A smaller bank might have lost its banking licenses.”
Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer & Company Bangs the Table for Healthequity (NASD:HQY)
Mohan Naidu, CFA, is Managing Director and Senior Analyst, Healthcare Information Technology of Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Mr. Naidu joined Oppenheimer from Stephens, where he had been a senior analyst covering HCIT since 2013. Prior to Stephens, Mr. Naidu spent five years as a member of the highly ranked HCIT equity research team at Piper Jaffray & Co. Before his career as a research analyst, Mr. Naidu worked at GE Healthcare IT for seven years, first as a senior lead system designer and later as a product development manager.
In his exclusive interview with the Wall Street Transcript, Mr. Naidu reviews the current investment landscape for health care software services stocks: “I would say the companies that have been providing what I call electronic health records are going to struggle a bit in the next 12 months, but outside of that, the niche vendors that provide productivity enhancement and work resolutions to hospitals are going to grow a lot because the hospitals have continued to spend and focus on trying to help the physicians and clinicians expand or at least improve their workflow in the post-electronic-health-record environment. Of course, there are newer services around telehealth and consumerization of health care, and also even the changing reimbursement angle. All these three subareas are going to really get a lot of tailwinds, not just in the next 12 months but probably the next five years or so.”
“The other company that I am really excited about is HealthEquity (NASD:HQY), which is a company that manages and provides technology and services to employers so that they can actually provide the platform for employees to manage their high-deductible plan/HSA accounts. In the next five years, most of the employers, at least the larger ones, will move away from predominantly copay-based plans to deductible, high-medium plans, we believe. Employers are trying to find ways to get the employees more involved with health care costs, and there is no better way, we believe, at least at this point, than a combination of a high-deductible plan and an HSA, where an employee or a family will have a $6,000 to $7,000 deductible that can be put in an HSA account.”
For all the details and more picks and pans from Mr. Naidu in this growing business sector, read the entire interview in the Wall Street Transcript.

Macron in Morocco to discuss Libya, Qatar
Rabat, Morocco | AFP | French President Emmanuel Macron was in Morocco Wednesday on a 24-hour visit for talks on battling terrorism as well as the Libyan conflict and Qatar's dispute with its Gulf neighbours.
As he stepped off the plane for his first visit to Morocco since his election in May, the French president, his wife Brigitte at his side, was welcomed on the tarmac by King Mohammed VI.
The king's wife, Princess Lala Salma, and Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, 14, were also present at the airport to greet the French first couple, who were then driven to the royal palace for talks.
Ahead of the visit, the French presidency said Macron would discuss with Mohammed VI the dispute between Qatar and several countries, as both Paris and Rabat are keen on mediating a solution to the crisis.
The French presidency said after Macron landed in Rabat that the French president would meet separately in Paris with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the crown prince of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
The meetings are due to take place in the last week of June and are aimed at trying to defuse the dispute between Qatar and its neighbours.
The United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and other countries, accusing the gas-rich Gulf nation of supporting Islamist extremism.
The crisis is the worst to grip the Gulf in years.
“President Macron has spoken with all the heads of state of the region and called for appeasement. These efforts could converge with the mediation that Morocco wants to attempt,” the Elysee Palace said ahead of the visit.
A French diplomatic source said “the priority is to help resolve the crisis”.
Also on Macron's agenda was the conflict in Libya, where the UN-backed government is struggling to impose its legitimacy.
The fight against radicalisation and terrorism would also be at the centre of the talks between the two leaders, and Paris would like to “intensify” cooperation in that field, the source said.
Moroccans, or people of Moroccan origin, are believed to be behind several attacks that have been carried out in Europe in the past two years.
Macron and his wife are to attend an iftar meal, to break the fast of Ramadan, at the king's personal resident, and the French president will spend the night in Rabat before flying back home Thursday.

Flushing, NY – Wednesday night was a magical night that reminded us why anything can happen in a nine-inning game of baseball.Down by two runs in the early going, the New York Mets (30-34) rallied to defeat the Chicago Cubs (32-33) by a final score of 9-4.
Playing with fatigue, Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey was brutally battered for four innings. In his time on the mound, Harvey surrendered back-to-back home runs to kick off the game. Overall, the Cubs produced three home runs, and four runs off Harvey.
Had it not been for the offense and bullpen coming through, the Mets would have suffered their second straight loss. The Bullpen Amazin' kept New York in the game as they held the Cubs scoreless for the remaining final five innings of the game. The pitching unit of Paul Sewald, Francisco Salas, Jerry Blevins, and Addison Reed combined to hold the defending World Series champs to five hits, zero runs, zero home runs as they struck out six batters. The highlight of the game goes to Mets Curtis Granderson.
Granderson, who is one of the nicest professional ballplayers, blasted his 300th career home run in the eighth inning. Not only was it a milestone run, it was the go-ahead run for the Amazins. With that said, enjoy the photos Latino Sports photographer Frank Hyatt covered Tuesday night's Cleveland Indians 5-7 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers from Progressive Field, home of the Cleveland Indians. Good Night, Always Believe!

Teyana Taylor appears to have canceled plans for an updated version of her new, Kanye West-produced album K.T.S.E. “I guess we ain't getting one,” Taylor wrote on Twitter today, responding to fans inquiring about the promised revised album's whereabouts. “A lot of clearance issues, shit takes time,” she elaborated in a second post. “At this point I will leave album the way it is & will just debut the extended records thru my visuals!”
In an interview with radio personality Big Boy last week, Taylor said sample clearance issues involving Lauryn Hill's “The Lost Ones” and an unspecified Sade song affected multiple K.T.S.E. tracks and that one song premiered at the album's listening party, “We Got Love,” had to be excluded from the released version. (Kanye has since been accused of failing to properly clear a Numero Group sample for use on K.T.S.E.) “Once y'all hear the album next week, you'll see what I'm talking about, because it's way more complete,” Taylor said at the time. A revised version of K.T.S.E. incorporating additional sample material was supposed to appear on streaming services this past weekend (June 30-July 1), but that didn't end up happening.
Sampling headaches were probably inevitable given the compressed schedule and last-minute approach to this summer's G.O.O.D. Music releases, but it's a frustrating reality for fans who waited nearly four years for Taylor's sophomore album, only to wait hours longer on release day for a project she's implied is less than complete. If all goes well, though, it seems we can look forward to hearing expanded versions of K.T.S.E. tracks in upcoming videos.
The EU, Germany and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, are supporting Ukraine's work in boosting energy efficiency in the residential sector.
They have signed agreements, under which the IFC will initially manage funding worth €43 million (£37.6m) from the EU and €10 million (£8.7m) from Germany.
The grants will be used to co-finance programmes of the Ukrainian Energy Efficiency Fund, a new initiative to enable housing associations to implement energy-saving measures in multi-family buildings.
Ukraine has one of the largest housing stocks in Europe but many homes are said to be old and inefficient, with poorly insulated buildings that lose as much as 50% of their heat.
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will go from Cape Canaveral to low Earth orbit in 10 minutes Monday with a Dragon capsule heading for the International Space Station carrying nearly more than 6,400 pounds of supplies and experiments.
Liftoff is set for 1631 GMT (12:31 p.m. EDT) Monday from the Kennedy Space Center's launch pad 39A.
It will be the 39th flight of a Falcon 9 rocket, and SpaceX's 11th launch of the year. Working under contract to NASA, Monday's launch will be the 12th of least 26 SpaceX resupply missions to depart for the space station.
The illustrated timeline below outlines the launch sequence for the Falcon 9 flight with the Dragon spacecraft. It does not include times for the experimental descent and landing attempt of the first stage booster at Landing Zone 1, a former Atlas missile launch facility about 9 miles (15 kilometers) south of pad 39A.
Three ignitions of the first stage engines after separation will steer the booster back toward Florida's Space Coast from the northeast. Here are key times for the landing maneuvers:
T+plus 2 minutes, 41 seconds: First stage boost-back burn begins
First stage boost-back burn begins T+plus 6 minutes, 9 seconds: First stage entry burn begins

Sunderland and David Moyes are expected to hear this week whether the manager will face punishment over his ‘slap' comment to a female reporter.
The 53-year-old Scot issued a public apology to BBC Newcastle and Radio Five Live reporter Vicki Sparks after video footage emerged of a controversial exchange between the pair following a post-match interview where he said she “might get a slap”.
Sunderland described his comments after the draw with Burnley as “wholly unacceptable” adding apologetic Moyes continued to have their full support in his role as manager.
The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with FA officials getting involved. Sunderland responded to the FA's request for observations last Monday.
Moyes is yet to be charged with anything, with the FA asking for observations at this stage before deciding on their next course of action. The off-camera incident followed the goalless draw with Burnley when Moyes was asked by Sparks if owner Ellis Short's presence at the game had meant he was under more pressure.
FISHERS, Ind. (AP) — A Marsh Supermarkets spokesman says a court is allowing the sale of 26 of its remaining stores to two Ohio-based grocery chains.
Spokesman Tom Mulligan says a Delaware bankruptcy court on Wednesday conditionally approved the sale of 11 stores to Kroger Co. subsidiary Topvalco Inc. for $16 million and 15 stores to Findlay, Ohio-based Fresh Encounter parent Generative Growth LLC for about $8 million.
Marsh said in a court filing Tuesday that Topvalco agreed to buy two stores each in Bloomington, Indianapolis, Muncie and Zionsville, and single stores in Brownsburg, Fishers and Greenwood.
It said Generative Growth agreed to buy two Indianapolis stores; other Indiana stores in Columbus, Elwood, Greensburg, Hartford City, Marion, New Palestine, Pendleton, Richmond and Tipton; and Ohio stores in Eaton, Middletown, Troy, and Van Wert.
___
The story has been corrected to show Topvalco is buying two stores in Bloomington and one in Brownsburg, not three in Bloomington.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A detention hearing for rapper Juelz Santana has been postponed until authorities decide who will prosecute the drug and gun charges he faces following an incident at Newark Liberty International Airport.
A judge was due to decide Monday whether Santana would remain jailed until his trial. Officials say that hearing will likely now occur sometime this week.
Santana pleaded not guilty to state charges last week. He also faces federal charges in the same incident
Authorities say security personnel found a loaded .38-caliber handgun and oxycodone pills he didn't have a prescription for in a carry-on bag containing his identification.
They say he fled the area, leaving two bags behind. He turned himself in three days later.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Jacoby Ellsbury will serve as New York's designated hitter in Game 2 of the AL Division Series against the Indians.
Yankees manager Joe Girardi is going with Ellsbury over Chase Headley because of his success in the past against Cleveland ace Corey Kluber. Ellsbury has batted .263 (5-19) in his career against Kluber, who went 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA in two starts against New York this season. Headley is just 1 of 14 against Kluber.
The Indians won the opener 4-0 over the Yankees, who were held to three hits and got nothing from rookie slugger Aaron Judge. The MVP candidate struck out four times, but Girardi isn't worried about the right fielder, who slumped miserably after the All-Star break before a strong finish.
"I don't really have any concerns about it because as watching him go through some of his ups and downs this year, how he's always bounced back," Girardi said. "So I'm not really too concerned about it."
Indians manager Terry Francona made two moves with his lineup. Austin Jackson will start in left field against New York left-hander CC Sabathia, and Yan Gomes will catch Kluber. Roberto Perez started behind the plate in Game 1.
Also, Francona said there's a good chance Michael Brantley will start in left field in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. Brantley missed 50 games over the final two months with an ankle injury.
However, Brantley, who is available off the bench in Game 2, has made huge progress in recent weeks and Francona is glad the All-Star is back. Brantley missed Cleveland's run to the World Series last year following two shoulder surgeries.
"He helps us win," Francona said. "I'm excited for him because last year he missed out. This year, with a lot of hard work, he's now going to be a part of what we're doing. I know it will mean a lot to him, and because of that, it means a lot to us."

Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, slowing down from a solid 1 percent gain in December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
Overall sales likely pulled back from a December bump in holiday shopping online and at auto dealers, while Americans spent more than normally expected last month at clothiers, department stores, electronics outlets and sporting goods retailers.
Higher gas prices drove a 2.3 percent sales increase at service stations last month. Gasoline prices climbed 7.8 percent between January and December, according to a separate Labor Department report released Wednesday. The retail sales report does not adjust its figures for prices.
Purchases at restaurants and bars climbed 1.4 percent. Building materials stores saw a slight 0.3 percent gain.
But sales at auto dealers slipped 1.2 percent, a sharp pull back after jumping 2.9 percent in December.
Sales at non-store retailers such as internet outlets were flat in January, although they have climbed 12 percent over the past year as more Americans prefer to shop via their computers and phones.
Over the past 12 months, total retail sales have risen a solid 5.6 percent. The greater spending likely reflects the improving job market. Employers added 227,000 workers in January, while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.8 percent because more people started looking for jobs and were counted as unemployed.
Astronomers: Trappist-1 Exoplanets Could Support Life
Scientists have identified two planets circling round a dim dwarf star as especially likely candidates for habitable worlds, with probable water and a source of heat, conditions thought necessary for life beyond Earth.
Since their discovery last year, the seven planets and their star, called Trappist-1, have thrilled astronomers hunting for a world resembling Earth. Never before had scientists found so many Earth-sized planets around a single star, or in a zone where the extreme temperatures of space would not obliterate the chances of life.
The finding suggested that there may be planets as rocky and large as Earth all over the Milky Way, and scientists quickly set to work analyzing the Trappist-1 system.
With colleagues in Hungary, Dr. Amy Barr, of the Planetary Science Institute built mathematical models of the seven planets and their interiors, and found that six of the seven worlds likely have water, as liquid or ice, with a global ocean possible on one. The team then modeled the planets' orbits to determine a likely surface temperature on the worlds.
"That's one of the main innovations of the paper," Barr told the Guardian. "The planets are also on eccentric orbits -- kind of egg shaped -- so every time the planet goes around the star it gets stretched and squeezed."
Jupiter's moon Io, experiences the same kind of push-pull, called tidal heat. Io's surface is riven by erupting volcanoes, lava flows, scars and caldera. Barr said the same forces are probably at work in the Trappist-1 system: "The planet kind of works its own internal friction, because that stretching and squeezing creates heat in the interior."
In the paper, set to be published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, the team concluded that planets b and c (each world goes by a lower-case letter), experience tidal heat, and that planet c likely has little to no water, but mostly iron and rock. Planets d and e -- the two identified as most likely to be habitable -- also experience tidal heat, they found, but much less.
They calculated that those planets are "in this kind of temperate region," Barr said, with a "very reasonable surface temperatures." Planet d, the team estimates, has a temperature around 15C (59F) or perhaps as low as slightly warmer than the melting point of ice. Planet e was colder, Barr said: "the temperatures you would get in Antarctica, but also reasonable."
The likelihood of tidal heating is encouraging to scientists in search of planets with the conditions for life. Tidal heat not only warms a planet, but also drives chemistry and flow in its mantle, conditions amenable to the development of life -- at least as humans know it.
Because NASA has yet to launch its next generation space telescope, the James Webb, scientists like Barr and her colleagues have turned to computers to investigate puzzles with limited data. A paper last year found that Trappist-1, although older and more dim than our sun, projects a stellar wind far more severe than the solar wind that lashes Earth from our sun. This wind likely stripped away the atmosphere -- another condition for life -- from the planets closest to Trappist-1, while the more distant planets fared better. Another team investigated whether the Trappist-1 worlds could hold water -- another condition -- and found that four of the seven might.
But while the pieces of research by various teams have generally supported each other, Barr and other astronomers, astrophysicists and geophysicists are most eager for more observations. Should the James Webb launch on schedule this year, it will provide far more data about specific exoplanets, and ease the challenge of writing about a system as a whole.
"It's hard to write a paper about seven planets all at once," Barr said.

NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Roland Griffin scored 18 of 20 points after halftime and finished with nine rebounds, Rickey McGill had 17 points, seven rebounds and eight assists and Iona beat Quinnipiac 87-82 in double overtime on Friday night.
Schadrac Casimir added 14 points and Deyshonee Much scored 11 for Iona (14-9, 8-3 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference).
Neither team scored in the second overtime until McGill hit E.J. Crawford for a layup with 1:50 to play and the Gaels led the rest of the way. Quinnipiac missed 7 of 8 from the field and hit just 1 of 4 free throws in the period.
McGill made two free throws to give Iona a seven-point lead with 54 seconds left in regulation, but the Bobcats used a 9-2 run - including Cameron Young's 3-pointer with four seconds to go - to make it 69-all and force overtime.
Jacob Rigoni and Young each hit a 3-pointer as Quinnipiac opened OT on an 8-2 run, but Much tied it with a 3-pointer and then made a layup to give the Gaels a 79-77 lead with 29 seconds left in the period. Chaise Daniels' layup 23 seconds later forced the second overtime.
Young had a career-high 31 points and 11 rebounds for Quinnipiac (9-14, 6-5). Rigoni scored 16, including four 3-pointers, and Daniels added 15.

Rev. Daniel Ogbarmey Tetteh, Director General of SEC
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon announce a new capital requirement for companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange.
The move follows recent announcement by the Bank of Ghana which also increased its capital requirement from 120 million cedis to 400 million cedis for banks in the country.
Speaking to Citi Business News, the Director General of the SEC, Rev. Daniel Ogbamey Tetteh explained that the commission will go to the market to undertake an assessment and come out with a figure.
“There is a procedure we have to follow before we announce the capital market requirement that we are going to propose. Basically, we will get to the market with what our proposals are based on. What capital is required by the different market operators to be able to operate effectively on the capital market,” he stated.
Rev. Ogbamey Tetteh pointed out that the regulator will take into consideration the views of players in the industry.
“After we propose it to the market, we will take their feedback and then after we hear from them then will make a determination as to the new level, he said adding that “without a solid financial background or without the necessary capital base you find it difficult to be effective as capital market operator”.
He stressed that there is the need to increase the requirement to strengthen companies on the bourse.
Redknapp returns at Birmingham
Veteran English manager Harry Redknapp has replaced Gianfranco Zola as the boss of Birmingham City, the struggling Championship club announced on Tuesday.
The 70-year-old former Tottenham Hotspur takes charge with Birmingham three points above the relegation zone after a dismal four month spell under Zola.
Redknapp's most recent managerial post was with Jordan. He last worked in English football with Derby County as an advisor.
Zola stood down on Monday, declaring “I sacked myself”.
The 50-year-old was a controversial appointment by the club's Chinese owners after they sacked Gary Rowett, who had Birmingham well placed to challenge for a place in the play-offs, in December.
However under former Italy international Zola, the Midlands club suffered a dramatic slump in form that saw Birmingham manage just two wins in 22 matches.
Following Monday's 2-0 loss to Burton Albion, after which Zola resigned, Birmingham are just three points above the second-tier drop zone with three matches remaining.
Redknapp's first game as Blues' boss is Saturday's Birmingham derby at Aston Villa.
His last spell in the Championship saw Redknapp guide QPR to promotion. Redknapp has also managed two other London clubs in West Ham, for whom he played, and Tottenham Hotspur.
He has also been in charge of three south coast clubs, starting his managerial career at Bournemouth and later twice taking charge of Portsmouth either side of an ill-fated stint at their bitter rivals Southampton.
It was with Portsmouth that Redknapp enjoyed arguably his greatest success when they won the 2008 FA Cup.
Zola, speaking following Birmingham's home loss to Burton at St Andrews. said it had been his decision alone to cut short his two-and-a-half year contract.
“I sacked myself,” he explained. “I decided to give in my resignation. I am sorry because I came to Birmingham with huge expectations.
“Unfortunately the results have not been good and I take full responsibility. It is not that I like quitting, but Birmingham deserves better.”
Zola, in his third management spell in England after stints at West Ham and Watford, added: “If I feel I cannot help the players, why stay? If I cannot help the team, it is better I leave and let someone else do that.
“I feel very bad and very sorry. We worked with a lot of meaning, but unfortunately it didn't produce the results. It is all very disappointing.”

From a fire that claimed four lives last December emerges some hope that a similar tragedy won't be repeated in Port Colborne.
At Monday night's city council meeting, fire Chief Tom Cartwright accepted $1,700 in donations that will be applied toward a campaign to provide smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors to people who can't afford them.
Cartwright plans to bring a report outlining the plan to a future council meeting, but has said he anticipates that firefighters, both volunteer and career, will be out six days a week, day and night, spreading the message of the importance of these alarms.
“I'm hoping it will have a significant positive impact on the community,” he said.
The donations to Port Colborne Fire and Emergency Services all started with an idea from the president of the Friends Over 55 Recreation Centre.
Jack O'Neil said he wanted to do something in wake of the tragedy that claimed a mom and her two children and their grandmother, so he made a call to fire officials.
“I asked them if there was anything I could do to help,” he told city councillors. “We've got to save lives. Our seniors, any life, are valuable.”
A campaign ensued that included distributing informational posters across the city. O'Neil's plan was to raise money to purchase smoke alarms for residents who can't afford them. It generated $700.
Regional Chairman Alan Caslin was also brought into the effort.
Caslin, who spoke at Monday's council meeting, said he took some money raised by the Regional Chair's Charity Golf Tournament to assist. He said he was happy to do this for the residents of Port Colborne.
Caslin handed Cartwright an envelope with a $1,000 cheque in it, calling the cause “worthwhile.”

ORLANDO, Fla. (WFLA) – A Ruskin man faces misdemeanor charges after he was arrested outside of Pulse nightclub while hundreds of people remembered the 49 people killed there last June.
Orlando police say Daniel Maguire, 36, and another protester showed up next door to the site of attack holding a sign with homophobic slurs and wearing a shirt with anti-gay slogans.
A crowd quickly surrounded the two men, shouting “Love over hate.”
When police arrived to defuse the situation, they asked Maguire to move away from the club for his own safety.
“Noticing the hostility of the situation, and the increasing volume of the crowd, I asked the sign holder if he would walk with us to the north to get him out of the crowd,” Sgt. Jerry Goglas wrote in the arrest report. “He stated, ‘Aren't you here to protect me?' I advised him that although I was there to keep the peace and protect all persons involved, the crowd was very emotional and becoming increasingly hostile towards him.”
Maguire can be seen on WESH video asking another officer “What law am I breaking?”
That officer holds out his hand to stop Maguire from walking back onto the Pulse property, but he does not comply. Maguire and the officer begin shoving each other, then Maguire falls and is placed in handcuffs.
Maguire was taken into custody and charged with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest without violence.
The other protester was not arrested and left the event without incident.
Services were held throughout the day Monday to remember the 49 people killed on the one-year anniversary of the attack.
Hundreds of people descended on Orlando to leave flowers, cards and drawings to remember the victims and stood shoulder-to-shoulder outside the nightclub as the names of the victims were read aloud.

Pennsylvania elementary and middle school students will spend less time focused on standardized testing this school year.
Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday that a change to the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment tests will reduce the length of the standardized exams by 20 percent in grades three through eight.
Parents, students and educators across Pennsylvania have continued to express concerns about the amount of time devoted to standardized testing, Wolf said during a visit at Susquehanna Middle School in Dauphin County Monday.
"This reduction will ease the stress placed on our kids, and will allow students and teachers to focus more on learning than on testing," Wolf said in a news release. "This change should also reassure parents that we've listened to their concerns about over-testing."
Pa. vo-tech students no longer need to worry about Keystone Exams
The vice-president of Pennsylvania's largest teachers' union praised Wolf for the decision
"There is no doubt that reducing the actual time students spend taking state tests is good for our students," said Dolores McCracken, of the Pennsylvania State Education Association. "Gov. Wolf today reaffirmed what educators have been saying for a long time - that too much emphasis on standardized testing interferes with teaching and learning."
Mandated by federal law, the English and math PSSA are taken in the spring by students in third through eighth grade. The science tests are taken by fourth- and eighth-grade students.
Axing an entire math and English PSSA testing section as well as some science questions, will allow students to avoid up to two full days of testing, the release states.
This means than on average students in grades 3 through 8 will spend 20 percent less time on state testing. The youngest students will see the greatest reduction, averaging about 25 percent.
"Each year, teachers spend an inordinate amount of time preparing students to pass the PSSA," said Tamara Willis, superintendent of the Susquehanna Township School District. "The current system has resulted in a loss of creativity and innovation within our classrooms and growing pressure for teachers to 'teach to the test.'"
While standardized tests can help schools monitor their progress and achievement, they also interrupt learning and can be disruptive for students, the release states. The department is studying ways to further reduce those disruptions, the release says.
"We want to make sure that our testing policies work for our students, teachers, and support professionals. Public schools are places where students learn," McCracken of the PSEA said. "By creating a more balanced, research-based, and appropriate use of standardized tests in Pennsylvania's public schools, we can find the right balance - and do what's right for our kids."
The change came out of discussions between the Pennsylvania Department of Education and education stakeholders as it developed its state plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act, the federal law that follows the No Child Left Behind Act.
Pennsylvania has replaced the high school PSSAs with the Keystone Exams, subject-based, end-of-course exams, which have been repeatedly delayed amid concerns over high stakes testing.
In June, Wolf signed a law that means Pennsylvania high school students studying in career and technology education programs no longer have to pass the Keystone Exams to graduate.

Officials say a woman caught trying to smoke on a Southwest flight has been arrested after shouting she was going to kill everyone on the plane.
Sacramento County sheriff's spokesman Shaun Hampton said Monday that 24-year-old Valerie Curbelo was arrested on the tarmac when the plane landed Saturday.
Hampton says when the crew stopped Curbelo from having a cigarette in the plane's bathroom, she threatened to kill all the passengers and crew and became combative.
Southwest said in a statement that the flight from Portland, Oregon, received priority treatment from air traffic control and landed safely in Sacramento.
In a jailhouse interview with KOVR-TV, Curbelo, of Sandy, Oregon, said anxiety drove her to smoke.
She said she didn't know why she made the death threats, adding that it wasn't typical behavior for her.
CHICAGO -- The Chicago Cubs used an unusual alignment for Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto, employing four outfielders across the Wrigley Field grass on Monday night.
As Votto came to the plate in the top of the fifth inning, usual third baseman Kris Bryant moved to left-center field, with left fielder Kyle Schwarber playing near the foul line. Jon Jay remained in center, with Jason Heyward in right field.
The left side of the infield was vacant, as shortstop Javier Baez played up the middle.
Votto beat the alignment by doubling to right field. It's believed to be the first time the Cubs have employed that look since Joe Maddon took over as manager in 2015.

Marvel's “Black Panther,” Chadwick Boseman, graduated from Howard University with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts (BFA) in 2000.
On May 12, Boseman returned to his alma mater to address the Class of 2018, while receiving an honorary degree.
The Howard University graduation is one of more than 100 Historically Black College and University graduations and one of more than 4,000 general graduations across the country.
On May 5, White House Correspondent April Ryan, brought down the house at Bennett College in North Carolina.
In Arkansas on the same day, journalist and political commentator Sophia Nelson, made lasting remarks during the Philander Smith College commencement exercise.
Across the nation, families are gathering, people are celebrating, and graduations are being hailed as an occasion of joy.
However, despite these many festivities, if you are a Black American who graduated from the University of Florida (UF), your achievements may have been marred by the horrible memory of faculty marshals physically pushing you off the stage, after you decided to celebrate your Black Greek (fraternity) pride, with the execution of a few “steps.”
More than 20 students were assaulted by the unidentified faculty member (although some say he is a chemistry lecturer), who is now on paid leave.
Why would the university continue to pay someone who seems to have differentially attacked Black students, as apparently no White students were assaulted or pushed off the stage?
This lecturer is a menace to society and college students, who should not be exposed to his racism, either on stage or in a classroom.
According to The New York Times, UF President W. Kent Fuchs apologized to the affected students and left a personal message of apology on Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity member Oliver Telusma's voicemail, due to the incident.
However, from where I sit, President Fuchs should track that student down along with all the others and visit them face-to-face.
The UF incident reminds Black students that graduation is but one of the many hurdles they must clear.
Every day, every single day, they face the possibility of pernicious racism, differential treatment, and the threat of law enforcement to compel compliance with the most foolish of laws and norms, spoken or unspoken.
That's why Holly Hylton, the White woman who managed a Philadelphia Starbucks, felt free to call the police on two Black men after they had been seated, without ordering anything.
That's why a hysterical White female bigot, called the police on a Black man, who was barbecuing in a public park in Oakland, California, where barbecuing is customary.
That's why the police were called on three Black women (and a White man), because they failed to wave or smile when they exited an Airbnb in Rialto, California, and were detained for 45 minutes despite possessing proof that they had reserved their space.
That's why the police wrestled a 25-year-old Black woman to the ground (exposing her bare breasts) in an Alabama Waffle House, after she asked for plastic cutlery and an ignorant employee reportedly said “she did not know her place,” and the beat goes on and on and on.
The police are too often called to put Black people in their place, to force them to comply, to reinforce the tenet of White supremacy; the notion that when we see a White person, we must shuck and jive and smile. So-called law enforcement officers become servants of racism, who want us in our place.
I want the graduates to know that their place is everyplace.
Class of 2018, your place is in that Starbucks at the table, order or not. Your place is in that Waffle House, getting the utensils you requested. Your place is at the lake in Oakland, burning those bones on your grill. Your place is on that stage at UF.
Resistance has a high price. Who wants to go to jail and end up, like Sandra Bland, whose mysterious death in Texas still has not been solved? Who wants to be handcuffed, humiliated, exposed, and maligned, just for asking a simple question?
Starbucks will close thousands of stores to the tune of millions of dollars for unconscious bias training. But who will train these biased police officers and the racists who call them, because their feelings are bruised when no one waves at them?
The Class of 2018 will learn, as have millions of other Black Americans, that racism is alive and well.
They've cleared a hurdle with graduation, but even as some cross the stage, they are being reminded that there are many more hurdles to clear, to survive in our unfortunately racist nation.
Perhaps though, the Class of 2018, will be among those to dismantle the racist hurdles.
Perhaps in the process of clearing other hurdles (graduate and professional school, marriage and children, artificial intelligence and gentrification), they will also find the wherewithal to eliminate racial barriers to success.

Baidu has also announced during its annual AI developer conference that it has already manufactured 100 Apolong vehicles with help from Chinese bus manufacturer King Long. Apolong is powered by Baidu's Apollo open source platform, which has Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, meaning it doesn't need human input in select conditions. The latest version of Apollo also announced during the conference supports valet parking and integrates with Baidu's software that has facial recognition capabilities and can detect if a driver is showing signs of fatigue.
In addition to unveiling Apollo 3.0, Baidu has also revealed that it's teaming up with Intel to use Mobileye's technology. If you'll recall, Intel purchased 84 percent of Mobileye's shares for $15.3 billion, making the Israel-based company a subsidiary. Baidu will integrate Mobileye's Responsibility Sensitive Safety model, which the company describes as "decision making that is based on common sense human-centered knowledge of what it means to drive safely and avoid accidents," into Apollo. The Chinese tech giant will also use Mobileye's Surround Computer Vision Kit as its preferred perception solution for its platform.
NEW YORK (AP) — A French-Italian crew has won the first leg of the Atlantic Cup by reaching New York an hour and a half ahead of an American crew after sailing 648 nautical miles from Charleston, South Carolina.
Skipper Catherine Pourre and Pietro Luciani on Earendil sailed into New York ahead of the American crew of Amhas, Micah Davis and Rob Windsor.
Earendil moved into the lead after a long, intense battle with Amhas. The French-Italian duo played the conditions perfectly, allowing it to gain a tactical and speed advantage after gybing in from the Gulf Stream to race along the New Jersey shore.
The second stage of three-stage race, to Portland, Maine, begins Saturday. The race will cover 1,008 nautical miles and is being sailed in Class40s.
Malabu Oil deal: Reps may not summon Jonathan
May accept written submission
ABUJA— APPARENTLY disturbed by the uproar that greeted the proposed invitation of former President Goodluck Jonathan by the House of Representatives adhoc committee investigating allegations of corruption, malpractices, and breach of due process in the award of oil prospecting licence, OPL 245, also known as Malabu Oil scandal, the House may shelve invitation of the former number one citizen and accept a written submission.
It was gathered, yesterday, that the adhoc committee, led by Razaq Atunwa (APC, Kwara) on a second thought, shelved the idea of summoning Jonathan as this may send wrong signals to different quarters.
Vanguard recalls that Atunwa had, last Thursday, explained that former President Jonathan might be summoned by the committee because fresh facts emanating from court cases on the controversial oil bloc seemed to have implicated the ex-leader.
A source privy to this development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said members of the committee had a second thought, considering the furore that trailed media reports that Jonathan would be summoned.
He said: “We have reviewed the situation, especially comments from a cross-section of opinion leaders and most of us were of the view that we should not heat up the polity. One, the former President has already reacted and denied any dealings with the principal characters in the oil bloc scandal.
“Second, the case is in court, both in Nigeria and outside the country. So we are not out to humiliate or witch hunt anyone, but we just want to gather information that could help in getting to the bottom of this scandal once and for all.”
“What we have resolved now is that we will request the former President to do a paper for us, stating what he knows about the oil bloc and we will work with that. There is no personal interest here but we are only interested in clearing this mess because right now, our country is a laughing stock internationally. It is a shame”
Probed further if the committee was under pressure to drop the invitation, the lawmaker replied: “I will say we are not under pressure but some well-meaning Nigerians have advised and expressed their reservations and we have to reason with them.
“Right now, there is relative calm and peace in the Niger Delta and we do not want anything that may trigger another round of crisis in that part of the country. Times are hard and we need peace for development to thrive.”
Vanguard's attempts to reach the chairman of the ad hoc committee, Atunwa to confirm the latest development failed as his cell phone was inaccessible.
Atunwa had in a statement last week, said: “The committee is aware of recent information that have come to light, both nationally and internationally, indicating that former President Jonathan may have been complicit in the controversial OPL 245 deal”.
According to Atunwa, these facts have firmly placed former President Goodluck Jonathan on the committee's radar”.
The lawmaker further explained in the statement that “the committee believes that former President Goodluck Jonathan may well be in a position to assist it with its inquiries.
“Accordingly, the committee is considering inviting him to give evidence before it. An announcement will be made once a formal firm decision is taken on the matter.”
While assuring that the committee intended to be “meticulous, thorough and comprehensive in its inquiry so as to bring about finality to this seemingly intractable matter,” Atunwa also disclosed that the committee was closely monitoring proceedings in Italian courts cases instituted by the public prosecutor of Milan in which ministers in Jonathan's administration were mentioned, including President Jonathan himself.''

Officials say FBI agents interviewed Michael Flynn shortly after he took office as National Security Adviser.
FBI agents interviewed Michael Flynn shortly after he took office as National Security Adviser about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, current and former officials told The New York Times on Tuesday.
While it is not clear what he said in his FBI interview, investigators believed Flynn was not entirely forthcoming, the officials said. If the authorities conclude that he knowingly lied to the FBI, it could expose him to a felony charge.
The report comes a day after President Donald Trump asked for Flynn's resignation, amid reports that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which included discussion of U.S. sanctions.
Flynn maintained publicly for more than a week after his interview that his conversations with the ambassador had been innocuous and did not involve sanctions against Russia, noted The New York Times.
Shortly after the FBI interview, on January 26, then acting attorney general, Sally Yates, warned the White House that Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail because of inconsistencies between what he had said publicly and what intelligence officials knew to be true.
It is unclear whether Flynn had a lawyer for his interview with the FBI or whether anyone at the White House, including lawyers there, knew the interview was happening, according to the report.
Even after FBI agents interviewed Flynn and Yates warned the White House, Flynn denied yet again — this time to The Washington Post on Wednesday — that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador.
Earlier on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump had asked Flynn to resign because of an “erosion of trust” and not because Flynn broke any laws.
He stressed the White House had reviewed the situation and determined that Flynn did not violate any laws during his call with the Russian ambassador.

Multiple Paralympic gold medallist Daniel Dias headlines Brazil's 18-strong team for this year's World Para Swimming Championships in Mexico City.
Dias has a total of 14 Paralympic titles to his name and will bid to defend the seven gold medals he won at the last edition of the World Championships in Glasgow in 2015.
The 29-year-old, who competes in the S5, SB4 and SM5 classifications, will lead the Brazilian squad for the event, due to run from September 30 to October 6.
Andre Brasil, a seven-time Paralympic champion, has also been named in the Brazilian team.
The 33-year-old will enter the competition in the Mexican capital aiming to retain his crowns in the 50 metres freestyle, 100m backstroke and 100m freestyle S10 events.
Brazil's squad also features Beatriz Carneiro, Cecília Araújo, Edênia Garcia, Felipe Caltran, Gabriel Souza, Ítalo Gomes and Joana Neves.

Others who are due to represent the South American nation at the event are Luis Antonio Correa da Silva, Matheus Rheine, Patrícia Santos, Phelipe Rodrigues, Raquel Viel, Ruan Souza, Ruiter Silva, Talisson Glock and Thomaz Matera.
Brazil will be hoping to better their haul at the 2015 World Championships in the Scottish city, where they claimed a total of 23 medals.
It included 11 gold, eight silver and four bronze.
Their total saw them finish in 11th place on the medal table.
Sixty countries are set to be represented in Mexico City in all, with 550 swimmers due to compete at the Francisco Marquez Olympic Swimming Pool.
The event is the first major competition in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic cycle.
The Powerlifting World Championships will also take place in the Mexican capital at the same time as part of a festival of Para-sport.
There are six kits available: Explorer, Explorer Pro, Light Wizard, Science Lab, Smart Life and All-in-One. Each is equipped with basic blocks like a light sensor and adjustment knob, with the different kits featuring specialized blocks geared toward a child's interests, like cold cathode, WiFi and camera blocks. Others include a voice sensor, Bluetooth, ultrasonic and display module.
Once your kit is set up, you can program it using Makeblock's mBlock, a graphical and flow-based programming system, with "no prior coding knowledge necessary," the company says. It also promises steady updates to allow for new projects and capabilities. mBlock is based on Scratch 2.0, a code teaching program, so it should be easy for kids who've done some Arduino programming to pick up.
Other features include remote control via WiFi (letting kids water plants or feed pets via a smartphone), high durability, third-party software (including Microsoft's Cognitive Services AI platform) and Lego compatibility, presumably letting you marry Neuron with Mindstorms, or at least use Lego blocks as structural elements in projects.
The Makebot Neuron project is launching on Kickstarter starting at $69, meaning you're taking a mild risk ordering it. However, the Shenzhen, China-based company says its products are in over 25,000 schools, and it has done a bunch of successful Kickstarter campaigns, including the mBot robot building kit (above), Codeybot code-teaching robot and Airblock drone-cum-hovercraft, which garnered $830,000 by itself.
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — At least 60 inmates died during a prison riot in the northern state of Amazonas, including several who were beheaded or dismembered, in the biggest killing at a Brazilian prison since 1992.
Amazonas state public security secretary Sergio Fontes said that in addition to the deaths, some inmates escaped, but he did not say how many. He added that 40 had been recaptured.
Twelve prison guards were held hostage by the inmates, though none was wounded.
“This is the biggest prison massacre in our state's history,” Fontes said during a press conference. The riot at the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex began Sunday afternoon and lasted until Monday morning.
It was the largest death toll during a Brazilian prison riot since the killing of 111 inmates by police officers in the Carandiru penitentiary in São Paulo in 1992. Police said they acted in self-defense then.
Fontes confirmed that many of the dead had been beheaded and Judge Luis Carlos Valois, who negotiated the end of the riot with inmates, said he saw many bodies that were quartered.
“I never saw anything like that in my life. All those bodies, the blood,” Valois wrote on Facebook.
Authorities said the riot apparently grew out of a fight between two of the country's biggest crime gangs of the country over control of several prisons. Fontes said the inmates made few demands to end the riot, which hints at a killing spree organized by members of a local gang, the Family of the North, against those of the First Command of the Capital that is based in São Paulo.
The secretary said that officers found a hole in a prison wall through which weapons entered the building. Several firearms were found in the post-riot search by police.
The First Command, nationally known as PCC, is the most powerful drug and prison gang in Brazil and it has been trying to extend its reach to northern prisons dominated by the Family of the North.
Valois said that during the negotiations, inmates only asked “that we did not transfer them, made sure they were not attacked and kept their visitation.”
The riot ended after the inmates freed the last of the 12 prison staffers they had held hostage, Valois said.
In another prison in Amazonas, 87 inmates escaped in the first hours of Monday, Fonte said.
One of the inmates posted a picture on Facebook as he left the prison.
Amazonas police are investigating whether there is a link between the riot and the escape.
5,800 shell cos under govt glare over deposits post note ban
Press Trust of India, New Delhi, Oct 6 2017, 14:10 IST
Last month, the government imposed restrictions on operations of bank accounts of over 2 lakh 'struck-off' companies. Image for representation.
Intensifying its crackdown on black money, the government today said it has collated information about 5,800 shell companies whose near zero- balance accounts saw nearly Rs 4,574 crore of deposits post note ban and Rs 4,552 crore withdrawal thereafter.
"Vital information has been received from 13 banks regarding the bank account operations and post-demonetisation transactions of some of the 2,09,032 suspicious companies that had been struck off the Register of Companies earlier this year," the government said in a statement today.
Last month, the government imposed restrictions on operations of bank accounts of over 2 lakh 'struck-off' companies.
Terming it as a "major breakthrough" in fight against black money and shell companies, it said the first instalment of data pertains to about 5,800 companies -- out of more than 2 lakh that were struck off -- involving 13,140 accounts.
"Few of the companies have been found to have more than 100 accounts to their names. The highest grosser among This is a company having 2,134 accounts, followed by others having accounts in the range of 900, 300 etc," it said.
The data on pre-demonetisation accounts and transactions conducted during the cash ban period is "startling", the government stated.
After separating the loan accounts, these companies had a meagre balance of Rs 22.05 crore on November 8, 2016.
"However, from November 9, 2016 (after the announcement of demonetisation), till the date of their being struck off, these companies have altogether deposited a huge amount of Rs 4,573.87 crore in their accounts and withdrawn an equally large amount of Rs 4,552 crore," the statement said.
With loan accounts, there was a negative opening balance of Rs 80.79 crore in these accounts.
Companies had multiple accounts with minuscule or negative balance as on November 8, 2016, which have seen deposits and withdrawal running into several crores. The accounts were thereafter again left as dormant with paltry balance.
"This exercise of swindling the authorities was carried out post demonetisation till the companies were struck off. In some cases, certain companies have gone more adventurous and made deposits and withdrawals even after being struck off," it said.
Citing an example, it said that in one of the banks, 429 companies having zero balance each on November 8, 2016, deposited and withdrew over Rs 11 crore and left again with a cumulative balance of just Rs 42,000 as on the date of the freeze.
Similarly, in the case of another bank, more than 3,000 such companies -- most having multiple accounts -- have been located.
From having a cumulative balance of about Rs 13 crore as on November 8, 2016, these companies have deposited and withdrawn about Rs 3,800 crore, leaving a negative cumulative balance of almost Rs 200 crore at the time of freezing of their accounts.
"It needs to be re-emphasised that this data is only about 2.5 per cent of the total number of suspected companies that have been struck off by the government. The huge money game played by these companies may well be the tip of an iceberg of corruption, black money and black deeds of these and many more of their brethren," the statement said.
Investigative agencies have been asked to complete necessary investigation in a time-bound manner.
After being removed from the list, operations of the bank accounts of 2,09,032 suspicious companies were restricted for discharge of their liabilities only.

The billionaire Beny Steinmetz was detained by the Israeli police on Monday morning for questioning in connection with an investigation into money laundering, obstruction of justice and bribery, officials said.
Mr. Steinmetz, an Israeli diamonds, mining and real estate magnate, is already under scrutiny by law enforcement authorities in four other countries, including the United States. Federal prosecutors in the United States are investigating whether representatives of his firm bribed government officials in Guinea to secure a multibillion-dollar mining deal. In Switzerland and Guinea, prosecutors have conducted similar inquiries. He was previously detained and questioned in Israel in December.
Since 2013, the United States Justice Department has been investigating Mr. Steinmetz's company, BSG Resources, over potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Guinean government has claimed that BSG Resources obtained an iron ore mining concession by paying more than $8 million in cash through a representative to the then-wife of the country's president.
The focus of the Israeli investigation appears to be more expansive, based on an official statement that said that authorities were investigating “a number of people on suspicion that they acted systematically together with the main suspect in order to create and present fictitious contracts and deals, among other things in the field of real estate in a foreign country, for the purpose of transferring funds and money laundering.”

Mr. Steinmetz is also under indictment in Romania, as part of a broad investigation into money laundering and real estate there.

THE Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia (RASWA) announced Lauren Rayner as the recipient of the 2018 Bendat Family Youth Scholarship, awarded to a young Western Australian who is enrolled in a bachelor level course at an Australian university in an agricultural-related discipline.
Living in Brookton and then attending the WA College of Agriculture, Narrogin, Ms Rayner has always been passionate about agriculture.
“Agriculture brings people together from all over the world with different ideas, practice and specialties,” Ms Rayner said.
She will be using her scholarship to continue studying animal science and crop and pastoral science at Murdoch University, hoping to become an agronomist or wool agent.
The Royal Agricultural Society Foundation has been created to give educational and community funds to young people in agriculture.
It would provide them with the ability to be able to continue their agricultural studies.
RASWA president Paul Carter said scholarships were a great opportunity to encourage young people to study and work in agriculture.
“Lauren is a great member of the agricultural industry and we are excited she is the recipient of this year's scholarship,” Mr Carter said.
“We look forward to her participating in RASWA events in the lead up to this year's Perth Royal Show.”

Locally owned and operated comics and gaming shop Infinity Flux will host their third-annual New Year's Eve party Sunday, December 31. The event provides an alternative to the typical New Year's Eve parties, offering a night of gaming to new and seasoned gamers.
“Our annual New Year's Eve party is a way for us to say thank you to the amazing customers and friends we've met over the years. It's also become a fun time to meet new folks who haven't heard about the shop and show them how exciting and friendly the gaming community is.” -- Meagan Frey, event organizer and Infinity Flux employee
Infinity Flux boasts a selection of over 100 board game demos, and volunteers will be on-hand all night to teach games to new players. The event is free to attending and will also include a photo booth area, snacks and party favors, and, of course, a midnight countdown.
The shop recently celebrated their third-year in business and, as of last year, have expanded their comic offerings by opening a second, all-comics storefront (located in the same plaza).
In the last year, there's been a big drop in support for charter schools, while other forms of school choice are getting a little less unpopular. That's the top line of a national poll released today.
President Trump and his education secretary Betsy DeVos have put school choice front and center on their education agenda. The general idea of "choice," however, takes many forms.
Charter schools are paid for by tax dollars, charge no tuition and are managed independently of public school districts.
Vouchers allow students to use tax dollars to pay tuition at private schools.
Tax-credit scholarships, now available in 17 states, which allow individuals and companies to get a tax credit for donating to scholarship funds that are used in turn for private school tuition.
U.S. opinion on these ideas seems to be shifting, according to a new poll from EducationNext, an opinion and policy journal associated with free-market education reform ideas. They've been asking similar questions for the past decade.
Here are the latest results:
Charters: Last year 51 percent of the public supported "the formation of charter schools"; this year it's just 39 percent, a 12 point drop in one year.
Vouchers: 45 percent are either strongly or somewhat supportive of universal vouchers. That's a bounce from last year, but more or less in line with the five years before.
Tax credits: This was the most popular form of school choice with 55 percent of the general public supporting this year; also a one-year bounce, but in line with longer-term trends.
There's no one obvious explanation for the change in opinion on charter schools. The drop was seen among both Democrats and Republicans and amongst all racial and ethnic groups.
"That's the largest change on any survey item, and one of the largest single-year changes in opinion that we've seen over the 11-year history of the survey," Martin West, the editor-in-chief of EducationNext, said on a press conference call.
The wording of the question — about the formation of charter schools — may hold a clue. In theory, it might be possible to have very positive feelings about the charter schools currently in your community, yet still oppose new ones.
And the expansion of charters is exactly what communities around the country have been fighting over.
Last year the NAACP and Black Lives Matter called for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools (the NAACP called more recently for a ban on for-profit management of these schools). The state of Massachusetts saw a bruising fight over its charter cap. Detroit's proliferation of charters has been labeled "a glut" and "chaos." And charter expansion was the central issue in the school board race in Los Angeles, one of the biggest public school districts in the country.
The nationally representative poll breaks down respondents by political party, and there's a clear partisan divide on many issues, even as public opinion shifts. Last year, for example, 57 percent of Democrats favored universal vouchers, against 45 percent of Republicans. This year they've switched places: 62 percent of Republicans like them and only 50 percent of Democrats agree.
Zeroing in on that political divide, pollsters also measured what they called the "Trump effect." That is, how do responses change when some people are told that the president supports or opposes a particular issue?
They found that self-identified Republicans are more likely to support an issue if they are informed that Trump also supports it, while Democrats are the opposite. However, Trump's net influence is nearly nil, which makes him less of a force than President Obama was in this poll in 2009. Back then, when respondents on all sides were told the new President supported an education issue, they were more likely to back it, by double digits.
This poll, then, serves as a snapshot of what some have called the breakdown of a long-standing bipartisan consensus on education that dated back to No Child Left Behind.
Still, there is one enduring issue where blue- and red-state opinions are near-identical: approval of the local public schools. 55 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of Democrats give local schools a B or an A.
Over the weekend, the New York Times published a story titled, “`Testilying' by Police: A Stubborn Problem.”
“Officer Martinez tapped the bag with his foot and felt something hard, he testified. He opened the bag, leading to the discovery of a Ruger 9-millimeter handgun and the arrest of the woman,” reported the Times March 18.
“But a hallway surveillance camera captured the true story: There's no laundry bag or gun in sight as Officer Martinez and other investigators question the woman in the doorway and then stride into the apartment. Inside, they did find a gun, but little to link it to the woman, Kimberly Thomas. Still, had the camera not captured the hallway scene, Officer Martinez's testimony might well have sent her to prison.”
The concept of cops “tesilying” has received a lot of attention in the last three years, connected to the trial of the officers connected to the death of Freddie Gray, the case of the Gun Trace Task Force, as well as others. But, Baltimore residents argue officers lying in court has been a problem for decades.
According to a report in the Baltimore Sun in January, a Baltimore Police Department (BPD), detective remained on the job for weeks, after he admitted lying in court. Det. Sharod Watson said he saw a suspected drug dealer, “on a daily basis” for about 18 months, even witnessing him make a sale. However, Watson was forced to admit that testimony was “factually impossible” when prosecutors presented evidence that the suspect he spoke of, Isadore White, had been in jail for 12 of those 18 months. A jury acquitted White of all charges.
Also according to the Sun, Watson had remained on duty at least up until last month working in a special BPD unit created after the Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF), was disbanded.
Baltimore Police Commissioner Darryl De Sousa has formed a corruption investigation unit within BPD, in the wake of the GTTF scandal, which saw multiple police officers convicted for stealing, planting drugs and selling drugs.

NEW YORK (AP) – Watching NFL football games on your phone used to be mainly limited to Verizon customers. Soon anyone will be able to watch football games on the go for free on Yahoo's app, now that Verizon owns Yahoo.
But people who want to watch football through online-TV services like Sling will have more problems. An NFL game on ESPN will still be blocked on the Sling app on a phone – and starting next season, on tablets as well for some games.
Verizon bought Yahoo in June and wants to build a digital ad business to rival Facebook and Google. Verizon's five-year deal with the NFL takes effect in January. Playoffs will stream on Yahoo, Verizon's app go90 and the NFL's own app.
___
This story has been corrected to say that only some tablet games will be exclusive to Verizon.

When the National Rifle Association urged the government to revisit whether "bump stocks" should be restricted, it immediately raised eyebrows. Why would the nation's leading gun-rights organization, not known for compromise, be willing to bend even just a bit when it wields perhaps more influence than ever?
Some gun-industry experts say the NRA's move is little more than a ruse to stall any momentum for wider gun control until outrage over the Las Vegas attack subsides. It also carries little risk. For one, it's rare for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to reverse course without a change in the law. For another, "bump stocks" are not big moneymakers for the gun industry. And by seeking an administrative change, rather than a new law, the NRA allows its supporters in Congress to avoid going on the record with a vote.
"They're dismissed as silly gadgets that really inhibit the accuracy of a firearm. If these bump stocks were super popular among gun owners, we'd see a very different position from the NRA," said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law and author of "Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America."
The NRA "can throw a sacrificial lamb of 'bump stocks' because they know that gun owners don't use them or like them," he added.
The devices, originally intended to help people with disabilities, fit over the stock and pistol grip of a semi-automatic rifle and allow the weapon to fire continuously, some 400 to 800 rounds in a single minute, mimicking a fully automatic firearm. Bump stocks were found among the weapons used by Stephen Paddock as he rained bullets from a Las Vegas casino high-rise last Sunday. The gunfire killed 58 people at a concert below and wounded hundreds more.
On Thursday, the NRA issued a statement that urged the ATF to review whether the devices comply with federal law and said it "believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."
The statement pointedly noted that it was under President Barack Obama's administration that the devices were authorized to be sold and again urged Congress to enact one of the gun lobby's top priorities: a national "concealed-carry reciprocity" law that would require all states to recognize other states' concealed carry permits.
In a matter of hours, NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox put to rest any sense that the group was actively seeking a ban of bump stocks, telling Fox News' Tucker Carlson: "What we've said is ATF needs to do their job. ATF needs to look and if there's technology that's come to the market that allow for a semi-automatic rifle to function as a fully automatic rifle, they need to be regulated differently. We didn't talk about banning anything."
Notably, the nation's other leading gun lobbying groups, including Gun Owners of America, reiterated their opposition to restricting or banning the devices.
The few companies that sell bump stocks are known to include in their packaging a letter from the ATF from 2010, when the agency concluded that they were not restricted by either the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.
The ATF provides guidance when a manufacturer asks the agency to evaluate a firearm or accessory to determine if its sale is restricted by either federal law. It is extremely rare for the ATF to reconsider its previous guidance unless federal law changes — so rare that experts could think of only one time when it has happened, and even then they weren't sure their memories were correct.
The agency, describing its process in general on Friday, indicated that Congress will be responsible for decisions about regulating or banning the devices.
It was not immediately clear whether President Donald Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the ATF, could order it to re-evaluate its judgment about devices.
The NRA is viewed as the most powerful and most inflexible group in the gun lobby. It pours millions of dollars into political campaigns and successfully blocks legislation that would either ban certain firearms or make them more difficult to purchase. The NRA has only gained influence following the election of Trump, who became the first president since Ronald Reagan to address the group's annual meeting.
After some particularly deadly mass shootings, the NRA has worked to find some common ground with gun-control advocates.
Following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting in which a mentally ill student shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17, the NRA worked with gun-control advocates to fund a bill designed to improve record keeping so that people with mental illnesses were unable to purchase a firearm.
In the days following the Las Vegas attack, unusual alliances began to emerge between top Democratic and Republican members of Congress urging that bump stocks be banned. If the devices were restricted by an administrative ruling, it would spare NRA supporters in Congress from having to go on the record with a vote.
John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, cast the NRA's move as a "wink and a nod."
"They're not making a concession. What they've really done is punted this to the very federal agency that said bump stocks were legal," Feinblatt said. "This was just a wink and nod."
A Lancashire children's hospice is looking ahead to an ‘exciting' year, with a new plan to improve its services and events to mark its 25th anniversary.
Following a recent Care Quality Commission report, which declared some areas of Derian House needed improvement, management and trustees have come up with a plan to address previous concerns and an action-packed calender of events.
In the report published last month, the hospice, in Chancery Road, Chorley, was marked needing improvement in three areas, but after parents' glowing reports about the level of support they received, it had a good rating for its care and responsiveness.

/mystery-of-blue-circles-revealed-as-derian-house-launches-dream-appeal-1-7740262
David Robinson, vice chairman of the trustees, said: “We are moving forward with a plan and have new strategies to be presented to our staff next week.
“Everybody wants to do better all the time. We want to focus on how we can be outstanding in everything we do.
“We have a great team of dedicated people and our commitment to children, young people and their families continues. The future is bright. We have our 25th anniversary in October. It is an exciting year for us as we celebrate the landmark of 25 years caring for children and young people, which is a massive achievement.
“We have so many great things planned. We have a gala in June, a silver anniversary ball in October, the winter sparkle in November. These are our usual events but they will be bigger and better to celebrate 25 years.”
The charity is also looking for new trustees, following the departure of its chairman, Les Paul, after nine years.
David added: “Les Paul has done a great job for nine years. He has been passionate about the care and interests of the children and has given great support to everyone. He will be missed.
“We have a robust board of trustees and a decision about who will be the new chairman will go through the board.
“We are always looking for more trustees. We like to get a broad range of skills, but it would be great if anyone with a medical, care or commercial background was interested.”
Assassin's Creed Origins is a new take on the formulaic franchise, sending players to explore the mysteries of Ancient Egypt and the rise of Cleopatra. Everything has changed, and here are seven examples that might get you interested in the series again.
After the release of Assassin's Creed Unity, fans have mostly agreed that the basic premise is pretty played-out. Improvements came in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, putting players in control of a pair of assassin siblings in London, greatly improving the gameplay, but avoiding any structural changes to the series.
That all changes in Assassin's Creed Origins. This is a true sequel, one with new mechanics, new combat -- basically new everything. Let's get into the nitty-gritty and show off seven serious changes in the upcoming Assassin's Creed.
Instead of rehashing the endless conflict between Templars and Assassins, Origins takes place in ancient Egypt, at the time of Cleopatra. The Roman Legion occupies the north-African breadbasket, and arenas have been established across the nation.
You take the role of a local village protector named Bayek. The Assassin Brotherhood is still a thing, because both societies (in Assassin's Creed lore) are based on precursor ancient civilizations. The goal of Origins, it seems, is to refresh the setting and offer players something new instead of another standard Templar conflict.
Taking a page from the Dark Souls playbook, you'll have to lock-on, block, attack and parry in a slower, more precise style. You won't be swarmed by giant groups of opponents, instead pitting Bayek against small groups, or even on-on-one.
Like Dark Souls, you have a shield to block incoming attacks and light or heavy attacks for offense. You'll be able to dodge, too -- an important tactic, because enemies are much more difficult this time around.
No more awkward sword-swinging foolishness, Origins lets you ride into battle on horseback (or camel-back) and all your combat controls match-up whether you're on-foot or mounted. You'll even encounter enemy riders as well, forcing you to take on the group while riding.
Remember the mini-map that used to take up the bottom-right corner of your screen in every Assassin's Creed entry? That's gone. Instead of hunting collectibles and chasing waypoints, you'll take quests -- similar to Skyrim, Fallout or other open-world RPGs.
Taking away the mini-map might sound like an annoyance, but you'll gain a trusty partner to make exploration much easier. At any point, you can send your eagle to fly into the sky, searching for quests or other "?" spots of interest.
Like Metal Gear Sold 5's binoculars, you can use your eagle to mark enemies in an area before engaging (or sneaking) to complete a quest.
Following the open-world RPG format, the hero of Origins doesn't just gain XP and levels. As you level up, you'll unlock skill points, letting you enhance your arsenal of abilities down several separate skill trees.
The three skill trees are: warrior, hunter and seer. The warrior is all about combat and melee weapons. The hunter focuses on archery and enhances your eagle's abilities, while the seer unlocks skills related to tools, such as smokescreens.
Black Flag included a gentle smattering of underwater exploration during its diving bell segments, but Origins allows our hero Bayek to explore literally anywhere along the Nile. Hop into a skiff and track treasure, then swim underwater to collect it.
That's not all. The various tombs, pyramids, and other locations are basically "dungeons" in all but name. You'll be able to delve into these places much like Skyrim, and if you're not prepared for a challenge, you can so easily get turned into a bloody puddle.
Ending the first official trailer, there's something we haven't really seen in any of the other Assassin's Creed games -- real boss battles. A giant snake attacks Bayek, and that isn't the only challenging super-opponents you'll encounter.
In the coliseums, you'll often do battle with unique enemy types, but survive long enough and there are true-blue bosses that appear. These armored opponents have their own unique moves and personalities, and while Origins isn't meant to be as difficult as a game like Dark Souls, these titanic battles aim to get your blood pumping, rather than end in an anticlimactic stabbing like almost every other Assassin's Creed battle.
There's so much more new and different in Assassin's Creed Origins we can't cover it all here. You'll also find Far Cry's wild animal systems, ambient faction battles, and an inventory system overhaul. Keep following The Escapist as we bring you more Assassin's Creed news in the near future.
The man who drove his car into a restaurant near Paris on Monday evening reportedly told police he wanted to kill himself and had weapons in the car.
However, the incident is not being treated as a terror attack for the time being, according to RTL radio.
A Denver jury found fully in pop singer Taylor Swift's favor Monday, delivering a unanimous verdict in a trial over whether she was groped by a former radio host during a Denver meet-and-greet. Wanting the trial to serve as an "example to other women," the star had sought a single dollar in damages, which she was granted.
In his closing statements, Swift's lawyer Douglas Baldridge referenced the example that Swift hoped her suit could be for others in similar situations "by returning a verdict on Ms. Swift's counterclaim for a single dollar — a single symbolic dollar, the value of which is immeasurable to all women in this situation."
In his own closing arguments, David Mueller attorney Gabriel McFarland wondered why his client would introduce himself by name and then almost immediately after reach under the skirt of "one of the planet's, one of the country's, the biggest superstars?"
The case was largely fought on the credibility of Swift and Mueller.
Late this past Friday, a federal judge threw out part of the case brought against Swift by Mueller, saying he had not proven Swift had set out to get him fired.
Swift countersued Mueller for sexual assault after his own suit was filed in 2015, leading to Denver trial which began jury selection last Monday. Swift initially had sought to keep the incident quiet.
By Friday, most of the principals in the case had been heard from — most notably Ms. Swift herself, who had several sharp rejoinders to questions from Mueller's attorney. Asked about Mueller's firing, Swift responded: "I am not going to allow your client to make me feel like it is anyway my fault, because it isn't."
Modular refineries will create massive jobs in Niger Delta says Ex-PENGASSAN
BY JIMITOTA ONOYUME
Former national president, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN Dr Brown Ogbeifun in this interview encouraged the quick take off of modular refineries in the Niger Delta , saying it would create over twenty jobs across the region. According to him, before the refineries would take off Excravos, Koko, Sapele, Burutu ports in Delta state would be dredged, noting that this would step up employment opportunities for teeming youths in the region .
Excerpt:
Lets here your take on modular refineries and its impact in the Niger Delta region
The reason I support modular is because of the devastatng effect of vandalism, stealing of crude from pipelines that stretches through kilometers to get to their end points which it would redress. . Modular refineries will come closer to the source of raw materials, you are not likely to use long stretch of pipelines that will be vandalized. But this will require federal government to ensure our waterways, ports are back because you will need to do a lot of dredging. Modular refineries are small refineries to provide few stock to a dedicated target. When the waterways and ports are back the vessels can come closer to the refineries. When you refurbish Koko, Gelegele, Ports, Warri ports this will enhance the refineries. And the dredging will mean a thousand of job opportunities for youths in the region.
When we have modular refineries in an area it will create jobs for people around. people will be trained in the art of refining , the local content law that encourages engagement of locals for certain jobs will come in force. It will also help us deal with the environmental hazards from attack on oil facilities, illegal bunkering activities
Vice President, Prof Yemi Osibanjo during a tour of the region as Acting President said international oil companies should relocate their headquarters to the region. Any word for the region?
There are so many factors for the pronouncement of the Vice President, Professor Osibanjo to IOCs when he toured the region to come on stream . The governments of states in the region need to also see what they can do to be more friendly, these companies are in business. Any oil and gas person is in business to make money. They go through a lot of unsecured environment. If you want to pull people back to the region you must be ready to guaranty security.
Again the companies are facing multiple taxation, from the local government to the states it is not something that is easy for the multinationals, that is why we are talking of the Petroleum Indusry Bill, to harmonize the taxes, so it is not about a marching order from the presidency. You must have an environment that is safe , economically viable and conducive for their operations.
Government at all levels must go beyond lip service. Warri used to be the hub of activities for shell. Government must go beyond lip service. When they were divesting from shallow waters, land, I am sure more than sixty percent of their assets were given out. What would stop the governor of the state from intervening. If they are here our children will have job. This would have made the economy of the state bubble. This would reduce the level of unemployment, insecurity in the region. We lost it because they just folded their arms and allowed it to happen.”
Lets hear your assessment of the amnesty program for ex militants in the Niger delta
Let us go the memory lane and ask how militancy started, it may be my own opinion with all I have read and seen and from the angle of the oil and gas sector. Militancy has three dimensions we need to look at them so we don't get wrong answers.
Militancy started with agitations for a better Niger delta, here is a region that is underdeveloped yet you have most of the resources of the nation from the region. The boys in the creeks are seeing what the elites are doing with their wealth from the region through illegal bunkering . it is not a poor man who could afford badges and military excorts for the badges on the waterways for illicit oil deals. The people in the communities were seeing it so the boys were relatively angry.
Also you look at the political elites that have used some of the boys for electioneering purposes abandoning the boys without means of livelihood. So they go back to the creeks. The third aspects are that there are those that are into criminality but powdered as militancy. You can see the genuine agitation for resource control, those used and dumped by politicians and the criminals in the system. It became a little bit more difficult as they progressed to identify who is who
Whether we like it or not the region has suffered a lot of underdevelopment because the money that is taken from the region is not commensurate with the development in the region. Go to Norway they have a museum, that has become a tourist attraction on how they started, the money has been used to improve education, heath in the country as a whole, the area where the oil is from has become a tourist attraction.
You talked about the amnesty, I think it was President Musa Yar Adua that came up with it. The very bad state of having assets of companies destroyed in the region. The creek is not where you can use military operations. Dialogue becomes the appropriate approach. In all states in the world with similar problems you do a lot of mediation. Amnesty in this sense was not a bad concept. When it started you saw the mop of arms , it reduced the level of criminality in the region. Our oil production went up.
However, the implementation became a little bit faulty. The real resource control foot solders that were there in the creeks could not be said to have formerly benefited as a whole, people who did not know why and where militancy started became the beneficiaries , relatives were brought in. it became cumbersome, suddenly the budgets could not carter for those it should , that is the truth . I believe that scrapping the amnesty program is not a solution, , we have to define it properly. Again I do not believe that amnesty is forever. Today we have youths who graduated from aviation schools that are pilots and several other programs in the Universities it shows that the guys are intelligent.
If we do the amnesty program well and concentrate on the militants , I am sure today we would have had just a few left. Because most of them would have been empowered to work. We have not been able to deal with the militancy because of the sharp practices mentioned.
Any word for the youths as a labour leader?.
Militancy or resource agitations should not connote destruction of national assets because the more you do the more you deploy money needed for other developmental purpose to fix the assets. For example three or four times the Excravos line that supplies crude to refineries are blown this happens almost yearly. The money to repair it should go to other areas. The only way is to have platforms were people can bare their minds. So our youths should embrace dialogue to arrive at solution to issues of underdevelopment in the region.
The environment is badly hampered by exploration activities, you talk of black sooth it is real,. You have your first rain of the year in the region, you can see the hydrocarbons as black as they are in your buckets and people inhale this on a daily basis. Dr Brown Ogbeifun The thing we need to do as a nation is to have a regulatory framework to reduce gas flare. We have paid too much lip service to ending gas flare. The people don't have water to fish any more. We should also discourage attack on oil facilities, the region is suffering it. The environment suffers.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Australia captain Steve Smith will return home from the tour of India due to a shoulder injury, Cricket Australia announced just hours before the opener of a three-match Twenty20 series against the hosts on Saturday.
Smith hurt his right shoulder diving in the field during the fifth and final one-day international against India at Nagpur on Sunday, adding injury to the insult of a 4-1 series loss for the visitors.
The board said an MRI scan had ruled out any serious injury and the 28-year-old would be fit for the start of the domestic season and lead Australia against arch-rivals England at home in the Ashes series starting on Nov. 23 in Brisbane.
"Following the (Nagpur) match, he (Smith) complained of shoulder soreness, which has not settled and is restricting his ability to bat and throw," team doctor Richard Saw said.
"Subsequently he has had an MRI scan which has excluded serious injury but we believe the best course of action is for him to not continue to aggravate his shoulder and allow it to recover.
"He will have further investigation upon his return to Australia but we remain confident he will be available for the start of the Sheffield Shield season."
Vice-captain David Warner would lead Australia in the Twenty20 series, while all-rounder Marcus Stoinis would replace Smith in the squad, Cricket Australia added in a statement.

Up to 185,000 jobs could be put at risk if Ontario's Liberal government keeps its pledge to increase the minimum wage to $15.
Those are the findings of an “independent assessment” of Bill 148, the Liberal's Fair Workplaces Better Jobs Act. The bill will hike the minimum wage — currently set to rise with inflation from $11.40 an hour to $11.60 in October, up to $14 on Jan. 1, 2018, and $15 the following year.
But the according to a study commissioned by Ontario's Chamber of Commerce, the bill will put jobs at risk and have “dramatic unintended consequences.” Chamber vice- president Karl Baldauf said the province needs to slow down and amend its legislation.
“Should the government move forward with these vast, unprecedented reforms, there will be significant, sudden and sizable uncertainty for jobs and economic growth in Ontario,” he said. The report also says that Ontario businesses will see a $23 billion “hit” over the next two years because of the legislation. While the changes won't cause mass layoffs, they will kill job growth, said Paul Smetanin, president of the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis, which conducted the study.
“The results are not sensationalized,” Smetanin said. “We have been conservative in adopting what literature suggests. It pains us to have to deliver such a message.”
The report also estimates there will be costs for the Ontario government itself. Increased costs associated with the bill will add $440 million in debt to the province's treasury.
“As I go from community to community, the thing that I'm hearing over and over again is that these changes are all too much too fast,” he said.
Labour Minister Kevin Flynn said the government will review the findings the report. It's one of a “long list” of studies on the topic, he added.
“We recognize there are concerns from the business community,” he said in a statement. “We've worked hard to make sure Ontario's business climate is competitive, and we are committed to working with the business community to bring forward initiatives that will improve our competitiveness even more.
That being said, we will not back down from our plan to bring fairness to Ontarians.”
Progressive Conservative labour critic John Yakabuski said the Liberal government needs to conduct its own economic impact study of the new bill.
“It'll be a tragedy if all of these 185,000 people are put out of work,” Yakabuski said in a statement. “A higher minimum wage doesn't help if Ontarians don't have a job to wake up to in the morning.”

Small businesses will be hit hard: CFIB
ANTONELLA ARTUSO
An economic analysis of proposed labour law changes including a $15-an-hour minimum wage confirms that small businesses are going to get hit hard, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says.
Julie Kwiecinski, the CFIB's director of provincial affairs in Ontario, said its own member survey shows that one-third are considering shutting down or moving in response to the mandatory wage hikes beginning with a $14-an-hour minimum on Jan. 1.
“Unfortunately, we have felt and seen the government do their eye rolls at us... not believing what we were saying in our survey,” Kwiecinski said Monday. “They're scared, they're worried that this is actually going to start taking effect on Jan. 1.”
A report prepared by the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis (CANCEA), on behalf of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Keep Ontario Working Coalition, says small businesses are five times more likely to be impacted by the new provincial labour legislation than large companies.
The government bill goes before a committee next week when MPPs will have the chance to introduce amendments, she said.
“If people think it's bad now, it could get worse in terms of the cost to business and jobs when the whole process is said and done,” Kwiecinski said.
The Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) issued a statement Monday dismissing the findings of the CANCEA analysis as “inaccurate, incomplete and just not responsible.”
The “corporate lobby” analysis fails to consider economic benefits to raising the minimum wage such as higher consumer spending and reduced demand on social services, the OFL statement says.
Peer-reviewed economic research has found that contrary to the report's claim that 185,000 jobs are at risk, increases in minimum wage have “very small, if any impacts” on employment levels, the statement says.
CANCEA said in its report that it is independent and does not accept any research funding that requires a pre-determined result or policy stance.

Billy Bragg has been releasing one-off political tracks all year long, and today he's put out a new one called “Saffiyah Smiles” that was inspired by a viral photo of Saffiyah Khan smiling while protesting an anti-immigrant demonstration in Birmingham last spring. Bragg provided some more context to NPR:
Following the shocking scenes of white supremacists marching through the streets of Charlottesville this past summer, my mind went back to an image of a young woman facing down a ranting fascist with nothing but a serene smile. Saffiyah Khan had been taking part in a counter demonstration against the neo-fascist English Defence League in Birmingham, England, in April this year when she saw a woman being surrounded by taunting EDL supporters. Saria Zafar was targeted because she was wearing a hijab and when the police failed to intervene, Saffiyah stepped up and got in the face of the loudest aggressor, holding him at bay with nothing more than a smile until police eventually intervened. A press photographer (Joe Giddens) captured the moment and the picture went viral. Local Labour MP Jess Phillips memorably tweeted the image with the caption, ‘Who looks like they have the power here?'
Listen to the song below.

(KARK/NBC News) — A young Arkansas mother's final moments were streamed on Facebook Live as friends watch helplessly from afar.
25-year-old Keiana Herndon went live Wednesday from a friend's home, where she was staying with her young son.
The video starts out with Keiana singing. You see and hear her respond to viewers and even put the spotlight on her son.
A few minutes later, Keiana falls and the phone drops out of her hands.
Her uncle, Jeffrey Herndon, said he could hear his niece struggle to breath and her son scream in the background.
“It was real hard,” he said.
All the while, the number of eyes on her grew.
A friend showed up nearly 30 minutes after Keiana hit the floor.
Keiana's father wishes someone watching would have acted sooner.
“It's amazing for someone to sit there and see somebody or hear them take their last breath and nobody did anything,” said Richard. “So, I want to take my hat off to everybody that actual did something.”
Keiana's mother is heartbroken.
“She had thyroid problems. The thyroid messes with everything and it triggered her heart. It's a tragedy, I know that much, and I know one thing, I would love to have my baby back with me,” Keiana's mother, Mary Morgan told KATV.
A GoFundMe account has been created for Keiana's family.

The Arizona Diamondbacks are heading to the National League Division Series.
The Diamondbacks held on to beat the Colorado Rockies 11-8 in a heart-stopping matchup in Phoenix on Wednesday night to win the National League Wild Card game. Former Cy Young Award winner Zack Grienke started for the Diamondbacks against Colorado's Jon Gray, but both pitchers combined for only five innings pitched in a crazy contest that saw Arizona jump out to a six-run lead early on before the Rockies closed the deficit to one on two occasions in the late innings.
A career .098 hitter coming into the game, Arizona reliever Archie Bradley laced his first career extra-base hit, a two-run triple, into the left-center gap off the Rockies All-Star Pat Neshek to give the D-backs an 8-5 lead in the seventh inning.
But Bradley went out to the mound in the eighth and gave up back-to-back solo home runs to Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story. He later allowed a two-out double to Pat Valaika to put the tying run at second base before settling down and inducing a flyout from Jonathan Lucroy, who'd reach base in his previous three plate appearances, to end the threat.
The Snakes then added three insurance runs in the bottom of the frame before Colorado eked out one in the ninth against Fernando Rodney, who closed it down to ensure the Diamondbacks advanced to the National League Division Series for the first time since 2011.
Arizona had opened up a six-run lead by the third inning by battering Gray, who didn't get out of the second inning against Arizona's vaunted lineup. The D-backs plated three runs against Gray before the 25-year-old recorded an out, thanks to a monstrous three-run homer from Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt.
Gray escaped the opening frame without further damage, but after Diamondbacks shortstop Ketel Marte tripled in the second inning to bring home David Peralta, Rockies manager Bud Black pulled Gray with Colorado down 4-0 after four outs. A two-run shot from Daniel Descalso in the third inning extended Arizona's lead to six runs.
That would normally be more than enough to work with for Greinke, but Arizona's ace completely fell apart in the fourth. The Rockies drove in runs on four consecutive at-bats, with pinch-hitter Alexi Amarista's line-drive single up the middle making it 6-4 to signal the end for Greinke. It was the shortest postseason start of his career.
However, the Snakes clung to the lead behind No. 2 starter Robbie Ray, who made his first relief appearance since 2014 and hurled 2.1 innings of one-run ball. The final innings certainly weren't without their drama, but Arizona led throughout it all to survive.
Major League Baseball expanded to two Wild Card teams in each league in 2012, prompting the creation of the one-game Wild Card playoff for the right to play in the Division Series. Arizona will now move on to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS.
Stakeholders Call for Review of Tax Policies in Real Estate Sector
Emma Okonji
Worried that the effects of the high rate of taxes is taking a toll on the real estate sector, its stakeholders on Tuesday, called on the federal and state governments to review their tax policies and provide incentives where necessary.
The stakeholders who spoke at the first Construction and Real Estate Group Seminar, with the theme: Navigating Tax Issues In Real Estate Transactions, organised by the Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) in Lagos, said there was need for people to pay taxes, but insisted that taxes must not be imposed in such a way that will force taxpayers out of business.
There expressed worries the that government pays less attention to the survival of any business, as long as it (government) collect taxes at all cost. The stakeholders who were particularly concerned about Company Income Tax and Value Added Tax, called on the federal and state governments to come up with clear terms for the payment of such taxes, which they said, were contradictory and confusing, while calling for total review of the tax policies in the country.
The forum called for review of tax policy at the federal and state government levels. Tax payers in Lagos are of the view that the Lagos State government is unduly imposing taxes on them with the motive to run them out of business
Deputy President of NBCC, Mr. Akin Olawore, who spoke to THISDAY shortly after the seminar, said the Chamber created idea focus group, and charged them with the responsibility of discovering societal challenges, in order to create solution to address issues.
“The essence of the seminar is to address tax issues in the real estate sector. The Federal Government and the Lagos State Government are keen about the ease of doing business and the forum seeks to address tax issues in real estate transaction as it relates to ease of doing business,” Olawore said.
“What was observed was that taxes are no longer used by government as a measurable tool, but as a revenue generating tool. It is not being used to direct development, but being used to generate money for government at the detriment of tax payers.
Government needs to loosen taxes in order to develop the economy. Government can increase taxation when it wants to reduce consumption, especially when government feels three is too much money in circulation and people are consuming too much, with large appetite for importation. Such tax could reduce consumption of foreign goods and services. But when government discovers that the economy is shrinking and things are becoming tight, government should be able to loosen taxes and give the people some breathing space,” Olawore said.
According to him, when the US had financial crises in the past, they relaxed tax and that is how it is done globally and Nigeria should be able to learn from other countries of the world. He said government must ensure enough cashflow in the hands of the people so that manufacturers will be able to produce and and people will be able to do good businesses, and jobs will be created.
Representative of the Chairman, Board of Internal Revenue Service in Lagos, Mr. Tunji Oshekun, who defended government position in the area of tax collection, said the money collected by the Lagos State Government on taxation is being used to develop the state by providing essential amenities like roads, electricity and water for citizens of the state.
But stakeholders were of the view that government should reduce the rate of taxes levied on citizens.
If taxes are reduced, more people will pay their taxes and government will make more money. Today not everybody is paying tax and we have a lot of tax evaders because they cannot afford to pay high taxes, so they have refused to register their properties. But when taxes are reduced, more people will register their businesses and properties, more people will go to bank to borrow money and government will make more money from the increased volume of transactions, the stakeholders said.
Olawore warned that should the challenges of tax persist, the nation will not develop and it will affect job creation. It will scare foreign investors and the few local investors will continue to struggle to make ends meet, and corruption will increase because people will begin to look for short corners. He was however optimistic that government would listen to the people and reduce the financial burdens of the citizens as they relate to tax collection.

LAS VEGAS -- With a day to go before kickoff, four reported million-dollar bets have already been placed on Super Bowl LII - all four on the underdog Philadelphia Eagles.
A bettor on Friday at William Hill placed a $1 million money-line bet on the Eagles at 155 odds. If Philadelphia pulls the upset over the New England Patriots, the unnamed bettor would net a $1,550,000 profit.
Earlier in the week, William Hill reported taking a $1.6 million bet on the Eagles 4.5 and another $1 million money-line bet on Philadelphia. Last week, MGM's sportsbook reported taking a "multi-million" bet on the Eagles.
It's not uncommon for million-dollar bets to show up each year on the Super Bowl, but not this many. Last year, for example, only one $1 million bet was reported on Super Bowl LI between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons.
The Patriots were 4.5-point favorites over the Eagles on Saturday at most sportsbooks. They opened as high as 6-point favorites two weeks ago, but the majority of the early action, especially the largest bets, have been on the Eagles.
On Friday night at Caesars Palace sportsbooks, 61.4 percent of the point-spread bets and nearly 70 percent of the money that had been wagered was on the Eagles. The action was even more lopsided at William Hill, where 85 percent of the money on the point spread was on Philadelphia.
The largest reported bets on the Patriots were in the six-figure range. MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood told ESPN that the largest bet he had taken on the Patriots was a "mid-six figure" money-line bet.
The sportsbook at the South Point casino also reported taking a six-figure bet on the Patriots.
A lot could change leading up to kickoff. Las Vegas bookmakers say as much as 80 percent of the bets will be placed Saturday and Sunday. For right now, though, Las Vegas is rooting for the Patriots.
Conflicts between the two sides have resulted in many deaths, strained relations and destruction of properties.
The Paramount chiefs of both Alavanyo and Nkonya traditional areas, two communities in the Volta Region, have expressed misgivings over the intention of the government to take over the disputed land over which they have had several clashes spanning many years.
Last week, the Minister of Defence, Mr Dominic Nitiwul, stated in Parliament that the government was considering taking over the land and turning it into a military reservation.
The chiefs contend, however, that before the government annexes the land, there are certain conditions that have to be met first.
The Daily Graphic spoke with the paramount chiefs of both the Alavanyo and Nkonya traditional areas last weekend.
Alavanyo
The Paramount Chief of the Alavanyo Traditional Area, Togbe Tsedze Atakora VII, said his people were prepared to accept any initiative by government to take over the land on condition that families in Alavanyo that had been adversely affected by conflicts were compensated as they would lose a major component of their source of livelihood.
He said the chiefs of Alavanyo had not received any official notification of the government's plan.
“If that is the only step to be taken to ensure everlasting peace in the area and end the wanton loss of lives of innocent citizens in the name of the conflict, then it would be appropriate to sit down and talk,” he said.
Togbe Atakora VII said the land boundaries that had existed between them since the time of their ancestors and in the colonial times must serve as evidence in resolving the land issue.
For her part, the Paramount Queen of Alavanyo, Mamaga Ametor II, said many governments had over the years expressed similar ideas of appropriating the land but nothing had come out of it.
According to her, if that is the decisive step to take to bring an end to incessant killings in the area, then the people of Alavanyo will be in support of it.
Nkonya
The Nifahene of Nkonya Ahenkro, Nana Kofi Pumpuni, is of the opinion that the government must be courageous and declare the people of Nkonya real owners of the disputed land.
According to him, the dispute has been referred to the law court on seven occasions and on each occasion the court ruled in favour of the Nkonya. According to him, what is required now is to proceed on the principles of rule of law and enforce the court judgements.
Nana Pumpuni, who was speaking on behalf of the Paramount Chief of the Nkonya Traditional Area, Nana Okortor Kofi III, said no government had ever taken over any disputed lands in the country and that any takeover attempt of the Nkonya-Alavanyo lands could lead to entrenching disunity between the two peoples.
The Paramount Queen of Nkonya, Nana Otubea II, said it was not right for the government to appropriate the land because there was conflict surrounding ownership of the property. According to her, the people of Alavanyo were granted settlement on Nkonya land when they fled from Sovie.
“In the event of any land dispute, the courts are there to resolve conflicting interests. If the people involved fail to accept, recognise and respect the court's ruling, then bloody clashes (as is happening between the Nkonya and Alavanyo) are bound to happen,” she said.
The land dispute between the two traditional states is principally between some families of Nkonya-Tayi and Alavanyo-Kpeme.
Several attempts at resolving the conflict by governments, religious bodies, non-governmental organisations, the Volta Regional House of Chiefs and other concerned bodies have been largely ineffective.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has suggested transgender military members may continue to serve, despite President Donald Trump's announcement of a ban.
Mattis said Monday that the White House had still not provided policy guidance on transgender persons serving in the military, adding that they were still studying the issue, raising the prospect that transgender service members may be allowed to continue to serve despite President Donald Trump's July announcement of a ban via Twitter.
"We are going to study the issue," Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.
"The policy is going to address whether or not transgenders can serve under what conditions, what medical support they require, how much time would they be perhaps non-deployable leaving others to pick up their share of everything. There's a host of issues and I'm learning more about this than I ever thought I would and it's obviously very complex to include the privacy issues which we respect," Mattis said.
"I am waiting right now to get the President's guidance in and that I expect to be very soon," he added.
Trump announced his plan to ban transgender service members on Twitter last month. The move took the Joint Chiefs of Staff by surprise, and the Pentagon has said it is awaiting an official order from Trump before making a policy change.
The White House has yet to send official guidance to the Pentagon on the ban.
Mattis was unwilling to publicly support a 2016 Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Defense Department that put the number of transgender people in the military at between 1,320 and 6,630.
Mattis added that the guidance Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford issued still stands. In a July memo, Dunford informed service members that there will be "no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidelines." "In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect," Dunford wrote in a memo to the military that was obtained by CNN.
Mattis said the Defense Department is working with the Trump White House: "I got my people over there in the room to give them any military background that they might need to inform them but they write their own policy of course. So we are in a supporting role right now and soon we'll have, you know, the actual direction."
Last week, five active-duty transgender service members filed a lawsuit against Trump's Twitter directive, arguing it was unconstitutional.
Asked about the ban on August 10, Trump said he was doing the military "a great favor."
"I think I'm doing a lot of people a favor by coming out and just saying it," Trump said. "As you know it's been a very complicated issue for the military, it's been a very confusing issue for the military and I think I'm doing the military a great favor."

Arsenal And Leicester City Send Scouts To Watch Oghenekaro Etebo
Arsenal and Leicester are set to go head-to-head for the signature of Nigerian striker Oghenekaro Etebo, according to The Sun.
Report claims that both teams sent scouts to take a look at the 21-year-old midfielder play for Portuguese side Feirense against Porto on Thursday.
Etebo has been compared to Paul Pogba and won African Football's Most Promising Talent award in 2015 before impressing for Nigeria last summer at the Rio Olympics.
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri is wasting no time in a bid to bolster his squad to avoid an unexpected relegation dogfight.
The Foxes are set to splash the cash on midfielder Wilfred Ndidi from Genk having had an £18million deal accepted.
Etebo has become a regular in the Portuguese side in recent weeks, but has scored just once this season.
The 21-year-old has played mostly on the left wing this season, but can play in midfield or the opposite wing.
Arsenal eyes watched Etebo play 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw with Porto last Thursday.
Etebo first caught the attentions of Arsenal during the summer when he became the first player in 44 years to score four goals in an Olympic fixture.
The attacker inspired Nigeria to a 5-4 win over Japan at Rio with Monaco and Atalanta also interested in securing the youngster's signature.
Etebo is under contract with Feirense until the summer of 2018.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) – Three years after taxpayers spent $624,000 for boat ramps, shelters and other improvements to St. Petersburg's Grandview Park, neighbors say that the waterfront park has become an unsanitary homestead for the homeless.
“One of the reasons I don't put my kayak in the water anymore is because it's being used as a toilet,” said Donna Bainter, who lives a block away from the park.
Bainter told us homeless campers sometimes startle her by walking out of the mangroves along the shoreline and approach her with drunken comments while she's walking her dog.
“I tell them ‘stand back, he bites,'” Bainter said. One day, Bainter said she spotted a man bathing in the bayou right next to the boat ramp.
“He was naked and washing himself in there,” Bainter said while pointing toward the ramp.
There used to be a large dumpster located between two boat ramps and surrounded by a wall. The city removed both the wall and the dumpster, because homeless people used that area as a bathroom.
Bainter showed us at least four homeless camps located behind a thin layer of pepper trees and mangroves that line the waterfront of Grandview Park. Beer cans, liquor bottles, bedding and even crack envelopes litter the ground. Used toilet paper is everywhere.
“Normally, I wouldn't walk back here if you weren't here,” Bainter told us.
During our walk, about two people were sleeping on a narrow rickety dock behind some mangroves, while others loitered under a shelter strewn with empty beer cans. We saw one boater, and no one was using the tax-funded boat ramp.
We showed pictures of what we witnessed to City Council member Karl Nurse whose district includes Grandview Park.
“You wouldn't want to live next to that and if you were launching a boat, you'd be hesitant to launch a boat there,” Nurse said. He promised to take action.
“We'll take it back,” Nurse said. “I'll get the parks department to do their part of the cleanup and I'll be in touch with the police chief and make sure we up the police activity again.”
Police insist they haven't received complaints about homeless people taking over Grandview Park before we called. Bainter's complaint letter to the Mayor was circulated to the parks department last week, where the Parks Superintendent Phil Whitehouse said he wasn't aware of a recent homeless problem, either.
“Obviously there will be action taken,” Whitehouse said.
Nurse said if other residents have issues about Grandview Park, they should speak up. Meanwhile, it's now up to the city to reclaim it for boaters and the neighborhood.
“We'll take it back and then it becomes a need to make sure it doesn't fall of the radar,” Nurse said.

Envoy Hotel Opens on Abuja's Diplomatic Drive
Demola Ojo
In a few days, a top class boutique hotel will open its doors to guests in Abuja. The Envoy Hotel by Mantis promises to embody the spirit of Nigeria's capital city which hosts diplomats, businessmen and world leaders.
While the hotel's official opening is billed for early March, the Envoy's doors will be open in a few days from now to a privileged few.
Constructed by Hometel Developers, the five-star facility is the only commercial property on Diplomatic Drive, Abuja, where many embassies are located and is adjacent to the US Embassy.
The Envoy will be managed by South Africa-based Mantis Collection, which manages an array of properties around the world, including the only hotel in Antarctica.
According to Hometel, Mantis was chosen as the hotel's management company because of its policy of allowing individual properties maintain their unique brand identity.
The Envoy's brand identity is very special to it, as it's a concept rooted in the history of the Silk Road and the envoys deployed to help ease trade. The ancient network of trade routes was for centuries central to cultural interaction, originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West, and later to Africa.
The Envoy has 50 Standard Rooms, four Diplomatic Suites, four VIP Suites, and a Presidential Suite.
Considering its location, it is understandable that security has been given paramount importance. Chinwe Odife, Development Director at Hometel assured that the hotel is among the most secure on the continent, with a world class security company involved from conceptualization to completion.
Apart from expected security mechanisms like baggage scanners, walk through metal detection machine and automatic pop-up bollards at the gates, other features include security enhanced bulletproof doors on the VIP floor, shatterproof windows on all front ground floor windows and more.
Modern technology is also a key feature, with a lot of firsts expected to be unveiled.
According to the Envoy's General Manager Keletso Nxumalo, the hotel will create lasting emotions in the guest long after they depart. “We have world class facilities, well trained staff and the best culinary experience in the market,” she said.

"Oh, we won't give in, let's go living in the past."
Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson sang these very words back in 1969 as a commentary on those who would rather close their eyes to turbulent days and dream of a better, simpler time.
There were aspects of Sunday night's performance by 'Jethro Tull by Ian Anderson' to close out Musikfest in Bethlehem that were truly troubling, but fortunately, the familiar songs allowed the large crowd on hand to generally escape back inside them.
Right from the moment Anderson first took the stage, busting into the signature flute riff on the 1969 single "Living in the Past," that classical English sound and unique vibrancy of Jethro Tull's music came ringing through.
The four band members surrounding him, masterfully handled the complexities of the time signatures and phrasings uncommon in popular music.
Among the troublesome aspects of this show was Anderson's voice and his singing.
It's been speculated that Ian Anderson has had numerous throat surgeries over the past three decades and has dealt with many vocal problems. He tended to sing in abrupt short breaths of words, with his range diminished from what we know from the recordings.
Of course, no one deserves to be judged off of 40-year-old recordings of themselves, though it was an issue that was hard to overlook over the course of the 2-hour long show. There were odd inclusions of actors on video playing characters singing parts on a couple of songs, but they were fortunately infrequent.
Beyond his vocal issues, 70-year-old Anderson was wonderfully lively and nimble as he would move from one side of the stage to the next gesturing with his free hand and kicking and bending his left leg into his trademark pose.
"Nothing is Easy" and "New Day Yesterday," both from the brilliant 1969 album "Stand Up," were heavier than expected with denser riffs and searing solos from German guitarist Florian Opahle.
His guitar playing was the other part of the show that was troublesome at times. There were moments where it was too over the top, like Zakk Wylde was trading riffs with Anderson's flute. In the end, when it was able to fade back into the cohesive sound, it worked just fine.
Hundreds rally for peace in wake of Virginia violence
After completing the first five minutes or so of "Thick as a Brick," which is essentially is a 44-minute long song, the crowd erupted into a standing ovation as they could recognize the flawless performance of a difficult song with many parts.
"Don't get over-excited," Anderson said as he absorbed the praise, "otherwise we might do all of it."
The line got equal part laughs and cheers. He even was jovial in his treatment of introducing his own songs.
"Enough of that old stuff," Anderson said after performing a couple of songs released right after the band's inception in 1968. "We'll play one of our more recent tracks from -- 1978."
That song was "Heavy Horses," about tractors replacing horses on the farm, and it was among many a number of strong inclusions in the set that dealt with many social issues. 1987's "Farm on the Freeway" spoke of overdevelopment, 2012's "Banker Bets, Banker Wins" was a commentary on the financial crisis and the newer composition "Fruits Of Frankenfield" warned of genetically modifying our foods.
The set was filled in with Jethro Tull's take on instrumental songs composed by the likes of Bach's "Bouree" and "Toccata and Fugue" and oddly enough King Henry VIII who wrote "Pastime with Good Company" way back in the 16th century.
"When he wasn't cutting the heads off his wives," Anderson said about the English monarch. "He was a cultured gentleman and wrote beautiful music."
The 1971 song "My God" was a clear highlight of the evening as it began stripped down to just Anderson on guitar and keyboardist John O'Hara creating a layered musical template that would build as the rest of the band came in. An extended flute solo saw Anderson playing on stage with footage of a younger version of him on the screen behind.
The penultimate song of the night was "Aqualung" with the riff exploding from a darkened stage. Yes, THAT riff. An instantly-recognizable, get up out of your seats right now, riff.
"Aqualung" featured another pre-recorded video assist, this time from singer Ryan O'Donnell playing the main character from the song.
The show closed out with the thumping "Locomotive Breath" that led right into Musikfest's closing fireworks display as the arena emptied.
Led by Ian Anderson's unique style and presence, the musicality of the band overshadowed some limitations and for the majority of night, it was simply a joyful trip back into time.

It's a feat that has been beyond some of rugby's greatest teams.
The exhilarating Welsh side of the 1970s couldn't do it. Neither could the Philippe Sella-inspired French in their golden age of the mid-to-late 1980s. Clive Woodward's England came close at the start of the 21st century but again fell short.
On 20 occasions, a country has won back-to-back titles in the northern hemisphere's top international championship — its name has ranged from the Home Nations, the Five Nations and, currently, the Six Nations — but none have managed three in a row outright.
Heading into the 120th edition, England's class of 2018 is the latest team aiming to reach that elusive milestone.
"We want a 'three-peat,'" England coach Eddie Jones says.
The English have already made history in Jones' two years in charge, winning 18 straight tests to break the national record and match a world-record streak set by New Zealand.
Throw in two straight Six Nations titles and a rise to No. 2 in the world ranking, no wonder the Rugby Football Union recently tied Jones down to an extra two years, keeping the Australian at the helm until 2021.
The hard work might just be starting for Jones, though.
After the honeymoon period, he says England has entered Phase 2 of his tenure. All roads point to Japan for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and Jones wants to be sure England has the necessary strength in depth to sustain a genuine challenge for the trophy.
The next seven weeks might answer that.
This edition of the Six Nations could just as well be dubbed "Survival of the Fittest," given the injury problems that are wreaking havoc across European rugby.
England says it has 18 players out of contention for various injuries. Wales has fewer players sidelined but they'll arguably have bigger names missing, including Liam Williams, Sam Warburton, Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb, and Taulupe Faletau.
Morgan Parra and Brice Dulin have just joined France's lengthy injury list.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has said he has "13 guys that were selectable who may or may not get back during the championship."
Putting aside the longer-term questions about player welfare in this brutal age of rugby, the short-term effect is potentially a more competitive Six Nations.
Ireland won consecutive titles before Jones arrived on the scene, and looks to be the biggest danger to England, on the back of a November series in which Schmidt's side beat South Africa — by a record 38-3 — and Argentina in a clean sweep. It was the Irish who ended England's hopes of consecutive Grand Slams with a 13-9 win in Dublin in March.
Scotland's 53-24 win over Australia in November, dovetailed with a narrow loss to New Zealand a week earlier, suggested a team that has developed its attack in recent years could be even more of a threat under new coach Gregor Townsend.
France is also under a recent hire in Jacques Brunel, and has 10 players in its squad under the age of 23, making Les Tricolores as hard to predict as ever.
Its injury crisis, as well as away matches against England and Ireland in the first three rounds, will likely see Wales fall short.
Italy, in its second season under Conor O'Shea, is once again the wooden-spoon favorite.
So don't discount England's chance of making more history under Jones.
Such is his diligence that England's coaching team said last week that it is using a tactic utilized by the U.S. military in the Cold War to help prepare the side for unlikely eventualities in the Six Nations.
"We're militarily red-teaming our own side to see what weaknesses we have shown and where we think we can improve," defense coach Paul Gustard said about the twice-a-week meetings on 'what if' scenarios.
The spark for this was Italy's no-ruck tactic that bamboozled England in a match at Twickenham last year. The English came through that difficulty and won — as has often been the case under Jones.
Expect, like last year, England vs. Ireland to be the title decider in the final weekend.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Black students are suspended from school, expelled and referred to law enforcement much more frequently than their white peers and the disparities are growing, according to a federal report released Tuesday.
The report released by the Education Department is likely to add to an already tense national debate about what causes such racial disparities. Civil rights groups believe that racial bias is at play and insist that federal protections are necessary. Some experts counter that forcing schools to adopt milder disciplinary practices makes classrooms unsafe.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is considering scrapping Obama-era rules that were meant to counter those disparities and urge schools to adopt softer discipline approaches. She met with supporters and opponents of that policy this month.
The data show that while black students represented 15 percent of all enrolled students in 2015-2016, they accounted for 31 percent of children referred to police or arrested. The disparity is 5 percentage points higher than in 2013-14, when such data was last collected. Two years ago, white students made up 49 percent of all students but represented 36 percent of students who were referred to the police.
There also were disparities in penalties for bad behavior. Black boys represented 8 percent of all enrolled students in 2015-16, but accounted for 25 percent of suspensions and 23 percent of expulsions. Black girls made up 8 percent of all students but accounted for 14 percent of suspensions and 10 percent of expulsions.
By comparison, white boys represented 25 percent of all students and 24 percent of those who got suspended. White girls represented 24 percent of all students and 8 percent of those suspended.
"This should cause alarm for all of us," said Catherine Lhamon, chairwoman of the Commission on Civil Rights, who previously served as the top civil rights official at the Education Department under the Obama administration. "Students were and are treated in very different ways. The reality is that those students experience discrimination."
The guidance issued during Lhamon's tenure instructed schools to move away from harsh punishments and instead favor positive behavior interventions such as counseling. It also told schools to examine their discipline data and fix racial disparities if there are any.
Mike Petrilli, president of the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, has been calling for scrapping the 2014 guidance. He argues that it has made educators reluctant to punish bad behavior and has led to disorder in classrooms. While he agrees that racial bias does play a role, he said that children who are subjected to poverty and trauma are more likely to act out at school.
"The numbers are the symptom, not the disease. The disease is about ineffective schools, it's about unequal life circumstances," Petrilli said. "We've got to address the underlying causes of these disparities. Some of them may be racial bias in the way that discipline is doled out, but it's also differencing in student behavior that relate to differences in the challenges groups are facing."
DeVos hailed the release of the report and urged federal and local education leaders to take note.
"Protecting all students' civil rights is at the core of the Department's mission," she said in a statement.
The report did show that gun violence is still fairly rare in U.S. classrooms, with about 240 schools, or 0.2 percent, reporting at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting. Harassment and bullying, however, were widespread, with some 135,000 allegations reported. Of those complaints, some 41 percent involved sexual harassment, 23 percent had to do with race, 16 percent with sexual orientation, 11 percent with disability and 8 percent with religion.

CONFIRMED: 18 killed in Mogadishu restaurant attack
Mogadishu, Somalia | AFP | A suicide car bombing and assault by Shabaab militants on two neighbouring restaurants in Somalia's capital Mogadishu ended Thursday morning with 18 dead, a government spokesman said.
“The operation is over now and the gunmen were killed by the security forces,” said Mohamed Ahmed Arab, spokesman for Somalia's security ministry.
“They have attacked business places and killed innocent civilians: 18 civilians were killed, including a Syrian national, and more than 10 others were wounded,” he said.
The attack began at around 8pm (17.00GMT) on Wednesday evening with a suicide car bombing at the Post Treats restaurant and club, after which gunmen stormed inside the nearby Pizza House restaurant.
Both venues are popular with affluent, young and diaspora Somalis and were busy as customers broke the Ramadan fast.
The gunmen spent the night roaming the restaurant killing those they found trapped before they were eventually killed by the security forces.

Virtually every form of movement is faster -- both overall and with abilities like gliding and Supers. Those Supers and power weapon ammo will be available more frequently, too. And if you thought the regular gameplay revolved too heavily around auto rifles, you'll be happy to hear that hand cannons, fusion rifles and other guns should be more useful.
There are other competitive tweaks in line for March 27th, such as quitting penalties, a weekly playlist and 6-on-6 Iron Banner. All told, it's evident that Bungie wants the Crucible to be more appealing in its own right, rather than something to grind when you're looking for new gear. It's just unfortunate that these updates will have taken half a year.
Thai navy SEALs and rescue teams started giving crash courses in diving and swimming to the group of trapped young soccer players, hoping for a swift end to their harrowing ordeal.
Rescue divers on Tuesday found the twelve teenagers and their coach alive after they went missing in a Thai cave more than 10 days ago. But authorities said it remained unclear how long the boys would have to remain inside.
The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach entered the cave to celebrate a birthday. They became trapped when sudden rainfall flooded its entry on June 23. Similar incidents have befallen other visitors at the local tourist spot.
On Wednesday, Thai authorities provided food and medicine to the soccer group while experts assessed the conditions needed to evacuate them safely.
"The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children take a lot of people," Prawit Wongsuwan, Thailand's deputy prime minister, told reporters.
"Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive," he said, adding that if water levels subside, the Wild Boar soccer team would be taken out easily.
Another option would be to drill a hole into the cave and airlift the boys out. But authorities say they prefer the diving option.

Preparations underway
In a video released on Wednesday, the soccer players said they were in good health. The boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave with their emaciated faces visible in the one-minute video.
Rescuers said they would not put the boys' lives in danger and would take "no risk" to free them.
"All 13 don't have to come out at the same time," Narongsak Osottanakorn, governor of Chiang Rai province, told reporters on Wednesday. "Who is ready first can go first."
Weerachon Sukondhapatipak, a government spokesman, said more preparations are needed to rescue the boys.
"Some of them can't swim, so therefore it will take time for them to adjust," he said.
"Officials would teach them how to move, how to dive, how to move their body under those circumstances," he added.
Somboon Sompiangjai told Reuters news agency that his son Peerapat, 16, could swim. He said he was confident that SEALs would eventually get the boys out.
"I am not worried if the kids have to swim and dive," he said. "I felt much better after seeing the clips with the children in good spirits, even though they were in there for 10 days."

And there he was again — The man for whom dozens of obituaries had just been written and whose name had been added to journalists' memorial in Moscow only hours before.
Arkady Babchenkoreturned to the land of the living in the company of Ukraine's secret service chief and prosecutor general.
The journalist was found by his wife outside the couple's apartment, bleeding and apparently having been shot multiple times. Reporters had gathered on Wednesday to find out more about the "murder" investigation, with the official line being that he had died.
It was then that Vasyl Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, announced that the press would have the opportunity to speak to Babchenko themselves.
The 41-year-old entered the room, clad in a black sweater, to applause and gasps.
"I'm still alive," he said.
Proving a link
Babchenko thanked Ukraine's security services for saving his life before apologizing to his wife for putting her through such an ordeal. His hosts explained that the stunt had been necessary to lull the individuals suspected of ordering and organizing a hit against the Kremlin critic into a false sense of security. The aim all along had been to collect further evidence linking the plot's alleged lynchpin with Russian secret services.
They presented grainy footage purporting to show the plot's organizer handing over thousands of dollars to the man tasked with shooting Babchenko. The intended shooter turned out to be working for Ukrainian security services. Minutes later yet more footage was shown – this time of a middle-aged man being arrested on a busy city street before being bundled away by plainclothes agents. This, they said, was the organizer of the plot to kill Babchenko. Not only Babchenko, but as many as 30 other Russian exiles in Ukraine.

Barely able to contain his satisfaction, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko read out a series of earlier comments from political opponents inside and outside the country – slamming Ukraine's inability to protect journalists like Arkady Babchenko. The critics, he said, had been proved wrong.
Political killings to destabilize?
President Petro Poroshenko hailed the news as a sign that Ukraine had "passed the sovereignty test" and called the day a "birthday" of sorts for the nation. But even beyond government circles there was much vocal approval online for the government's strategy and its willingness to take risks.
Read more: Ukraine foreign minister urges tougher Russia action, World Cup boycott
But what about the cost to Ukraine's international credibility? The hours following Babchenko's "killing” saw Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman slam Russia's "totalitarian machine” and call for his "killer” to be punished in a late night Facebook post. Could Groysman not have known what was going on? At about the same time Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin was at the UN in New York, where he spoke of his government's reasons for believing that Russia would not shy away from political killings to destabilize Ukraine. But, he stressed, the investigation had only just got underway. With hindsight it seems like a remarkably measured statement. An attempt to avoid saying anything more compromising? Perhaps we'll never know.
Elementary methods
Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashenko was adamant that the ends very definitely justified the means,
"Even Sherlock Holmes successfully faked his own death in order to get to the bottom of difficult and complex crimes. However painful that might have been for his family and Doctor Watson" - a sentiment that was echoed by many in Kyiv's political classes.
Read more: Ukraine: The forgotten victims of Donbass
But beyond Ukraine's borders the reaction has been much less forgiving. The head of Reporters without Borders, Christophe Deloire, called the day's developments "pathetic and regrettable.” The the OSCE's Representative on Media Freedom, Harlem Desir, was on his way to Kyiv when news emerged that Babchenko was not after all dead. So far Ukraine's European allies have yet to respond, but they are unlikely to appreciate being dragged into a stunt that saw everyone from Germany's president to the British foreign secretary expressing their dismay and offering their condolences to Babchenko's family.
The onus is now firmly on Ukrainian investigators to prove that this abuse of public trust was really worthwhile. They'll need to show that Babchenko's disappearance allowed investigators to conclusively prove a connection between the purported organizer of this plot and Russia's secret services. The outside world is waiting.
An arrest has been made in the fatal shooting of a man over the weekend in Allentown.
Jermaine Taylor, 39, was shot multiple times early Sunday morning inside a third floor apartment at 1351 West Linden Street, and was pronounced dead at 4:19 a.m.

WSJ Personal Tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler did a video review of Microsoft's new Surface Laptop, the one with the cloth. I've been wandering about that cloth, and was very curious what he might say. The short version is that he compares it to Apple's years-old MacBook Air, is able to clean the above-mentioned cloth, but expresses doubt about what it will be like after a couple of years. He also questions why Microsoft bothered to make it, which is a question I've also had. The title gives you a good indication of where he's at on the device: “Surface Laptop Review: The Good, Bad and Filthy.”

On Monday night in France, police say that a driver plowed into a pizzeria in Sept-Sorts, which is located about 35 miles east of Paris proper. Initial details are still forthcoming, but a French Interior Ministry spokesperson tells CNN that at least one person is dead with seven others injured. A suspect has been taken into custody, and CNN states that this attack appeared to be made “intentionally,” although other outlets dispute this detail.
NBC News reports that the driver's intent was not clear and adds a few additional pieces of information, including the possible age of the deceased female victim (between 8 and 12 years).
Since November 2015, Paris has remained in a state of heightened alert following the coordinated terror attacks that killed over 130 people and injured hundreds more. Several other incidents have followed, including a machete attack outside the Lourve museum and a rifle-stealing incident at the Orly airport, as well as multiple attacks near the Champs Elysées and the Notre Dame cathedral.
This situation is developing, and we will report additional details as they become available.

An international team of scientists is studying live specimens of a giant, black, mud dwelling worm-like animal — a Kuphus polythalamia — that feeds on sulfur and lives in a shell that looks like a baseball bat.
People have known about giant shipworms for centuries but obtaining live ones for study has been elusive. Researchers from the University of Utah, Northeastern University, University of the Philippines, Sultan Kudarat State University and Drexel University finally found the mollusks in a lagoon on an abandoned log farm in the Philippines.

The researchers hope by studying the microbes found in of the world's longest bivalve's single gill they will find new antimicrobial substances.
The findings were published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Unlike its slimy cousins, K.polythalamia doesn't eat rotting wood. Rather, it burrows into the mud, consuming hydrogen sulfide. Its microbes turn the swamp gas into carbon.

"This particular species fall square in the middle of the family, so we know it had to have a wood-eating ancestor," Margo Haygood, a research professor in medicinal chemistry at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy, told Popular Science.
"Do they start out eating wood? We don't know anything about their life cycle, or where we might find more populations of them. And we have no idea how old they are. ... Are the specimens we studied a couple years old, or a couple hundred?"
The animal's shells, which look like elephant tusks and can be 5-feet in length, often wash ashore. The giant shipworm itself is “dark gray, shiny and floppy,” Haygood said.
"I was awestruck when I first saw the sheer immensity of this bizarre animal," Marvin Altamia, a researcher at the marine sciences institute, University of the Philippines, told Phys.org.
Daniel Distel of the Ocean Genome Legacy Center at Northeastern University in Boston said he and colleagues were first made aware of the colony in 2010 as the result of a Philippine TV news story on people trying to eat the slimy beasts for medicinal purposes. He told New Scientist he had been “looking for them for 20 years.”
“It's hard not to be amazed when seeing one in the flesh, even if you know nothing about them,” Distel said. “There is no other animal like them.”
Distel said the giant shipworm evolved from the wood-eating variety and likely is a newer addition to the family tree.

HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — For Palestinians, the new mayor of Hebron is a hero who they hope will improve their city. But to Israelis, the new leader of the divided West Bank city is an unrepentant murderer.
Weeks after the former PLO fighter took office, Tayseer Abu Sneineh is a contentious figure in the West Bank's most volatile city, showing no remorse for his role in an attack 37 years ago but saying he is now committed to pursuing a peace agreement with Israel.
He sports a short gray beard today, but as a 26-year-old math teacher he took part in an attack in Hebron on Israeli settlers returning home from Friday night Sabbath prayers on May 2, 1980. Six people were killed and 16 wounded.
Abu Sneineh was convicted as one of the gunmen and sentenced to life in prison. But he was released three years later in a prisoner swap between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and deported to Algeria. He returned to the West Bank, along with other exiled PLO figures, after the Oslo interim peace agreement was signed in 1993.
Abu Sneineh says the attack, one of the deadliest on West Bank settlers, was justified.
"They all were armed settlers and soldiers, no women or children," he recalled. "We attacked them with guns and hand grenades."
"We wanted to send a message to the settlers that this is our city and they have to leave," Abu Sneineh added.
Hebron is the West Bank's most populous city, holy to Muslims and Jews, where several hundred nationalist Israeli settlers live in fortified compounds in the midst of 170,000 Palestinian inhabitants.
Palestinians must frequently cross through military checkpoints to get around the area, and the close proximity of the two populations has turned the city into a flashpoint of violence. Hebron has been the epicenter of many of the Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis in the past year and a half.
The Palestinians seek the West Bank, captured by Israel in 1967, as the heartland of a future independent state and say the Jewish settlements there are illegal — a position that has wide international backing.
Israel says the presence of its settlers is justified by an ancient Jewish connection to Hebron going back to the days of the biblical patriarch Abraham.
Noam Arnon, a spokesman for the Jewish community of Hebron, called Abu Sneineh "a despicable and cowardly murderer" who killed civilians in their white Sabbath shirts.
"It was a terror attack of the type that took place recently in Paris and London," Arnon charged. "The fact that he boasts about it proves what a despicable murderer he is."
Abu Sneineh shrugged off criticism, saying that many Israeli officials served in the military and were involved in the deaths of numerous Palestinians in decades of fighting.
"They killed children, women, the elderly; they bombed schools, residential buildings and killed thousands of Palestinians since the establishment of the state of Israel," he said.
Now 63, Abu Sneineh said he has put his life as a militant behind him and is focused on the tough reality of governing in a divided city.
Abu Sneineh lives in Hebron's Old City, an area under tight Israeli military control. Passing recently through an Israeli checkpoint on his way to the Ibrahimi Mosque, a site revered by Jews as the Tomb of the Patriarchs, he was cheered as a native son capable of solving the city's problems.
His priority these days, Abu Sneineh said, is to improve municipal services for Palestinian residents, including water, electricity and roads. Most of these services are controlled by Israeli authorities.
"We need to double the amount of water, and increase the electricity and expand the boundaries of the city and this needs Israel approval," he said.
The new mayor's first challenge in office involved a burst sewage pipe in the Old City. He said it took a week of negotiating with Israeli authorities to obtain a permit for municipal workers to enter the area and fix the pipe.
On his way to the mosque, Abu Sneineh stood in line at a checkpoint with a dozen others waiting for an Israeli soldier behind bulletproof glass to open a revolving gate before they passed through a metal detector. Soldiers prevented an AP team from filming the checkpoint and threatened to arrest a photographer.
"We elected him because he is our son, the son of the old city, and he knows our suffering and we are confident he is going to solve our problems," said Mohammed Jabir, a 64-year-old barber.
The Palestinians hope to one day establish an independent state that will also include east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip — areas also captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. That dream is far off after two decades of failed peace talks and the rival Hamas militant group controlling Gaza.
Abu Sneineh said he's committed to the peace accords with Israel, but warns that if they don't result in the establishment of a Palestinian state, "the Palestinians will have the right to return to armed struggle."
He believes the only solution would be for the settlers to leave.
"They are occupiers," Abu Sneineh said. "They occupy our homes by force. They killed many people in the city in cold blood, and one day they have to leave."

THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities have agreed to extradite to France the Georgian suspected head of an international crime ring specializing in robberies and burglaries.
Lasha Shushanashvili, 57, was among 14 people arrested, in coordination with France, in April in the northern city of Thessaloniki during a two-day operation involving more than 100 police officers.
A further 17 suspected members of the crime ring were arrested in France.
Shushanashvili's lawyers said they would appeal to Greece's supreme court against Wednesday's extradition ruling by Thessaloniki judicial authorities.
Shushanashvili was first arrested in Greece in 2012, and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment for heading an international criminal ring allegedly involved in armed robberies and at least one contract killing.
In fewer than three years, he secured early release on health grounds.
(WCMH) – Every legendary pass, catch or run in the Super Bowl involves one common element: the football. And to many players and fans, a Super Bowl football is a precious commodity.
“Last Super Bowl I caught some passes but I didn't score, so best believe if I score I'm keeping that bad boy,” says Eagles WR Torrey Smith.
Before they touched down in Minneapolis, the footballs were born in the tiny town of Ada, Ohio. It's the home of the Wilson football factory. And the day after the Super Bowl matchup is set, that's the factory's Super Bowl.
“That Monday we ship their practice balls, 54 of them, we ship another 54 for practice or game so they each get 108 balls,” says Dan Reigle, the Wilson plant manager.
Each team then selects 54 game balls, nearly 5 times more than a typical NFL game. And for the fans, the specially-stamped footballs turn into a coveted keepsake.
You may wonder why they'll use so many different footballs during the game. That's because of the value of a game-used football, especially for charity auctions and fundraisers. And as of the Friday before the game, the league takes possession of the game balls to make sure they meet all size and air pressure specifications for Super Sunday.

Kcee & Wife, Ijeoma Okonkwo Celebrate 8th Wedding Anniversary, Nigerians react
Nigerian singer, Kcee is still keeping his marriage of 8 years to Ijeoma very private.
It was a real shock when the “Limpopo” master during an interview in 2014 said that Cynthia Ijeoma Oduah who he wed in March 2010, is his sister.
When images of the couple's traditional and white wedding popped on the screen, he claimed “we were shooting a movie”.
It's still puzzling that of the over 2million followers, 4,153 post on Instagram, Ijeoma's photo has never appeared.
He is following over 2000 people but not his wife.
Today is their 8th wedding anniversary, and Ijeoma, who runs an event company has shared the stunning photo above and wrote;
“8years+ #FaithfulGod #IgiveyoualltheGlory”
However, Kcee has not posted anything about it.

Caitlyn Jenner can't imagine ever having sex with a woman again.
The 67-year-old transitioned from her former identity of Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn in 2015, and insisted at the time that despite deciding to live her life as a woman, she remained entirely heterosexual, adding: “I've never been with a guy.”
However, an excerpt from Caitlyn's upcoming memoir The Secrets of My Life, sees the reality star address her sexual preferences, and admit she's unsure what her future holds when it comes to who she shares her bedroom with.
“Of the most important things in my life, sex is beyond the bottom; it has been that way for a long time,” Caitlyn writes in the passage. “A future female companion? Yes, I do think about that. A future female sex companion? Not happening, at least for now, and perhaps not ever.”
A former passage from the tome saw Caitlyn admit that she had undergone gender reassignment surgery in January, but the new section was apparently written before she had the operation.
She continues to explain that while she has yet to feel sexually attracted towards a man, that could change after her procedure.
“Maybe removing the last physical appendage of my maleness... will make me feel differently,” she muses.
The Am Cait star's remarks come after her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015, in which she discussed her decision to transition into Caitlyn and described herself as “asexual” when asked how the change would affect her sex life.
“There are two different things here,” she explained. “Sexuality is who you personally are attracted to - who turns you on - male or female. But gender identity has to do with who you are as a person and your soul, and who you identify with inside, OK?”

Ikara spill: Reps order NPDC to pay community N100m
By Emman Ovuakporie
ABUJA—MEMBERS of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Petitions have ordered the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company, NPDC, to pay Ikara community in Edo State about N100 million as compensation for perennial oil spill in the communituy, since 2014.
It will be recalled that following petitions before the House of Representatives and the need to avoid violent response from Ikara indigenes, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, NOSDRA, issued a 14-day ultimatum to NPDC to commence the clean-up of the community or face sanctions.
The non-compliance by NPDC further angered the committee members and the fact that the NPDC had been accused of deliberately refusing to address cases arising from series of oil spillage that occurred since 2014.
Giving his ruling, late Tuesday evening, Chairman of the committee, Mr. Uzoma Nkem-Abonta (PDP, Ukwa East/West Federal Constituency), said: “Ikara community should be compensated with nothing less than N100 million and a proper clean up of the community should be carried out immediately.”
Earlier, during the investigative hearing, representatives of Impact Assessment Department of NOSDRA, Mr Oluwole Adeleke and that of NPDC, Mr Godabe Godabe, could not state concretely as to how the compensation should be structured.
The chairman had simply asked both men that, based on their experience in impact assessment of oil spills, what would they suggest as compensation for over 1450 indigenes as this involves spills of over 100 barrels of crude oil.
Responding, Adeleke said: “We need to carry out an impact damage assessment first to know how to quantify and determine what to pay.”
Reminded that he said that the spill was due to equipment failure, he said “I'm a director and we've done several assessments in the past and I can't just come out with an estimate to justify what is on ground.”
At that point, he allowed the leader of Ikara community, Mr Lawrence Wilbert, to give the community's professional assessment of the level of destruction.
Wilbert told the lawmakers that “the professional assessment carried out on the level of damage to the community was N11.736 billion and this can be verified anywhere by professionals.”

"There will be no mercy for the thieves," Kenya's president announced Wednesday amid a growing corruption scandal as diplomats representing 18 Western countries including the United States urged strong action against graft.
President Uhuru Kenyatta spoke a day after 24 officials were charged with corruption-related offenses in a probe linked to the alleged diversion of nearly $80 million.
The government will spare no effort to recover all of the money, Kenyatta said. As for those to blame, "their days are numbered. They will be prosecuted and jailed."
Kenya's leader is under increasing pressure as outrage grows over a number of corruption scandals revealed in recent weeks around the ministries of health, energy, agriculture, public service and youth. Kenyatta has long been criticized for not acting against corrupt officials despite numerous vows to crack down.
In a statement, the 18 Western diplomats urged strong political leadership and zero tolerance for graft.
"When there is evidence of corruption, those responsible should be prosecuted regardless of political party, social stature or personal connections," the diplomats said.
Among Kenyans, the president's announcement was received with some skepticism.
"We know @UKenyatta you are going to sacrifice small thieves and the big thieves will not be touched," rights activist Boniface Mwangi said on Twitter.
The president, who won a second term last year, declared corruption a national security threat in 2015. At the time he pledged to implement the vetting of customs and revenue officers, suspected by some in the government of denying the country revenue by taking bribes to overlook tax obligations. That vetting has never occurred.
Kenya is considered among the world's most corrupt countries, ranked 143th out of 180 nations by Transparency International in its annual corruption index.
John Githongo, a former anti-corruption adviser to ex-President Mwai Kibaki, told The Associated Press he believes Kenyatta's administration is the most corrupt of the four presidents Kenya has had since independence.
Githongo said the public is cynical because of a lack of corruption prosecutions, including against some people who still are holding office.
"The people being taken to court are involved but given our history in Kenya, these are patsies," he said, adding that "if the president is willing to shore up his legacy then he must be willing to pay the political price of going after" the people around him.
Since Kenya's corruption watchdog was created in 1997, all five of its heads have resigned or been forced out of office in what analysts say is a result of the country's deeply entrenched graft.

Six months before rushing water ripped a huge hole in a channel that drains a Northern California reservoir, state inspectors said the concrete spillway was sound. As officials puzzle through how to repair Oroville Dam spillway, federal regulators have ordered the state to figure out what went wrong. Earlier inspection reports offer potential clues, including cracks on the spillway surface that if not properly repaired could let water tear through the concrete. In recent years, construction crews patched cracks – including in the area where water burrowed a huge pit last week. Damage to the main spillway triggered a series of problems culminating with the first use of the emergency spillway, which quickly began eroding and threatened to unleash a torrent of water on cities downstream. On Tuesday, officials said the immediate danger had passed, and allowed nearly 200,000 residents to go home after evacuation orders scattered them for nearly two days. Inspectors with the state agency that both operates and checks the dam, the nation's tallest at 770 feet, walked the half-mile-long spillway in 2014 and 2015 and did not find any concerns. “Conditions appeared to be normal,” the inspector wrote in reports from both years. Last August, a team of inspectors did not check the channel on foot but instead from afar, also concluding that everything looked fine. The inspection came as California was enduring a five-year drought, and the channel rarely was used to relieve pressure on Oroville Lake, which is about 70 miles north of Sacramento. An extraordinarily wet subsequent six months changed that. Dam managers were draining water from the fast-filling reservoir into the Feather River below when the pit appeared last week. Experts said problems like the cracks in the concrete spillway and spots in nearby areas where water seeped from the reservoir through a hillside were common issues with dams. What mattered, said John Moyle, New Jersey's director of dam safety and flood control, was whether dam operators dealt with the problems carefully – patching cracks so they were watertight, and dealing with spots where water was leaking through so they didn't grow to undermine the concrete. The Department of Water Resources declined to answer specific questions about the repair work, saying engineers were focused on ensuring public safety. Robert Bea, professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering at University of California, Berkeley, said it's “obvious those repairs didn't work.” “We don't have details on the repairs, but they put cement into the cracks and troweled it over,” Bea said. “I call it ‘patch and pray.'” On Monday, federal regulators told the department it must enlist a group of independent consultants both to assess what went wrong and to recommend long-term fixes. Documents and interviews show that crews were patching cracks in 2009 and 2013. A water resources department spokesman said it was normal for maintenance crews to be troubleshooting cracks in the channel during dry summer months. One resident of the region said he saw crews in the spillway at least once a year for the past several years. “When they have four or five trucks down there, the only thing they have to do is fill cracks,” said Don Reighley, a retiree and fisherman who is a several times a week drives past the channel to launch his boat into the reservoir. One of the state inspectors who went to Oroville Dam in August said authorities may never know exactly what destabilized the spillway. “Any type of evidence that might have been there is gone,” Eric Holland of the water resources department's dam safety division said. “Everything has been washed away.” — Knickmeyer reported from Sonoma, California, Pritchard reported from Los Angeles.

Kid Rock is reportedly being considered as a potential candidate for Senate.
The 46-year-old musician, real name Robert Ritchie, was apparently discussed during a Michigan Republican Party convention last weekend, according to Rollcall.com.
The website reports the rocker was thrown into the mix as one of the Republican contenders for Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow's Senate seat next year, but no official decisions have been made as yet.
While Rock's name is likely to come as a surprise to the majority, he has always been very vocal about his political beliefs. Despite considering himself as Republican, there are some issues he disagrees with the party on, as he previously explained to The Guardian newspaper.
“I am definitely a Republican on fiscal issues and the military, but I lean to the middle on social issues. I am no fan of abortion, but it's not up to a man to tell a woman what to do. As an ordained minister I don't look forward to marrying gay people, but I'm not opposed to it,” he said.
Born Free singer Rock has been a massive supporter of several Republican candidates, including Mitt Romney during his bid for the U.S. presidency back in 2012.
He is also a supporter of new U.S. President Donald Trump, and began stocking Trump merchandise in his online store prior to the November election. Among the items are T-shirts bearing the slogan “God, Guns & Trump”, and hats stating, “Make America Bada-- Again”.
The right to bear arms is something Rock feels very passionately about, and he owns several guns himself, including a .22 rifle and a semi-automatic with a silencer.
“I'm always buying more guns. I have everything from a Civil War cannon to an MP5 machine gun and old police guns. If someone invades your house, yeah, you can shoot them. I don't think crazy people should have guns,” he added.

Global nanobiotechnology market: Increasing demand for nanobiotechnology in stem cell therapy
Stem cells have the potential to develop into different cell types during early life and function as internal repair systems that divide to replenish other cells in the human body. Stem cells include embryonic stem cells and non-embryonic adult stem cells that are unspecialized cells. Advances in stem cell research reveal the potential of stem cells that can change the way the diseases are perceived and treated.
“At present, thousands of clinical trials around the world involve some form of stem cell therapy as there is a lack of complete understanding of the fate of the transplanted cells and their distribution after injection. Traditionally, the monitoring of therapies is led by histological analysis that is laborious and invasive and involves multiple tissue biopsies,” says a senior analyst at Technavio for research on health and wellness.

A couple of days ago, I was hanging out with my best friend from the opposite sex, contemplating life and how so much has changed over the past year. But then I realized that I wouldn't have survived it without having him around.
Having a best friend from the opposite sex gives you the chance to explore what the others do, think or like. You get to be exposed to all the terrible things they do, their kind of drama and how to easily win their hearts.
For girls, this is what having a guy best friend feels like:
He'll Give You the Best Relationship Advice
If you like that guy in your class, he will give you the best advice to make him fall for you. Give it a couple of weeks or maybe months and you'll change your relationship status from ‘single' to ‘in a relationship'. How amazing is that?
He'll Never Let You Fall for the Wrong Person
Surprisingly, he will notice a playboy from afar and he won't keep it from you. If he doesn't approve of this guy, then don't even respond to the guy's texts. Because guys know other guys and they are 99.9% right.
Your Self-confidence Will Get Boosted
We have all been in this place where we doubted ourselves. We doubted our personalities, our looks and even our social skills. But this amazing friend always reminds you of how great of a person you are, and you will believe them because if a guy tells you are beautiful, then it sounds more real!
You'll Get a Chance to Know How Guys Think
Well, I can assure you that most guys are not as naive as they seem to be. Guys know how to pull off a good show, without us girls even realizing it. But thanks to my best friend, I have learnt to spot the fakes (Or at least still learning).
For guys, this is what having a girl best friend feels like:
Buying Gifts to Your Significant Other Gets Easier
They will give you their honest opinion, so no worries, you won't be buying her an ugly necklace. Girls know what other girls might like, which makes things much easier for you.
You Understand the Psychology of Girls, or at least Try to
I do admit that girls are a little bit hard to understand, but having a girl as your best friend might make the process a little bit easier. You'll be able to understand some of the weird acts and reactions of girls, thank your best friend for that.
You Get Free Fashion Advice
Some guys think that putting on jeans instead of sweatpants makes you the most fashionable person on the planet. Having a girl best friend will give you the opportunity to have free fashion advice without having to lose your dignity to a stranger.
The downside to both of you:
People Always Think You're Dating
You two are so close that people start thinking you're actually dating. At first you would play along with the rumors and just prank your friends, but it gets really annoying later on because it might get in the way of a new relationship.
Your Significant Other Gets Jealous of Them
You know every single thing about each other, and it annoys your SO a lot. No matter what they do, they still can't reach that level of connection with you.
What is really amazing about this friendship is that both of you are extremely loyal to each other, probably because you know too much about each other. On a serious note, cherish this friendship because you are truly blessed.
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (WTNH) – Tuesday is the tax deadline and as the busy filing season winds down, you likely have stacks of paperwork you need to store.
Green and Sklarz partner Eric Green, says you only need to keep documents for the last six years or so. Anything older than that can be shredded and thrown out.
You should also consider storing your documents electronically so they're easy to access and not taking up space in your home. Green added this is the best time of year to get all of your finances in order.
“After you've done your return, it's always good to do what I refer to as an audit file where you have everything kept in one place. Don't start scattering your documents the bank statements go here, credit card information go there, try to keep it all together. If you need it in other places, make copies,” said Eric Green, Partner with Green & Sklarz LLC.
Something to keep in mind: right after tax time is a good time to find discounts at office supply stores, so if you need any software to get organized or supplies for next year, now's the time to find deals. There will be more back-to-school type office deals come June.
If you don't think you will make the tax deadline, Tuesday on Good Morning Connecticut we'll let you know what you need to know about filing an extension and what you should do next.

Rwanda's president Paul Kagame has denied ever meeting with Zimbabwe's opposition leader Nelson Chamisa after he (Chamisa) suggested during a rally to have “helped the Rwandese leader turn his country around” following the gruesome genocide in 1994.
According to reports, Chamisa told his supporters in Beitbridge over the weekend that he had helped the Rwandese leader turn his country around during his time as Zimbabwe's minister of information and communication technology (ICT) between 2009- 2013.
“Look what my brother Paul Kagame is doing for his country. I helped him on his ICT policy, on how to turn around the country when we met in Geneva, Switzerland and he was happy with my presentation. He asked and enquired about me from former president Robert Mugabe and he told him that I belonged to his party Zanu-PF, but I told him there and there that I belong to MDC party led by the late Morgan Tsvangirai. So Kagame is doing a wonderful job for his country because he is planning from a local level, and because of that, Rwanda has never been the same, it has changed completely,” Chamisa was quoted as saying.
But, in a tweet, Kagame denied knowing the charismatic opposition leader.
The east African leader said: “1st my name is Kagame not kagama 2- I don't know this man & no discussion ever happened to him anywhere …3rd Rw's ICT policy, projects & progrm started before mdc formation and politics! I wish the people of Zim. well!”
In what appeared to be damage control, a picture of the two shaking hands has since emerged on social media – as Chamisa was being called out for lying.
Chamisa has since also took to social media to remind the Rwandese leader that they had met a few years back after Kagame had asked for a presentation document that the MDC-T leader had made.
The ruling Zanu-PF has also taken a swipe at him claiming his insistence of meeting Kagame was an embarrassment.
According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, it was not the first time that the young politician was caught lying.
The report said that Chamisa had previously lied about being promised $15bn of aid by the United States government should he become victorious in the coming elections.
Zimbabwe is expected to go to the polls on July 30 after President Emmerson Mnangagwa made the announcement on Wednesday.
Mnangagwa maintained on Monday that he was committed to “free and fair elections”. News24.com
PILOT MOUNTAIN — Many people were predicting hard times for East Surry football after the team lost more than 20 seniors off a record-setting 2015 team that won 13 games. Instead, the Cardinals re-invented themselves, and won a share of the Northwest 1A Conference title the next season and reached the 1AA state quarterfinals last fall.
A big part of East Surry's success the last two years was a hard-nosed offensive line that helped the Cardinals pick up an average of 6.2 yards per attempt in 2016 and 6.7 in 2017, despite injuries that often left the team shorthanded in the backfield. One of the key players in the trenches for Coach David Diamont's last two East Surry teams was 6'3”, 255-pound senior tackle Nathan Vass.
Vass didn't leave East Surry with any big career numbers of his own, just a handful of tackles he was credited for when playing defense. But he played a major role in the nearly 6,000 yards that Cardinal ball-carriers picked up in those two years, along with the 18 victories. His efforts in that regard were not un-noticed, and on March 11, he signed to continue his football career at Ferrum College after a recruiting battle that involved several area college programs.
“Honestly, I clicked with the coaching staff a lot, and I really liked the campus and the scenery,” Vass said of choosing Ferrum, a member of the NCAA Division III Old Dominion Athletic Conference that went 8-2 last season. “They offered more to me than any other school did, so I chose them.”
Vass said that three other schools were also heavily involved in his recruiting process. Two of them were rivals of the Panthers in the USA South Conference the past several seasons, N.C. Wesleyan and Greensboro. The third was Emory & Henry, a new league rival as Ferrum joins the ODAC for the 2018 season. The Panthers beat all three teams last fall.
Vass said that the Ferrum coaching staff hasn't been specific about where he will play, but he will be working on the offensive line in college. At East, he also took occasional spins on the defensive side of the ball. Academically, he was leaning toward business administration, but is now looking at criminal justice as a major.
Like many of his teammates on the last two Cardinal teams, Vass said that the highlight of his career was when East Surry pulled off one of the biggest upsets anywhere in the state that fall. In the 2016 regular-season finale, the Cardinals were four-touchdown underdogs to arch-rival Mount Airy, but stunned the Bears 21-10 on their own field.
“We'd just lost to Walkertown and then had to go play Mount Airy, which was rough,” he said. “There was a little bit of doubt going in, but I had faith in my teammates and we all had faith that we could pull through, and we did. We played the perfect ballgame that night.”
The key to the victory was in the performance of the Cardinals' offensive line. East dominated time of possession, and even Mount Airy coach Kelly Holder admitted that the Cardinals “just came in and mashed us.” The win allowed East Surry to earn a share of the conference title that season.
Vass has been playing football since the third grade, and credits Cardinal offensive line coach Steve Whitt with making him a better player.
“Coach Whitt has pushed me all along, been there for me and helped me with the recruiting process,” Vass said. “He worked with me during the recruiting process and during the summer to make sure my form was down.”
He's excited to apply what he's learned to a new adventure in the ODAC.
“It sort of ended in a bitter way here, losing in the third round last year, but I'm looking forward to playing football for four more years,” he said.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — People from the iconic East Side neighborhood of Sutton Place have banded together to stop the construction of a giant glass tower.
As CBS2's Emily Smith reported, the proposed project has become what some call a David vs. Goliath a race between the residents and the developer. The residents are now fighting to get their neighborhood rezoned.
Along the East River, the charming Sutton Place community is found and around on the street of the same name, from 52nd Street to 59th Street. But it has been anything put peaceful as some residents fight plans for the building that would dwarf its neighbors.
“It would be sitting here in this space like a monstrosity cantilevering out,” said Lisa Mercurio of Sutton Place.
“You put a tall building up on the street – on a street; a side street; a residential neighborhood like this, you're going to lose light. You're going to lose quality of life,” said Bonnie Behrend of Sutton Place.
“Sutton Place is historic if you walk up and down that beautiful avenue,” said Melissa Mittman of Sutton Place. Many residents point out that the Vanderbilt family once owned a home in Sutton Place.
The new plan calls for a 79-story residential tower. But the developer, Gamma, does not have a permit yet due to an incomplete application submission, according to the Department of Buildings.
Now it is a race, as Sutton Place residents try to get a rezoning plan approved first that would cap buildings at 24 stories. City Councilman Dan Garodnick (D-4th) said most every neighborhood in the city has a height limit for development – except Sutton Place.
He said it is due to outdated zoning restrictions – a quirk that dates back to the last time it was looked at in 1961.
“This is a glaring loophole in the zoning resolution which needs to be fixed. It should have been fixed a long time ago,” Garodnick said. “We have a proposal to do just that.”
Meanwhile, Garodnick has sent several letters to the Department of Buildings asking officials to not approve any permits for a high-rise – at least until the residents' rezoning plan gets some attention.
A representative of the developer, Gama, called the neighbors' proposal “self-serving.”
“It will set a dangerous precedent that threatens to hamper the progress of not only our project, but also our city as a whole,” the statement said.
In response, some Sutton Place residents say they welcome anything that stymies big development and preserves the character of Sutton Place.
Rezoning Sutton Place would ultimately be up to Mayor Bill de Blasio. But first, the proposal has to go through a lengthy process, including a public hearing.
As a new year begins, many people chose to get fit as one of their New Year's resolutions. Shelly Marriage started off 2017 at Ideal Bootcamp, where they are getting everyone into shape, and making sure people stick to their resolutions.

When Mustang City Manager Tim Rooney considered hiring the first managerial intern of his tenure, who that would be turned out to be the easiest part of the decision.
“We wanted someone who really wanted to be here, who had that drive, that interest, who wanted to learn,” Rooney said. “It was not choice it all.”
That's because Edigar Kajirwa was not the run-of-the-mill applicant. After meeting Rooney and Mustang's assistant city manager, Justin Battles, at a series of conferences and activities, he took the initiative to reach out – seeking an internship where he could make a difference, Kajirwa said.
That's something important to the 21-year-old University of Central Oklahoma senior. Growing up in Nairobi, Kenya, Kajirwa had a great childhood in many ways, but he also saw poverty and suffering. It was something that always stuck with him, he said.
“I know how fortunate I am to have the opportunities I've had, and I'm not going to waste them,” he said.
Majoring in political science with an economics minor focusing in public administration, Kajirwa came to Oklahoma City in 2014 to attend UCO. He wasn't the first of his family to pursue an education in the United States; he joined his sister, an Oklahoma City resident for more than a dozen years, who initially moved to the state to attend Northwestern Oklahoma State University.
Traveling more than 8,600 miles to a completely different country and culture might seem daunting for many, but Kajirwa immediately immersed himself in school and found an extensive circle of friends. Growing up, the new UCO student was a natural athlete – he played soccer, rugby, cricket, squash and basketball, ran track and was a swimmer. Benefits of sports, like teamwork, respect and camaraderie, might have helped ease any transition issues he could have faced.
“I thought it might be difficult at first, but it wasn't a challenge for me,” Kajirwa said. “I found much in common with my new friends – sports, music – and I knew what I wanted to do.”
What he wanted to do was excel, and he did. Beyond his studies, Kajirwa became a member, then president, of UCO's Model United Nations and attended the Midwest
Model United National conference in St. Louis; as a member of the organization's ECOSOC – Economic and Social Council – Kajirwa helped organize events raising awareness of international events and news, as well as a fundraiser benefiting people in South America.
“It is a very interesting field, and I enjoy interacting with people from different backgrounds and interests,” he said.
It was his pursuit of meaningful extracurricular activities that led to Kajirwa's meetings with several city managers and other municipal administrative staff, including Rooney and Battles, he said.
“It was a manager and student/faculty event at UCO; they had a roundtable event for students to get to speak to city managers across Oklahoma, and I met several city managers during the event – Mr. Rooney was very informative and nice,” Kajirwa said. “I kept in touch with the city and then attended the City Management Association of
Oklahoma winter conference in February, getting the chance to meet for the first time Mr. Justin Battles.”
Beyond Kajirwa's poise, positive attitude and educational background, it was also his interest in finding out all he could about the city of Mustang that appealed to both Rooney and Battles, the city manager said.
“It was obvious Edigar was very committed to this kind of opportunity, and we believed this would be of benefit both to him and to the city,” Rooney said.
Kajirwa, who began his internship May 14, will work in Mustang's managerial department until Aug. 17. During that time, he will attend City Council meetings, municipal activities and events, as well as handle a variety of projects.
“This internship is based on the goal of giving me the opportunity to attain experience and give me an introduction into the governance, operations and administration of the city government,” Kajirwa. “I am very excited to have this opportunity, and I already like Mustang a great deal.”
As he completes his internship, Kajirwa will prepare for his fall 2018 UCO graduation. After that, he plans to either obtain a longer-term intern opportunity or begin a graduate program.
“It depends on the opportunities at that time,” he said. “One thing I know I want to accomplish is to start an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that will focus on the less privileged, so I can help pay for educational needs of students who don't have opportunities that can help them move forward.
“While I'm here, I want to work on creating connections between the municipality and people, that necessary cohesiveness, which I could see is a true strength of Mr. Rooney and Mr. Battles,” Kajirwa said. “I'm happy to have this opportunity to learn from them.”

Earthquake-hit Mexico has itself offered aid to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria's destructive passage through the Caribbean.
The US's southern neighbour plans to ship experts from its state-run power company to the island, where large numbers of people are without electricity, along with 30 tonnes of water and mosquito repellent.
The offer came on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico. He told islanders they could be “very proud” that more people had not perished in the storm, compared to the toll from “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Mexico's offer comes in the context of strained relations with the US in the months since Mr Trump took office. The President has promised to build a wall along the US's southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and repeatedly claimed Mexico will pay for it.
Mexico had planned to send material assistance to the US after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, but later withdrew the offer after the first of the two earthquakes struck in the country's south in early September.
Mr Trump was criticised in Mexico for the time he took to offer condolences to his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Peña Nieto, over the first quake, which killed at least 98 people. The US president later said he had been unable to reach Mr Peña Nieto because of poor phone reception.
But after Maria struck Puerto Rico, the local mobile phone operator of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim proved more reliable than some US competitors during the early days of the communications outage across the island of 3.4 million people.
Pledging an all-out relief effort in the US' Caribbean territory, and thanking those who had praised the federal response so far, Mr Trump added on Tuesday: “Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.”
Some 34 people are thought to have died on the island.
During his visit to Puerto Rico, Mr Trump threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd in the Guaynabo district, a move described by Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, as “terrible and abominable”.
Ms Yulín Cruz has faced venomous public attacks by the President after criticising elements of the government's response to Maria. She said: “Sometimes his style of communication gets in the way. I would hope that the president of the United States stops spouting out comments that really hurt the people of Puerto Rico.”
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The New Hampshire Lottery says it won't appeal a judge's ruling that allows a woman who won a Powerball jackpot worth nearly $560 million to keep her identity private.
The lottery said in a statement Monday that rather than appeal it believes the state Legislature should take up any possible changes in laws affecting the lottery.
The woman signed her ticket after the Jan. 6 drawing. She then learned that she could have shielded her identity by writing the name of a trust. Lawyers said she was upset after learning she was giving up her anonymity by signing the ticket, which the lottery commission acknowledged isn't spelled out on the ticket, but is detailed on its website.
She sued the state lottery commission to stay anonymous.

NEW YORK (AP) - The maker of Ambien said Wednesday that "racism is not a known side effect" after Roseanne Barr cited the insomnia drug in explaining the tweet that led ABC to cancel her show.
Hours after ABC pulled the plug on "Roseanne" because of her offensive tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett - and quickly breaking a promise to stay off Twitter - the comedian was busy posting on the social media platform.
Barr tweeted that what she did was unforgiveable and urged supporters not to defend her. She said of the Jarrett tweet, "It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting."
The drugmaker Sanofi took to social media to say that "while all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."
Barr later tweeted that she has had odd experiences while taking the drug late at night. "I blame myself, not Ambien," she tweeted.
After not mentioning Barr's firing in a campaign-style rally in Tennessee Tuesday night, President Donald Trump broke his silence on Twitter. He noted that Robert Iger, chief executive of ABC parent Walt Disney Co., called Jarrett to tell her that ABC did not tolerate Barr's comments.
"Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC," Trump wrote. "Maybe I just didn't get the call?"
Trump reveled in the success of "Roseanne" after Barr's character in the show came out as a supporter of his presidency.
"Roseanne" was an instant hit when it returned this spring after a two-decade hiatus. But after Barr's tweet that likened Jarrett, who is black, to a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and the "Planet of the Apes," ABC canceled the show in a one-sentence statement from network entertainment president Channing Dungey. She called it "abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values."
Barr's agent also dropped her and several services pulled "Roseanne" reruns.
Jarrett, who said she was "fine" after the slur, urged in an MSNBC special Tuesday about racism that the incident become a teaching moment.
"Tone does start at the top, and we like to look up to our president and feel as though he reflects the values of our country," Jarrett said. "But I also think that every individual citizen has a responsibility too, and it's up to all of us to push back. Our government is only going to be as good as we make it be."
Barr showed no signs of abandoning Twitter, engaging in a series of tweets that apologized to those who lost their jobs because of the "Roseanne" cancellation and expressed remorse she was being branded a racist. While asking not to be defended, she retweeted comments from supporters that attacked ABC and complained that conservatives are treated more harshly than liberals for their behavior.
Barr was resoundingly condemned Tuesday, including from many who helped make her show successful.
The executive producer of "Roseanne," which came back this spring after being gone for two decades and instantly became television's second most popular comedy, said he supported ABC's decision.
"Our goal was to promote constructive discussion about the issues that divide us," said Tom Werner. "It represented the work of hundreds of talented people. I hope the good work done is not totally eclipsed by those abhorrent and offensive comments, and that Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs."
ABC and Disney had taken notable steps to be more inclusive in its entertainment, and Dungey is the first black to be entertainment president of a major broadcast network. But much of its progress would have been threatened if it looked the other way at Barr's tweet.
She has a history of diving into political conspiracy theories on Twitter, and that's how she ended her Memorial Day weekend. She criticized Democratic financier George Soros and tweeted that Chelsea Clinton was "Chelsea Soros Clinton," implying she was married to a nephew of Soros. Clinton herself corrected Barr online. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted two of Barr's statements about Soros, although not the remark about Jarrett.
Jarrett's name came up in response to Twitter commentary that raised her name in relation to an Obama conspiracy theory. Barr tweeted: "muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."
Three weeks earlier, "Roseanne" was the toast of ABC's annual presentation of its programming plans to advertisers. Dungey's boss, network chief Ben Sherwood, even joked then: "If anyone came to play a drinking game based on how many times we mention 'Roseanne,' you're welcome."
"Roseanne" earned an estimated $45 million in advertising revenue for ABC through its nine episodes that started airing in March, according to Kantar Media. The firm estimates that the 13 episodes that had been ordered for next season would have brought in as much as $60 million, with more through repeat episodes.
The cancellation has no clear precedent in television history, said David Bianculli, professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. The closest analogy is CBS pulling the plug on the Smothers Brothers variety show due to their anti-war views in the late 1960s and the same network not renewing "Lou Grant" at its peak, which star Ed Asner always contended was due to his outspoken political beliefs.
But cancelling "Roseanne" is "like taking off 'All in the Family' or 'I Love Lucy' or Andy Griffith at their zenith," he said.
There was also CBS' firing of Charlie Sheen from "Two and a Half Men" during his bizarre spate of behavior. Sheen, for one, saw an opportunity in Tuesday's events.
"Good riddance," he tweeted about the "Roseanne" cancellation. "Hashtag NOT Winning. The runway is now clear for OUR reboot."
Barr retweeted that, too.

Michael Alan George Minuti couldn't wait to be the first baby of 2017 born at the Royal Preston Hospital.
He arrived two days early, at 10.52am yesterday, to the delight of parents Sally White and Alex Minuti from Clayton-le-Woods.
Baby Michael Alan George Minuti, who was born at 10.52am weighing 6lb 3.5oz
Michael weighed in at 6lb 3.5oz and Alex said: “He's wonderful and they are both doing fine.
“He was due Tuesday but it is great to think he was the first to be born at RPH in 2017. It's the perfect way to celebrate the new year - and our upcoming anniversary. Sally and I got together on January 29 last year.”
According to the Tennessee's Integrated Traffic Analysis Network, there were 71 crashes and four deaths statewide related to alcohol-impaired driving during Super Bowl weekend last year. In 2016, there were 67 crashes and two fatalities.
“Our state and local partners will increase enforcement to remove drunk drivers from the roadways,” said THSO director Vic Donoho. “Officers will conduct sobriety checkpoints, saturation patrols, and high visibility enforcement. We ask that all Tennesseans plan ahead and make safe driving choices.”
This year, the THP developed a new public service announcement to remind football fans the most important part of a party checklist is to designate a sober driver. To view the PSA, visit youtube.com/watch?v=fltzS6kayi4.
“In 2017, state troopers removed 116 impaired drivers from state roadways during Super Bowl weekend,” said THP Col. Tracy Trott. “Drunk driving is not a game. If you fumble and get behind the wheel, you risk losing your life or the life of another. Be a team player. Always find a sober ride home.”
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Want the world's best, up-close view of a rocket launch without being right there at the pad?
For the first time, cameras will provide live 360-degree video of a rocket heading toward space.
NASA will provide the 360 stream Tuesday as an unmanned Atlas rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a capsule full of space station supplies. The stream will begin 10 minutes before the scheduled 11:11 a.m. liftoff and continue until the rocket is out of sight.
The four fisheye-lens cameras are located at the pad, about 300 feet (100 meters) from the rocket. A computer in a blast-proof box will stitch together the images for a full, in-the-round view. There will be about a minute lag time.
It will be shown on NASA's YouTube channel.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher terrorized opposing offenses from the middle of the field. Randy Moss and Terrell Owens did the same to defenses on the outside.
The two hard-hitting linebackers and two big-play receivers highlighted an eight-person class voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday. Safety Brian Dawkins also received at least 80 percent support from the 47 Hall of Fame voters, along with contributor Bobby Beathard and senior nominees Jerry Kramer and Robert Brazile.
But the biggest stars of the class are the two linebackers that made it on their first tries, and the pair of lightning-rod receiver who sometimes caused as many problems for their own teams as for the opposition. Moss also made it on his first try, while Owens needed to wait for his third year on the ballot to get enough support.
Moss and Owens each played for five teams in their careers as they often wore out their welcome with their inability to get along with teammates and coaches at times.
But at their best, there were few players ever able to strike fear in defenses as much as Moss and Owens, who were both all-decade selections for the 2000s.
Moss burst on the scene as a rookie in Minnesota in 1998 when he caught a league-leading 17 TD catches and helped lead the Vikings to the NFC title game. His combination of speed and athleticism made him the game's most dangerous big-play threat and led to the phrase “You got Mossed” for embarrassed defensive backs.
He led the NFL in TD catches five times, including his record 23 for New England in 2007, and earned four All-Pro selections. He finished his career with 982 catches for 15,292 yards and ranks second all-time with 156 TD receptions.
Owens entered the league as a third-round pick by San Francisco in 1996 but developed into a star known for some memorable playoff appearances, including his winning 25-yard TD catches to beat Green Bay in 1999; his 177 yards in a comeback win against the Giants in 2003; and his nine catches for 122 yards in the 2004 Super Bowl against New England just seven weeks after breaking his leg.
Owens ranks second to Jerry Rice with 15,934 yards receiving and is third on the all-time touchdowns receiving list with 153.
Lewis is widely considered one of the greatest middle linebackers, winning two AP Defensive Player of the Year awards and earning eight All-Pro selections. He anchored a dominant defense for the 2000 Baltimore Ravens in a season that ended with him winning Super Bowl MVP, then retired as a champion after Baltimore closed his last season with a title win over San Francisco in February 2013.
Lewis joined tackle Jonathan Ogden as the only Ravens voted into the Hall of Fame as both of the team's first-round picks in its initial season of 1996 received the high honor.
Lewis' career was also marked by legal problems off the field. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice after initially being charged with murder in connection with two killings following a Super Bowl party in Atlanta in January 2000. Lewis was also fined $250,000 by the NFL.
Urlacher wasn't far behind Lewis with his play on the field and is the latest in a line of great Chicago middle linebackers to make the Hall, joining Dick Butkus, Mike Singletary and Bill George. He was the Defensive Player of the Year of 2005 and joined Lewis on the 2000s all-decade team.
Dawkins spent most of his 16-year career in Philadelphia, earning five first-team All-Pro selections for his versatility that included 37 career interceptions and 26 career sacks. He became the first player in NFL history with a sack, interception, fumble recovery and touchdown catch in the same game against Houston in 2002.
Kramer got passed over 10 times previously as a finalist before finally getting enough votes as a senior to become the 14th member of the Vince Lombardi Packers to make the Hall. Kramer helped anchor the Green Bay line for 11 seasons, winning six NFL titles and making the block that cleared the way for Bart Starr's TD sneak in the “Ice Bowl” for the 1967 NFL championship.
Brazile was a finalist for the first time after a 10-year career for the Houston Oilers that included five straight All-Pro selections.
Beathard helped build four Super Bowl champions in Miami and Washington and made seven trips to the title game during more than three decades as a personnel executive with a sharp eye for talent.
Five offensive linemen were among the 15 finalists, with tackle Joe Jacoby getting eliminated in voting that reduced the candidates to 10, and tackle Tony Boselli, guards Alan Faneca and Steve Hutchinson, and center Kevin Mawae getting cut in the next round of voting.
Cornerback Ty Law also made it to the final 10 in his second time on the ballot. Defensive backs John Lynch and Everson Walls, receiver Isaac Bruce and running back Edgerrin James were the other candidates eliminated in the first cuts.

UK low-cost carrier easyJet is rolling out a new premium ancillary product, where passengers can board from the private jet terminal at London Luton Airport for a £475 ($604) fee.
The VIP service, which is being offered in partnership with executive jet handling company Signature Flight Support, is available with immediate effect. It includes parking outside Signature's newly opened terminal, use of the amenities and refreshments, private customs, immigration, security screening and transport directly to the aircraft.
Passengers will be boarded at the same time as “Speedy Boarders.” The charge, which is set by Signature, is £475 for the first passenger and £120 for any additional travelers, although there may be initial promotions to build the service. EasyJet will market the service via its website and “below the line marketing,” receiving a commission from Signature.
Launching the service at the Signature terminal June 13, easyJet CEO Carolyn McCall said: “It's all about ancillary revenues. We are constantly looking for new revenue streams. This is quite innovative for a budget airline and we've got to see how this goes. It's not going to be something huge.
“This is not about trying to get more upmarket, or to take the space someone else has. It's a real opportunity for a specific type of passenger—like second homeowners and those celebrating a special occasion,” she said.
While easyJet customers might seem an unlikely audience for a premium service, research shows they identify with higher-profile brands and 20% are flying on business. Also, groups are increasingly hiring private jets and this service would work out cheaper, although easyJet plans to stick with its “bread-and-butter ancillaries” like hotels and car insurance.
“There is a big difference [to a paid lounge]. A lot of passengers don't want to go through the hassle of the airport experience. This is a particular kind of passenger who wants something completely different and is less price sensitive. The profile of our passengers make a good fit, otherwise Signature wouldn't do it.”
Signature has offered a similar service from London Gatwick for the last three to four years, but this is the first time the two companies have joined forces to formalize the offer.
“Signature ELITE Class has been extremely successful at London Gatwick Airport,” Signature Flight Support Europe, Middle East and Africa division managing director Evie Freeman said. “We look to continue to expand Signature ELITE Class services to additional airports in the future.”
There is no exclusivity agreement between easyJet and Signature, but McCall said they are a preferred partner and there are “definitely opportunities” to extend the service to airports like Venice, Milan and Geneva.
She added that easyJet is “seriously considering” reserving overhead lockers in the first six or seven rows for Speedy Boarding customers, including those using the Signature service. McCall said easyJet has no plans to package the Signature product with other ancillaries or as part of its Flight Club loyalty scheme for now.
In the first quarter of 2018, the airline will roll out a new commercial system, which will make it easier to offer a “whole range” of products, which will be dynamically packages and served to the customer, McCall said.
London Luton Airport is Britain's busiest executive aviation airport, with three private terminals and around 30,000 arrivals and departures each year—roughly a quarter of all such flights in the UK.

FIREFIGHTERS ARE called to thousands of ‘disruptive and costly' false alarms costing millions of pounds, The Yorkshire Post can reveal today.
Crews in Yorkshire have been called out to more than 23,000 false fires prompted by automatic alarms at private businesses, hospitals and schools since April 2015, the new figures show.
The potential sum of firefighters' time and resources would total nearly £8m if counted separately from their working day, the investigation can reveal. And, it's emerged, these alarm call outs account for a third of all incidents in some parts of the region.
“The practical cost is in the loss of this lifesaving resource,” said David Williams, chairman of the Yorkshire Fire Brigade's Union.
“We don't want to be at a hospital looking for a fire alarm, when just around the corner someone is hanging out of their window because their house is on fire.
“That's time you can't get back. That's when it's critical.”
The Yorkshire Post investigation, based on a series of Freedom of Information requests to the region's four fire services, found there were a total of 23,281 false call outs to automatic fire alarms since the start of last financial year. The highest number - nearly half the total sum - were in West Yorkshire where firefighters responded 11,064 times. The authority here is now issuing invoices to repeat offenders.
Each call out in North and West Yorkshire takes one fire engine and four firefighters out of service, with an estimated cost of between £323 and £355 an hour.
Critics argue that this isn't money spent, as firefighters would be on duty regardless, but admit this is a huge waste of resource which could be better spent.
“The numbers are down 80 per cent on what they were 10 years ago - but they still count for a third of all incidents that we attend,” said Dave Walton, deputy chief fire officer for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS).
“The fire and rescue resource across Yorkshire is finite - it's no secret that all services are facing budgetary challenges at the moment.
“We won't save millions by not going to false alarms - the cost to us is in terms of opportunity.
“It would give us more opportunity to engage with the public and to do what we are good at - which is to work to reduce fire costs in terms of death, injury and property.”
Fire authorities have been working to tackle the issue, but say the weight of responsibility has to lie with private businesses in ensuring their systems aren't adding to the problem.
“We know from history, from experience, that often it is down to alarms being poorly maintained,” said Mr Walton.
“It's the premises' owner's responsibility.
“If we don't reduce the demand as much as we can, then our fire crews cannot respond to fires, car accidents, to incidents where they are most needed.
“It's in everybody's interests that these are managed well.”
In some areas forceful measures have been put in place in parts of Yorkshire to tackle the number of call outs to automatic fire alarms.
Since 2015, firefighters have been called out to false alarms more than 23,000 times, including thousands of times to hospitals and schools.
As the “unnecessary” cost to critical resource continues, fire services across Yorkshire have taken steps to clamp down on the number of attendances.
“We charge now, for the most persistent,” said David Williams, chair of the Yorkshire Fire Brigade's Union. “We will send a huge bill. We've done everything we can to prevent this from happening.
“We've tried the carrot, now we've got no alternative but to use the stick. And it's a hefty stick - to pay £350 because someone's burnt a bit of toast.”
The estimated cost of call outs - including the use of a fire engine and firefighters' time - is nearly £8m across Yorkshire and £4m in West Yorkshire alone.
But this, the fire service argues, is a “notional figure” as resources would be in place regardless.
“It isn't a true cost of £4m - firefighters are already at work,” said Dave Walton, deputy chief fire officer at West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS). “If we didn't go to automatic fire alarms, we wouldn't be £4m better off, the fire engines and firefighters would still be here. But it is a problem.”
WYFRS issued invoices 942 times since April 2015. These aren't fines, the authority stressed, these are an attempt to recoup costs.
“We're not fining people, we don't have the power to do that,” said Mr Walton. “Where people are persistent offenders, we can invoice them. Calls to automatic fire alarms account for approximately a third of all our call outs. It stops our staff going out to community safety initiatives, to training days.”
Since the force started charging repeated offenders two and a half years ago, he said, the number of call outs had fallen nine per cent.
There was evidence that it cost organisations £2,900 for each call out, he added, and the charges were beneficial to all in the long run.
“We will continue to work with those responsible for the affected properties to manage down the demand as we see this as being of benefit to both the wider community and those organisations who host the fire alarms.”
In North Yorkshire, as of April last year, the fire authority also changed the way it responded to calls. Attending each of the thousands of automatic alarms every year was a “huge waste of resources”, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (NYFRS) said, adding that it was “costly and disruptive” to its fire crews.
Since that time, it has not attended alarms during daylight hours in premises where people do not sleep unless a fire has been confirmed.
It also warned that it might not attend specific premises where there were repeated false alarms and where the cause was not being addressed.
Nicky Brown, chair of the South Yorkshire Fire Brigade's Union, said steps were being also being taken here to tackle the issue.
“South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (SYFRS) have been cutting down the number of calls - and they've been reducing their attendance.
“They've been putting more onus on the premises' managers to ensure it's an actual incident before attending so that we don't send appliances out unnecessarily. It's a waste of resources.
“But if a fire alarm is going off, we have to send a firefighter out because there's no way of knowing. The one time you don't go, there could be drastic consequences.” ‘
A House committee has passed a measure that would change the date voters would decide on whether to make Missouri a right-to-work state.
House Committee Resolution 102 would move the right-to-work referendum from the November general election to the August primary, which traditionally draws fewer voters. It's sponsored by Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston.
“I want this done,” she said. “I don't want our jobs that we're waiting on down in southeast Missouri to wait any longer – I want to give those business owners concrete protection that this is now in the law.”
Those businesses include Magnitude 7 Metals, which is planning to redevelop the former Noranda plant near New Madrid. It also was the subject of a special legislative session last year. Rehder said it's possible the company could pull out of the project if right-to-work is defeated at the ballot box.
“They have other options that they're looking at,” she said. “They've not guaranteed us that we have it yet.”
Rehder co-sponsored the right-to-work law that was signed last year by Gov. Eric Greitens. It would prevent workers from being forced to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment. But opponents were able to get enough petition signatures to also require approval by voters. Voting “yes” on what's now Proposition A would make Missouri the 28th right-to-work state in the U.S.
Senate Minority Floor Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said in a written statement that moving the vote would be an insult to opponents of right-to-work.
“Voters know that Right-to-Work is wrong for Missouri because it will lower wages, strip workers of their rights, and harm our economy,” she said. That's why more than 300,000 Missourians signed a referendum petition to put this question on the November ballot – either way, I am confident that the working men and women will defeat Prop A on any ballot.”
Rehder's proposal still has to pass the full House and Senate before the 2018 regular session ends on May 18.

GYMPIE Mayor Mick Curran and MP Tony Perrett don't often see eye to eye these days, but they do agree on one thing - the powerful new integrity body set up to deal with council complaints is a good thing.
By the end of this year, Queensland's integrity regime will include a new independent body charged with investigating complaints against local government mayors and councillors.
READ MORE: Council corruption in the spotlight after Operation Belcarra
"As a strong supporter of transparency and accountability in local government I welcome the establishment of a new independent body to investigate complaints against councillors and mayors,” Mr Perrett said yesterday.
"While a majority of Queensland councils have not been caught up in recent regrettable events, confidence in local government has hit rock bottom. There is significant concern in the Gympie and Fraser Coast regions with the operation of local government.”
Cr Curran said it was "disappointing that a small minority of local government representatives have caused everyone to question the reputation of the entire sector, however it is important to remain vigilant”.
Tony Perrett. Patrick Woods
"Any legislative changes to ensure complaints against councillors are properly investigated are welcomed. It is an honour to be a representative of your community, one that should not be taken lightly.
"There is no doubt that if councillors are doing the wrong thing, there should be a system in place which allows complaints to be made, without fear of reprisal, and investigated accordingly.”
Mr Perrett said he received numerous complaints about the Gympie council, with residents feeling issues were either being dealt with behind closed doors, not properly investigated, biased, or dismissed out of hand.
"Many of them have told me they look forward to the Office of the Independent Assessor being up and running as it will put the complaints process at arm's length from councils and CEOs,” he said.
"This new body should open the door and throw a light on a system which they feel is shrouded in secrecy. It will help return trust and integrity to local government.
Deb Frecklington and Tony Perrett. Patrick Woods
"I was pleased to support recent legislative changes which have increased accountability and transparency in local government and the CCC recommendations about local government corruption.
"Mismanagement, corruption, misconduct, and complaints should always be rigorously and quickly addressed. There are no excuses.
"State Labor Government claims of integrity in dealing with local councils are hollow when you consider the reluctance it has previously shown to pull councils into line, or deal with popular elected officials when they are in the same party.
"Labor governments have been in power in Queensland for the past 18 years out of 21 and we have seen the unwillingness of this Government to deal with councils or councillors who politically support them.
"The LNP Opposition will closely watch the new complaints body to ensure that any gaps are quickly ironed out instead of being ignored.
"Above all the decisions and actions of councils and councillors should be transparent and accountable. The public needs to have faith that decisions are impartial and that they can trust in the integrity of council processes.”
New laws passed by the Parliament this month will see the Office of the Independent Assessor up and running before year's end, with funding to be provided in next month's State Budget.
Local Government Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said the Office of the Independent Assessor would work alongside the Crime and Corruption Commission.
"As with the CCC, the Office of the Independent Assessor will have the power to seize documents and compel people to attend interviews, with stiff penalties applying for non-compliance. The CCC will continue to investigate corruption, while the Independent Assessor will focus on official misconduct. The new system is designed to put the brakes on bad behaviour long before councillors reach the watch house door. What we have now is not up to the job. It is convoluted, lacks teeth, and - given recent events - clearly fails to act as a sufficient deterrent for some councillors. One of the biggest weaknesses of the current system is the requirement to lodge complaints directly with a council's CEO. Understandably, potential complainants can be reluctant to 'dob in' councillors, given CEOs close working relationship with mayors and councillors.”
HAVANA (AP) — The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it is not cutting off food and water supplies to Puerto Rico despite reports that it intended to do so.
FEMA spokesman William Booher tells The Associated Press that the agency had been evaluating whether enough stores and supermarkets had reopened by Jan. 31 to justify ending distribution of food and water to municipal governments on the island. He says that decision had not actually been taken but officials mistakenly made the date public this week.
Booher says FEMA is in the process of winding down food and water distribution as stories and markets come back online, but will continue to distribute aid to needy towns for the foreseeable future.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California lawmakers moved Wednesday to create a state-backed bank to handle the billions of dollars flowing from the newly legal recreational marijuana market.
The world's largest legal recreational marijuana economy, created under a law that took effect this year, is projected to grow to $7 billion.
The bill approved by a bipartisan 29-6 state Senate vote is designed to help pot entrepreneurs who usually deal in cash because most banks won't accept money from a product that remains illegal under federal law.
SB930 now goes to the Assembly for consideration.
The bill would permit charter banks and credit unions regulated by the state Department of Business Oversight to provide limited banking services to pot-related businesses.
They could use the banks to pay rent, state and local taxes and fees, vendors within California for goods and services related to the cannabis business and to buy state and local bonds and other investments.
"We're not using the federal system, we're not using the federal wire," Democratic Sen. Bob Hertzberg of Van Nuys said of his proposal. "This is a short-term creative approach to deal with this extraordinary problem."
He said the banks would suffice until what proponents hope will be an eventual change in federal law.
Hertzberg said the current system is dangerous because it requires pot dealers to conduct their business using cash, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. He said he's heard of some businesses burying or hiding tens of millions of dollars for lack of an alternative.
State budget officials project California will collect $600 million in cannabis taxes in the upcoming year, but that often requires the businesses to haul duffel bags full of cash to tax agencies.
The cash economy also makes audits and other standard oversight measures difficult.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Battling the flu, pop star Pink powered through a pre-Super Bowl concert, still hitting high notes, flying in the air and dancing onstage days before she will sing the national anthem at the big game.
Pink skipped some of the words during the songs, relying on her backup singers Friday at Nomadic Live at the Armory in Minneapolis. But she was still energetic and spirited, ending the set with her signature high-flying athleticism while singing the pounding hit, “So What.”
The mother of two told the audience she had the flu and that her children “cough into my mouth and I can't stop them 'cause they're so cute.”
“I'm not going to sound like (crap) all night because you guys are going to help me,” she said. “We're going to rock the (expletive) out and have a good time.”
As she began to sing “Beautiful Trauma” — from her recent album of the same name — she quickly stopped her band and told the crowd, “I can't do it.”
“I hate this,” she said. “I can't do that song. I'm sorry.”
Pink will sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on Sunday at the U.S. Bank Stadium before the New England Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles. The 38-year-old singer grew up about 30 miles from Philadelphia and gave a shout-out to the City of Brotherly Love during the show.
She wore a loose white top, loose white pants and red heels as she ran up and down the stage, kicking off the show with the jam “Get the Party Started.” She later sang well-known hits like “U + Ur Hand,” ″Who Knew,” ″What About Us” and “Raise Your Glass.”
Despite feeling under the weather, she was exceptional when she covered 4 Non Blondes' “What's Up,” a crowd favorite.
“We're gonna wake up the entire neighborhood,” she said before singing the song.

Chimamanda Will Lead Women to ‘Hell' – By Fredrick Nwabufo
Who made Chimamanda Adichie the supremo of feminism? Who made her the feminist papal? How did she become the feminist potentate?
By asking Hilary Clinton, former US presidential candidate, why her Twitter bio starts with “wife', Chimamanda has not only intruded into the personal business of Clinton, but also scorned a key principle of feminism – “choice”.
Besides other leanings, feminism entails freedom of choice. A woman is at liberty to be anything she wants to be – doctor, lawyer, housewife or mother. The right to choose is principal, and this should not be prejudiced.
Setting straightjacket standards and rules, which Chimamanda's brand of feminism promotes, will result in a second captivity – by matriarchal she-lords.
Notable feminists of the first and second waves such as Betty Friedan, author of ‘The Feminine Mystique', emphasised the essence of “choice” in their works; that a woman can be a housewife or a career person if she chooses to. The key word here is “chooses”.
The imposition of personal foibles on the feminist struggle gives it a blemished complexion. The result of this is the ridiculing of women who choose to be mothers or housewives by their so-called “woke” peers.
As a matter of fact, Chimamanda's brand of feminism makes a caricature of the movement's goal – equality of gender. How? Chimamanda's virulent feminism, by default, teaches all women are not equal – the housewife is less of a woman and in shackles, while the stiletto-wearing career woman is the archetypal vanquisher of the demonic patriarchal order.
In all, it is still “woke” if a woman chooses “wife” as her title. It is all a matter of choice. Personally, I believe “father” is an esteemed title. Nursing my six-year-old son from infancy has been the most rewarding duty for me. Yes, I am a father first.
In conclusion, Chimamanda's feminism is already leading some women to the hell of confusion, bitterness and misandry. Feminism should be defined by all women in different stations, according to their realities and choice, not by some self-installed matriarchal potentates.

PHOENIX (AP) — A trial began Tuesday in the case of a Syrian man accused of supplying a component of improvised bombs used in the Iraq War, with a prosecutor saying the man had sympathized with a group that wanted to use violence to drive a wedge between Iraqis and Americans.
Ahmed Alahmedalabdaloklah (AL-ah-med-AL-ab-dahl-OK'-lah) is accused of making circuit boards used to remotely detonate roadside bombs in Iraq for the 1920 Revolution Brigades.
The trial is being staged in Phoenix because authorities said a part for improvised explosive devices was made by a company headquartered in Arizona.
Prosecutor Joseph Kaster told jurors in opening statements that Alahmedalabdaloklah embraced the group's objectives to force American troops to abandon Iraq. "He shared their violent objectives," Kaster said.
The case against the 40-year-old Alahmedalabdaloklah arose out of a raid a decade ago at a Baghdad apartment where soldiers discovered a large cache of bomb-making materials, though no explosives were found. Prosecutors say Alahmedalabdaloklah's fingerprints were found on several items in the apartment.
Authorities said in court records that several witnesses have tied him to the production of IED components, including one person who said Alahmedalabdaloklah, after fleeing Iraq and moving to China, found a factory in China to make the circuit boards.
Alahmedalabdaloklah has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to destroy U.S. government property with an explosive, possession of a destructive device in furtherance of a violent crime, conspiracy to commit "extraterritorial murder" of a U.S. citizen and providing support to terrorists. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.
Defense attorney Jami Johnson said her client never expressed any sentiments against Americans in 12 years of his emails that were reviewed by investigators. "Twelve years — and not one single anti-American statement," Johnson told jurors.
Johnson said her client, who was brought to Iraq as a refugee when he was a child, operated a legitimate electronics shop in Baghdad and moved to China when security in Iraq deteriorated.
Johnson said Alahmedalabdaloklah set up an electronics business in China that sold products in Iraq and elsewhere but never sent any components used in a bomb.
She said her client's fingerprints were found on his photos and documents inside the Baghdad apartment, but none of the electronics contained his prints or DNA.
Alahmedalabdaloklah was arrested in May 2011 after flying to Turkey from China. He was jailed for three years in Turkey before being extradited to the United States in August 2014.
Prosecutors have said in court papers that 1920 Revolution Brigades claimed responsibility for 230 attacks in Iraq against American soldiers from 2005 to 2010.
The 1920 Revolution Brigades was active against U.S. forces in Sunni-dominated parts of Iraq until it switched sides in 2007 to fight against al-Qaida. The group derived its name from the 1920 revolution in which Iraqis revolted against a British occupation.

LOS ANGELES — Kenta Maeda underwent an MRI on Wednesday that confirmed the diagnosis of a strained muscle in his right hip.
The Dodgers placed Maeda on the DL, giving them four members of their season-opening starting rotation on the DL. Clayton Kershaw is scheduled to come off the DL and start Thursday's game.
In Maeda's place, the Dodgers promoted right-hander Dennis Santana, one of their top-rated pitching prospects. Santana, 22, had made only two starts at Triple-A Oklahoma City after starting the season in Double-A. Between the two stops, he is 1-3 with a 2.54 ERA and 1.05 WHIP in 10 starts with 65 strikeouts in 49-2/3 innings.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Santana will be available to pitch out of the bullpen in an “emergency” over the next two days but Santana could make his first big-league start this weekend in Colorado. The Dodgers will need a starter to fill in during the three-game series.
Maeda said his understanding is that the hip strain is “mild” and he is optimistic about making a quick recovery. Roberts said the Dodgers have “no idea” at this point how long Maeda will be out.

ABINGDON, VA (WJHL) – The United States Marshals Service wants to warn the public about an ongoing national jury duty phone scam that is affecting folks in our region.
Federal officials say the call begins with the alleged scammer posing as a U.S. Marshal or other law enforcement officer. The alleged scammer calls the victim and tells them that he or she has missed federal jury duty, but ‘can avoid arrest by paying a fine — immediately.'
Federal officials say other versions of the scam allegedly claimed the victim failed to appear in criminal court for a hearing or an ‘ongoing civil matter and must pay fines to avoid arrest.'
Investigators say it appears the scammers are targeting older individuals — but federal agents warn the scammers will adapt the scam to anyone who answers the call.
According to the Department of Justice, the alleged scammer provides information like title and badge numbers of legitimate law enforcement officers or court officials.
U.S. Marshals say the scammers even go as far as spoofing their phone numbers to appear on a caller ID as they are from the court or a government agency.
U.S. Marshals went on to explain the scammers direct the unsuspecting victim to purchase money orders or prepaid debit/credit cards similar to Green Dot prepaid Visa cards for payment.
Marshals are warning this is a nationwide scam and you should not provide any personal identification or money to the caller.
The U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement:
Federal courts do not call prospective jurors and ask for money or personal identifying information over the telephone. It is advised that if someone is attempting to solicit any fees or service from you that you did not request, you immediately (within a minute) identify who is calling you, why they are calling you, and then hang up. You should then look up a legitimate published telephone number (not the number the caller provided you) and validate the call as being legitimate. A legitimate service or government entity will not object to you immediately validating their efforts and this should quickly eliminate any illegitimate calls. If you believe you may be a victim of the jury duty scam, identity theft, or other scheme, you can also file a complaint online with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at http://www.ic3.gov.

Republicans have begun politicizing the shooting at the Congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia at which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others were shot.
Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) was first out of the gate, The Hill reports:
“I can only hope that the Democrats do tone down the rhetoric,” Collins told WBEN. “The rhetoric has been outrageous … the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters.”
Collins said that it was inevitable someone was going to act based on the “rhetoric” towards President Trump and the GOP.
“You know, some people react to things like that. They get angry as well. And then you fuel the fires,” said Collins, who is among the most vocal Trump backers on Capitol Hill.
Donald Trump Jr. tweeted:
Trump Jr's tweet was highlighting that of another user who accused “NY elites” of “glorifying the assassination of our President.”
Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President — Harlan Z. Hill (@Harlan) June 14, 2017
The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, the WaPo reports:
The shooter at the GOP congressional baseball practice this morning is James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., according to law enforcement officials. Hodgkinson, 66, owns a home inspection business. His home inspection license expired in November 2016 and was not renewed, state records show.
Hodgkinson was charged in April 2006 with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle, according to online records in St. Clair County, Illinois. The charges were dismissed, records show.
Users on social media are pointing to this as his Facebook page.
Donald Trump is going to make remarks about the shooting at 11:30 am.
Two members of the Vigilante Service of Ogun State (VSO), Ismaila Jimoh (aka Bintin) and Hassan Olatunde, have been arrested in connection with the death of a 28-year-old businessman, Tayo Olatunbosun.
According to Punch, Jimoh and Olatunde were said to have apprehended Olatunbosun in the Adiyan area of Ogun State on Saturday for allegedly stealing a hairdryer.
After apprehending him, they brutally beat the businessman with charms and later took him to the Agbado Police Station around 10pm.
The police later released Olatunbosun on bail. He was subsequently admitted to a hospital in the community, where he gave up the ghost on Sunday.
In the wake of the death, angry youths, who claimed the victim was returning from a party when he was arrested, took to the street and vandalised the VSO office.
The mob also reportedly set four motorcycles ablaze.
It took a combined team of operatives of the Agbado division and the Area Command, Sango, was deployed in the area to restore peace.
A resident, Bashiru Irewole, said residents were pained by Olatunbosun's death, urging the state government to curtail the excesses of the vigilance group.
He said, “Contrary to the stealing allegation, the man was returning from a party when members of the VSO stopped him. They seriously tortured him. He eventually died yesterday (Sunday) in the afternoon. He traded in accessories such as phones and laptops. He was not a thief. They just wasted his life.
“His friends attacked the VSO office. They burnt a motorcycle in front of the office and moved to the Olomowewe area in Adiyan, where they burnt three motorcycles parked by the roadside. There was confusion everywhere.
“Through the intervention of the police, the situation was brought under control on Sunday evening. Policemen have been patrolling the community.”
Another resident, who did not want his name in print, said there might have been a disagreement between Olatunbosun and the vigilantes prior to the incident.
“Those that killed him must be brought to book. I don't think they beat him because he stole the dryer or not.
“They probably had a disagreement with him before now and they decided to deal with him. They beat him with charms and later took him to the station,” he said.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the two vigilantes were later arrested by the Agbado division. A police source said the hairdryer purportedly recovered from Olatunbosun was taken to the station.
“By the time the vigilantes brought him to the station with the dryer, he had been seriously injured.
“He was released to go and treat himself, but he died in the hospital,” the source added.
The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspects were being investigated for murder and would be charged to court afterwards.
“The two vigilantes in question are in custody. The Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has ordered that they should be transferred to the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for proper investigation. Even if he was caught stealing, that does not mean he should be killed,” he added.

One of the best meteor showers of the year should peak the night of Wednesday, December 13 into the early hours of Thursday morning.
Spectators should expect to see up to 120 meteors per hour shoot across the sky. These streaks will appear as tiny remnants of an asteroid called 3200 Phaeton interact with Earth's atmosphere. This shower is special because most meteor showers are from comet remnants, while this shower is from an asteroid.
Officials with NASA say viewers should be able to watch the shower starting around 7:30 p.m., with most meteors visible from midnight to 4 a.m.
The Geminids are active every December, NASA scientists say. They're active when Earth passes through a large trail of dusty debris shed by 3200 Phaetons. The dusty debris burns up when it runs into Earth's atmosphere, creating the "shooting stars."
For more information about the meteor shower from NASA, click here.

Game players face their demons in virtual reality
Zombies from the television series “The Walking Dead” and other demons are coming to life for video game players in virtual worlds.
With new virtual reality systems, gamers will be climbing into colossal war machines to battle high-tech armies, wandering mutant-infested post-apocalyptic wastelands and going toe-to-toe with demons in new offerings unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo this week.
While play on consoles or Windows-powered personal computers continued to dominate the annual industry gathering, virtual reality flourished as game makers invested in the future.
The number of E3 exhibitors involved with virtual or augmented realities more than doubled to 126 from 53 last year, according to the Entertainment Software Association behind the event.
“This by far, is the most exciting E3 as it comes to virtual reality,” said YouTube director of gaming Ryan Wyatt.
Bathing in carnage
Virtual reality versions of blockbuster video games “Fallout,” “Doom,” and “Skyrim” were part of a lineup unveiled by Bethesda Softworks.
“Virtual reality is something we have been at the forefront of for a while now,” said Bethesda vice president of marketing Pete Hines.
Later this year, shooter game “Doom” will “bathe you in virtual carnage” as a cybernetic survivor fighting off a demon invasion.
A VR version of “Fallout” will put players into a world destroyed by nuclear war, while they will face dragons in a full-length, open-world version of “Skyrim,” according to Bethesda.
Sony built on its library of games for its PlayStation VR gear, which works with top-selling PlayStation 4 consoles.
More than a million PS VR units have been sold, along with some 5.25 million VR games.
‘Breaking Bad'
Along with games, Sony is working on a VR “experience” spinning off the television series “Breaking Bad” in a partnership with producer Vince Gilligan.
Skybound Entertainment meanwhile announced it is collaborating on virtual reality games spinning off “The Walking Dead,” the post-apocalyptic television series.
“Our goal is to honor the visceral world that (Robert) Kirkman has created while giving the Walking Dead's fans something to really sink their teeth into with robust games,” Skydance media chief executive David Ellison and operating officer Jesse Sisgold said in a statement.
A Skydance game titled “Archangel” shared behind closed doors at E3 let players take command a six-story-tall mechanized battle suit in a fight against a tyrannical corporation.
“Archangel” is to be released later this year.
“We decided to jump headfirst into the business of VR with ‘Archangel' because we saw an emerging market and want Skydance to help write this story,” Skydance Interactive president Peter Akemann told AFP.
“We know we're only at the tip of the iceberg with what VR can ultimately deliver as a gaming medium but we believe wholeheartedly in its long term potential and are investing in it as such.”
Pushing the envelope
Sony, HTC and Facebook-owned Oculus are the top players in virtual reality headgear, each striving to stake out territory in the budding market.
And even though the VR audience is lean compared to the hundreds of millions of people with consoles or personal computers, game makers are prone to embracing new technologies and understand that compelling content can inspire consumers to follow suit.
“If you don't start pushing the envelope, people won't think about upgrading hardware,” YouTube's Wyatt said of the drive toward richer graphics and immersive worlds in gaming.
“Publishers know the long-term payout that VR will have and are investing.”
Ultra-high definition graphics and virtual reality in games has been a bright spot in the personal computer, which is seeing that segment grow while the market overall declines.
While Sony's VR headsets work with PS 4 consoles, competing gear requires computers that handle the demand of processing rich, immersive graphics in real-time.
This has created opportunity for chipmakers.
“We want to work with partners to get gaming titles that are really worthy… and to grow the player base for virtual reality,” Intel senior vice president Gregory Bryant said at an E3 press event the chipmaker held in a Los Angeles theater.
“A lot of the technology and experiences we are showcasing transcend gaming; you can expect entertainment, music, sports and more.”
Gaming computer star Alienware and parent-company Dell boasted of continued investment in virtual reality and eSports.
“Virtual reality will never go away,” said Jon Peddie Research video game industry analyst Ted Pollak.
“But at the end of the day, game makers want to see a big install base of these headsets.”

There was no end of intrigue at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show this year.
Rumor, the German shepherd who narrowly lost at last year's show, had come close to simply hanging up her leash and retiring. Instead, she stormed back to win her category again this year — and then, to top it all off, beat out more than 2,800 dogs to take Best in Show on Tuesday, as well.
The triumph makes her only the second German shepherd to win the top prize in Westminster's 141-year history. Considering Westminster is the second-longest continuously running sporting event in the U.S. — second only to the Kentucky Derby — the redemptive win for the 5 1/2-year-old female is no mean feat.
Not only that, but as NPR's Merrit Kennedy noted earlier this month, Westminster also played host to another rarity at this year's dog show: cats. The featured felines shared a showcase with the dogs called Meet & Compete.
Still, whatever words we can offer on the event seem a little beside the point. The dogs — big and small, noble and loony — are the main event.
So, without further throat-clearing, here's what you came for: A few of our very favorite images from the competition.
A Chitungwiza man appeared in court on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting another man and firing his gun following a misunderstanding.
Kenneth Soka (25) appeared before Chitungwiza magistrate Mr Gideon Ruvetsa facing three counts of assault, pointing a firearm and negligence or recklessly discharge of firearm.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The prosecutor Mr Tendai Katonha alleged that on February 9 this year, at around 7:30am at TelOne car park in Zengeza 2, Richard Piyo was ordered to safeguard the vehicle by his brother Freddie Piyo.
Soka, who owns the vehicle, approached Richard and demanded to know why he was interfering in his domestic affairs.
He assaulted him.
Soka took out a gun from his waist and pointed it at Richard.
He allegedly fired a shot in the air, forcing Richard to plead for mercy.
Richard reported the matter to the police, leading to Soka's arrest. The Herald

Romero looks to lead Cougars to the postseason
Sitting at home on Monday, April 12, waiting to hear his name called in the first round of the MLB Draft after a successful season where he led the Cougars to their first-ever trip to Omaha for the College World Series — that's where junior lefthander Seth Romero hopes to be at season's end.
The West Columbia native enters his third season as a Cougar after leading the team in ERA in each of his first two. As the No. 25 prospect according to MLB.com, Romero knows an impressive year can go a long way come April's draft.
“I just want to show them what I know I can do,” Romero said. “I've been looking pretty good so I'm expecting big things. I want to go out there and help my team as much as I can and that's what I plan to do.”
Since arriving in 2015, Romero has been an integral part of the Cougars pitching staff, going 7-4 with a conference-leading 1.96 ERA and 92 strikeouts in 83.1 innings, while being named to four All-American teams.
The 2015 American Conference Rookie of the Year had his breakout performance in the Silver Glove Series against rival Rice, being named MVP of the series. In his first career start, Romero held the then No. 8 Owls to two runs, none earned while striking out nine in 6.1 innings.
“That was Seth's coming out party his freshman year,” head coach Todd Whitting said. “From that point forward, he was one of our most dominant pitchers. We put him in some tight situations for a freshman to handle and what defined him going forward is how he responded.”
In what could be seen as a down year for him in 2016, Romero finished 6-4, leading the Cougars with a 2.29 ERA and striking out a team-high 113 batters in 94.1 innings. He had his best month in March, going 4-0 with a 0.58 ERA and being named the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association pitcher of the month.
Now an upperclassman and Ace of the staff, Romero knows he has to do his part in being a leader and helping the newer Cougars adjust to playing at Houston.
“We've got a young team but all of us returners have got to do our job of showing them the way and showing them how we do,” Romero said. “If we do how we're supposed to, the results will be there.”
Heading into 2017, Romero has already received numerous accolades, being named to three Preseason All-American teams in addition to being rated the No. 10 college prospect by Baseball America.
Projected by d1baseball.com to be the AAC Pitcher of the Year, Romero knows the preseason accolades mean nothing if he doesn't go out there and prove it on the diamond.
“They mean a lot, but at the same time, I try not to focus too much on them because they don't really mean anything,” Romero said. “They're just how they think I'm going to do; I'm focusing on how I am going to do.”
Romero has taken a more professional outlook leading up to the 2017 season, working hard on improving himself and not having the same indifference that led to him being suspended for the first two weeks of 2016.
One notable area is in his conditioning, where the lefthander has worked hard to get himself in better shape, dropping down to around 220.
“He's worked extremely hard in the offseason to get his body in shape, losing probably 20-30 pounds and worked extremely hard in the weight room,” Whitting said. “The way he responded to having an average year last year and him being able to recognize that and do some things to get himself better, I'm really proud of the way he worked to this point.”
Despite an impressive season from their Ace, the Cougars missed the postseason in 2016, and they know that if they want to get back there in 2017, Romero will be key in setting the tone.
“Any team that has aspirations of playing in Omaha has to have an ace on their staff and Seth is capable of being that guy,” Whitting said. “He has lightning coming out of that left arm but I think, more than that, it's his desire and preparedness to win.”

ENFORCEMENT: The RACQ has listed the five important road rules that drivers know but ignore.
ENFORCEMENT: The RACQ has listed the five important road rules that drivers know but ignore. Liana Turner
MOST people can recognise a Stop sign and know exactly what the word "stop” means.
Most probably know what is meant by the expression: "No right turn.”
Most people can count to two, which is the minimum number of seconds of driving time we should be behind the car in front.
But you might not think so, given the frequency with which these important road rules are broken - by us, in Gympie's transport region.
RACQ says police and Department of Main Roads figures show the five most common laws drivers know but break anyway.
TMR data revealed a raft of fundamental rule breaches drivers were caught for between November 2016 and October 2017.
RACQ spokeswoman Lauren Ritchie said drivers were throwing their money away on unnecessary fines.
"It should be one of the easiest rules to understand but last year in the central police region we saw too many drivers fined for not stopping at a stop sign," Ms Ritchie said.
"Stop signs mean you must come to a fully controlled stop behind the line before you take off again.”
Ms Ritchie said these laws may seem trivial to some drivers, but they were designed to make it safer for everyone on the road.
"It's up to every driver to brush up on the road rules before they get behind the wheel, and to ensure they follow them - ignoring these laws is risking your life and the lives of others."
Ignored road rules in the central police region include:
Fail to stop at a stop sign at an intersection: 1947
Disobey 'No Right Turn' sign: 418
Follow another vehicle too closely: 509
Driving at night or in reduced visibility without lights on: 222
Driving a car with L plates when you are not a Learner or Driver Trainer: 8
Senator the Hon Arthur Sinodinos AO
Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science
Parliament House ACT 2600
Dear Minister Arthur
We write in relation to your recent statement that Pauline Hanson's One Nation is “more sophisticated” than it previously was, in response to a branch of the Liberal Party engaging in unprecedented preference deal with the party. In particular, we seek clarification on how, exactly, One Nation is now more sophisticated than in the late 1990s.
Is this enhanced sophistication reflected in the party's view of single mothers, given a One Nation candidate's view that they “are women too lazy to attract and hold a mate”, expressed in the prestigious conservative publication Quadrant?
Or has this greater level of sophistication been demonstrated in the party's foreign policy views — such as the One Nation candidate who seeks a restoration of white rule in South Africa?
Perhaps the sophistication lies in One Nation's view of LGBTI Australians? There's the candidate who claims LGBTI Australians are out to destroy families. Or the candidate who says a society that supports same-sex marriage — which now includes much of the Western world — is “degenerate” and that same-sex marriage is “undermining civilisation and making our culture more like African-American culture with its 70% illegitimacy rate”?
(We note, by the way, that referring to children born to unmarried couples as “illegitimate” stigmatises every child of de facto couples in Australia.)
There is also a One Nation candidate who claims “same-sex marriage will open the door to compulsory homosexual teachings in homes, schools and churches, thereby confusing children, students and congregations because heterosexuality will not be recognised as normal” — although we admit that the image of a sexually confused congregation perhaps represents a sophisticated sense of humour.
Same-sex marriage proponents are also, according to another One Nation candidate, using Nazi mind control programs to change people's views on the subject — which we're prepared to allow would be a “sophisticated” psychological weapon.
We're also unclear on what is “sophisticated” about claiming the 9/11 attacks were fake, given 9/11 truthers have been around so long their lies have become internet memes — although apparently the fake nature of the 9/11 attacks is not official One Nation policy even though the candidate who claims they were fake is still running under the One Nation banner. Perhaps he believes the hijackers used a Nazi mind control program.
Arguably, these are all merely the views of One Nation candidates, rather than the views of its elected officials. We note, however, that your Queensland Senate colleague Malcolm Roberts claims that abortion is a UN plot, that global finance is controlled by wealthy Jewish families via “privately owned central banks” and that they are behind the “hoax” of climate change; indeed, that “Goldman Sachs already controls much of the world reportedly on behalf of the Rothschilds.” As a former bank executive, we understand you would be in a strong position to assess the accuracy and, for that matter, the “sophistication” of such claims. However, we note that none of these conspiracy theories from Roberts are particularly new — indeed, despite One Nation's strongly protectionist economic policies, Roberts has to import all his conspiracy theories from foreign sources.
Pauline Hanson has also claims that the Family Court system makes men murder women and children out of frustration — is this perhaps a sophisticated analysis of family law and domestic homicide?
Or is it, perhaps, that Hanson's greater sophistication lies in switching the focus of her hatred and bigotry from Asian Australians to Muslim Australians since the 1990s, reflecting an innovative, agile ability to shift the target of racist demonisation as fashion dictates?
Yours sincerely,
Crikey
After a warm Saturday, the next few days look cooler. Tonight temperatures fall to around 40° with mostly clear skies. Skies will stay mostly clear tomorrow as a cold front dives through. Highs probably won't make it out of the 50s Sunday before the cold front causes temperatures to fall. It'll be a chilly Superbowl evening and night with temperatures in the 40s and eventually 20s by early Monday morning. Highs stay in the mid 50s on Monday and will struggle to get out of the 40s on Tuesday thanks to cloud cover and rain chances. Showers will be possible on Tuesday but heavy rain amounts aren't expected and it won't do anything to dent drought conditions. Drizzle/fog will also be possible as we head into Monday night/Tuesday morning.

President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has some unlikely fans in the US among far-right communities.
In a video that was posted on Twitter, three men who took part in the Charlottesville protests talk about their support for Assad, the notorious Syrian leader accused of killing thousands of his own people. One of the men is wearing a T-shirt that reads “Bashar's Barrel Delivery Co.”
"Support the Syrian Arab army," one of them says.

Assad is accused of dropping barrel bombs on civilian populations to terrorize them.
There was a picture of Assad on the Facebook page of James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of being the driver of the car that hit and killed counterprotester Heather Heyer. In the picture, Assad is in full military uniform, wearing sunglasses. Below him is the word "undefeated."

According to Joyce Karam, a reporter with The National and Al Hayat, support for Assad among far-right groups is not new. It's just more visible.
For example, she says, David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, has been praising Assad for years. In 2009, he visited Syria and spoke with members of the Assad government.
Syria is a beautiful nation, with a rich history & amazing leader. President Assad should be our close ally (there's no question about that) https://t.co/idycwANHn7 — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) March 13, 2017
Karam believes there are three main reasons why the far-right is fascinated with the Syrian leader.
One, his stance on Israel. "[David Duke] looks up to the Assad regime as an anti-Israel body politic in the Middle East," Karam says. "[It's] a regime that bashes Zionism publicly."
Next, his defiance in the face of ISIS. "I think what Assad represents today [is] somebody who is, to them, barrel bombing radical Islamists. They see that as a good thing," Karam says.
The third reason behind this fondness for Assad is the ferocity with which he has crushed the uprising in his own country. The far-right views Assad as a strong man, as an authoritarian who will use any means to reach his goals.
Karam adds that Assad is aware of his own appeal within the far-right community in the US. And maybe even doesn't mind it.
"This is a leader who jumps at any opportunity [for] admiration from the United States," she says.

For three quarters on Sunday afternoon, the Giants stuck right with the Dallas Cowboys.
Despite 12 games of epic injuries and incompetence, which had left several vocational corpses in its wake, from fired head coach Ben McAdoo to just-as-out-of-work general manager Jerry Reese, Big Blue was right with the superior Cowboys, who have more to play with and play for.
Then the fourth quarter started and a taut 10-10 tie morphed into a 30-10 rout. There was nothing fancy about the way Dallas did it, either. Simply, the Cowboys had an extra gear and the Giants didn't.
Even without suspended running back Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys (7-6) had more than enough to vanquish the downtrodden Giants. Take future Hall of Fame tight end Jason Witten, for example.
Witten doesn't catch that many passes anymore, but when he does he seem to do it in the end zone. To give his career some context, consider this: Of Witten's 1,141 career receptions, 154 have come against the Giants.
For a Cowboys team almost impossible to root for, Witten is the rare ray of sunshine for a franchise that always goes dark well before the Super Bowl. If you don't know his story, Witten had a rather turbulent childhood that eventually morphed into a stellar professional career that will almost certainly land him in Canton some day.
There were no such heartwarming narratives on the other sideline. The Giants (2-11) are an absolute, abject mess. It felt like they were a unit on Sunday for about 45 minutes, as they traded blows with the Cowboys, using a stout defense and an occasional passing game that had been taped together with retreads and neophytes. It wasn't a matter of coaching, of tactics or execution on Sunday, the Giants just stink right now.
You saw the fourth-quarter wreckage. Someone named Rod Smith — not the great former Broncos wideout, mind you — gallop for a long touchdown. Quarterback Dak Prescott seemed to have his way with Big Blue's defense from there, tossing two of his three TDs in the final quarter. Prescott finished with 332 passing yards, completing 20 of his 30 throws (66 percent), for a robust 137.1 rating.
Smith didn't just have the 45-yard scoring run. He also had an 81-yard scoring reception. Of Smith's 160 total yards, only 47 came on the ground. He was Dallas' leading receiver on this day, besting even Dez Bryant, who had a 50-yard highlight-reel catch-and-run TD of his own. In all, eight Cowboys caught passes.
On the other side, Wayne Gallman led the Giants in rushing with a pedestrian 59 yards. Evan Engram led Big Blue in receiving, with four bland catches for 54 yards, including 35 on one grab.
Making matters worse for Big Blue was the fact that Cowboys' all-world linebacker Sean Lee was everywhere. As if there were two of him on the field, Lee had 18 tackles, and seemed to amaze fans, friends, and FOX's broadcast duo.
In a painful reminder that the Giants' season has melted into indifference and ignominy, there were thousands of Cowboys fans in the stands. When Witten scored his touchdown, it almost sounded like the game was being played in Dallas.
And, of course, we had Eli Manning, who was coming off the epic embarrassment of being benched after 210 straight starts. And it was done for no other reason than McAdoo and Reese feeling like they had nothing else to do. I mean, benching a potential Hall of Famer for Geno Smith? Why not?
No, Manning didn't come back with a bang. He didn't short-circuit the scoreboard. But it was hard to expect much from him without his two best receivers, little to no running game, and a patchwork offensive line. Still, it was good to see Manning under center, where he belongs, where he had been every week, every game, every snap since 2004.
The Giants don't belong in the playoffs, or in contention, but at least they didn't embarrass themselves … for three quarters, anyway.

German police say that a 19-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker has suffered serious burns after setting himself on fire at a supermarket warehouse in Bavaria.
Police said that the man poured gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze early Monday in Gaimersheim, a town between Nuremberg and Munich. He had bought the gasoline shortly before at a filling station.
The blaze was extinguished swiftly by other people at the scene, but the man was seriously injured.
The man's motives weren't immediately clear. Police say he was carrying a knife but didn't use it.
Savvy travelers seeking to close out 2017 in style don't need to ready their passports just yet. This December, escape the snowy grey streets for warm weather and a warmer welcome in New Orleans. Pack your bags and enjoy plenty of opportunities to have a ball at the opening of a very exciting year for the city.
A TRICENTENNIAL KICKOFF
While the Crescent City draws legions of visitors for Mardi Gras (and Southern Decadence), NOLA also offers a bevy of options to ring in the new year. January kicks off an extra special 300th birthday year, as 2018 marks New Orleans' Tricentennial celebrations.
2018 will be spent celebrating the city's rich history, strength in the face of adversity, vibrant community and the bright future ahead. The 300th birthday will feature some of the biggest bashes in New Orleans history, including special celebrations of the city's staples like a King's Day Mardi Gras kick-off, Jazz Fest and even a few special New Year's events.
The crowning kickoff of the 300th year is the spectacular riverfront fireworks show, Symphony in the Sky. And Jackson Square will be alive for the annual fleur-de-lis drop with Ryan Seacrest and other celebrity guests for the Central Time Zone New Years' Countdown of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve! Rather than drop a ball on New Year's Eve, NOLA drops a six-foot lighted fleur-de-lis, the city's adopted symbol.
Eat
Any time is a good time to eat in New Orleans. The city's world-renowned restaurant scene blends traditional Creole cuisine with cutting-edge culinary innovations. December is a prime time to taste the best the city has to offer as many restaurants offer special Reveillon menus.
The Reveillon tradition dates back to the 19th century when most of the city was Catholic and would return from midnight mass on Christmas Eve to lavish meals that sometimes lasted until dawn. Now, Reveillon has been reimagined as an extended restaurant week with many of the city's finest eateries offering exciting special menus throughout the holiday season.
This year, you can enjoy a four-course, pre-fixe meal at Vacherie ($45, featuring dishes like seafood gumbo, alligator sausage, coq au vin and Louisiana pecan pie), Tujague's ($54, featuring dishes like Louisiana shrimp and goat cheese crepes, Creole turtle soup, chicken pontalba and white chocolate bread pudding) and more than 50 other top restaurants.
Drink
What's a New Year celebration without a little (or a lot) of bubbly? You can't go wrong at any of the gay bars in the French Quarter (affectionately known as the “Fruit Loop”). Take a tour of the holiday specials at local favorites like Oz, Bourbon Pub and Parade, Cafe Lafitte in Exile, 700 Club and Good Friends Bar, all within a three-block walk.
If you're looking for an all-inclusive experience, Bourbon Vieux is mixing it up for a mixed crowd at an unforgettable New Year's Eve party that includes an open bar, gourmet buffet and champagne toast. Tickets to the party are $170.
Bourbon Vieux boasts the largest balcony on Bourbon Street, but you can enjoy a view of the New Year's fireworks over the river at Pat O'Brien's. The $155 ticket includes food, drinks and party favors as well.
You can get an even closer look at the fireworks aboard boozy Mississippi River cruises from the Paddlewheeler Creole Queen, Steamboat Natchez and more.
Be Merry
The heart of New Orleans's New Year's celebrations is in Jackson Square. Revelers will crowd the square to see New Orleans' signature fleur-de-lis drop.
Even if you're not a sports fan, it's worth checking out the Allstate Sugar Bowl Fan Fest. The football-heavy series of events and activities is also the home for Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Central Time Zone countdown, and has previously featured performances from pop powerhouses like Kelly Clarkson, Usher and Panic! At the Disco. At midnight, there will be special Tricentennial fireworks.
While you're in town, you can also take in all the razzle dazzle of Celebration in the Oaks, a spectacular holiday lights festival in City Park. Hundreds of thousands of twinkling lights adorn 25 acres, spanning the Botanical Garden, Storyland and Carousel Gardens Amusement Park.

CONFUSED about exactly where the Gympie Town Centre 40 zones stop and start? Fear not.
Gympie Regional Council and the Department of Transport have both clarified where, when and on what roads drivers should be travelling at 40 km/h in the CBD and surrounding areas after a resident recently expressed concerns to The Gympie Times.

"There are some streets where signs start halfway along, others that don't seem to have an End 40 sign, (and) there is the confusing one near ... that has 'End 40' right in front of (a) School 40 zone,” the resident said.
A council spokeswoman said most 40 km/h zones are either within the Town Centre or in close proximity to local schools.
"The Gympie Town centre is generally covered by a 40km speed limit with the exception of lower Mary Street, Smithfield Street and Glandore Lane which are 20km areas,” the spokeswoman said.
"The majority of the outlying 40km areas cover timed school zones.”
Council also supplied a detailed map showing which roads had restricted speed limits around Gympie, which can be viewed below.

A TMR spokesperson outlined the enforced limits on Gympie roads managed by the state department.
"Brisbane Road is the local name for a section of Tin Can Bay Road, between the Bruce Highway and the turn-off to Tin Can Bay (and) Cootharaba Road,” the spokesperson said.
"It is sign posted at 60km/h, however there are two school zones (40km/h) clearly signed on this section of Tin Can Bay Road.
"Speed limits in built-up areas in Queensland are 50km/h unless otherwise indicated by signs.
"Channon Street is the local name for a section of Gympie-Connection Road, between the Bruce Highway and Horseshoe Bend, and is sign posted at 60km/h.”

PDP tasks government on economic revival strategies
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is advising the Federal Government to put in place viable economic strategies that would offer sustainable solutions to Nigeria's economic challenges.
In a New Year message yesterday by the spokesman of its national caretaker committee, Dayo Adeyeye, the PDP said Nigeria's economy had degenerated from the largest and fastest growing African economy in 2014 to take the rear position of number 30 because of what it called sheer incompetence and lack of ideas on how to tackle the problems by the Federal government.
The PDP charged the Federal Government to “employ the services of economic experts to put in place viable policies that will revamp our ailing economy.”
According to the opposition party, “We are presently in recession because of significant decline in government business in both internal and external spheres. The Federal Government should increase money supply, cause rise in disposable income and decrease mindless taxations which have led to high inflation and multiple prices in money market.”
The PDP also charged Nigerians to work harder and trust in their capacities to surmount the current economic condition pointing out that the bad policies of government since May 2016 had “occasioned this economic recession with its attendant consequences of extreme hardship, starvation, deprivation, insecurity and rise in ethnic, sectional and political agitations for self-determination.”

Rescue crews are searching the waters off Huntington Beach's Tower 18 for a missing swimmer.
The man was swimming with another person when they got into the surf line and a large wave separated them, Huntington Beach Fire Capt. Carl Corbin said. The second man got out of the water, but the missing swimmer was not seen.
The man was reported missing just after 4 p.m.
Tower 18 is just south of Goldenwest Street.
Boats, Jet Skis, helicopters and divers are all helping in the search, Corbin said.
“The conditions are probably a little rougher than some days,” Corbin said, describing the waves and 3 to 5 feet and the conditions windy and choppy.
Nine firefighters were called to tackle a washing machine fire at a Sunderland home.
Crews from Marley Park and Sunderland Central Community Fire Stations were called to a two storey house on Cato Street in Southwick at 9.40am today, Friday, February 2.
When firefighters arrived the resident had disconnected the washing machine from the electricity supply and managed to evacuate the property.
Firefighters put out the fire using a carbon dioxide extinguisher and removed the washing machine from the house.
They also use two breathing apparatus and a positive pressure ventilator was used to ventilate smoke from the home.
Children with a rare, incurable disease that causes rapid aging and early death may live longer if treated with an experimental drug first developed for cancer patients, a study suggests.
The small, preliminary study isn't proof the drug works and it found only a small benefit: Treated children with the disease progeria were more likely than others to survive during the two-year study. But some kids taking the drug in this and other studies have lived into their late teens. Researchers and others say the results suggest a potential breakthrough for a heartbreaking condition that typically kills kids before they reach adulthood.
"Anything we can do to try to provide them hope of a longer life is well worth doing and well worth celebrating," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, who was not part of the new study. A geneticist, Collins led laboratory experiments that in 2003 identified the genetic basis for the disease, formally known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.
Among 27 children with progeria who got the drug lonafarnib, one died during the 2007-2010 study. That's compared with nine of 27 untreated children with the disease. Thirteen of the treated children are still alive; most began taking other experimental drugs too.
"For the first time ever we have a drug that is shown to extend lifespan for children with progeria," said lead author Dr. Leslie Gordon of Brown University. Her son was a study participant and died in 2014 at age 17.
The results were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study, conducted at Boston Children's Hospital, was unusually designed, comparing children given the drug with other progeria patients worldwide who weren't enrolled in the study. The untreated kids were matched as closely as possible with study participants by age, gender and other characteristics, but they weren't a standard control group and didn't receive dummy medication.
That design weakens the study conclusions, said Dr. Howard Worman, a Columbia University biologist. "You really cannot say anything 'worked' without a contemporary placebo control."
The children in the study were also involved in earlier research testing the same drug combined with two others. Within a period of about five years, survival was extended by about 19 months. It wasn't clear if all three drugs or just one or two of them contributed to the improvement. Lonafarnib also appeared to reduce blood vessel damage.
Average life expectancy for progeria children is about 14 years. Though many die younger, usually from heart attacks or strokes, some lonafarnib-treated kids have lived to their late teens.
For parents, who want to see their children grow up, that sliver of extra time is a bittersweet blessing.
"If you're a mom and you're told that life expectancy is 13 years, that 1.6 years is gold," said Heather Unsinger. Her 7-year-old daughter, Carly, was a study participant and has been taking lonafarnib since age 3. "But it's really hard to jump up and down."
Affected children are typically small, bald and fragile-looking but intellectually normal. Carly "has full-throttle dreams" and envisions becoming an art teacher one day, her mom said.
Other kids "always think I'm a baby," Carly said. But "I'm a regular kid."
Progeria is caused by a mutation in a gene that regulates production of a protein that helps shape and support the nucleus of cells throughout the body. In normal aging, the protein accumulates in cells but in children with progeria, an abnormal buildup occurs that severely damages cells. Lonafarnib helps block that abnormal buildup.
The disease affects about 1 in 20 million people. It is a chance mutation and isn't inherited. Affected children are born looking healthy, but fail to grow normally, lose body fat and hair and develop aged-looking skin, stiff joints and diseased arteries.
Lonafarnib was initially developed as a potential cancer treatment but without much success. Schering Plough/Merck supplied the study drug; the research was paid for by the Progeria Research Foundation.
Gordon, the lead author, and her husband, Dr. Scott Berns, started the foundation in 1999 after their son, Sam, was diagnosed. She is continuing to study lonafarnib and other drugs in kids with progeria.
University of Washington geneticist Dr. Fuki Hisama predicted that lonafarnib will eventually become standard treatment for progeria, though not a cure.
The study "gives other people the message that there is hope for rare diseases," said Hisama, who wrote an accompanying journal editorial.

President Trump is never more visibly pained than when he has to convey to the world that he's comfortable in his own skin. The president's discomfort with pretending to be a warm, convivial host has never been more apparent than when he hosted French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron at the White House this week.
Trump is most at ease when he's focusing on the thing he loves most in this world: himself. When he has to pretend to be interested in other people — like his wife, school shooting victims, allied heads of state, or children who aren't Ivanka — is when things go off the rails. Take for example, this moment in the Oval Office where Trump was trying to project an air of casual camaraderie and affection between the two world leaders by brushing what was likely imaginary dandruff off of Macron's shoulder in front of the photo spray. You know, that common joke between dudes where one guy tells a crowd of people that the other's scalp is flaking off all over his lapel. Classic bit.
“We have to make him perfect,” Trump said to the press pool while Macron laughed off the bizarre gesture. “He is perfect.”
If there's anything that strengthens relations between two countries, it's pointing out dandruff pic.twitter.com/KPxnrvtp5o — Dave Brown (@dave_brown24) April 24, 2018
Trump likes making huge displays of touching Macron. I get it, the French president is a handsome as far as world leaders go. Here's a curious instance of Trump grabbing Macron's hand and leading him back into the White House with the same kind of force and intensity with which I'd grab a friend and drag her over to the ballpit at Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but Trump really enjoys touching Macron. He enjoys, touching, patting, tugging on his arm, doing that alpha “I'm hugging you, but I'm hitting you” back pat, and kissing Macron. He also enjoys telling the press how much he likes Macron after giving the French president the equivalent of a full TSA frisk in front of photographers.
why can't he just act like a normal adult human WHY pic.twitter.com/6ts6sEqXJA — shauna (@goldengateblond) April 24, 2018
The first lady, on the other hand, is considerably less receptive her husband's advances. Consider this moment in the Rose Garden where Trump makes a persistent effort to get Melania to finally take his hand. After tapping his wife's hand repeatedly with his index finger, he finally fashions his pinky into a little hook and grabs hold of Melania's hand until she finally relents. She doesn't look particularly stoked about the public display of affection, but she's being generous considering how the recent news cycle was dominated by stories about her husband allegedly maybe paying Russian sex workers to pee on each other in a Moscow hotel suite.
Trump trying to hold Melania's hand reminds me of Pepé le Pew chasing a bewildered Le Cat. pic.twitter.com/ZlhbtAJDuH — laney (@misslaneym) April 24, 2018
As this footage of shows, Melania's hat choice was strategic in that the comically wide brim blocks her husband from making actual contact when going in for the cheek kiss. Brigitte Macron wasn't so lucky.

Although Trump wants to impress his buddy Macron, he still manages to lose his chill in front of his guest, like when ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl asks Trump if he's going to pardon his devoted fixer Michael Cohen should the president's consigliere actually catch a conviction following a recent FBI raid.
“Stupid question,” Trump snipes while Macron sits next to him making exaggerated “this guy! right?” faces.
When Jon Karl asked about a Michael Cohen pardon, Trump gave him the “Stupid Question” response. Seems like a pretty good question to me. (Check out Macron's facial expression) pic.twitter.com/ygoIDEK17s — Red T Raccoon (@RedTRaccoon) April 24, 2018
The Macrons' state visit doesn't end till Wednesday, so there's still plenty of time for Trump to make his guests, and everyone around them, uncomfortable.

Goni: Without INTELS, I Wouldn't Have Acquired a Degree
Barivule Goni is a physically challenged staff of Intels Nigeria Limited. A graduate of Economics from the University of Port Harcourt, Goni shares her experience working with the Nigeria's oil and gas logistics giant. Excerpts:
Please tell us your name and a bit about yourself.
My name is Barivule Angela Goni. I am a woman with physical disability of the legs caused by polio few months before my first birthday. I am from Rivers State, a graduate of Economics from the University of Port Harcourt and a likeable personality.
How long have you worked with INTELS?
I have worked with INTELS for three years and six months. Although, I did a one year Graduate Trainee with INTELS and after successful completion I was immediately employed.
When did you become a beneficiary of the INTELS scholarship for physically challenged children?
I became a beneficiary of the INTELS scholarship in 2005 – the year I got admission after presenting a proof of my admission.
How long did the scholarship last?
The scholarship lasted for four years – the duration of my course at the university.
What difference did the scholarship make in your life as a person?
The scholarship made a lot of difference in many areas of my life. Most importantly, it enabled me to fulfill my dream of becoming a graduate. I was almost losing hope of going to the university due to lack of finance but the scholarship made this dream a reality. It took care of my tuition and daily needs while in school so that I was able me to meet the day-to-day demands of the school, which as a person with disability would have been difficult; for example, paying my transport fares to attend lectures.
How has it been working in INTELS with the physical challenge that you have considering that Nigeria as a country and many businesses in the country have little or no regard at all for the physically challenged?
INTELS has created an accessible platform that enables me carry out my job/responsibilities daily without hindrances. Though I work on the third floor, I have not had difficulties or been in need of human help getting there despite the fact that I am physically challenged. This is great. Moreover, this is only seen in overseas where the physically challenged do not have to be assisted to work. INTELS has created an inclusive platform, which the government and other businesses (especially multinational companies) in this country have failed to do. For many companies, investing in the lives of those living with disabilities is wasteful. They would rather give working aids (wheelchair, crutches and or walking stick) as the case may be that are of low standards to them or share a few foodstuffs during festive periods occasionally but INTELS has shown that people living with disabilities are employable and have done everything to ensure that they are happy in the community.
In the past, physically challenged persons are cheated out of their own share of the resources of the land and are seen as beggars and of no use thus, the universities and other public buildings are inaccessible to them but INTELS is changing all that through their scholarship and employment of the physically challenged.
One thing worthy of mention here is that I am not treated by my colleagues with pity just because I am physically challenged. I am accepted and respected as everyone else and I am allowed to carry out my daily task according to the job description for my level.
To say INTELS has changed my life is an understatement. INTELS has greatly changed my life and it is getting better and better. I rise up daily with a sense of purpose and hope. I know that by the grace of God all my dreams will come true. I own and ride my car thus, mobility problem solved. I pay my house rent – shelter issues taken care of. I feed myself, take care of my personal needs and contribute my quota in any association or social group I belong.
In addition, I have been able to assist my siblings and take care of my parents in my little way. I am not a burden or liability to family but an asset, someone that has prospects. Thus, dependency issue solved and I am treated with respect in my family and among friends. What can I say, “Thank you INTELS”.
How many physically challenged people work in INTELS at present at what is the company's policy towards them?
At present, there are 13 physically challenged persons working with INTELS and one is still on training. The company gives them all the necessary support and respect deserving of a human being. They are treated with dignity.
Tell us more about the company's CSR, especially as it regards helping the less privileged and physically challenged children in the society.
The Corporate Social Responsibility of INTELS as regards helping the less privilege and physically challenged children in the society takes care of education, which span from primary to tertiary education and, assistance in the provision of artificial limb for amputee, corrective surgery for polio affected children. Amongst all that, they ensure the employment of the physically challenged. I think INTELS understands that people living with disability are humans and a part of the society; that, they too have something to offer and when given the opportunity can do great things. That is why it has taken its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) beyond what is known and seen in Nigeria. Indisputably, INTELS is the only company that not only has a growing number of physically challenged persons on its staff list but also has been consistent since the commencement of its scholarship in 2003.
They have done what I call “true empowerment”. That is, challenging the person to live out his or her God-given purpose by creating an opportunity and an enabling environment. The company has ensured the education of many persons living with disability from primary to tertiary level without financial hindrance as most of us are from poor backgrounds and can only dream of being educated but could not afford it due to lack of finance.
I must say here that for many companies this is a waste of time and scare resources and would bring in no profit. They would rather sponsor beauty pageants and all kinds of entertainment in order to promote their brands and company rather than carry out true CSR especially one in which the government of the day has no interest; one that would truly change the lives of the less privileged. Even when they do, they are not sustainable as INTELS which has done it for more than fourteen years and even through the economic recession or meltdown, ensures that lives are change through its CSR.
What are your hopes and aspiration as a person who has benefitted tremendously from INTELS' benevolence?
My hope as someone who has benefitted tremendously from INTELS is that government should appreciate what INTELS has been able to contribute in the community and create laws that will encourage companies and businesses to create accessible platforms for persons living with disabilities so that many can be employed too because they have been neglected for so long.
In addition, government should make public places accessible to the physically challenged so that they can be informed and productive. For me, I aspire to travel and see different places and experience many cultures of the world. I also want to inspire and encourage younger generations of persons living with disabilities to embrace education because it is their right.

It has been clear for months, however, that Pai does not intend to do the right thing where the internet — our internet — is concerned.
Just one day after Pai released that statement on transparency, he quickly repealed several orders and reports issued by the FCC as the Obama administration wound down. Pai's reasoning was that these "midnight regulations" did not have the support of two of the four remaining commissioners and ran "contrary to the wishes expressed by the leadership of... congressional oversight committees." If you think that rationale sounds a little thin, because it basically boils down to "we didn't like it," you're not the only one. Commissioner Mignon Clyburn responded to Pai's actions that same day by noting that it's "a basic principle of administrative procedure" that actions should be explained. She also added that Pai was critical of the commission's earlier left-leaning majority because for "not providing sufficient reasoning behind its decisions."
The list of items yanked from the record ranged from a report on potential security concerns around 5G to a paper that addresses progress on reforming discounted internet access for schools. Seemingly important stuff, by the sound of things. Most notably, an investigation into "zero-rating" -- a worrisome practice in which telecoms and ISPs don't count certain services against data caps, giving them distinct advantages over their competitors -- was shut down. These are meaty topics that would benefit from more insight, but the haste with which Pai dismissed these reports sure seems to indicate some disdain. Forget about leading by example — Chairman Pai's push for transparency has been marred by hypocrisy since the very beginning. And things obviously didn't end there.
Later that month, the commission voted along party lines to revive and revise an exemption that allowed certain ISPs to dodge reporting requirements laid out in the 2015 Open Internet Order. That resuscitated exemption means that any internet service provider with fewer than 250,000 subscribers doesn't have to disclose information about fees, data caps and ways providers manage their networks to their customers. While this, strictly speaking, doesn't have much to do with the sort of operational transparency Pai pushed for early in his chairmanship, it's a chilling admission that the majority of the FCC — Pai included — isn't troubled by hiding important information from the public.
Prior to the publication of the FCC's new plan to roll back the open internet protections laid out in the 2015 order, Chairman Pai met with a number of people, including representatives on lobbyist groups like USTelecom. Despite the far-reaching implications of those conversations, the contents of those meetings have never been revealed. Two FOIA requests and a subsequent lawsuit filed by watchdog group American Oversight shed some light on the situation, but what happened inside those meetings remains a mystery. As a result, though, the FCC did eventually release calendar information and related messages about Pai's meetings, along with communications with Congress and the White House on the subject of net neutrality. This definitely isn't a good look for a man who began his tenure as FCC chairman claiming to want a more open process.
Before enacting new rules for managing the internet, the FCC must also accept feedback from the public, though it's been made clear that even an avalanche of pro-net neutrality comments probably won't make a difference. Unless you're a lawyer or a telecom insider, your arguments are held in very, very low regard by the FCC. That sort of disregard for feedback was made even more apparent when reports surfaced alleging that many of the nearly 22 million statements the FCC received during its public comment period were fraudulent. An analysis performed by data scientist David Kao found that, after stripping out apparently fake comments, nearly 99 percent of the remaining submissions favored existing net-neutrality rules.
A follow-up report from the Pew Research Center found that only 6 percent of comments submitted were unique, and that the seven copied-and-pasted comments accounted for 38 percent of all submissions. The kicker: Six of those seven comments "argued against net neutrality regulations," indicating a concerted effort to stuff this virtual ballot box. Pai's response to all this? Nothing of substance. He instead spent his time in the days leading up to the report's release taking aim at celebrity critics on Twitter and reaffirmed that the commenting process isn't an opinion poll "for good reason." Meanwhile, an investigation into the fake comments led by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneidermann was met by an unhelpful agency and an FCC spokesperson -- Mark Wigfield -- who derided the whole thing as a publicity stunt.
The FCC inspector general's office finally relented last week, and signaled that it may — in some way — aid in the investigation. Still, the dragging of feet and the political posturing have prompted even more criticism of the FCC's handling of net neutrality.
"While I fundamentally disagree with the merits of the FCC's proposal, what is equally concerning is the lack of integrity to the FCC's process that has led to this point," said commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement. "To review, the FCC has held zero public hearings. The FCC has knowingly maintained a system that has already been corrupted and is susceptible to abuse."
Recently Pai delivered a keynote address at the Telecommunications and Media Forum at — where else? — Verizon Communications' Washington, D.C., headquarters. (Quick reminder, if it wasn't obvious: Verizon owns Engadget's parent company, Oath, but it has no control over what we cover and how.) The contents of Pai's address remain secret, as the event's organizers held to the decades-old Chatham House rule (just because, apparently), which stipulates that "participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed."
Given Pai's tenure as a Verizon lawyer, Verizon's sponsorship of the event and the topics slated to be discussed there, it seems rather convenient that Pai is using an arcane British code to shield his comments. For all we know, Pai might have spent his time pandering to his telecom buddies, or gloating over the impending death of the Open Internet Order. As with many things the FCC has done this year, we'll probably never know what really happened. Thanks to a video Gizmodo obtained of Pai's recent address at the Federal Communications Bar Association Dinner, though, we do know that he doesn't mind joking about being a Verizon shill.
Despite what he has said in the past, Ajit Pai's version of transparency is willfully ignorant at best and maliciously hypocritical at worst. When the FCC convenes to vote next week, the agency's ideological fault line will most certainly lead to an unavoidable conclusion. With Commissioner Brendan Carr joining Pai and Michael O'Rielly, the FCC will vote to abolish the common-carrier classification that would force ISPs and telecom giants to treat all data passing through their pipes equally. What happens next remains to be seen, but one thing seems clear: While true transparency might not have changed this outcome, it certainly would've helped the rest of us come to grips with the process. Unfortunately, Chairman Pai's words and actions just don't match up.
