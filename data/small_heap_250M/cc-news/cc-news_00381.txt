Gorakhpur: Pardaphash has learned that Dr Kafeel Khan, who was first being portrayed as a hero, would spend duty hours in his private hospital.
Dr Kafeel was the chief nodal officer of Japanese Encephalitis department in the hospital and was sacked yesterday.
According to the sources, he bought oxygen using his own money when the BRD hospital faced shortage because of the non-payment of dues to suppliers.
However, after the initial probe, his role turn out to be quite dubious. Dr Kafeel is not known for his magnanimity, but for his private practice, and the cylinders he brought were those he syphoned off from the government hospital.
If hospital staff is to be believed, Dr Kafeel was one of the people responsible for the disaster in which 60 children died in a matter of three days.
CSUSM offers guidance and support for undocumented students

Under the Trump Administration, many are concerned about immigration rights, particularly on how new laws could apply to college campus communities.
Undocumented students have some protections due to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a policy enacted in 2012 under the Obama administration.
Not every undocumented student is a DACA recipient — or “Dreamer.”
California Assembly Bill 540 allows financial support for undocumented students regardless of DACA status. It is unclear how any changes to federal law might impact California and the CSU system.
Dr. Deborah Kang of the History Department said she wanted to host an event focusing on how to help and support undocumented individuals.
Faculty members, the National Latino Research Center, the Office of Diversity, Educational Equity and Inclusion, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MeCHA) and Standing Together as oNe Dream (STAND), helped organize the Jan. 24 event.
The National Latino Research Center's Dr. Arecela Nunez-Alvarez and Lilian Serrano lectured immigrant rights.
Regardless of someone's status, they each said, an individual has rights that extend from the Bill of Rights and these rights apply no matter where you are within the United States.
“If you are stopped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), they must have a warrant with your information to legally detain you,” Serrano said.
If detained, demand an immigration lawyer and remain silent, make sure to have that lawyer's contact information available and have proper identification, the speakers advised. Having identification papers from another country could be problematic — a sign of one's status. Don't sign paperwork without a lawyer you may inadvertently waive your right to stay in the U.S. by signing a voluntary departure agreement, they said.
Serrano said the California Truth Act requires law enforcement to inform an individual that speaking with ICE is voluntary.
Organizations like STAND offer students, regardless of their status, support to accomplish their “goals and dreams, though the path may be difficult,” said STAND President Julio Villa. He encouraged students to attend to meetings no matter their status.
Dr. Michelle Ramos-Pellicia presented on a resolution passed by Academic Senate that offers support. It establishes that the “Academic Senate CSUSM stands in support of undocumented students … [it calls for] the establishment of a task force to articulate and address needs of undocumented students … [and] completion of ‘Education Without Borders' training provided by STAND.”
The resolution was approved Dec. 7 with only one vote of opposition.
With DACA repeal possible (and a Trump executive order expanding ICE being signed just a day after the lecture), Dr. Nunez-Alvarez and Serrano reminded audience members that being vigilant and creating a plan if DACA is eliminated or ICE confronts you is key.
In September, the University Police Department released a letter to the campus explaining the CSU system policy regarding ICE: The department will not detain nor question individuals based on suspicions and will not enter into enforcement agreements with immigration agencies.
During a spring 2016 job fair, students protested the presence of ICE recruiters, which alarmed some students concerned about their safety. Some questioned the agency's presence as it seemed to put the employment opportunities with ICE over the safety of students.
Since this incident, UPD has worked on improving its relationship with students and being more transparent about such events, UPD officials said. They have expressed both in the fall 2016 letter and in interview that they want students to feel safe on campus and know that they are safe within UPD regardless of status.

António Guterres assumed office on Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017, as the ninth United Nations Secretary General after Ban Ki-moon's exit following the completion of a 10 year- tenure on Saturday, Dec. 31. Guterres, in his maiden message as the UN Secretary-General, entitled: “Appeal for Peace”, urged the world to make a New Year resolution “to put peace first”.
“On my first day as Secretary-General of the United Nations, one question weighs heavily on my heart.
“How can we help the millions of people caught up in conflict, suffering massively in wars with no end in sight?
“Civilians are pounded with deadly force. Women, children and men are killed and injured, forced from their homes, dispossessed and destitute. Even hospitals and aid convoys are targeted.”
According to him, no one wins these wars rather, everyone loses.
Guterres pointed out that trillions of dollars were spent destroying societies and economies, fueling cycles of mistrust and fear that can last for generations.
He regretted that whole regions were destabilised adding, the new threat of global terrorism affects us all.
“On this New Year's Day, I ask all of you to join me in making one shared New Year's resolution: Let us resolve to put peace first.
“Let us make 2017 a year in which we all – citizens, governments, leaders – strive to overcome our differences.
“From solidarity and compassion in our daily lives, to dialogue and respect across political divides… From ceasefires on the battlefield, to compromise at the negotiating table to reach political solutions…
“Peace must be our goal and our guide,” the new UN scribe said.
The first of two large systems tracks across Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon, with a second system heading our way Friday.
Saskatoon Forecast

AFTER Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah signed the paper of accession with India and took over reins from the Dogra ruler, it created a trust deficit between him and the Kashmiri population. Prior to this act, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah was widely regarded as the leader of masses and because of this decision he turned into a villain overnight. In order to make up for the loss of support and reputation, he tried to tie up with the Union government of India in formulation of some exclusive laws for the state which would differentiate the state from rest of the country and which would simultaneously come to his rescue for recovering his stature among the masses. As a result, the inclusion of Article 370 was formulated and enunciated in the Constitution of India which would confer special status and reservation for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and its residents. The major highlight of Article 370 was to restrict the jurisdiction of union government to only three areas: defence, foreign affairs and communications. At that time, it must be admitted, Article 370 served as a tranquilizer for the agitated citizens of Jammu and Kashmir. Somehow it made an impression that the state still stood out from the rest of country in spite of Sheikh Abdullah's deal with India.
Later on, in the 1952 Delhi Agreement between Abdullah and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, several provisions of the Constitution were extended to J&K via presidential order under the form of Article 35A. So, it can be said that Article 35A was a bylaw of Article 350 which would specifically deal with the ‘permanent residents' of the state. Hence, the subject matter of Article 35 A is the definition of who is the permanent resident of state and it subsequently empowers the state legislature of Jammu and Kashmir to confer some special rights and privileges to its permanent residents and simultaneously reserve nonresidents from claiming the rights which would be otherwise be constitutionally valid, like employment opportunities under the state government, acquisition of immovable property in the state, settlement in the state and right to scholarships and such other forms of aid from the state government.
By virtue of the reservations laid in Article 35 A of the Indian constitution for the nonresidents of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Indian constitution has itself made the state different from the rest of the country. In other words it can be said that Article 370 and Article 35 I have constitutionally acknowledged the political dispute of Jammu and Kashmir. The constitution of India is in itself a slap on the faces of those people who claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and those who deny the validity of anti-Indian dissent of Kashmiri people.
Hence it has been a thorn in the path for those Indian state establishment(s) who want to realize their aim of ‘Akhand Bharat'. If there is any political party which is the biggest advocate of annihilation of Kashmir's political dispute, it is the right wing BJP which is currently in power. The BJP has been critical of the makers of constitution for framing, what they call, arbitrary laws like Article 370 and Article 35 A. It has always been on the top of their agenda to abrogate these laws, as is evident from the fact that in the elections of 2014, one of the basic mottos in the BJP's manifesto was to scrap these laws. They had also promised to arrange land at cheap rates in Kashmir for the establishment of Sainik colonies for ex-servicemen. Now that BJP has come into power, they are taking steps to materialize their manifesto. So they have lodged a petition against the validity of Article 35 A under the disguise of a RSS run NGO called ‘We The Citizens' in the Supreme Court of India.
In Jammu and Kashmir , the mainstream parties are showing a strong resentment against the petition. The government has even filed a counter petition against the NGO's petition. Before People's Democratic Party, which is running the state government with the help of BJP, tries to gain the sympathy of people by acting as victims, they must be reminded that in the assembly elections they had compromised their party manifesto by making an alliance with BJP. The scrapping of these laws was always the foremost agenda of BJP and in spite of this fact PDP had opened the doors into the valley for BJP. Legally and morally, the Chief Minister has not any right to curse and threaten BJP against the proposed abrogation of these laws. It can be said that in case these laws are scrapped, the BJP and PDP will equally share the credit for it.
The proposed abrogation of Article 35 A is as much an act of war against the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir as any military action. If Indian forces are containing the dissent at the behest of gun, the stooges of BJP and RSS are doing so at the behest of constitutional intrusion. The Union government of India wants to justify this invasion by giving arbitrary legal reasons. For instance , they are claiming that this law affects the Fundamental Rights of other Indian citizens. It is completely irrational to imagine that any privilege enjoyed by a state citizen from regional government can curb the right of a citizen living in another state. Another legal excuse that is given to scrap Article 35 A is that this Article was not originally part of the Constitution as it was adopted only through a Presidential Order in 1954 and has not gone under the scrutiny of the Indian parliament. By giving this reason, the government is questioning the setup of credibility of its own constitution. Article 35 A is not the only law passed through a presidential order; there are other 41 orders as well and by this logic all those subsequent Presidential Orders will also become vulnerable to legal questions.
In case article 35 A is scrapped, it won't take long when nonresidents will replace the state residents in every aspect. The land will be bought at sky-high rates, an offer which would be very hard for an ordinary Kashmiri man to turn down. And eventually we will have to crave for space in our own homeland. Article 35 A also reserves state government's job opportunities exclusively for state residents. In case the Article is scrapped, the job opportunities will be there for the taking for whole India. There is already a scarcity of government job opportunities, and if whole country lays a claim on the jobs it would be catastrophic for the educated class of Kashmiris. It won't take long until Kashmiris would have to revert back to the era of forced labour.
The anti-Indian cause attracts its support from the Muslim population of Kashmir. The union government knows that as long as Muslims are in majority in the state, the anti-Indian cause is very much alive. Hence, they are planning to dilute the Muslim majority population with nonresidents' settlements.

If you've been thinking about buying a home, there might be no better time than June, which is annually recognized by such organizations as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) as National Homeownership Month.
These entities work with lending institutions, realtors, housing counseling agencies, community organizations and many others to make individuals aware of programs that will assist them in the quest to become homeowners.
“One of the many opportunities potential home buyers can take advantage of is free counseling,” said Coleen Baumert, the director of homeownership programs for the Harrisburg, Pa.-based Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA). “We believe that financial education is a key component to purchasing a home, so we work with a network of counseling agencies to provide one-on-one, group and online counseling.”
Baumert noted that counseling is mandatory for anyone with a FICO score of 680 or lower.
“We want buyers to be able to maintain and sustain their decision to enter the housing market,” she added.
Baumert's emphasis on counseling is reinforced by research from HUD. According to independent research, HUD reported that, “…delinquency, default and foreclosure rates for borrowers who have received counseling from a HUD-approved housing counseling agency are 30 percent lower than uncounseled borrowers.”
In addition to free financial counseling programs, Baumert points out that PHFA can assist qualified buyers to obtain mortgage loans at rates below prevailing mortgage interest rates obtained by most buyers.
“Even a quarter of a percent reduction in a mortgage interest rate can help potential buyers to obtain more home for their money,” Baumert said.
Baumert noted that PHFA works with first-time buyers, buyers who are moving up to larger homes and single buyers, as well as families that own a larger home and have decided to downsize. PHFA also helps buyers to find affordable financing for different types of mortgage loans: conventional, FHA, rural development and VA.
Charaka Cook, the Region V vice president of NAREB, noted that her organization hosted a number of community events around the country in June in recognition of National Homeownership Month. She pointed out that the goal of the NAREB is to increase homeownership among African Americans by 2 million over the next 5 years.
“Homeownership is the cornerstone of the American dream,” Cook said. “Creating awareness of this fact is particularly important in the African-American community where homeownership has slipped from 49 percent to 41 percent since the housing crisis of 2007.
Cook noted that homeownership among non-Hispanic Whites by contrast is about 71 percent.
Cook observed that NAREB works with real estate professionals who can help potential home buyers to overcome past financial mistakes and low credit scores.
“There are many ways to help people get back on the right track,” she said. “We want everyone to understand the many benefits of home ownership.”
Cook continued: “Among other things homeowners are less likely to move so family stability is enhanced, and more importantly you're creating a lasting legacy that can be handed down to future generations. Overtime this will help to close the generational wealth gap that exists in much of the African-American community.”

Grammy winning rapper Big Boi has joined Sony's Superfly remake.
Trevor Jackson, who can currently be seen in the Freeform comedy Grown-ish, will lead the cast as Youngblood Priest, while Straight Outta Compton star Jason Mitchell will play his business partner, Eddie. Sony did not comment on the latest casting.
Director X will helm the re-imagining of the '70s cult classic that follows a cocaine dealer who tries to secure one more deal before getting out of the business. Alex Tse (Watchmen) penned the screenplay.
Grammy nominated rapper Future will curate Superfly's soundtrack. He will also produce, alongside Joel Silver, with Steven R. Shore, Matthew Hirsch, Hal Sadoff and Aaron Ausch serving as executive producers.
Superfly, which is currently filming in Atlanta, is set for a June 15, 2018 release.
Big Boi is best known as one half of the legendary hip-hop duo Outkast, earning seven Grammy awards. This year, he picked up a nom for best rap song for his track “Chase Me” that can be heard in Edgar Wright's Baby Driver. His Hollywood career includes recently wrapped recurring roles on The Quad for BET and MTV's Scream, and a appearance on Lee Daniels' Fox series, Star.

The B.C. government is changing real estate laws in an effort to prevent flipping of condos from one buyer to another before they are built.
Finance Minister Carole James presented legislation Tuesday to require real estate developers to collect and report information on pre-sale condo assignments, to enforce the collection of property transfer tax on buyers.
“For too long, people who resell condos before they have been built have been inflating real estate prices, without necessarily paying taxes on their gains,” James said. “We are making it fairer for people who want to buy a condo, by making sure those who flip pre-sale condos pay their fair share.”
James said the information will not be publicly available, but will be shared with the Canada Revenue Agency, to make sure that capital gains tax as well as provincial property taxes are paid.
Robert Eggers turned a lot of heads with his terrifying 2016 horror film The Witch, which tapped into something truly evil in its exploration of a family of fundamentalists torn apart by satanic forces (and one nasty goat) in the 1630s New England. One big part of the film's appeal was the breakout performance of young Anya Taylor-Joy, who's since found stardom with roles in M. Knight Shyamalan's Split and Josh Boone's upcoming X-Men spinoff New Mutants.
Now, it appears that Eggers and Taylor-Joy will try to make (black) magic again in a remake of F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, a fitting project for this budding maker of sepia-toned horror. Eggers are both writing and directing the project, and Variety reports that Taylor-Joy is currently in negotiations to star. Chris Columbus and Eleanor Columbus will produce for Studio 8. Nobody's made a direct remake of the story since Werner Herzog knocked it out of the park back in 1979.
No word yet on Black Phillip's role in the remake.
Trinidad and Tobago were eliminated from the CONCACAF Under-15 Championship with a game to spare after their second successive Group B loss today at the IMG Campus in Bradenton, Florida.
The young Soca Warriors were routed 6-0 by hosts, the United States, on the heels of a 4-0 loss to Costa Rica yesterday.
Ten goals conceded with none scored and zero points, the Warriors have no choice of advancing to the knock out stages. However, they can expect another tough test on Wednesday when they face a Canada team that will be aiming to ensure their own progress.
Canada lost 1-0 to the United States on Sunday but rebounded to beat Costa Rica today. So Canada and Costa Rica both enter their final group matches with three points and will be competing for one available spot alongside the US.
It was always going to be tough for Trinidad and Tobago to match them but head coach Russell Latapy has had the team in training for much of the year and there was an invitational tournament in the Cayman Islands along with a pre-CONCACAF friendly by way of warm-up.
Trinidad and Tobago drew with Manchester City, DC United and Tampa Bay United with a solitary loss to Houston Dynamo before they faced international competition. But they still came up well short when the confederation's championship kicked off.
Latapy's own record as national youth coach, since he returned to Trinidad last September, has been humbling with defeats to Haiti and Jamaica and a solitary win over Bermuda at the Caribbean Under-17 level last year before he picked up the National Under-15 Team.
In his defence, Trinidad and Tobago have played second fiddle to Jamaica and Haiti long before Latapy took up the reins while Costa Rica and the United States enjoy tremendous records against the twin island republic.
After Sunday's loss, Latapy told the TTFA Media that his under-15 players have good technical quality but lacked in the areas of tactical awareness and game management.
“We are a much better team than we were earlier in the year,” said Latapy, “but we still need the experience of playing international games in which this here is part of the process.”

If you are one of those old-school folks who frequents newsstands and still loves thumbing through glossy magazines for good stories and captivating photography, then you likely have had the magazine Cherry Bombe on your radar since it began in 2013. Published twice a year by Kerry Diamond and Claudia Wu, it's a lovely thing, devoted to the intersection of women and food, with a particular interest in fashion. (Diamond is a former magazine editor, Wu, a former art director.) Cherry Bombe is irreverent and compelling, giving voice to women in the food world from Martha Stewart to Lena Dunham — both of whom have graced the cover, with cherries. Imagine “Mrs. Beeton's Cookery Book” crossed with Lady Gaga.
Happily, probably inevitably, Diamond and Wu have now come out with a cookbook: “Cherry Bombe: The Cookbook.” Inside the book, published by Clarkson Potter, are 100 recipes from 100 women, among them Christina Tosi of Milk Bar; “Top Chef's” Padma Lakshmi; Naomi Pomeroy of Portland, Ore.'s, Beast restaurant; Jeni Britton Bauer of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams; Tartine's Elisabeth Prueitt; and L.A.'s own Evan Kleiman (KCRW), Jessica Koslow (Sqirl), Sarah Hymanson and Sara Kramer (Kismet).
On some levels, like the magazine that engendered it, it's a tongue-in-cheek book (pink cover, lots of cherries, pink KitchenAid). But on other levels, the cookbook is surprisingly straightforward, as the voices and stories that make the magazine so compelling are oddly missing, replaced by just the recipes themselves.
If you already subscribe to the magazine, you might want to make Lakshmi's sweet and sour shrimp from the cookbook while you reread last year's magazine cover story on the television personality and cookbook writer, which is a far more interesting read than the few sentences that operate as introduction to the dish. If you don't have a copy of the magazine, well, maybe go pick up an issue while you're out shopping for the ingredients for Prueitt's chocolate hazelnut torte. (If you want even more Cherry Bombe, there's also Cherry Bombe Radio and, on Oct. 14, a daylong conference called the Cherry Bombe Jubliee.)
With a stack of issues, you'll have the best of both worlds: the assembled chapters (tools & rules; mains; sweet treats) of the cookbook, plus all the stories that load the magazine, including interviews, illustrations, photo essays and to-do lists. Nice.
Cookbook of the Week: “Cherry Bombe: The Cookbook” by Kerry Diamond and Claudia Wu (Clarkson Potter, $35).

40 minutes. Serves 4.
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined but tail-on
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Kosher salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
½ teaspoon cumin seeds
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
1 cup minced shallots
1 cup diced yellow bell pepper
2 dried red chiles, such as Kashmiri for mild heat or Thai for extra heat

2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoons butter
4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1/3 cup diced dried apricots
1 whole preserved lemon, seeded and diced
½ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro

1. In a bowl, toss the shrimp with the lemon juice and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cover and set aside.
2. In a deep skillet or wok set over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot, stir in the cumin and fennel seeds and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Toss in the shallots and bell pepper and continue to cook for 5 to 7 minutes to soften the peppers.
3. Add the dried chiles, garlic and ginger to the skillet and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the butter and tomatoes, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the tomatoes release their juice and it begins to thicken, 12 to 15 minutes.
4. Toss in the dried apricots, preserved lemon and turmeric and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes to marry the flavorings. Taste for seasoning and an additional ¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste.
5. Stir in the shrimp, coating it with the sauce. Cook, stirring once or twice, just until the shrimp becomes opaque, 3 to 4 minutes, careful not to overcook. Toss in the cilantro and remove any chile tops that popped off during cooking. Serve over rice.

On the third day of deliberations, the jury responsible for determining the criminal case against comedian Bill Cosby moves forward with no clear verdict just yet in sight.
Mulling over the case for more than seventeen hours, the panel consisting of seven men and five women must decide whether or not Mr. Cosby, 79, is guilty of drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, 44, in a 2004 incident.
After numerous advances from Cosby, Constand alleges that the January 2004 encounter culminated in Mr. Cosby giving her three "herbal" pills during a dinner at his Pennsylvania home. According to Constand, Cosby stated that the pills were her "friends" and that they would help take the edge off. The prosecution is accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting Constand while she was incapacitated.

Cosby pled not guilty to charges of aggravated indecent assault against Constand, one of dozens of sexual assault accusations, all of which Cosby has flat-out denied. In the only criminal case brought against him, Mr. Cosby has been the subject of a two-year media frenzy where nearly 60 women have claimed that the comedian sexually assaulted them.
During deliberations, the jury requested from the judge comments made by Cosby in a 2005 and 2006 deposition taken for a civil lawsuit, which was settled at a later date. Detailing his relationship with Constand, Cosby claimed that Benadryl was administered to the woman in order to help her relax and enjoy a consensual sexual encounter.
While the prosecution has labeled Cosby as a calculating sexual predator, the defense has countered with inconsistencies in Constand's testimony. If found guilty, Mr. Cosby will be convicted of three counts of aggravated assault, each charge carrying a maximum of ten years imprisonment. In addition, Cosby will have to register as a sex offender.

LAHORE - The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry has feared of dire economic consequences if government increases the prices of petroleum products.
LCCI President Malik Tahir Javaid said that increase in petroleum prices at this critical stage when caretaker setup is going to hold the system, would add fuel to the fire and would give a big blow to the trade, industry and ultimately to the economy.
He said that economic indicators are not in the favour of economy. No sector would be left unaffected if government goes against the ground realities and increases POL prices.
The LCCI president said that it is not the industrial sector alone but the agriculture sector would also badly suffer from the increase in POL rates.
He said that Pakistan's agriculture sector is engine of growth.
The increase in petroleum prices would increase the input cost of agriculture production as high speed diesel is being used in tractors, tube-wells, harvesters, thrashers and other agriculture machinery. Senior Vice President Khawaja Khawar Rashid and Vice President Zeshan Khalil said that the cost of thermal generation by private sector to go up.
Hartlepool's big night of championship boxing is off.
Martin Ward was scheduled to challenge European champion Abigail Medina at the Borough Hall on Friday, July 21.
Hartlepool is my home town and the Borough Hall is the best venue in the sport NEIL FANNAN
The 29-year-old, trained in Hartlepool by Neil Fannan, and managed by town fight figure, Dave Garside, was looking to join brother, Tommy, in clinching glory in the super-bantamweight division.
Tommy lifted the British title last month when he beat Jazza Dickens at the First Direct Arena in Leeds.
Martin was due to top the bill at the Headland venue next month with Hartlepool lightweight prospect earmarked for a title eliminator.
However, the event has, reluctantly, bitten the dust, with Martin poised to box for the title next season.
“On a personal level, I'm gutted the show is off,” said Fannan. “Hartlepool is my home town and the Borough Hall is the best venue in the sport.
“Martin's fight with Medina will still go ahead, but sadly not at the Borough Hall.
“I'm not able to go into any detail about a new venue or date because it involves another promoter's show and it's not my place to mention it.
“But Martin's challenge will go ahead and he will benefit from a better financial deal on the other show.”
Fannan has not ruled out running a show later this year starring Cope.

BT has been fined £25,000 after being found guilty of carrying out unsafe roadworks in the UK capital, following a prosecution by Transport for London.
The offence was committed on March 1 at roadworks being carried out by BT on London's Streatham Hill, at the junction of Leigham Court Road.
"BT failed to properly sign and guard the working area, enabling pedestrians to walk dangerously close to heavy plant and machinery," said TfL in a press statement. The authority added that this is the second time in the last year that it has prosecuted BT over unsafe roadworks.
Openreach, BT's infrastructure division, separated from the telco arm of the business shortly after the offence was committed.
British Telecommunications plc pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to comply with directions regarding street works, contrary to the New Road and Street Works Act 1991, on October 4 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
In their judgement, lay magistrates Marguerite Argles and Patricia Sales said: "It is clear that BT simply failed to comply with safety regulations and these failings could have caused serious harm to other road users. The aggravating feature in this matter, in my view, is the failure to properly close off the pedestrian crossing close to the work site, which resulted in pedestrians walking freely around heavy machinery. The regulations are there for a reason and must be complied with."
The court handed down a £25,000 fine, though the offence is punishable by an unlimited financial penalty. BT was also ordered to pay £2,764 in costs and a £150 victim surcharge, which goes into a fund for victims of crime.
Over the last seven years, TfL said it has handed BT 991 fixed penalty notices (fines), netting it £67,270, and has prosecuted the telco 41 times for roadworks offences. 13 of those prosecutions have taken place within the last 18 months.
Other notable London roadworks offenders since 2010 include Thames Water, with 13 prosecutions; Virgin Media, with 11 prosecutions including those brought against its contractors; Vodafone, with nine; and Cable & Wireless with three. ®

Vancouver police are issuing a warning to residents and visitors to make sure not to leave any valuables in cars when parking in the city.
This comes as a response to a dramatic increase in theft from vehicles over the same period in 2017.
Police say from January to March of this year, there was a 39.4 per cent increase in thefts.
“Theft of items from vehicles is a preventable crime,” says Sgt. Jason Robillard of the Vancouver police in a release. “You can take simple steps to help prevent thieves from breaking into your vehicle. One of the easiest things to do is to avoid leaving anything visible in your car.”

In December, police arrested more than 25 suspects and recommended more than 80 charges during the month-long theft-from-auto project in downtown Vancouver.
“You may think that an item is not valuable, like a car charger or a jacket, but it might be enough to tempt a thief,” adds Robillard. “The effort it takes to remove all visible items in your car is minimal when compared to the cost and hassle of replacing a broken car window.”
Police say they have stepped up patrols in Vancouver to help reduce the frequency of thefts but say drivers should not leave anything visible in their cars when parking.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana private investigator pleaded guilty on Monday to misusing Donald Trump's Social Security number in repeated attempts to access the candidate's federal tax information during the presidential campaign.
Jordan Hamlett, 32, faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine following his guilty plea in federal court.

Authorities have said Hamlett failed in his attempts to get Trump's tax returns through a U.S. Department of Education financial aid website.
The Lafayette resident was indicted in November 2016 and had been scheduled to start this week, but the judge originally assigned to the case died on Saturday after a brief illness. U.S. District Court Judge John deGravelles has not yet scheduled Hamlett's sentencing hearing .
Defense attorney Michael Fiser had argued Hamlett didn't have any “intent to deceive” and simply tried “out of sheer curiosity” to discover whether Trump's tax information could be accessed through the government website.
WATCH: Trump predicts tax overhaul deal soon
Every president since Jimmy Carter has released tax returns in what has become an American tradition during presidential elections. Trump has refused to release his.
Federal agents confronted Hamlett two weeks before last November's election and questioned him in a Baton Rouge hotel lobby. At the time, the agents didn't know if Hamlett had been successful, and they feared a public release of Trump's tax returns could influence the election, according to a transcript of court testimony earlier this year.

Treasury Department Special Agent Samuel Johnson testified in March that Hamlett immediately took credit for his “genius idea” to seek Trump's tax returns from the financial aid website.
Johnson also said investigators asked Hamlett if he was familiar with Anonymous, an internet hacking group.
“At that time, Anonymous had been established as people that have released some of President Trump's personal identifying information and things of that nature,” Johnson testified.
Federal prosecutors had asked to bar Hamlett's lawyer from presenting a trial defense that that he was acting as a benevolent “white hat” hacker. Brady, a senior federal judge who died Saturday at a Baton Rouge hospital, ruled last month that Hamlett couldn't testify that he had a “good purpose” in attempting to test security flaws in the website.
WATCH: Trump says Americans will be able to file taxes on one sheet of paper
Fiser said Hamlett had tried to call and notify the IRS about the flaws last September, on the same day he tried to electronically access Trump's tax records.
Fiser said Hamlett liked to test security systems for weaknesses in his spare time and would notify system administrators if he found a system vulnerable to a security breach. Hamlett once discovered a security flaw that allowed for public access to the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office's “raw” reports on open investigations and exposed personal information about police officers.
“Hamlett tipped the sheriff's office to the flaw and was met with thanks and appreciation, not an arrest,” his attorney wrote in a recent court filing.
After his indictment, Hamlett was arrested again in August for allegedly violating conditions of his pretrial release. Prosecutors said he committed “numerous violations,” including hacking into email and social media accounts of a man at the request of the man's wife.

WASHINGTON >> Democrats demanded a special investigation Tuesday into possible links between President Donald Trump's administration and Russia, including when Trump learned that his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian diplomat.
“The American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.
Flynn's resignation late Monday also prompted Democrats to press again for a no-holds-barred probe of Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Republican leaders have refused so far to establish a special bipartisan committee to examine Moscow's meddling, arguing that the existing congressional committees are capable of handling the inquiries. But they'll be under pressure to reverse course after Flynn stepped down following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Flynn made the right decision to step down but he sidestepped questions about whether an inquiry is warranted.
“You cannot have the national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,” the Wisconsin Republican said. “I'm not going to prejudge any of the circumstances surrounding this until we have all of the information.”
At issue is whether Flynn broke diplomatic protocol and potentially the law by discussing U.S. sanctions with Moscow before Trump's inauguration.
Republican Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Flynn's resignation “is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus.”
“General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections,” McCain said in a statement.

California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says he wants to know whether Flynn was acting on Trump's behalf or whether Trump or anyone in his administration approved his contacts with Russia. He said Flynn's resignation “does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians.”
Pelosi said in a statement that Congress “must call for a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to fully investigate Russia's influence on the administration and the election.”
“The truth and consequences of the Russia connection: the American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security,” she said.
Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said wrote on her Twitter account that it's “time for a select bipartisan committee on the involvement of Russia in this administration and election. Period. Stop. Public hearings.”
Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said revelations about Flynn's interactions with Russia “raise grave questions about who in the White House knew about Flynn's vulnerability to blackmail and exploitation by the Russian government, and when they knew about it.”
Smith called for a “full investigation that covers any and all connections to these events that could undermine the national security of the United States.”
Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said a rigorous bipartisan investigation is needed because there are “far too many questions unanswered about this administration's ties to Russia.”
But Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said “the situation has taken care of itself” when asked by reporters if his panel would investigate Flynn's actions.
“Sounds like he did the right thing, he didn't want to be a distraction,” Chaffetz said of Flynn. “And it was getting to be a distraction.”

Hundreds of drivers with ride-hailing service Uber in Qatar went on strike on Monday for the second time in a year to protest against fare cuts.
The US-based company, which started operations in Doha in 2014, has in recent months cut fares by 15-20 percent for passengers amid growing competition from local firms.
Uber drivers in Doha stayed home on Monday to protest the cuts and an "upfront" service launched by Uber in November that allows passengers to view the total fare before their journey.
"The upfront [service] isn't fair. If you get stuck in traffic or the passenger makes extra stops during the journey, we receive nothing for that," said John, an Ethiopian driver who declined to give his second name.
"If they [Uber] don't raise fares and treat drivers better we have many other platforms we can go to. I have a family to support," he said.
Uber has tried to drive down taxi fares to win customers from local rivals in Qatar like Careem which has a larger market share than Uber in most of the 50 cities in the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan region in which it operates.
An Uber spokesman in Dubai said the company was "committed to dialogue with partner drivers" and had made improving their experience a priority.
"We are very proud of the high quality service they [drivers] offer to riders who want to get around Doha with a safe, efficient and affordable ride," said the spokesman in a statement.
Thousands of Ethiopians, Indians and Nepalis work as Uber drivers in wealthy Qatar where unions and labor protests are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail terms or immediate deportation.
Some drivers say they have struggled since an oil slump in mid-2014 that has squeezed state finances and last year saw Doha raise the domestic price of gasoline by 30 percent..

ISLAMABAD - Maryam Nawaz, the daughter of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif, in a surprise move on Tuesday, read out her statement in a press conference at Punjab House here, stating that she was being tried to put pressure on her father.
The statement was earlier submitted by her before the accountability court in the Avenfield corruption reference on Monday.
“My name was not mentioned in the April 2017 verdict, but I was later implicated in the JIT investigation,” Maryam Nawaz said before reading her statement. “From there, cases against me were initiated. I have answered 127 questions in the accountability court”.
To a question why the case was framed against her, she said, “Despite not figuring anywhere in the Supreme Court's judgment of April 20, 2017, the reason I was dragged into the case finds its origin in ‘will teach a lesson' mindset that has threatened, harassed and victimised those who refuse to accept the excesses, have the courage to rise against injustice and have challenged the rotten, entrenched practice of bringing the elected prime ministers to their knees, on one pretext or the other, be it religion, corruption or even ‘ghaddari' allegations.”
She said: “They are defiled, disgraced, harassed and pressurised into submission if they attempt to exercise the authority conferred upon them by the Constitution.” The answer is what Maryam added to her earlier prepared reply.
Speaking in Urdu, she said she knew why this corruption reference was being initiated against her. She said it was just to pressurise her father who has refused to the dictates.
“My implication in this case is prompted by a mala fide intention and extraneous consideration. Indeed, I have been falsely involved on account of my commitment to the political cause of true democracy, rule of law and the Constitution and for siding with my father who has to his credit excellent performance in terms of public welfare and wellbeing of the nation at the expense of illegal incarceration and exile for a number of years on account of political victimisation,” she said.
She questioned why she was facing this case and why she had to appear again and again before a joint investigation team (JIT) that was framed through WhatsApp calls.
“I appeared before this court more than 70 times and still this is going on. I know why I am being kept away from my mother who is suffering from the fatal disease of cancer and I also know that in the 70 years history of Pakistan no woman ever appeared before the court so many times. “My only crime is that I am the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, but just like brave and proud daughters of Pakistan, I am standing firm by my father. I am standing by his narrative. To put my father's love for me to a test, the perpetrators have involved me in this case,” she said.
Maryam said Nawaz Sharif was the one who refused to surrender before any kind of hardships, refused to resign when guns were aimed at him, rejected the world's pressure and made Pakistan a nuclear power and bravely suffered every kind of atrocities being meted out to him by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf. She said the perpetrators knew that when a case was framed against his daughter and she was dragged into the court, a traditional father would succumb to pressure and agree to their terms and conditions.
“The people who think like this neither know Nawaz Sharif nor do they know his daughter. My father has taken up the flag against the 70-year diseases faced by this country. He is struggling for the welfare of the people of Pakistan and to protect their right to vote and democracy,” she said.
Maryam said: “As per our traditions, daughters are being respected alike, but the perpetrators deviated from these traditions of ours. Maryam is not a weakness, but the strength of her father and won't let her father's head bow down.”
I am being tried to pressurise my father, says Maryam
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) said on Monday it had abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), leaving Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) as the sole suitor in pursuit of the $40 billion-plus deal.

Sources told Reuters last week that Disney was in the lead to acquire the assets, which include Fox's FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, the Star network in India and stake in European pay-TV provider Sky PLC (SKYB.L).
The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, prefers a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney stock than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, one of the sources said.
Comcast, the biggest cable provider in the United States, said in a statement on Monday that its discussions with Fox had ended.
“When a set of assets like Fox's becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”

The assets in question would have expanded Comcast's international footprint through ownership of Sky and Star. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages.

Disney's negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment.
Any potential deal will follow the U.S. Department of Justice's decision last month to sue to block AT&T Inc's (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).
Comcast shares were up 1.5 percent in after-hours trading, while Disney shares were up 0.2 percent and Fox shares fell 1.3 percent.
The events taking place in Islamabad over the last few days leave no doubt about the aggravation of the crises in the state system of the country.
The said crisis has reached a stage where it is too big to be swept under the carpet.
Refusing ministers including the Minister Interior during a hearing of a case against Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister, and Ihsan Iqbal's inability to hold responsibles accountable- supposedly working under his ministry- is a reflection of government's weakening grip on power.
Who will know better than the Minister Interior about the existence of “a state within the state”?
The contraction of civilian control over state system is accompanied by the expansion of military's power.
There is no vacuum for sure! The total exclusion of representatives of political government from the delegation visiting Kabul and the press conference by DG ISPR on Thursday show as to who is shaping/executing foreign policy of the country.
In this situation which country will take the visit of Foreign Minister of Pakistan seriously? The ruthless and reckless campaign against Intelligence Bureau, the prime civilian intelligence agency, and its DG by certain political parties and media quarters epitomizes depth of rift within the system.
The much-maligned Parliament is effectively sidelined.
Nonetheless, the call, a sane one, of the Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani for a grand national dialogue between the stack holders on the platform of Parliament was rejected or ignored by all and sundry.
“Judicialization” of politics in the country has left the judiciary in tatters.
Political leaders from both sides, government and opposition, have gone into survival mode.
The political elite seems too incapacitated to launch an initiative for finding a way out of the crippling crises.
The ever-deepening divide between the civilian and military branches of state has paralyzed the system at a stage when it is in dire need to act and act wisely.
The new US policy towards South Asia has drawn a red circle around Pakistan.
Sensitive state institutions are publicly blamed for having connections with terrorist groups.
As if this wasn't enough, even closest international friends have called out Pakistan to act against violent extremist groups active in the country.
Pakistan's relation with three out of its four neighbors are frayed making substantial military deployment a necessity.
Furthermore, it is difficult to get a rational and objective analysis of the economic front as the government is making tall claims in bringing reforms and improvements in country's economy.
But the opposition is rubbishing such claims.
Both sides have consensus on the fact that Pakistan will have to turn to IMF for a bailout shortly.
In this situation, Pakistan can't afford international isolation.
Despite all this, Pakistan can still put its house in order by starting the implementation of National Action Plan (NAP) and then confidently turn to meet global challenges.
But unfortunately, the country seems to be moving in the reverse.
The so-called political mainstreaming of the proscribed organizations is a case in point.
De-radicalization projects the world over have specific rules and procedures.
The militants renounce militant ideologies and strategies.
First and foremost they are disarmed.
But in the current case, the armed outfits even don't pretend to be accepting any rules or procedures applied in the de-radicalization project.
Some of them are preaching violence from their “political” platforms.
On the political front, one more challenge that the government needs to address on an emergency basis is the status of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
The government is yet to create a consensus among different stakeholders on the region's status.
Parliamentarians of the area have already staged a sit-in outside Parliament to register their protest against the delay in implementing FATA Reforms.
Also, there is zero effort to find a political solution to the bloody conflict in Balochistan.
The problem is that the challenges mentioned above do not see a mention in the political discourse of the country.
Years and years have been wasted in protests over the alleged rigging in elections of 2013 and making Nawaz Sharif ( him and him alone!) accountable due to the names of his children in the leaked Panama Papers.
Instead of politically attacking the government on pressing policy issues the PTI led opposition groupings have been more focused on putschist strategies that have resulted in bitter and deep polarization.
The status quo is too toxic and explosive to be maintained indefinitely.
Political leadership from both sides needs to rise to the occasion.
Even now it isn't too late to positively respond to the call given by the Senate Chairman for a national dialogue for putting the country back on track before the general elections to be held in the next year.
Pakistan can take a fresh start with a consensus on a set of rules of the game.
I remember the words of veteran Baloch leader Mir Ghous Bakhsh Bezjinjo, in 1977 in Hyderabad Jail.
Mir Sahib had been a prominent football player at his young age and had also been a member of Ali Garh College's football team in undivided India.
He used to ask Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to abide by rules of the game and not to twist the rules by using the state power.
Mir Sahib warned ZAB that without rules there would be no game and he proved to be prophetic.

Brooklyn, Mich. — You should try to go three-wide after the restart, team owner Chip Ganassi told his young driver, Kyle Larson.
A bold suggestion, from the boss, with three laps left in the Pure Michigan 400.
A lot of other folks on the team at Chip Ganassi Racing thought that might not be such a good idea, especially if the leaders got to Turn 1 three-wide at Michigan International Speedway.
Besides, the current generation of NASCAR race cars is often unstable side-by-side, especially racing at 212 miles per hour at the fastest track in NASCAR.
PURE MICHIGAN 400 FINAL RESULTS
Why risk wrecking it and ending up with a DNF? Sitting fourth on the final restart of the race would yield a good result.
He did not need a win to get into the playoffs.
But Larson is a racer.
And so, he ended up going four-wide, on the way to joining two NASCAR legends as the only drivers to win three-in-a-row at MIS. David Pearson won both races in 1972 and the next one in 1973, and Bill Elliott won two in 1985 and the next one in 1986.
“Yeah, that's some kind of awesome company, for sure,” Larson said. “It was an awesome finish for us.”
With Cup series leader Martin Truex Jr. starting first, his teammate on the same row in second and Larson starting next to third place Matt Kenseth, and just a three-lap sprint to the checkered flag, Larson took the boss' advice.
When the green flag fell, he accelerated like a lightning bolt and split Truex and Jones.
There you go, boss. There is your three-wide, sir.
Smooth move
But when Kenseth hit the skirt, way down low, with any speed he could bring, three-wide became four-wide.
From where did his race-winning move come?
“I have no idea,” Larson said. “He said something about going three wide on the restart, and I was, `Oh, yeah. That's one of my options, for sure.
“I was running a few through my head, and that was one of them, to try to get a good run and get to his inside and slow (Truex) down and clear him between (turns) one and two.”
That is how it evolved.
He split the teammates with a bull rush to the front, and three demonstrably faster cars could not catch Larson with all of that clean air ahead of him.
In the middle of Larson's explanation on his way to victory lane, Ganassi, a formidable fireplug of a man, who had just exchanged high-fives so vigorously with his team members that he almost knocked a couple of them off the crew chief's stand, came charging in.
Bear-hugging and kissing Larson effusively, he nearly knocked his considerably smaller driver to the pavement of pit row.
“That was the most perfect restart of my life,” said Larson, after Ganassi regained control of his celebratory affection.
He had complained to his crew early on that the first restart in the race might have been the worst of his career.
“I've lost a lot of races on the restart,” he said. “But to get one from the second row makes up for a few of them
“I can't believe it happened. We were struggling all day. Definitely not as good as the last two times we were here. But we persevered.”
When the situation evolved, with four cars in a horizontal line up the banking of the track, how did they not crash?
“Everyone stayed off of each other,” said a downcast Truex. “I don't know.”
In sync
“For me, it was an easy choice,” said Jones, of Byron, Michigan, who provides growing evidence with each race that his time in NASCAR may shimmer all through the 21-year-old's career.
“It really didn't matter if we crashed,” he said, referring to the standings, which has him on the bubble for the playoffs. “The only thing that was going to benefit us was if we were going to win. So, we were in the middle and I just kept going and hoped that I would get enough air to keep moving along.
“So, I think everybody was kind of on the same page, and it worked out.”
So, let us take inventory, shall we?
Four guys going appreciably over 200 miles per hour, side-by-side, all four want to win, and Jones and Kenseth, driving like an unchained tiger on the bottom of the track are in the same circumstances.
They pretty much do not care if they wreck. They want to win to automatically make the playoffs.
So boss, you really think Larson should try to go three-wide?
How about four?
“Kyle just hung in there all day,” Ganassi said. “We didn't have the best car today by a long shot, and were just lucky to put four (tires) on there with not too far to go.
“I appreciate when Kyle steps up and does what he did here today. It makes it all worthwhile, obviously.
After he loosened his embrace and got his lips off the cheek of his winning driver, Ganassi stepped back a bit and told him, “They were all giving me a hard time for telling you that.”
When racers race, it is usually good racing.
There is a lot that NASCAR and other forms of racing need to do to counteract the perception that the best racing, racing in its truest form belongs to a bygone era.
Well, they raced the daylights out it for those last three laps at MIS this season.
Here is hoping for more!

Father John Misty's "Please Don't Die" Video
Father John Misty is sharing one more song from his new album, God's Favorite Costumer, before its release this Friday. The track is called “Please Don't Die”, and comes accompanied by a stop-motion animation video. Directed by Chris Hopewell (who also helmed the visuals for FJM's Pure Comedy single “Things It Would Have Been Helpful to Know Before the Revolution”), the clip plays off both the album and track title by proving Josh Tillman may not be bound for Heaven, but rather Hell.
The video opens with a dejected Misty moping about his alcohol-and-cigarettes strewn hotel room. Suddenly the floor opens up and the resigned indie rocker slides down into Hell. As he crosses the River Styx on a black swan boat helmed by the Grim Reaper himself, he passes dancing corpses and dead forests. He finally comes upon his final resting place, but isn't so excited to join the skeleton crew. Find out what happens next by watching below.
God's Favorite Customer is out June 1st. The record has been previewed with a number of tracks, including “Mr. Tillman”, “Just Dumb Enough to Try”, and “Disappointing Diamonds Are the Rarest of Them All”. Father John Misty has a large summer and fall tour mapped out around the release, playing alongside the likes of Jenny Lewis, TV on the Radio, Bully, Lucy Dacus, King Tuff, Blitzen Trapper, and others. Find his complete itinerary here.
God,
To make peace, to make law – men must meet together.
Egypt has played a primary role in fostering unity between Fatah and Hamas. There can be little progress in just peace with Israel when Palestinians are feuding.
And now Egypt's parliament opens a new session. The first word: Do not defame the body. There can be little progress in stabilizing society in a house divided.
God, keep the unity of spirit through the bond of peace.
There is much bad blood in Palestine, with different visions and different pressures. It will not be easy to make amends, let alone to engage Israel.
And there is much bad blood in parliament, with accusations of subservience and sabotage. It will not be easy to check and balance, let alone to achieve consensus.
God, when men meet together not all is peace. Perhaps it must be so to get there. Give space for all grievance. Give patience with all charity.
Set the Holy Land straight, God. Make Egypt merciful.
May their peoples achieve peace, domestic and foreign, inside and out.

Ayr Skin Care announced the official launch of its new e-commerce site earlier this summer in a cocktail reception held at its headquarters in downtown San Juan Capistrano. Led by a mother-daughter team, Kirsten Thomas and Fiona Briggs, the site offers luxurious, anti-aging skin care products for sensitive skin, free from toxic ingredients, synthetic colors or fragrances, as well as most major allergens. The launch event was a perfect combination of exclusivity and creativity where ayrskincare.com was met with high praise for its clean design and amazing products.
The new shopping site is simple and intuitive, allowing customers to browse and purchase with ease. Each product page is filled with information on use, highlighted benefits, and a full ingredient listing, allowing for as much transparency as possible into what is in each formula.
The launch of ayrskincare.com is a culmination of years of work for founder and President, Kirsten Thomas, that all began as a personal mission. She said “I found that certain things I was using on my skin weren't working. There are a lot of cheap oils, petroleum products, grains, dairy, and soy (to name a few) in skin care lines. It became something I studied, took courses in, and eventually turned into a business, Ayr Skin Care, named after Ayr, the town my mother came from in Scotland. Ayr went from a dream, to a grass roots movement, to now a real store with the launch of our online site.”

KARACHI - The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Sindh police on Wednesday said it had completed probe into the mysterious murder of a college boy, revealing deceased friends were behind his murder.
CTD officials said that the boy had been abducted by his own friends for ransom and killed on the same day of his kidnapping.
22-year-old Bilal Rizwan, a resident of Al-Falah, Malir, was kidnapped on November 4, 2015 and murdered on the same day of his kidnapping, but his family was under the impression that he was missing since his body had not been found.
Taking notice of the incident, Sindh High Court (SHC) ordered the authorities concerned to recover the missing boy.
On the complaint of the family, Shah Faisal Colony police station registered FIR No 361/15 under Section 365/34 (kidnapping) against unidentified persons three days after of his kidnapping on November 7, 2015.
The family found the body from the same area nearly one month after his kidnapping on December 12, 2015.
“Interestingly, his missing/kidnapping and body recovery FIRs were registered at the same police station, but no one could understand he was the same as his body was completely burnt,” explained CTD In-charge Raja Omar Khattab.
“The killers were not strangers, but were his own friends, who kidnapped and killed him to get ransom money,” Khattab explained.
“One of his neighbouring friends, Adeel Rehman made a plan to kidnap and kill him along with his close friend Noman Qureshi,” he said, and added, “There were multiple reasons behind his kidnapping and killing. To kidnap and kill him after getting the ransom was the one reason, but there was another reason as well. And that was Adeel's sister, who was interested in the victim and Adeel was unhappy over that. Even Noman liked Adeel's sister. That's why Noman and Adeel decided to kill him.”
Giving another reason, Khattab said that the kidnappers could not free Bilal, fearing he would tell everyone about them.
“The victim belonged to a wealthy family and Noman who used to run a gym was facing a financial loss. He and Adeel decided to first kidnap him and get the ransom,” the officer explained.
Khattab further said that the kidnappers tried to make the victim unconscious by administering him injections after tightening his hands and legs with ropes, but the victim resisted and during resistance, they killed him.
“The victim was killed on the same day but his body was recovered after almost a month,” Khattab elaborated. “They hid the body first at their home and gym and later threw it at the garbage dump after one month,” he added.
The body was recovered from a garbage dump and was unknown and shifted to Edhi morgue. FIR No. 314/15 was registered on behalf of state against unidentified persons at Al-Falah police station. Victim's two cell phones were also missing and were not found along with his body.
The police high ups later took the notice of the incident and later Inspector General of Police (IGP) Allah Dino Khawaja transferred the case to the CTD on January 1 2016. The CTD officials then launched probe into the case.
“With the technical assistance, we managed to probe this case,” explained Khattab. The officer said that Noman Qureshi, Danish Amir and Adeel's father had been arrested while Adeel Rehman and his sister R* had gone abroad and most probably, were in Dubai while the police was trying to arrest them.
Later police also recovered victim's cell phones and a SIM card. “Interestingly, police, Rangers and other departments had earlier interrogated Adeel, but no one had a clue about his involvement and finally CTD arrested persons finally got to the actual culprits,” he explained.
CTD SSP Omar Shahid Hamid also held a press conference at which he told the journalists that the CTD police arrested nearly 39 absconders and proclaimed offenders in the last one week. “The data of the suspects in the fourth schedule is being computerized. So far the data of nearly 435 suspects out of 590 has been upgraded in the province. 116 suspects released in 2016 would also be put on surveillance,” said Omar Shahid Hamid.
He said that the eight edition of the Red Book would be issued in the next month. “The book includes details of 70 hardcore terrorists,” he informed.

After two days of bipartisan criticism for his failure to single out white supremacists, President Trump on Monday made his most explicit comments denouncing the hate groups responsible for "this weekend's racist violence."
"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis and white supremacists," he said flatly, reading from a teleprompter.
"To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered," Trump added.
First, however, he spoke glowingly about the economy.
The hastily arranged statement, from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, will be one of his most scrutinized.
It came after two days of widespread denunciations that Trump had failed to single out white supremacists for fueling the fatal weekend in Charlottesville, Va. Trump's initial comments instead faulted "this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."
Before the latest statement, Trump earlier Monday on Twitter criticized the African American chief executive of Merck, who resigned from a White House manufacturing council on Monday in protest of Trump's failure to explicitly condemn the racists in Charlottesville.
TAMPA, Fla. (AP,Jan 2,2017):— Police in Florida say an angry dog sent three people to the hospital after one tried to put a sweater on it.
Tampa police say the pit bull mix named Scarface bit a 52-year-old woman who was trying to dress him on Friday and her husband was attacked while trying to pull the dog off of her.
Police say the couple's 22-year-old son was attacked while trying to stop the dog by stabbing it in the neck and head.
The three people escaped the house and left the dog in the backyard.
Police say animal control officers shot it with a tranquilizer gun, but it managed to get back into the house where there were two children present.
Police used a bean bag gun and stun gun on the animal before catching it.

WASHINGTON-An American televangelist is appealing for donations to fund the purchase of a $54 million business jet, saying that if Jesus was still preaching he “wouldn't be riding a donkey.”
Jesse Duplantis, 68, whose Christian ministry is based in Louisiana, made the appeal for a Dassault Falcon 7X jet in a video for his followers.
Jesse Duplantis Ministries has already gone through three private planes, “burning them up for the Lord Jesus Christ,” he said.
“Now some people believe that preachers shouldn't have jets,” he said in the video. “I really believe that preachers oughta have and go on every available voice, every available outlet to get this gospel preached to the world.”
Duplantis said he needs the jet “so we can go anywhere in the world one-stop” and he recounted a conversation he said he had with God about needing the plane.
“He said, ‘Jesse, you wanna come up where I'm at?'” Duplantis said. “And I said, ‘What do you mean?'
“He said, ‘I want you to believe in me for a Falcon 7X,'” Duplantis said.
“I can't live long enough to travel by car, or by ship, or by train, but I can do it by an airplane,” he said.
“I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the Earth today he wouldn't be riding a donkey,” he said.
“He'd be in an airplane preaching the gospel all over the world.”
The eight-passenger Falcon 7X can fly from Paris to Tokyo or Shanghai to Seattle on a single tank of fuel.

The NFL can be a brutal business.
The Broncos signed former Bengals and Ravens cornerback Chris Lewis-Harris on Wednesday. To make room for Lewis-Harris on the 90-man roster, Denver waived cornerback Taurean Nixon.
Parting ways with Nixon was a bit of a surprise. The second-year cornerback was having a good spring and returned an interception in practice for a touchdown on Tuesday.
Tough business. T-Nix had a pick-6 off Paxton yday & I talked about his good spring. The next day, he has gone. https://t.co/XBqEN4epdP — Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) June 14, 2017
Nixon was selected by the Broncos out of Tulane in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL draft. He spent most of his rookie season on the team's practice squad but was promoted to the active roster for the playoffs and Super Bowl 50.
Nixon spent the 2016 season bouncing back and forth between the team's practice squad and active roster. He appeared in two games, recording just one tackle.
Though he has limited playing experience, Nixon was a candidate to compete for the team's No. 4 cornerback job behind Aqib Talib, Chris Harris and Bradley Roby. Lewis-Harris, Brendan Langley and Lorenzo Doss will now be competing for the fourth cornerback spot.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): Minister of State for Capital Administration
and Development Division (CADD), Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Monday said former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had organized a successful rally at GT road.
Talking to a private news channel, he said Nawaz Sharif had presented
his case in public court through four day rally from Islamabad to
Lahore.
The minister said people had warmly welcomed the rally of Nawaz Sharif
at every place.
He said no corruption charge was proved against Ex-Prime Minister.
Neither Nawaz Sharif had threatened to any institution nor used
derogatory language against them, he added.
Commenting on Pakistan Independence Day, he congratulated the nation
on 70th Independence Day and urged the nation to remain united and committed for the stability and prosperity of the country.
Minister for Trade, Energy and Employment, Ian Douglas, has urged those who vend agricultural produce on the streets of the capital to return to the Roseau Market because it has reopened since the passage of Hurricane Maria.
He stated that street vending in Roseau is something that the government does not want to encourage because of the lack of proper sanitary facilities.
“So we want to as much as possible to encourage all of our vendors to really return to the Roseau market,” Douglas said last week.
He stated that he understands the situation immediately after Hurricane Maria when vendors wanted to ply their trade but now that the market is opened, they should go there.
“That is the purpose of the market and that is really where all of the conditions necessary required for proper fresh produce vending is and not on the side of the road where you have no pipe-borne water beside the road, no washroom facility … to meet the sanitary requirements needed for fresh produce vending that may exist at the Roseau Market,” he noted.
DEXIA announced last week that the market has reopened but stated that half a million dollars are needed to get the facility working in normal conditions.
NOVATO, Calif. (AP)  California highway officials are rushing to stabilize a highway north of San Francisco ahead of another strong storm expected to hit the region Thursday.
The Napa Valley Transit Authority says that a levee by the road has broken, and the water has washed out underneath Highway 37.
The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports (http://bit.ly/2kPuaYw ) that a three-mile stretch of Highway 37 has been closed since Thursday and California Highway Patrol officials on Monday said they expect it to remain closed until at least Thursday as crews work to raise the road.
Highway 37 has been inundated with floods from a series of storms in January and February, causing road closures and traffic issues along the major thoroughfare.

North Korea is in talks with the US and Sweden to release three Americans held in the North, reports said, as diplomatic activities gathered pace ahead of Pyongyang's planned summits with Washington and Seoul.
The release of the three Korean-Americans – all held in the North after being separately charged with unspecified “hostile acts” against the regime – is under discussion through multiple channels almost two weeks after President Donald Trump agreed to meet the North's leader Kim Jong-un, reports said.—Agencies
NEW ORLEANS (AP)  The U.S. Gulf Coast braced Friday for a fast-moving blast of wind, heavy rain and rising water as deadly Tropical Storm Nate threatened to reach hurricane strength before a weekend landfall.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi and Alabama coasts. A hurricane warning was issued a few hours later for metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain.
Forecasters said in a Friday evening NHC advisory that the storm was growing in strength, with maximum sustained winds increasing to 60 mph (95 kph) and higher gusts.
"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the northern Gulf of Mexico," the advisory said.

States of emergency were declared in all three states as Nate - which has already killed at least 21 people in Central America - became the latest in a succession of destructive storms this hurricane season.
Nate is forecast to dump 3 to 6 inches of rain on the region - with isolated totals of up to 12 inches. That much rain led authorities to warn of flash flooding and mudslides. By midafternoon Friday, Nate was moving at a speed of 21 mph (33 kph). It was expected to move near or over the coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula late Saturday and make landfall in the U.S. late Saturday or Sunday.
Evacuation orders were issued for some coastal communities, including the Louisiana towns of Jean Lafitte and Grand Isle.
Shelly Jambon, owner of Sureway Supermarket in Grand Isle, said she plans on riding out the storm at her store even though it's across the street from the beach. She bought it two years before Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 and has weathered far more threatening storms than Nate.
"It's a mild one for us," she said. "Seventy to 80 mph winds? We get that in a winter storm."
The state mobilized 1,300 National Guard troops. Some were headed to New Orleans, where summer storms already have exposed problems with the city's fragile pumping system.
"We don't anticipate that this is going to cause a devastating impact to New Orleans or exceed the ability for the pumps," Gov. Jon Bel Edwards said Thursday.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency in six southernmost counties. State officials, at a briefing Friday in Gulfport, warned that Nate's main danger in that state will be from up to 10 feet of storm surge in low-lying coastal areas, as well as from winds that could damage mobile homes.
"If you are in an area that has flooded, I would recommend you evacuate that area until the storm has ended and the water has receded for your own personal safety and for the safety of the first responders that will be responding in the event you are trapped," Bryant said.
The storm threatened to disrupt one of the Mississippi coast's biggest annual tourist events, the "Cruisin' the Coast" auto show. Biloxi firefighters warned more than 700 recreational vehicle campers that they may need to leave early. The event continued as normal Friday, but Saturday's events were cancelled, replaced by a brief closing ceremony.
Dozens of offshore oil and gas platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have been evacuated as Nate churns through warm waters. Ingalls Shipbuilding, the Mississippi coast's largest industrial employer, announced Friday that only a skeleton crew of necessary employees would work Saturday and Sunday at the Pascagoula shipyard.
The northern Gulf Coast areas targeted by Nate largely have been spared the worst effects of a catastrophic hurricane season, but Louisiana's emergency declaration for Nate isn't its first since the start of the summer. In August, a weakened Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Louisiana after dealing a devastating blow to Texas and then nudging back into the Gulf of Mexico. Edwards also issued an emergency declaration in August for storm-related flooding in New Orleans.
On Alabama's Dauphin Island, owners hauled boats out of the water ahead of the storm's approach. Tourists canceled beach reservations for the weekend. The major concern was that Nate's storm surge was projected to coincide with high tide.
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director Lee Smithson expressed confidence that the federal government would be able to provide help to Mississippi even as the Federal Emergency Management Agency continues to respond to previous hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
Bryant authorized the use of the Mississippi National Guard to respond to any damage. Officials said they would open 11 evacuation shelters in areas away from the immediate coast, and that the regional bus system could transport people who can't drive to shelters on their own.
"This is a fast-moving storm," Smithson said.

Jeff Amy reported from Jackson, Miss. Melinda Deslatte and Michael Kunzelman in Baton Rouge and Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Ala., contributed to this story.
On April 9, 2017 in Trenton, New Jersey, Chanzie Washington allegedly led cops on a car chase and then ran on foot. When the police caught him, Washington was brought to the ground, and was then punched several times by three different police officers: Drew Inman, Antony Villanueva and Mark Kieffer III. Inman and Kieffer III are white and Villanueva is Hispanic.
One part of the video shows Inman punching the suspect before bragging to the person recording the video, saying, “I beat the living sh*t”– he stops when the other officer points to his body camera.
See the graphic footage below:
According to Trentonian, the Trenton Police Department is setting up the Hispanic cop, Officer Anthony Villanueva, “as the sole fall guy” and “Villanueva was placed on restricted duty within a week, but Inman remained on the streets for more than a month before being placed on restriction.” As of last month, Villanueva was suspended without pay. Inman is still on restricted duty and Kieffer III is on the streets. An anonymous cop from the department told Trentonian that the police department is “painting Anthony as the villain.”
Villanueva has hired an attorney who said, “I've already made plans to defend him on these charges, but there's no sense putting on my battle gear before the battle starts. I believe that if my client gets a fair hearing he won't be charged.”
Sounds like Villanueva was under the misconception that police solidarity may is the same if you are a person of color.

The B.C. government's new real estate taxes will have a big impact on Kelowna and any funds raised should stay in the city. That's the crux of a report presented to Kelowna city council Monday, in the wake of the provincial government's new taxes aimed at stabilizing the housing market and creating more rental units.
It's a 12-page report that touches on the three real estate taxes announced by the provincial government in its 2018 budget.
Starting with the foreign buyers tax where an additional 20 per cent is added to the purchase price, the impact can be significant.
Just look at the numbers: A typical condo selling for $332,000, add 20 per cent and the foreign buyer is paying more than $66,000 in additional taxes. At the other end of the scale, the sale of a $3 million waterfront home to a non-B.C. resident will see the buyer dishing out an additional $600,000.
And none of the money stays in Kelowna.
The report predicts that fewer international buyers will come to Kelowna, and the province will end up collecting upwards of $3 million in additional tax revenue.
The report goes on to say that international buyers will look to areas where they don't have the tax such as Vernon, Penticton and Kamloops.
Regarding the increased property transfer tax — where homes valued at more than $3 million would be taxed up to 5 per cent — the report says the impact on Kelowna would be minimal because of the 54,000 properties in the city, only 400, or less than one per cent, are assessed at more than $3 million.
The bulk of the report is dedicated to the controversial speculation tax. It's based on assessed value and designed to encourage homeowners to put their vacant properties on the rental block.
If it's not the owner's secondary home, some could be paying thousands of dollars more in taxes — on top of their property taxes.
There are an estimated 57,000 private dwellings in Kelowna.
Of those, a little more than 3,500 are unoccupied. The report estimates that half — about 1,700 — of those are owned by non-B.C. Residents. If half of those owners put those places on the rental market, it would add anywhere between 450 to 900 units on the rental market.
But the report says the speculation tax won't have the desired effect because it doesn't address the issue of property flipping.
It says that because the tax is based on annual assessment and not when the property is sold, it might encourage more flipping sooner to avoid the taxes and driving housing prices even higher.
The report says the speculation tax looks more like a ‘vacant home tax' and fails to address the speculation in the market.
It says that the speculation tax will have a negative impact on Kelowna because potential buyers will look to buy in other communities where there is no such tax.
Finally, it says that any additional revenue generated from these taxes go into affordable housing initiatives in Kelowna.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Friday on strong demand for Too Faced and Becca products and customizable gifts, and the company raised its 2018 full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast.
However, net income fell to $123 million, or 33 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $428 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.
The company incurred a one-time tax charge of $394 million following the recently passed U.S. tax bill.
The cosmetics maker raised its 2018 full-year adjusted profit forecast to $4.27-$4.32 per share, thanks to its robust retail travel segment, which includes sales in duty-free stores and tourist department stores like Harrods, House of Fraser and Le Bon Marche.
It had earlier expected adjusted profit of $4.04-$4.12 per share.
Revenue was boosted by the acquisition of Too Faced and Becca Cosmetics, which added about 2 percentage points to sales growth.
Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.52 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Sales rose 16.7 percent to $3.74 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $3.68 billion.
Shares of the New York City-based company rose 1.1 percent to $136 before the bell on Friday.
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP)  The state's top court has upheld a 75-year-to-life prison sentence against a former New York City police officer who admitted grabbing a schoolteacher off the street and raping her.
The Court of Appeals on Tuesday rejected a claim by Michael Pena that the long sentence violated his constitutional rights, affirming a decision from a mid-level appeals court.
Pena confronted the 25-year-old teacher on an Upper Manhattan street while off duty in August 2011. According to court records, he forced the woman into an apartment building courtyard, raped her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her in the face if she resisted.
Pena, now 32, argued the harsh sentence amounted to "cruel and unusual" punishment. But the top court, in a 6-0 decision, said that argument should have originated before the sentencing court.

We've seen a lot of stabs at politics so far this fashion week in New York, but they've mostly felt gestural, reliant upon slogans rather than follow-through. But none has seemed so resonant or relevant as Mara Hoffman's latest, which opened with four beloved organizers of the Women's March on Washington—Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland, and Carmen Perez—reading statements of intent and affirmation to stand tall with women in the face of the murky unknown.
The show itself incorporated a feminism-inspired dance performance, choreographed by Beth Gill and soundtracked by Ben Brunnemer, that from the looks of it captured both the freedom and strength that women behold—and the freedom and movement of the garments (organic cotton!), which look like something I would like to live in.
There's an artfulness in their construction, and an easiness that frankly seems to reflect that they're made by someone with great respect for women.
They're also profoundly chic!
While many designers attempt to encapsulate the essence of women's power, this collection looks to be a simple, striking, and humane distillation of it. I want every piece.

HYDERABAD - The Sindh Bar Council has directed its four senior members to take charge of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, Hyderabad, because it failed to conduct the bar's annual elections.
According to a letter issued by the SBC Secretary Zain-ul-Abidin on Dec 31, the council's executive committee directed for the step after taking notice of the delay in conducting the fresh polls.
The secretary further directed the members to verify the list of members within seven days and submit the same to the council for preparation of the final voter lists.
The polling to elect the new body was already scheduled for January 14, the letter reads.

SINGAPORE-Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that it will relaunch the world's longest commercial flight in October, a journey of almost 19 hours from the city-state to New York, but it will not be available to economy travellers.
The daily, non-stop journey from Changi to Newark Airport will cover about 16,700 kilometres (10,300 miles) and take about 18 hours 45 minutes, the airline said in a statement.
The current record holder is Qatar Airways Flight 921 from Auckland to Doha, which takes 17 hours 40 minutes.
The Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight will use the long-range Airbus A350-900ULR, which will be configured to carry 161 passengers - 67 in business class and 94 in premium economy.
The airline had flown a similar route from 2004 until 2013 but cancelled it as it fell short of revenue expectations. However, its latest decision comes as carriers look for new sources of revenue in a competitive environment, while long-haul flights often make more cash than those that require stops.
There are also plans for a non-stop route from Singapore to Los Angeles using the same plane, the airline said.
Analysts said the decision to have no economy class was an attempt to promote the airline to wealthy customers.
"It's about SIA marketing themselves as a premium service provider," Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, told AFP.
But there have been concerns that such long flights might pose safety risks, particularly for cabin crew.
Britain's largest union, Unite, alleged this month that Qantas had tried to "silence" crew members who wanted to discuss concerns about health and fatigue on their Perth to London route, one of the longest flights in the world at 17 hours and 20 minutes. SIA did not immediately respond to request for comment.
However Sobie noted that SIA pioneered the ultra long-haul route and had done a lot of research.
"In the early 2000s when this first started, SIA did all the testing they needed to and what they have come up with has set the industry standard today," he said.
Shukor Yusof, an analyst with aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said it was unlikely SIA could make money from the new service.
"The global premium market has eroded," he told AFP. "Operating costs are higher on ultra long-haul flights too, erasing any profits an airline might make." The new route comes as the city-state's flag carrier faces tough challenges. Last year, it consolidated its low-cost units TigerAir and Scoot into a single entity in a streamlining exercise.
And this month it said it will absorb its struggling premium regional wing, SilkAir, into the broader group following a multi-million-dollar upgrade as part of reforms to stay competitive.

Islamabad — Pakistan kicked off a day of celebrations on Monday marking 70 years of statehood and independence, the festivities beginning with gun salutes in the capital, Islamabad, and in each of the four provincial capitals.
In Islamabad, President Mamnoon Hussain hoisted the national flag at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang, and scores of Pakistani military and government officials and other dignitaries.
Security was on high alert across the nation following the suicide attack on Saturday when a bomber on a motorcycle targeted a military truck in the southwestern city of Quetta, killing 15 — eight soldiers and seven civilians.
Pakistan gained independence when the departing British left India and split the subcontinent in 1947, sparking one of the most violent upheavals of the 20th century.
For the Pakistanis, the anniversary comes amid political turmoil that has characterized successive civilian governments of the country, which has been dominated by military rule through much of its history.
Addressing the ceremony in the capital, Hussain urged the nation to look to the wisdom of its founders when facing the current “hot” environment.
“Solutions to all the problems of this time persist in our ideologies, thoughts of leaders of our freedom movement and our bright history,” he said. “By following them we can improve our situation today and our future as well.”
He appealed on the citizens to “rise above” their party and group interests and “protect the future of the nation.” Later in the evening, Hussain was to hand out medals to noteworthy citizens.
Most recently, Pakistan's political scene has been shaken when the Supreme Court dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office in July for concealing his family assets.
Sharif stepped down, allowing for Abbasi to take over, but decried the court's ruling as an injustice and vowed to clear his name. Then he embarked last week on a series of on-the-road rallies, spanning four days and covering the stretch from Islamabad to his hometown, the eastern city of Lahore where he addressed tens of thousands of supporters.
Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang said his country considers Pakistan an important partner in the “Belt and Road Initiative” that calls for Beijing building ports, railways and other facilities in a vast arc spanning 65 countries, including Pakistan.
In Karachi, visitors paid respects at the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder the country.
Pakistan Air Force put on a spectacular airshow, with Pakistani, Turkish and Saudi fighter jets flying over Islamabad as thousands of spectators watched from one of the city's parks.

Nominations for the 75th Golden Globe Awards have been announced, and in keeping with this year's incredibly fluid race, the love was spread to a variety of films and performers. The Shape of Water came away with the most nominations with seven in total, including Best Picture, Director, Actress, Supporting Actress, and Supporting Actor. But it was followed close behind by Steven Spielberg‘s timely The Post and the divisive Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both of which nabbed six nominations in total.
In terms of surprises, Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World—which famously went through reshoots a couple weeks ago to replace Kevin Spacey—walked away with three nominations, including one for Christopher Plummer, who replaced Spacey. Get Out was shut out of Best Director and Screenplay, although it did nab nominations for Best Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya (an underrated contender in this year's race). And Call Me by Your Name only scored three nominations in total for Best Picture, Actor (Timothee Chalamet) and Supporting Actor (Armie Hammer). As for pleasant surprises, Ansel Elgort pulled a nomination for Baby Driver, which is very neat.
Now, the Golden Globes aren't exactly a stayed and true Oscars predictor. They have no voter overlap and are voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which can sometimes make some pretty odd decisions (reminder: They nominated The Tourist for Best Motion Picture Musical/Comedy). However, given the timeline, they certainly have the ability to influence the race and raise the profiles of smaller or lagging contenders, especially since the ceremony itself airs right in the midst of Oscar nominations voting.
On the TV side of things, HBO's Big Little Lies dominated with six nominations in total, while newcomers like Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Showtime's SMILF walked away with big nominations. The Golden Globes have a tendency to recognize new/buzzworthy series, so this is right on brand.
Check out the full list of Golden Globe nominations below. Seth Meyers will host the ceremony this year, which airs live on Sunday, January 7, 2018 from 8-11pm ET on NBC.

South Korean companies will seek business opportunities in Japan's mega infrastructure project ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, a state trade agency said Tuesday.
In a 10.7 trillion-yen ($98.4 billion) project, Japan started building stadiums late last month, and plans to upgrade hotels and other existing facilities before the Summer Olympic Games that begin in July 2020, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said in a statement.
(Yonhap)
In a meeting arranged by KOTRA in Tokyo on Tuesday, 45 South Korean companies discussed possible ties with 80 multinational firms operating in Japan in the construction project, the statement said.Moreover, Korean companies will also seek opportunities to sell electricity in Japan, which has allowed its power suppliers to import electricity since April 2016.Japan has suffered sharply increased fuel costs as it became less dependent on nuclear power plants following the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan in March 2011.

North Yorkshire County Council would like to hear people's views on its proposals for best use of some of the investment it provides to organisations that provide community-based support.
The county council currently provides funding towards a small number of community-based wellbeing and prevention services throughout North Yorkshire which help people stay well and independent in their local communities. They mostly support older people, and provide the following types of support: information and advice, projects to address social isolation and loneliness, and practical support.
This support also includes signposting to agencies and services, befriending schemes, social activities and outings and support with daily tasks such as shopping and housework. As current contracts are now coming to an end the county council wishes to review and consult on the best way of investing in these services.
County Councillor Caroline Dickinson, North Yorkshire's Executive Member for Public Health, Prevention and Supported Housing, said: We know how highly valued these community services and activities are and we plan to continue investing in development and delivery of wellbeing and prevention support. To make sure we continue to make the best use of the money available, we are running a consultation on how we should best prioritise and provide the funding available for activities in the future, as well as supporting development of wellbeing and prevention support. Helping people to stay well and independent in North Yorkshire is a key priority for the County Council, and investment into these services represents only one element of what the Council is doing to support this ambition.
Other key county council programmes that support people to remain well and independent include:
The Stronger Communities programme which has developed a universal prevention offer that provides start-up funding, advice and support for communities across North Yorkshire to help people to support each other.
The Living Well service which helps people on the cusp of care build up their confidence by developing and maintaining their social networks so they can continue to live connected lives at home.
NYCC's Public Health Grant funds programmes focused on encouraging everyone to stay physically, mentally and emotionally healthy so that they live longer, healthier and more independent lives. It aims to tailor public health services to the needs of different communities in North Yorkshire, and building on their experience and knowledge of how best to support people.
The county council is holding information events about the consultation on future proposals for investment in wellbeing and prevention services. These are Monday 8 January 9.45am -12.30pm at the Forum in Northallerton and Tuesday 9 January 9.45am-12.30pm at the Cedar Court Hotel in Harrogate.
To find out more about the consultation or to take part in it please visit the service review webpage at http://www.nypartnerships.org.uk/wellbeingpreventionreview The closing date is 15 January 2018

The Sindh government has expressed the fear that the situation in Mithi of Tharparkar district (Sindh) where five infants have recently died of diseases and malnutrition may further depreciate if the area does not collect rains in the coming monsoon season. Problems pertaining to a water crisis, healthcare shortcomings and frostiness were the most crucial factors and that the parents had complained of lack of facilities at hospitals.
The total population of Tharparkar district is 1,308,368 of which 217,659 are infants/children under the age of five years. According to the report of the Tharparkar's district health officer which was submitted before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, none of the five toddlers died due to malnutrition, instead they perished due to causes like neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, birth asphyxia and pre-term / low birth weight. In 2016, total expiries of children in Tharparkar were 479 of which 404 died in the district headquarters Mithi whereas 87 infants died in Mithi in the first quarter of 2017 out of the entire of 98 in the district.

SYDNEY - Disgraced Australian stars David Warner and Cameron Bancroft will return to competitive cricket at a low-level limited-overs tournament in the country's tropical north in July, it was announced Tuesday.
Warner is serving a year-long ban from state and international cricket and Bancroft a nine-month suspension over a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March that rocked the game.
But they are allowed to appear at club level in Australia and in domestic tournaments abroad. As they work to rebuild their careers, the duo will feature in the NT Strike League in Darwin, a month-long Twenty20 and one-day event that features four franchises -- Desert Blaze, City Cyclones, Northern Tide and Southern Storm.
Bancroft is available for the entire tournament with Warner committing to two one-dayers on July 21 and 22. "We're delighted that Cameron and David will be joining us in Darwin for the Strike League," said Northern Territory Cricket chief Joel Morrison in a statement. "Their presence and experience will be invaluable for our local players."
Warner, who is also set to play for his Sydney club side Randwick Petersham from September, spent time running cricket clinics last month in Darwin. He said he was keen to be part of a league that is designed to give emerging players experience against interstate and international talent.
"I'm really looking forward to playing in the Strike League in July," he said. "I heard so much about the competition while I was in Darwin earlier this month that I'm keen to be part of it."
Former Australian captain Steve Smith, who was also suspended over the tampering incident, is set to make his return at an inaugural Global T20 Canada event in Toronto from June 28-July 15.

“A BC Wine Centre of Excellence would serve as an educational platform for B.C.'s wine and tourism industry, helping visitors learn more about our province's unique wine-growing regions, as well as the wine making process,” MP for Kelowna-Lake Country Stephen Fuhr's office said in a media release.
The study should be done by this summer.

There is no word yet on exactly where the centre would be built.
Richard Gelfond, chief executive of big-screen company Imax Corp., unveiled his new virtual reality center Tuesday with a bullish plan to turn the nascent VR industry into a mainstream art form, the way that movies and traditional video games are today.
It won't be easy. The VR business, he said, remains stuck in its early stages for now and badly needs a “jump-start.”
Though Hollywood and Silicon Valley have been touting virtual reality as the next big thing for several years, there are huge hurdles preventing its wide acceptance in the entertainment industry. Few people can afford the headsets and computing equipment the games require, which can cost thousands of dollars. Another problem: There aren't enough compelling games to make it worth the price.
“Whether it's the lack content or consumer access to headsets, the industry has been in a holding pattern, slow to go mainstream,” Gelfond told reporters at Imax's VR Experience Centre in Los Angeles. “It's a complex ecosystem that's in need of a jump-start, and we're here to start to provide the spark.”
Gelfond and Imax are hoping to help fix those problems by making big bets on VR. The company plans to open six pilot centers this year, including the Los Angeles location, which opened to the public last month.
The idea is to give people a place to play around with virtual reality games without having to pay that massive upfront cost of a full-on at-home setup. Customers pay $7 to $10 for a virtual reality “experience,” including games based on movies such as Lionsgate's “John Wick” and TriStar's “The Walk,” which allows daring customers to step on the virtual tightrope between the Twin Towers like the Robert Zemeckis film.
While VR may not be entirely ready for prime time at this moment, we're excited about the opportunity" — Richard Gelfond
“While VR may not be entirely ready for prime time at this moment, we're excited about the opportunity,” Gelfond said. “Someone needs to shake things up.”
Imax has made deals to build pilot centers in multiplexes with AMC Theatres and Regal Entertainment Group to test whether such attractions will help bring young people back to movie theaters. Each center costs $250,000 to $400,000 to create, not counting real estate spending, Gelfond said. Imax has additional centers planned for Britain and China and is eyeing projects in Japan, the Middle East and Western Europe.
Imax has also made moves to fix the industry's content shortage. The company recently started a fund with companies including Acer and CAA to finance new games for virtual reality headsets, totalling $50 million. In addition, Imax is working with Google to develop a new cinema-quality virtual reality camera. Hollywood has shown much interest in virtual reality, but not for full-length movies made for headsets. Virtual reality experiences are meant to last up to 15 minutes at the Imax center.
The company on Tuesday announced deals with David Ellison's production company Skydance Media and game publishing giant Ubisoft to provide content to the new centers. Skydance's upcoming games include a science-fiction first-person shooter called “Archangel” and “Life VR,” an experience tied to the company's upcoming space station thriller “Life.” Similar to the movie industry, Imax will share ticketing revenue with the gaming studios.
While the games will be available for at-home headsets, Ellison said locations such as the Imax centers are necessary to get the industry off the ground, much like arcades were in the early days of the video gaming industry.
“The place most people are going to experience VR for the first time is going to be in places like Imax,” Ellison told The Times. “We very much want to be a first-mover and we hope to establish a brand with what we're doing here.”
The flagship Imax VR Centre, located across the street from the Grove shopping center, opened with a soft launch Jan. 6. Gelfond said it has so far attracted 5,000 customers, and sales are growing so far, up 80% week-over-week. But, he admits, the company's involvement with VR is still in very experimental stages.
“These pilots are really going to be the testing ground,” Gelfond told The Times. “I look at this as a very flexible platform that is intended to be Imax's flag in the ground and will evolve as we go along.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior members of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Saturday rejected the vision for a “United States of Europe” put forward by the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom they are hoping to form a governing coalition.

SPD leader Martin Schulz said on Thursday his party, which suffered its worst post-war election result in September, would only gain support by providing a clear vision of Europe, and called for a United States of Europe by 2025.
Merkel's conservatives, who lost voters to the far-right due to their liberal migrant policy, want the SPD to agree to a last-ditch alliance with them after talks on a tie-up with two smaller parties collapsed.
Discussions on maintaining the conservative-SPD coalition, which has governed Germany since 2013, are due to start on Wednesday but the two parties look set to clash over the issue of Europe, which is likely to play a key role in talks.
Senior conservative Volker Kauder said Schulz's European proposal posed “a danger to the EU and citizens' approval of Europe” and Peter Altmaier, Merkel's chancellery chief, said the idea, and especially the timeframe, was unrealistic.
An Emnid poll for Bild newspaper found less than a third of Germans (30 percent) supported Schulz's idea while almost half (48 percent) rejected it.
Kauder told the Tagesspiegel newspaper it was necessary to strengthen Europe but also important to recognise that at the moment people longed for the “reliability that they believe they can find in national states”.
He added: “The proposal would also jeopardise the work of unification that is unique in the history of the world because the majority of member states certainly wouldn't participate in creating a united state.”
ANOTHER GRAND COALITION?

Altmaier told the Rheinische Post newspaper that Schulz's proposal had surprised him and it would be better to tackle specific problems in Europe such as unemployment, the protection of external borders and coordination of economic policy.
“The discussion about whether Europe should be a federal state, confederation or a united state is one for academics and journalists - not for German foreign policy,” Altmaier said.
“A United States of Europe would transfer member states' sovereignty to Brussels and there would not be a majority for that in many EU states,” he added.
Merkel has also been sceptical, saying on Thursday she would rather concentrate on more cooperation in defence by 2025, on employment and on innovation.
The Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) - also rejected Schulz's plan. Senior CSU member Markus Soeder told Welt am Sonntag his party did not want Germany becoming an “administrative unit” of the European Commission in a “European superstate”.
But the SPD defended Schulz's plan, with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel telling Deutschlandfunk radio it would ensure Europe's voice is heard on the global stage at a time when the influence of Asia, Latin America and Africa is growing.
The SPD is stressing that the outcome of talks with the conservatives is still open but Schulz said on Saturday if the SPD had the chance to prevent old-age poverty, improve nursing care and affordable housing, it needed to take that opportunity.
Other options are a Merkel-led minority government or new elections. The SPD has not ruled out either possibility, and newly elected SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told Bild newspaper he would immediately start preparing for a possible election campaign.
The SPD had initially planned to revamp itself in opposition after its poor election showing but agreed to talk to the conservatives when other coalition talks collapsed. An Emnid poll showed 61 percent of Germans thought joining another ‘grand coalition' would weaken the SPD further.
Kauder said the conservatives would go into talks prepared to make compromises but added his party had some “absolutely key demands” like capping migration and suspending the right to family reunions for some asylum seekers.
Facebook “likes” can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Donald Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of – and which Facebook may have enabled.
The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.

Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 per cent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been “unco-operative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials.

Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.
It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.

Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.”
“This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC's “Today.” It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.
Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research – not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked – even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent.
Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.
Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon – later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser – as a vice-president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.

The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviours fit with what other customers watch.
But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.
Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”
Wylie told Today that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.
The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work.
Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.
Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.

Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.
It's possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz's campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.
Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn't immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.
Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the “social graph” – essentially the web of people's real-life connections – is also invaluable for marketers.
For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.
Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according to Pew Research Center. While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.
What are the best accessories for the Google Pixel 2?
The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is Google's second go at making a premium smartphone for the masses, and it's earning high praise based on first impressions. But the true value of a phone is proven by its longevity and adaptability.
We're talking accessories and this early on — just days after the initial launch — the pickings are slim. But with Google introducing a 'Made for Google' certification partnership with a wide range of accessory manufacturers we're sure to see a good selection of accessories available as we get closer to shipping dates.
As it stands at the moment, the best place to find certified Pixel 2 accessories is straight from the source. The Google Store has some of its proprietary accessories available alongside third-party products, but nearly half of what's currently listed is not yet available for purchase. We'll be updating this article as more accessories go on sale.
Google-designed cases
Google has partnered with a number of different case manufacturers to get accessories certified as 'Made for Google', just another way for Pixel 2 owners to be confident in their accessory purchases.
Right now, there's a limited number of third-party accessories available, but If you're planning to order your phone straight from the source you should check out the cases designed in-house by Google.
Best Cases for the Google Pixel 2
For the Google Live cases there are two case types to choose between — a slim one-piece shell or a more rugged dual-layer case. No matter which you go with, you get to customize the back of your Pixel 2 with a stunning shot from your own photo roll, from Google Earth, or sample a work of art.
Each Google Earth case can be paired with a matching live wallpaper for a cohesive look around your device that just looks gorgeous. And if you opt for the dual-layer case, you'll be getting enhanced drop protection when compared to a single-layer case. Find yours starting at $50.
Another compelling option is the Google Fabric Cases which brings the look and most importantly the feel of that fabric finish found on other Google products, like the Home Mini and Daydream View. These cases offer a premium microfiber liner and will keep your Pixel 2 looking like a standout device no matter which color combination you decide on. They're also available for $50.

Moment Photo Case & Wide Lens Kit
Photography is a big feature on the Pixel line, and the Pixel 2's camera is positioned to be the best on the market. If you're #teampixel, get ready to take your photos to the next level with the Moment Photo case, which lets you quickly and securely attach peripheral lenses to enhance the Pixel 2's already outstanding camera setup.
Google is selling the Moment Photo case which includes a 18mm wide-angle lens made from premium materials that let the Pixel 2 camera capture more in crystal clarity. The case itself is pretty basic as a phone protector, but the lens is top-notch and accounts for the majority of the $130 price tag you can bet that this case is mostly a vessel for the high-quality camera lenses that Moment makes for mobile.
Check out Moment for more fancy camera lenses for your fancy new phone — Macro, Telephoto, and Super Fisheye. Quite the investment, but might be worth it if you want to add some uniqueness to your 'Gram game.

Google Pixel Buds
With the Pixel 2 ditching the headphone jack, it came as little surprise that Google would unveil its own wireless headphones alongside its new phones. And the Pixel Buds look like a compelling option for anyone in need of a fresh new pair of Bluetooth headphones — with advanced smarts built in!
If you watched the event, you were likely just as blown away by the Pixel Buds demo where they showed how you can trigger the Google Assistant with a quick tap, and how the buds can be used with Google's translation abilities that allow you to instantly start translating up to 40 supported language into English which sounds like an earbud version of the Babel Fish from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
In other words, these are the coolest earbuds for Pixel 2 owners to match the look and feel of your phone, along with a stylish carrying case that also intelligently pairs your earbuds with you open the case. They're not yet available for purchase but if you're interested in them you can join the waitlist.

USB-C Digital to 3.5mm headphone adapter
You may notice that a number of these accessory recommendations are centralized around coping with the loss of the headphone jack, a feature which many still consider an essential smartphone feature. Google will be including a headphone adapter with the new phones, but look at that thing — assuming you're not going to keep it plugged in all the time, there's a good chance of this thing getting lost.
If that happens, you may need to bite the bullet and get a new one — for $20. Might be a good idea to buy a spare from the get-go and keep it in a safe place.
See at Google Store
Moshi USB-C to 3.5mm Adapter/Charger
So it happened — Google has ditched the headphone jack. Everyone gets a headphone jack adapter with the phone, but maybe you need both ports. That makes an accessory like the Moshi USB-C to 3.5mm a necessary purchase for anyone who requires or prefers a wired connection.
This is another one of those accessories that's only listed on the Google Store as "Coming Soon". If you're for sure getting a Google Pixel 2 and you enjoy wearing headphones while your phone is charging at your desk this is going to be an accessory to keep an eye on — but it's also $45, so… I guess we can officially stop with the Apple dongle jokes.
See at Google Store
18W USB-C Power Adapter
It's always a good idea to stick with the charging accessories that came with your phone, and especially so with the claims Google has made regarding the Pixel 2 — seven hours of battery life after just 15 minutes on the juice.
Since you're probably gonna need some extra charging accessories anyways, you can't go wrong doubling up on the 18W USB-C Power Adapter. Of course, we'll be keeping an eye out for any certified 27W chargers that might offer even quicker charging speeds.

Tabliq Muslims Sue Government Over Mosque Raids
By Serestino Tusingwire
A group of tabliq Muslims has sued government seeking compensation for what they call “a violation of their rights” arising from incidents in December 2016 in which security operatives raided two mosques.
Police in late December raided Nakasero and Kiwatule mosques in Kampala as they were conducting investigations on murder of Maj. Suleiman Kiggundu. Scores were arrested and property vandalized.
The group led by the Nakasero mosque publicity Secretary Habib Buwembo, want court to order the police to unconditionally return their property including computers, Islamic literature, money and case files that they claim was confiscated during the raids.
“We have today decided to open up a file against security organs on the injustices that they have caused to the Muslim community.” Buwembo said.
The group wants court to issue an order that any property or document that was picked from the mosque should not be used as an exhibit or anywhere in the court process.
The group filed the application in the High Court which is yet to allocate it to a judge for hearing.
Adrian Gonzalez dives headfirst into home, seems to beat the tag by Cubs catcher Willson Contreras, but is called out. Safe, shout fans at Dodger Stadium who see replays on the board.
Umpires go to their headsets for a video review, and nearly three minutes later, the signal comes: Out!
Want to hear exactly how disputed calls get decided, like that one in last year's NL Championship Series?
Soon, we might.

While nothing is set, Major League Baseball and umps are expected to discuss a plan — most prominently used in the NFL — for crew chiefs to wear a microphone and explain replay rulings.
Under one possible scenario, they would start at the All-Star Game on July 11 in Miami, tweak the process over the season's second half and then go forward with the experiment in the playoffs.
People familiar with the talks spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an agreement has not yet been reached.
Last year, MLB asked for the plate ump to wear a mic at the All-Star Game, but there wasn't enough time to do it.
The umpires are in the middle of their five-year labor deal and any change would involve negotiations, plus a comfort level on both sides that the system would be efficient, accurate and easy.
So no way to say for sure if fans at Camden Yards, Coors Field and ballparks across the majors will become familiar with the voices of veteran crew chiefs — be it country singer Joe West, ordained minister Ted Barrett or Dale Scott, once a Top 40 AM radio disc jockey.
“It probably would be nice to get a little more explanation,” Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler said. “They're supposed to say the call stands or the call's confirmed. ‘The call stands' means you can't tell. A lot of times we don't get that … they just signal out or safe. That's all we get on the field.
“They may announce it on the PA, but it doesn't seem like that is consistent in all parks. And the acoustics in the stadium here — we have a hard time hearing what's on the PA in the bullpen,” he said.
In the NFL, hearing refs announce “upon further review” has long been part of the lexicon. The lore includes what Ben Dreith said in a 1986 game, when Jets lineman Marty Lyons tangled with Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and was penalized for “giving him the business down there.”
The NHL for some time has mic'ed up officials to explain coach's challenges, based on what the central replay booth tells them.
NBA crew chiefs put on headsets to watch reviews and talk with the replay center. Decisions are explained to the official scorer's table and the benches, and the public address announcers inform the crowd.
MLB has tried to speed up reviews this year, aiming for the umpires in the New York replay booth to relay the final calls to the field in under 2 minutes.
“It'll take more time,” Boston pitcher David Price said. “It's not going to make them any shorter.”
As for making the replay system more informative and entertaining, “Yeah, until they have a problem with the umpire's mic,” he said.
Marlins star Christian Yelich said a switch wouldn't affect him.
“The call's the call,” he said. “Just because they tell you what they decided isn't going to change it.”

AP Sports Writer Steven Wine and AP freelance writer Ken Powtak contributed to this report.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday as concerns the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran faded somewhat, reducing worries about the future of Iranian exports.
U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to seek stronger measures to contain Iran. At a joint news conference, Trump did not repeat threats to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement but made clear he has little patience for it.
Renewed sanctions could harm Iran's ability to export its crude.
Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA, said new sanctions against Tehran “could push oil prices up as much as $5 per barrel.”
Brent LCOc1 slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $73.86 a barrel. Earlier in the session it hit $75.47, its highest since November 2014. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell 94 cents to $67.70.
WTI's discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 was as wide as $6.32, the most since Jan. 2, on rising U.S. production.
Prices briefly extended losses in post-settlement trading after data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. Analysts had expected a decline in stockpiles.
“We're still really nestled within 3-1/2 year highs,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy.
“With oil prices near $70, a dollar here or there is not really enough to move the needle,” he said.
Before slipping, Brent hit its highest since Nov. 27, 2014, which is the day the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided it would not curb global output. Prices subsequently went on a multi-year plunge.
Oil began recovering in 2016 as OPEC discussed a return to market management with the help of Russia and other non-members. A deal to rein in output started in January 2017.
Meanwhile, oil demand in top consumer Asia is expected to hit a record in April.
“Prices are being driven up by tight supply due to high production outages in Venezuela plus the cuts implemented by OPEC and Russia,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. “What is more, demand appears robust.”
Growing U.S. demand, indicated by strong refinery utilization rates, is very supportive to prices, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.
“You could get rid of all of these geopolitical headlines -Syria, trade - and if you did that, you would still have a very impressive demand situation in the United States,” he said.

The statement itself sounds absurd.
The idea that any player could score 100 goals in a single season is outlandish considering the only man to get close just so happened to be the greatest hockey player to ever live. Wayne Gretzky set the NHL record in the 1981-82 season with 92 goals and after setting that mark some 36 years ago, the only other person to come anywhere close in the last decade was Alex Ovechkin with a 65-goal season in 2007.
100 goals seem next to impossible. Yet, as crazy as the idea sounds, one of the greatest players in NHL history believes it's possible.
One of the Best Watching Arguably the Best
The Edmonton Oilers played the Calgary Flames to open their season on Wednesday and in that game, Connor McDavid, Edmonton's superstar captain scored the only three goals of the contest as the Oilers shut out the Flames. McDavid was dangerous all evening and if it weren't for a stellar performance by new Flames' netminder Mike Smith, McDavid could have had one, even two more tallies.
One of the players looking on in astonishment was newly acquired Flames' forward Jaromir Jagr.
Not signed in time to be game-ready, travel and make the opening night roster for the Flames, Jagr watched on as McDavid put on a show. When asked about the phenom, Jagr could only smile and had a hard time describing what watching him felt like:
“What to say? McDavid is just too good. He's a great player. If he learned how to score on breakaways a little more, I think he'd score 150 in a season. To score 100 for him … it's possible. I've never seen anything like that in my life, to dominate like that with his speed.|
Is 100 Even Possible?
Jagr went on to detail the difference between the NHL of the past and the NHL of now. Long gone are the days of clutching and grabbing that was so prevalent in the years Gretzky set all sorts of records. Back then, it was like Gretzky was hauling a busload of school kids and rarely got a call. In the current NHL landscape, players with speed and skill are nearly unstoppable without taking a penalty.
This season, in particular, the NHL has made slashing and other minor infractions something that will be called regularly and McDavid is one of the NHL's best at drawing those types of penalties. He'll see more power play time in 2017-18 than ever before and he'll get even more opportunity to score.
But, C'Mon, 100 Goals?
It's only been one game and the rule of thumb is to never get over-excited after one victory. There are still 81 more games to go and to assume McDavid will score a hat trick in all of them is foolish. But, the way he played opening night, it's nearly impossible not to think about what he could do in those 81 remaining matchups.
Anyone who watched on Wednesday night has to believe, if McDavid stays healthy, he's got the ability to score at least one goal in 75% of the games he has left. To do so would put him at 63 goals on the season. If you give him 20 two-goal games (amazing, but not absurd) he'll have around 83. That alone would be incredible, especially if you consider that just last season he only netted 30.
How many more multi-goal games would he need? One or two four-goal performances almost feels expected. From there, it's anyone's guess.
Still Not Convinced
If the most cynical of fans were to remotely believe 100 goals was possible, a few things would have to happen.
First, McDavid has to shoot more. He talked about wanting to increase his shot totals at the beginning of the year and it looks like he's off to a good start. On Wednesday, he had seven shots on net. That pace obviously won't continue, but there could be an awful lot of games he comes close and other games where he has more.
Second, he'll need to keep using his speed. It's hard to imagine that McDavid could have gotten faster, but he has. He was burning past defenders all evening and during his second goal of the game, he was clocked skating over 40km per hour. He stopped on a dime, threw the puck upstairs on Smith and never once touched the goaltender. His speed is simply too much to handle for defenders and the Calgary Flames are assumed to have one of the better blue lines in the league.
Third, is his ability to finish breakaways. He's already great, but when you consider how many he'll get this season, if he finishes breakaways at just a 25% clip, he'll probably net 20 goals on undefended shots alone.
Why Even Talk About It?
Again, the idea that an NHL player can score 100 goals in a season is ridiculous. And, to be having this conversation after one game is the kind of thing a fan with a serious case of drinking the Koolaid would do. But, a fan didn't suggest it. One of the better players in hockey did.
With a smile on his face, if a player like Jagr jokingly says McDavid could score 150 if the young star was better on breakaways, you know he's only partially kidding when he says 100 is within reach.
Let's put it this way. If McDavid scores even half of what Jagr thinks he can, it will be a glorious day for the Edmonton Oilers, the NHL and fans in Edmonton who so badly want the team to make a trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs again, and this time go deep.
Those fans in Edmonton who saw Jagr's interview just got a whole lot more excited. As if there wasn't enough of a reason.
Bono and the guys in U2 are big football fans, as in soccer.
So when they sang about “Sunday Bloody Sunday” and “New Year's Day,” they had no intention of describing the end of the 2016 NFL season.
Yet, the firings of Chip Kelly and Trent Baalke in San Francisco, Mike McCoy in San Diego, and the resignation of Gary Kubiak for health reasons in Denver certainly rang true to those rock classics.
Usually, the axings take place the day after the regular season concludes. Except, of course, for the teams in a rush to get into the personnel market extra early, which in '16 were the Jaguars (Gus Bradley), Rams (Jeff Fisher) and Bills (Rex Ryan).

On Sunday, while other franchises were scrambling to make the playoffs or improve their postseason standing, the coaching carousel spun wildly in California. With Fisher already canned in Los Angeles, Kelly and McCoy became unemployed within an hour of each other.
Both moves were predictable, as was the release of Baalke, whose success as a GM with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how Jim Harbaugh molded and improved the players Baalke gave him. Baalke won a power struggle with Harbaugh, who headed to Michigan. The Niners became historically bad without him, and Baalke's choice of Kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker Jim Tomsula after Harbaugh left. At least Tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than Kelly managed.
Indeed, his only wins in a 2-14 record came against the Rams, so maybe LA owner Stan Kroenke will turn to Kelly.
Don't count on it.
“Despite my feelings for Trent and Chip, I felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary,” 49ers CEO Jed York said in a statement. “The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.”
The new direction for the Chargers looks like it will be north a bit to become a tenant of Kroenke and the Rams in the new Inglewood, California palace that will open in a few years. McCoy's team lost its last five games and finished second for two straight seasons in the tough AFC West. Injuries tore it apart, too, but with the focus on whether the Chargers would move to LA, it was hard to judge what kind of job McCoy was doing.
Apparently Chargers chairman Dean Spanos wants a totally fresh start when the club abandons its long-time home.
Which means both of the new teams in Los Angeles, which was without the NFL since 1995 until the Rams moved back last year, will be riding the coaching carousel.
More moves could be coming, too. Is Chuck Pagano safe in Indianapolis? Might the Saints do something with Sean Payton? What about Bears coach John Fox?
Safe for another year are Todd Bowles and Mike Maccagnan, who the Jets are bringing back. And Cleveland coach Hue Jackson, despite a 1-15 record. And Marvin Lewis despite the meltdown in Cincinnati.
The saddest news comes from Denver. Never was there a question about Gary Kubiak returning after leading the Broncos to their Super Bowl win last February. But Kubiak's health issues forced him to step aside, disappointing fans, players and John Elway alike.
“We love Kube, we love how he treated us,” said cornerback Aqib Talib. “We pray he gets healthy.”
Denver won't have any trouble filling Kubiak's spot. One of the hot candidates, for example, is Atlanta offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, son of Mike Shanahan, who coached Elway to two Super Bowl championships.
Given how well Kubiak fit in the Broncos' family, such a hire makes a lot of sense.
Then again, sensibility isn't always a criterion in NFL coaching circles.

Choosing a paint color for your walls is only the beginning. Then there's finding the right hue for the ceiling, the molding, the mantel, the window sashes. . . the list goes on. The best way to approach a top-to-bottom paint palette for a space (without feeling immediately overwhelmed) is to follow a formula proven successful by the pros. So we turned to designer Steven Gambrel to find out the paint color combinations he loves to use. The look he created for this New York City living room immediately came to mind. "For art-minded clients, a large neutral room is always preferred," he explains. "However, by using several shades of oyster white I was able to get forced shadows that make a room dynamic. The play of light achieved by mixing satin and high-gloss finishes adds an extra layer of complexity." Read on to see the monochromatic color scheme broken down by area.

A ghostly chant of “Bill of Rights, Bill of Rights” drifted out of a sidewalk tent as the United Nations monitor on extreme poverty walked the streets of skid row as part of a national tour investigating human rights conditions for the poorest U.S. citizens.
Philip Alston, an Australian and a New York University law professor, got a full taste of the epicenter of L.A. homelessness last week, passing by a shelter courtyard with dozens of people bedding down on the concrete because there was no room inside.
He and his entourage veered into the street to avoid a shirtless man who lay groaning across a wheelchair, a colostomy bag showing below his shorts hem.
“I think it's on a scale I hadn't anticipated, block after block of people,” Alston said at the tour's end. “When you see how concentrated it is, it's more shocking.”
Alston was appointed by the U.N. human rights council as the special rapporteur on extreme poverty to investigate the plight of the most vulnerable people in the economic doldrums of the richest nation in the world. The two-week mission visited four states, with stops in Washington and San Francisco's Tenderloin district, another homeless enclave.
Los Angeles was the only two-day stop for Alston, who met privately with local government officials and civil rights lawyers, presided over a skid row town hall and walked its streets.
Alston said that because the United States — alone among big industrial nations — has consistently rejected access to housing and sanitation as essential human rights, he is probing whether economic disparities prevent poor people from exercising their full political and civil rights.
The U.S. is not expected to face sanctions if violations are found, but Alston said his recommendations will be closely watched. In his previous post as special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Alston drew international attention with a scathing report describing the Obama administration's drone war as a “vaguely defined license to kill.”
“There is a significant international audience and other countries are watching,” Alston said to open the town hall Wednesday. “They want to know if the U.S. is living up to its great standards as far as human rights.”
Much of the town hall testimony focused on racism and what speakers described as the pervasive criminalization of poverty.
“The omnipresence of law enforcement induces fear in people already dealing with a high level of stress and trauma,” said Danny Park, who runs a skid row pop-up cafe.
Alston's street ambassador for the tour was General Dogon, a skid row organizer with the Los Angeles Community Action Network, which hosted the town hall.
Dogon was highly critical of the city's approach to homelessness as he led Alston on a walking tour. He said the street cleanings were designed to harass homeless people, accused police of confiscating their belongings and said skid row enforcement was aimed at driving the poor out of downtown.
“But there's no place for people to go,” said Dogon, who recommended the police budget be diverted to building low-cost housing on city-owned lots.
Alston acknowledged Dogon's street-level view was very different from what he heard in the halls of power.
”Politicians in any context are there to put a positive spin on what they're doing and to insist that existing problems are about to be resolved,” he said. “That's all to be expected.”
As Alston wrapped up the tour, a woman tried to give him some money “for your foundation.”
“No, I couldn't take your money — you're very kind,” Alston said. “I should be giving you money. Buy something good with it.”
Alston plans to release his preliminary findings Friday, with a full report due in the spring.

The death of a missing Edmonton man whose body was found in the city's far northeast early last week has been ruled a homicide.
Police said Tuesday afternoon that Chad Stevenson, 41, died as a result of blunt force trauma.
While Stevenson's body was found by utility workers in the area of 175 Avenue and 57 Street last Monday, police believe Stevenson may have died in 2017.

Stevenson was last seen in the Cy Becker neighbourhood, which is located near Manning Drive and Anthony Henday Drive, on Nov. 7, 2017.
His vehicle was recovered last month in the area of 51 Street and 162 Avenue. At the time, police put up a large white tent in the area and said the investigation was related to an ongoing missing persons case.

Homicide detectives continue to investigate Stevenson's death and ask anyone with information to contact the Edmonton Police Service at 780-423-4567 or #377 from a mobile phone.
Immigration agents have detained and threatened to deport a 23-year-old immigrant in Washington state who came to the U.S. illegally as a 7-year-old and later received protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a new lawsuit says.
Daniel Ramirez Medina was arrested at his father's home south of Seattle on Friday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a lawsuit filed by civil rights lawyers in federal court in Seattle this week. Ramirez is being held at a federal immigration detention facility in Tacoma, Wash.
ICE officials said Ramirez was a “self-admitted gang member” who was detained as a “risk to public safety.”
Ramirez's attorneys, who say Ramirez has never been convicted of a crime, denied the gang claim “unequivocally” and said he was “repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation.”
The arrest comes amid fears that the Trump administration may begin targeting hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been considered low priorities for deportation under the Obama administration.
The so-called DACA program, under which Ramirez was registered, is an executive action that provides a work permit and deportation reprieve to people who were brought to the U.S. as children and stayed illegally.
An estimated 742,000 “Dreamers” — those given protection under the program — live in the U.S. About 1 in 3 lives in California.
“The agents who arrested and questioned Mr. Ramirez were aware that he was a DACA recipient, yet they informed him that he would be arrested, detained and deported anyway, because he was not ‘born in this country,'” the lawsuit said.
A hearing in the civil rights case was set for Friday, according to digital court records. An ICE spokeswoman said Ramirez faces deportation proceedings before a separate immigration judge.
The case seems likely to receive widespread attention because of concerns that President Trump, who has repeatedly pledged to tighten controls on illegal immigration, is preparing to expand the nation's deportation policies.
During the campaign, Trump vowed to do away with DACA, but in an interview with ABC News after his inauguration, he said those registered under the program should not be alarmed.
“They shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart,” Trump said.
News of Ramirez's arrest brought denunciations from Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York.
“DACA recipients should not be an ICE priority. They are young people working & contributing to this great country,” Schumer said in messages on Twitter. “ICE must provide answers & release Daniel immediately. This action does nothing to make our country safe.”
Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California tweeted: “A 23-year-old DREAMer. No criminal record. This is outrageous.”
The detention was also criticized by Democratic Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, who said she was “looking into this troubling situation.”
“It is unacceptable that these Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children and have grown up and gone to school here, are being detained,” Cantwell said in a statement.
ICE officials said Ramirez was taken into custody Friday in a criminal case.
“Mr. Ramirez — a self-admitted gang member — was encountered at a residence in Des Moines, Washington, during an operation targeting a prior-deported felon,” ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said in a statement.
She added that ICE officers “took Mr. Ramirez into custody based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety.”
Gang membership can be grounds for the government to deny or review an immigrant's DACA status.
Ramirez had recently moved to Washington from California, where he had attended school, and he has a 3-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit. Ramirez first obtained DACA protection in 2014 and renewed his protection in 2016, the complaint says.
Ramirez was sleeping at his father's home near Seattle when agents arrived and arrested his father, for whom they had an arrest warrant, the lawsuit says.
After the arrest, according to the complaint, the agents asked Ramirez, “Are you legally here?”
“Yes, I have a work permit,” he replied, and on his brother's advice, declined to answer further questions.
At that point, the complaint says, agents took Ramirez to a processing center in Seattle, where he again informed authorities that he had a work permit. “One of the agents stated: ‘It doesn't matter, because you weren't born in this country,'” the petition said.
Ramirez's attorneys said his “unprecedented and unjustified” arrest was a clear broken promise by the federal government.
“In establishing DACA, the federal government created a clear and reasonable expectation among DACA recipients that they would be able to live and work in the United States without being subjected to arrest and deportation,” Mark Rosenbaum, a member of Public Counsel, a pro-bono law firm, said in a statement. “Bait and switch sullies the integrity of our nation's core values.”
Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, an immigrant rights group based in Washington, D.C., said DACA is “a discretionary policy,” but he was highly critical of the decision to detain Ramirez.
“This is outrageous. A young man is detained by ICE for what, being in the wrong place at the wrong time? The fact that he has been granted status under DACA is ignored? And to add insult to injury, ICE releases a statement saying he's a threat to public safety?” Sharry said in a statement.
David Leopold, an immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn., said the arrest of Ramirez “appears to be an arbitrary and capricious denial of his administrative and constitutional rights.”
“In his first month in office Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the Statue of Liberty by unconstitutionally denying entry to refugees and long-term green card holders based on nothing more than their religion,” he said in an email. “Tonight Trump is using his Deportation Force to make a mockery of the law, changing the rules on a young Dreamer who qualified, applied for and received deferred action.”
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department's chief economic expert sparred with AT&T-Time Warner's lead attorney at the antitrust trial on Tuesday in a number of tense exchanges over the method for estimating the consumer impact of the proposed merger.
At one point, Daniel Petrocelli, the lead attorney for AT&T-Time Warner, and Carl Shapiro, professor at University of California at Berkeley, talked over one another until they were stopped by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon.
Later, Leon stopped Shapiro as he became agitated as Petrocelli pressed him on his use of a figure from consulting firm Altman Vilandrie & Co. that was later changed and updated.
“I have my views. I apologize,” Shapiro said to the judge at one point.
The figures were used in estimating how many subscribers would be lost in a protracted dispute in which Time Warner content is pulled from a distributor during a carriage dispute. Those numbers were used in Shapiro's calculations that the merger would ultimately end up costing pay-TV consumers.
Shapiro argued that in his methodology, he provided a range of potential impacts of the merger. He said that AT&T-Time Warner and its experts were fixated on the lower end of those numbers, minimizing the potential impact of the transaction.

The emotion on display reflected the dispute between Shapiro and the economic expert retained by the companies, Professor Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago.
Petrocelli also challenged Shapiro on why he used data from June, 2016, to calculate customer lifetime value, another input used in Shapiro's model, rather than more updated numbers from 2017, which show less of an impact of the merger.
Shapiro acknowledged that under such new data, pay-TV subscribers would see an estimated 13 cents per month increase, from an earlier projection of a 27 cents per month increase.
Shapiro suggested that AT&T waited until the last minute to provide the numbers, and did not know enough about the new figures to use them.
“Apparently I am suffering the consequences of being conservative,” he said, again emphasizing that he made a point of offering a range of potential impacts.
He also countered attacks on his economic projections of the merger, arguing that it used a standard model that was “theoretically sound” and used by the FCC in studying the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger. That was approved in 2011.
Carlton had attacked Shapiro's use of the model, characterizing it as complicated.
“It reminded me of a quote form Albert Einstein: ‘Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler,'” he said.
He may be called again on Thursday, when the witness list will have been completed. Leon said that he would schedule closing arguments then.

Arsene Wenger has finally admitted he made a £60m mistake not selling Alexis Sanchez last summer.
Wenger insisted if he “had his time again” then he would have allowed Sanchez to join Manchester City after they made a mega bid on deadline day last August.
Gunners manager Wenger also claimed that Sanchez has joined Manchester United for a contract worth even MORE than £600,000-a-week.
When quizzed whether the deal was as much as the £600,000-a-week as had been reported, Wenger pointed to the ceiling as if to signify it was worth even more.
Wenger, who made the remarks during a Q&A session for the club's executive box holders, was careful not to use the word regret but suggested it was difficult to keep an unhappy player.

It comes in the week Leicester's Riyad Mahrez went AWOL after missing out on a move to Manchester City.
Wenger admitted that he should have sold Sanchez because his contract was running down but said he was determined to bring in a replacement and ran out of time to sign Monaco's Thomas Lemar.
Sanchez endured an unhappy four months at Arsenal after being made to stay at the Emirates and Wenger pointed to his drop in goals and assists compared to the previous season as to why the gamble to keep him backfired.

Arsenal ended up doing a swap deal with Sanchez going to Old Trafford with Henrikh Mkhitaryan moving the opposite way with both players valued at around £35m which represents a big drop since the summer.
Wenger also left the room wondering about his own future as he evaded questions as to whether he would remain in charge for the final year of his contract.
But Wenger, 68, insisted he was focused on reaching the Champions League through the Premier League and claimed it would be tough to do via the Europa League.
How much wheel time do you have to put in to keep up your horse habit?
And how long is just too long for you to drive? I'd love to hear what others think is acceptable 🙂 – I'm sure others would too!
To make this a fair comparison, pick your average drive time, not miles. 25 Miles in rural Kentucky is obviously different from 20 in L.A, and pick the time it takes on most days. Not the day when you get stuck behind half-legal slow-moving field equipment on single lanes, or 4:30 AM lone-rider speed stints to braid before a show.
OK let's hear it! Cast your vote!

Park rangers who found Sewell's silver Honda Odyssey around 8 p.m. Saturday also discovered a note in the car. In it, the Joshua Tree resident wrote that he was departing at 8:45 a.m. on April 21 and that if he was not back by the next day, he would need assistance.
Britney Spears and Sam Ashgari are spending a lot of time together.
So much so that the internet is speculating whether the pair could really be an item.
Ever since September, we've been wondering why they don't just announce they're a thing.
We know what you're thinking: Britney's dance moves across the table in the Slumber Party music video are probably what reeled him in.
Yeah, we all know just how energetic Spears can be with her dancing, so there's that.
With neither of the pairs confirming they are together, we need to do with the evidence the pair have spoon fed us on social media.
Adding fuel to the fire, Sam shared a picture of himself and Britney on Christmas day and they looked rather cute with each other.
Unfortunately, it seemed like Britney was not quite ready to let the masses know about her relationship and Sam later deleted the image.
Rather than deleting it, he could have written something about him not being in a relationship with singer, or something.

Truckers lined up their vehicles beneath an Interstate 696 overpass between Oak Park and Huntington Woods early Tuesday to keep a man from jumping.
Michigan State Police posted a Road Commission for Oakland County photo on their Twitter feed that showed 13 trucks lined up beneath the overpass near the Coolidge Road exit off I-696.
This photo does show the work troopers and local officers do to serve the public, the MSP Metro Detroit tweet said. But also in that photo a man is struggling with the decision to take his own life.
State Police Lt. Mike Shaw told WWJ news radio that troopers lined the truckers up beneath the overpass. With the trucks in position a person thinking of jumping would only fall a couple of feet rather than onto the freeway, he said.

Chris Harrison said in a post on the Twisted Trucker Facebook page that he was one of the drivers who lined up beneath the overpass.
The incident reportedly took place from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. Tuesday.
Harrison said he just happened to be driving one of the trucks near the front after state police stopped traffic and the east and west side of the freeway while they were dealing with the would-be jumper.
The cops came up and waved 6 or 7 of us through and then stopped us under the bridge, Harrison wrote in his post. Same thing on the westbound side.
As the truckers sat in their vehicles beneath the overpass, officers talked the man down.
Shaw said officers serving Huntington Woods took the man to Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak.
Afterwards, Harrison said a state police trooper went to each truck and shook the hands of the truckers and thanked them for helping state police.
State police in their Twitter post urged people to remember that help is available through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.
Brother Of Florida Shooter Arrested For Trespassing At Stoneman Douglas High
Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP
The brother of the suspect in the killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was arrested Monday for trespassing at the same site.
According to a police report quoted by the Miami Herald, "Defendant Cruz stated that he unlawfully entered the school property to 'reflect on the shooting and to soak it in ..."
Zachary Cruz, 18, had been warned to stay away from the campus, the Herald reported. The police report said that Cruz was spotted on campus at about 4:30 p.m. after the school day was over and students had been dismissed.
"Defendant Cruz surpassed all locked doors and gates and proceeded to ride his skateboard through school grounds," a deputy wrote in his arrest report.
Zachary Cruz's arrest comes just about a month after his brother, Nikolas Cruz, 19, allegedly shot and killed 14 students and 3 staff members at the Parkland school. He could face the death penalty.
The Sun Sentinel reports that Zachary has been living with a family friend since his mother, Lynda Cruz, died in November 2017.
The Sun Sentinel added that Zachary had admitted to Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputies that he and his friends had bullied his brother, Nikolas, when they were younger.
Donald Trump touted a poll Monday that put him at a 50 per cent approval rating.
But the U.S. president had nothing to say about another one that showed him at 41 per cent.
Trump tweeted Monday about a poll from Rasmussen Reports that showed 50 per cent of likely U.S. voters approved of his job performance.
It showed an equal percentage disapproving.
TRUMP APPROVAL HITS 50%https://t.co/vjZkGTyQb9 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2017
“This is the first time the president's overall approval rating has been back in the 50s in nearly a month,” Rasmussen Reports said.
“Just after his inauguration, Trump's job approval peaked at 59 per cent and remained in the 50s every day until early March. It's gone as low as 42 per cent since then.”
Rasmussen collects its poll results through telephone surveys of 500 likely voters per night; they're reported on a three-day rolling average basis.
It also polls randomly-selected participants from a “demographically diverse panel” using an online survey tool. It has a 2.5-per-cent margin of error.
READ MORE: Donald Trump's approval rating hits its lowest mark since the inauguration
In the past, Rasmussen Reports founder Scott Rasmussen has been called a “polarizing pollster,” with Democrats saying in 2012 that he was biased in favour of the Republicans, The Washington Post reported.
The campaign of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, however, touted his numbers strongly.
Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight gives Rasmussen Reports a grade of C+, with a record of calling races correctly 79 per cent of the time.
But Rasmussen's results also represented a strong divergence with polls reported by Gallup, which has a B-minus rating from FiveThirtyEight.
Gallup's most recent results on April 15 show Trump holding an approval rating of 41 per cent and a disapproval rating of 53 per cent.
That represents an increase from the end of March, when Trump's approval rating hit 35 per cent, the lowest it had been since his inauguration in January.
READ MORE: Donald Trump says ‘any negative polls are fake news'
In the past, Trump has shown that he's very selective about the poll results he chooses to accept.
In February, he tweeted that “any negative polls are fake news,” pointing specifically at NBC, ABC and CNN polls that took place during the election.
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017
It wasn't clear which polls he was referring to.
A CNN/ORC International poll, released one day earlier, showed 52 per cent of Americans being unhappy with his actions in office.
Those results marked Trump's highest disapproval rating at the time since polls began tracking them.

The unusual presidential campaign poster of Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party is getting mixed responses among Twitter users.Campaigning for the presidential election officially began Monday with the release of candidate campaign posters.Ahn's poster, which was reportedly counselled by an awards-winning advertisement designer Lee Je-suk, soon caught the public's attention as it had a rather groundbreaking design for a presidential campaign poster.Unlike other candidates' posters where the candidate's face fills most of the space, Ahn's poster featured the upper half of his body with his arms stretched out.Twitter user @Raoulian suggested that if put together with other posters, Ahn's poster stands out and “it looks as if Ahn's opening up the sliding door.”
(Official blog of Ahn Cheol-soo)
However, Twitter user @fakemommy suggested that campaign posters should focus on serving its purpose.“If visual differentiation influences the result of the election, the posters should be top-notch avant-garde. Why would they only pursue visual stability? Because what people expect from election posters are factors like trust and stability.”The design also ignited controversy since it did not mention the People's Party. Some people said that his intention behind the action is devious and it seems he was trying to get more votes from the right by not mentioning his political party.However, some set forth a counterargument with @classperfect offering “If you become a president, it is natural to leave the party and serve for the people. Then what does it matter whether it has the name of the party or not?”Twitter user @A_vilal took a contemplative view on the situation saying “Which candidate will be on the news for his or her poster design anyway?”By Kim So-yeon (syk19372@heraldcorp.com)

MAIMANA - Five Afghan soldiers lost their lives after Taliban militants stormed a temporary military base in Shirin Tagab district of the northern Faryab province on Tuesday, deputy to Provincial Council Sibghatullah Silab said.
Taliban militants, according to the official, attacked a provisional military base in Gorzad Kotal area of Shirin Tagab district in early hours of Tuesday killing five soldiers and injuring few others.
Taliban outfit has also confirmed the clash, claiming eight soldiers were killed in the fighting lasted for few hours.
The restive Faryab province with Maimana as its capital has been the scene of Taliban-led insurgency over the past decade.
Meanwhile, a Taliban attack on Baharak district in Afghanistan's northern Takhar province was repulsed and eight people including six insurgents were killed, provincial police spokesman Abdul Khalil Asir said Tuesday.
“Taliban rebels launched massive offensive on security checkpoints to overrun Baharak district Tuesday morning, but their attack has been repulsed and the rebels after leaving six bodies behind fled away,” Asir told Xinhua.
The official also admitted that two pro-government militias were killed and seven others including four militants sustained injuries.
According to the official, the security forces are busy in cleanup operations to find if any militant is hidden in the area. Taliban outfit has yet to make comments. However, a villager on condition of anonymity said that sporadic fighting is underway.
Sunderland will open talks with Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty after Aberdeen ‘reluctantly' agreed to give the Black Cats permission.
The two clubs had been negotiation a compensation package to release the pair from the deals at Pittodrie, which had two years to run.
Aberdeen boss McInnes will now discuss personal terms with the Wearsiders and is set for a significant pay rise.
The 45-year-old is still on holiday in Florida, but Sunderland remain hopeful of making an official appointment later this week.
McInnes will seek assurances regarding his transfer budget for the Championship campaign ahead, but, at this stage, there are unlikely to be significant complications.
Aberdeen had been keen to try to keep hold of McInnes, with new major shareholder Dave Cormack saying they would move ‘heaven and earth' to see off Sunderland's interest.
He even suggested that the Scottish Premiership runners-up – beaten in both domestic cup finals last term – would seek to extend the former St Johnstone and Bristol City boss's contract.
That now seems unlikely with the Dons, who have been bracing themselves for McInnes's departure for a number of weeks, seemingly accepting defeat.
An Aberdeen statement yesterday said: “The club can confirm that early this afternoon Sunderland FC agreed to meet all the contractual obligations for both Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty and they have reluctantly been granted permission to speak with both of them about the vacant managerial position at Sunderland.
“The club will be making no further comment at this time.”
It is understood that coach Paul Bracewell is set to leave the club.
Former Sunderland midfielder Bracewell joined the first-team staff in 2015 and his subsequently served under Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce and David Moyes.
There's this snappy little quote I've had stuck in my head since college:

Despite Legal Fights, Arkansas Pushes To Carry Out Delayed Executions

MIAMI-Two Nasa astronauts wrapped up a successful spacewalk to repair the International Space Station's aging robotic arm, the US space agency said. The outing by Americans Randy Bresnik and Mark Vande Hei ended at 3 pm (1900 GMT), marking a “very successful day,” a Nasa spokesman said.
The spacewalk lasted six hours and 55 minutes, almost a half hour longer than planned because the pair managed to tack on a few extra jobs that had been planned for next week.
Their main work involved the latching end of the Canadian-made arm, known as Canadarm2. They replaced one of two Latching End Effectors (LEE) which had lost the ability to grip effectively, said the US space agency. The 57.7 foot-long (18 meter) arm was instrumental in assembling the space station and is used to reach out and grab approaching cargo ships. The robotic arm has been a key piece of equipment at the orbiting outpost for more than 16 years, but began malfunctioning in August. Nasa wants to restore its full capability before the next US cargo ship arrives next month, carrying supplies for the six astronauts living in orbit. Thursday's spacewalk was the first of three scheduled spacewalks this month aimed at repairing and maintaining various pieces of equipment outside the ISS, and was the 203rd spacewalk in the history of the space station. Vande Hei and Bresnik plan to step out on another spacewalk October 10, with the third set for October 18. “The second and third spacewalks will be devoted to lubricating the newly installed end effector and replacing cameras on the left side of the station's truss and the right side of the station's US Destiny laboratory,” Nasa said.
Aisha Burns' solo debut Life In The Midwater came out way back in 2013. Since then, she's still been around, playing on the 2016 album Pearls To Swine from the cult-beloved singer Adam Torres. That album had a capability to make Americana, and the frontier it depicts, feel ethereal and mysterious once more — partially due to Torres' unusual voice, but also, crucially, due to the violin work contributed by Burns.
Though she may call Beverly, MA home now, Burns was born and raised in San Antonio, TX. And her music has that same expansive quality, like she's bottling up ghosts she found twisting through the air in the desert. Her sophomore outing Argonauta is finally around the corner, and it promises to bring the same scope. It boasts a voluminous sound big enough for Burns to grapple with a particularly strange time in her life in which loss and new chapters mingled, as she embarked on an unexpected and pivotal relationship right around the same time that her mother passed away.
We'd previously heard “Must Be A Way,” and now Burns has shared another single called “We Were Worn.” Here's what she had to say about the song:
This track was inspired both by what felt like an encounter with a ghost and the difficult choice of whether to embrace or detest the rise of memories of a person who has passed on. By the end of the song, I ultimately find solace in knowing that they haven't fully left me: I am made so thoroughly from the biological elements of my mother. My whole body, my bones, my blood are all evidence of her.
“We Were Worn” is Argonauta's opener and it rises dramatically. At first, it's almost only Burns' plaintive vocal and guitar, before drums crash in and her backing vocals haunt the edges of the composition. It has the same elusive yet emotive quality as her other work, and fittingly sounds like a conjuring and an exorcism all at once. Check it out below.

SOME resignations from high office are like the cauterising of a wound: brutal but decisive. Others resemble a battlefield amputation: a painful loss which cannot dispel the sinister whiff of some deeper infection. As Washington, DC absorbs the news, just before midnight on February 13th, that Michael Flynn has quit as National Security Adviser to President Donald Trump after less than a month in office, an ominous note lingers in the air. There is something unhealthy about the way this new government operates.
Mr Flynn, a retired three-star general and former chief of a Pentagon spy agency, had to quit after admitting that he had misled Vice-President Mike Pence about his contacts with a Russian envoy after the November presidential election but before the inauguration in January, when Mr Flynn was still a private citizen. That inaccurate briefing had left Mr Pence to head out onto television and unwittingly spread false information as he defended the man who on January 20th became head of the National Security Council. In his half-contrite, half-defiant resignation letter, Mr Flynn wrote of having sincerely apologised to both Mr Pence and Mr Trump for “inadvertently” misleading them with “incomplete information”.
Mr Flynn had always been tipped as a likely first casualty of the Trump administration. He made few allies with his manner, described as an unhappy blend of grievance, anger and arrogance. His resignation letter spoke of feeling honoured to have served his country in such a “distinguished” post, if only for three weeks. When trusted by a president, the national security adviser holds an immensely powerful job, as gatekeeper, referee, enforcer and co-ordinator whenever questions of defence, foreign policy and national security reach the White House for a presidential decision.
Visitors to White House meetings had reported, with surprise, how much the angular, rail-thin general seemed to grate on his boss, the president. That was even though Mr Flynn had the great advantage, in this administration, of having being one of the first high-ranking figures to endorse Mr Trump, startling his brother officers by leading a chant against Hillary Clinton of “Lock Her Up” at the Republican National Convention in 2016.
In the end, Mr Flynn suffered death by a thousand leaks. Former Obama administration high-ups and still-serving career intelligence officials told reporters, notably at the Washington Post and New York Times, that the general had been overheard by American spooks talking by telephone to Russia's ambassador to America, Sergey Kislyak, in December, in the dying days of the Obama era. Though Mr Flynn claimed that those contacts had been anodyne, turning on the logistics of future meetings and conversations, allegations spread that the pair had in fact discussed sanctions imposed by the Obama administration to punish Russia for meddling in the November presidential election, notably by stealing and leaking the private e-mails of senior officials in the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party.
Specifically, the word was that Mr Flynn urged the Russians to be patient and wait for Mr Trump to take office, and not to overreact to the sanctions. That allegation was all the more explosive because Mr Flynn already faced questions about ties with Russia after being fired by President Barack Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Mr Flynn left that agency in 2014, claiming that he was fired for raising uncomfortable questions about the Obama government's approach to fighting Islamic terrorism (Team Obama called him an insubordinate, obsessive and bad manager). In 2015 the former DIA chief turned up in Moscow at a gala for the state propaganda outlet, Russia Today, sharing a table with President Vladimir Putin.
In theory, Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador in December of last year were a potential breach of a law, the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from conducting foreign policy. But nobody has ever been convicted under the Logan Act. As so often in Washington, the cover-up was worse than the crime. And for critics of the Trump White House, it is that cover-up which seems to give off a gangrenous smell.
For the list of officials who must have known about Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador—a man whose phone calls are routinely intercepted, a fact known to every spy in Washington—is not short. Hours before Mr Flynn's resignation, even as some senior aides to Mr Trump insisted that the general enjoyed the president's full confidence, the Washington Post reported that a senior official at the Justice Department had briefed Team Trump in January that they believed that Mr Pence had been misled about Mr Flynn's Russian contacts. The Post's sources went further, saying that officials “couldn't rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition.”
Before parting ways Mr Flynn and Mr Trump shared a belief that Mr Putin's Russia might be a valuable—and usefully unsqueamish—ally in the fight against global Islamic extremism, a fight that Mr Flynn has cast in apocalyptic terms, as a clash of civilisations between Islam and the West.
Relations between Team Trump and the press are already rotten. They will not be helped one bit by the role of the media in taking down Mr Flynn, or—in the other direction—by days of official denials and obfuscation about the fate of the national security adviser. The atmosphere among officials who serve the president, including in the National Security Council, is also rotten. Career officials seconded to the NSC and White House talk of a policy machine paralysed by infighting and distrust. Political appointees brought in by Mr Trump have formed into warring factions, pitting establishment Republicans, such as the chief of staff, Reince Preibus, against radical nationalists with Mr Trump's ear, such as Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller. All sides are briefing against each other.
The acting national security adviser is another retired three-star general, Keith Kellogg. Possible permanent replacements are rumoured to include David Petraeus, the former four-star commander and architect of a successful counter-insurgency “surge” in Iraq. Optimists will see a chance for Mr Trump to reset his national-security apparatus after a false start. The president has, after all, hired a distinguished and principled former marine general, James Mattis, to be his defence secretary, and chosen as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, an accomplished former boss of ExxonMobil, the energy giant. Pessimists will worry that Mr Flynn's departure is not enough to cure what ails this administration. – The Economist
Looks like Azealia Banks' debut album, Broke With Expensive Taste, was aptly named.
According to multiple sources, the “212” singer — whose Twitter account was suspended for a hateful, racist rant in May of last year — was sued Tuesday in Manhattan Supreme Court for failing to pay somewhere between $130,000 to $137,000 in credit card bills to California-based City National Bank. Since 2012, she has taken out 3 separate lines of credit, including 2 credit cards, which she allegedly owes $79,000 and $8,000 on respectively, as well as owing up to $50,000 for a personal line of credit taken out in 2016.
This suit comes as the singer took a third-degree assault plea deal and faces criminal assault charges for biting a bouncer's breast at Manhattan's Up & Club club back in 2015.

WINNIPEG — A new set of bylaws are set to come to the table at city council on Tuesday. The bylaws will look at putting in more protections for Winnipegger's living in rooming houses.
Bonita Jarrow has lived in a rooming house for five years and said she wants to see her conditions turn around.
She lost a loved one in a rooming house fire that happened last year on Austin Street North and the fear of that happening to her haunts her everyday.

“I had family members die in that one that was in Austin. That was scary,” Bonita Jarrow said.
The bylaws around fire inspection haven't seen any major changes in over a decade, but last year that changed.
In November, it was approved that Winnipeg first inspectors would visit licensed rooming houses with shared washrooms and kitchens at least once a year to check smoke detectors and the conditions in hopes of avoiding fatal fires in the future.

On Tuesday, the second phase of bylaw changes will be before city council.
Sel Burrows is a local community activist and he said these changes are something he believes should have been in place long ago.
“It's sort of the most basic thing for the second most vulnerable people in Winnipeg,” Sel Burrows said.
Some of the changes that will be brought forward are focused on placing a bigger bite on unlicensed rooming houses.
Alex Forrest with the Winnipeg Firefighters Union said stricter enforcement and an increase in fines is the key to saving lives.
Sel Burrows also said fire inspectors and bylaw inspectors have come up with a cross training system where both will be trained to do inspections that the other can do in order to keep things efficient in the system.
Also proposed are new requirements and a scheduled inspection program for food trucks that use propane or gar fired appliances.
According to the report that will be on the table at City Council on Tuesday, there is currently no program in place to ensure these units are being safely operated in Winnipeg, including the mandatory installation of explosive gas and carbon monoxide detectors.
There is also a proposal to ban sky lanterns that are sometimes lit and released at weddings or other special occasions.

A Scunthorpe supermarket has cut back its opening hours, posing a question over the viability of trading late at night.
The Asda store on Station Road is closing earlier at 10pm, instead of 11pm from Monday to Saturday.
The move comes as the retail chain is reported to be battling slumping sales and changing shopping habits.
The company is understood to be reviewing staffing levels at 59 stores, none of which have been identified.
Eighteen large UK stores where ten per cent of the 3,257 jobs could go are also under review.
Fears of job losses have been triggered off by a near 20 per cent drop in profits last year to £657.2 million.
At the same time revenue fell by more than three per cent to £2.17 billion.
The price war started by German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl is blamed for the decline in Asda's fortunes.
More Asda customers are also using self-service tills, requiring fewer staff.
Chinese company copies BMW Isetta Enlarge Photo
Chinese companies have a track record for copying other automakers. Porsches, Hondas, and even tires often have knockoff alter egos in the country. The latest digs deeper into the past, however. Eagle, a Chinese carmaker, has blatantly copied the iconic BMW Isetta, Cars News China reported Tuesday.
The Isetta was built between 1956 and 1962, and its design oozes the time period. Eagle decided to give the "bubble car" a modern update with new sheet metal, but the same hard-to-miss shape. However, the body doesn't extend over the rear wheel partially like the original BMW Isetta.
Eagle's car, which it calls the EG6330K, doesn't feature front-opening doors, or a gasoline engine at that. Instead, four traditional doors are in place and an all-electric powertrain scoots the tiny car around. A 72 kilowatt-hour lead-acid battery provides—wait for it—5 horsepower. The battery pack will propel the car for 87 miles before needing a recharge if it's any consolation for the lack of power.
The report said Eagle is targeting younger buyers with the retro design, but will also pitch the EG6330K to elderly drivers who may want to downsize into a smaller car.
The small footprint and tiny electric powertrain will make the Isetta knockoff quite affordable, though. Eagle priced the car at around $4,000.
Twenty years ago, in February 1998, the term "open source" was first applied to software. Soon afterwards, the Open Source Definition was created and the seeds that became the Open Source Initiative (OSI) were sown. As the OSD's author Bruce Perens relates,
“Open source” is the proper name of a campaign to promote the pre-existing concept of free software to business, and to certify licenses to a rule set.
Twenty years later, that campaign has proven wildly successful, beyond the imagination of anyone involved at the time. Today open source software is literally everywhere. It is the foundation for the internet and the web. It powers the computers and mobile devices we all use, as well as the networks they connect to. Without it, cloud computing and the nascent Internet of Things would be impossible to scale and perhaps to create. It has enabled new ways of doing business to be tested and proven, allowing giant corporations like Google and Facebook to start from the top of a mountain others already climbed.
Like any human creation, it has a dark side as well. It has also unlocked dystopian possibilities for surveillance and the inevitably consequent authoritarian control. It has provided criminals with new ways to cheat their victims and unleashed the darkness of bullying delivered anonymously and at scale. It allows destructive fanatics to organize in secret without the inconvenience of meeting. All of these are shadows cast by useful capabilities, just as every human tool throughout history has been used both to feed and care and to harm and control. We need to help the upcoming generation strive for irreproachable innovation. As Richard Feynman said,
To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell.
As open source has matured, the way it is discussed and understood has also matured. The first decade was one of advocacy and controversy, while the second was marked by adoption and adaptation.
In the first decade, the key question concerned business models—“how can I contribute freely yet still be paid?”—while during the second, more people asked about governance—“how can I participate yet keep control/not be controlled?” Open source projects of the first decade were predominantly replacements for off-the-shelf products; in the second decade, they were increasingly components of larger solutions. Projects of the first decade were often run by informal groups of individuals; in the second decade, they were frequently run by charities created on a project-by-project basis. Open source developers of the first decade were frequently devoted to a single project and often worked in their spare time. In the second decade, they were increasingly employed to work on a specific technology—professional specialists. While open source was always intended as a way to promote software freedom, during the first decade, conflict arose with those preferring the term “free software.” In the second decade, this conflict was largely ignored as open source adoption accelerated.
So what will the third decade bring?
The complexity business model—The predominant business model will involve monetizing the solution of the complexity arising from the integration of many open source parts, especially from deployment and scaling. Governance needs will reflect this. Open source mosaics—Open source projects will be predominantly families of component parts, together with being built into stacks of components. The resultant larger solutions will be a mosaic of open source parts. Families of projects—More and more projects will be hosted by consortia/trade associations like the Linux Foundation and OpenStack, and by general-purpose charities like Apache and the Software Freedom Conservancy. Professional generalists—Open source developers will increasingly be employed to integrate many technologies into complex solutions and will contribute to a range of projects. Software freedom redux—As new problems arise, software freedom (the application of the Four Freedoms to user and developer flexibility) will increasingly be applied to identify solutions that work for collaborative communities and independent deployers.

Created and executive produced by Mickey Fisher (the creator of Extant) and with the pilot was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan, The Shallows), the NBC series Reverie follows Mara Kint (Sarah Shahi), a former hostage negotiator and expert on human behavior who is now working as a college professor while dealing with a terrible personal tragedy. When her former boss, Charlie Ventana (Dennis Haysbert), asks her to enter a highly advanced immersive virtual reality program, created to allow people to live out their wildest dreams, in an effort to save ordinary people who have lost themselves inside of this artificial world, she quickly realizes that saving others might lead her to some of the answers that she's looking for, in her own life.
During this 1-on-1 phone interview with Collider, actress Sarah Shahi talked about why she felt so personally connected to the story being told in Reverie, how this series is like Inception meets Alice in Wonderland, the memory she would choose to relive, if this program were real, the challenges of being the lead of the series and the one responsible for setting the tone on set, her relationship with showrunner Mickey Fisher, what Jaume Collet-Serra brought to the series, as the director of the pilot, and how the story arc will evolve, over the course of the season. She also talked about her time as Shaw on Person of Interest, and the life-long friendships she made, as a result of being a part of that series.
Collider: This show is such an interesting concept and idea, and so different from everything else that I've seen lately, which is cool.
SARAH SHAHI: Yeah, it's very different, especially for network TV.
When this opportunity came about, how was the show presented to you and what was it that really sold you on it?
SHAHI: It was pitched like Inception meets Alice in Wonderland. I play somebody who basically goes into people's deep subconscious minds to rescue them from themselves. I believe in timing. The older I get, the more I believe that everything happens for a reason. I feel like, when this show first came to me, it was something that I was destined to be a part of. My father had just died and I was pretty grief stricken. We didn't really have much of a relationship, and I was surprised by how much my sadness overtook me. I also started seeing him and started talking to him. I started having a relationship with him and healed my relationship with him through his death. I became a believer that there was a lot more to this world than what our eyes can see. When I read the script, here was a character that had lost her sister and her niece, and was also traveling back and forth between these two worlds. So, I felt that I was destined to play this role.
What most interested you in Mara, specifically? She has so many layers to her, from being a former hostage negotiator and an expert on human behavior to now being a college professor. What was it about her that you find most appealing?
SHAHI: The biggest thing was that I felt I had so much I common with her. In the pilot episode, we learn how her sister and her niece died, and I felt like she was someone who was struggling through this immense amount of grief. That was something that I definitely felt that I could relate to, at the time. Also, my views on technology mimic hers. As wonderful as it is, and as many advancements and good things that have come from technology, I also feel that, if we become too immersed in it, then we become disconnected. As a civilization, we were built on compassion and empathy and good. When we spend the majority of our time with our heads buried in a computer or in our phones, then I feel like we aren't exercising those things, and that's dangerous territory to be in.
When you do a show like this, you must think about what would this be like, if a program like this really existed. Are you someone who would try this program yourself, or do you prefer to avoid something this high tech?
SHAHI: I would be game to try something like this, only because I know that there's a lot of good that could come from it. The one reverie that I would do is because I have a very specific memory of me and my dad by the Great Pine Lake. I was no more than four years old, and I just remember being like a cat in between his legs and just living in between his legs. I remember his big hairy legs, the wind blowing in my hair, the song that was playing, and the smell of the air. If I could relive those moments, a couple times, when I remember feeling so safe and like I could do anything and be anything, I would. Being with my mom and my dad, at the same time, gave me such a sense of confidence. When you're that young, to be able to hold onto those memories for a few moments longer, I definitely think I would jump at that.
What is the biggest challenge of being the lead and being the one to set the tone on set, with a series like this?
SHAHI: It is very challenging. Even though I believe that this is very much an ensemble show and I don't think any one number on the call sheet is more or less important than the other, I was there more than everybody else. The responsibilities, in terms of just being very well-prepared and making sure that nobody is waiting on you, are a given that you have to have, but on top of that, you are one of the co-captains of this very big ship. I definitely have a no assholes policy. I don't like assholes. I don't like working with assholes. Thank god, Amblin Entertainment was the same way. We had an incredible crew. Everybody from the DP to craft service to the janitors for the stage was wonderful. We all made time for one another. If problems came up, we would handle it almost like life coaches would, with one another. We really helped each other get through it. To me, that's the most important thing because we're not curing cancer, we're filming a TV show. We're there to have fun and hang out with each other. We have to make it a good environment, and we have to have a good time and be respectful. Being there more than anybody, I definitely felt the responsibility to spoil the crew with lots of desert trucks and just make sure that everybody had a good time. I feel like when you have a good time and you like the people you work with, then you also put out more good work.

“It is as if the brain reacts to a stimulus by building then razing a tower of multi-dimensional blocks, starting with rods (1D), then planks (2D), then cubes (3D), and then more complex geometries with 4D, 5D, etc. The progression of activity through the brain resembles a multi-dimensional sandcastle that materializes out of the sand and then disintegrates,”
In the first minute against the Clippers, Rudy Gobert's knee collides with the knee of Luc Mbah a Moute. Gobert stays on the court for a few moments before heading to the locker room. After the game, an MRI revealed no structural damage. (0:50)
Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who suffered a hyperextension and bone bruise to his left knee on the first possession of Utah's 97-95 Game 1 victory Saturday over the LA Clippers, will not play in Game 2 of the series.
An MRI on Saturday night showed no ligament damage, meaning the Defensive Player of the Year candidate avoided serious injury.
"Trying to get better every day," Gobert told ESPN via text message Sunday.

Gobert is hopeful of playing later in the series, but his status remains in question. Jazz coach Quin Snyder was vague Sunday when asked about the timetable for Gobert's return.
"I don't think we're ready to say today, tomorrow, a week, two weeks," Snyder told reporters at the Jazz's practice in Los Angeles. "I think it's literally that wide open."
Slide-to-unlock. Pinch-to-zoom. Double-tap-to-wake. Gestures that work well are invaluable to a user's experience, and Android phone manufacturers are bringing these gestures to the home screen in deceptively simple and astonishingly successful ways. Case in point: the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the Google Pixel 2 — two of the most popular flagships on the Android market — eschew the app drawer button and instead use a gesture to open the drawer. On both phones, swiping up on the home screen will take you into the app drawer, but Samsung goes a step further: by default, swiping down on the home screen will open the app drawer, too. So what if you want to use a gesture to open something other than the app drawer? No problem.
Gesture controls on launchers can be generally broken down into two categories: preset and customizable. First-party launchers like the Pixel Launcher, as well as system-wide gestures on Samsung, HTC, and other devices, are preset gestures in that you can turn them off and on, but you can't change them from their default action. Some third-party launchers like Evie Launcher utilize preset gestures, likely in the interest of simplicity. The second category of gesture controls are customizable controls, such as those we find on Action Launcher, Nova Launcher, and ADW 2 Launcher. These launchers all offer a series of gesture controls that the user can assign a desired action to, from direct dialing your mother to opening the notification shade to opening Google Maps or launching a Tasker task. Customizable gesture controls let the user create the UI that they want through their taps and swipes.
While most launchers put things in different places, customizable gesture controls on launchers are generally in the same place and format. Look for Gestures or Shortcuts on your launcher's settings menu. You'll be treated to a list of gestures you can assign shortcuts and apps to. Tap the gesture you desire, then you'll be treated to a list of all the things you can assign there. While the possibilities are really quite endless, here are some popular and useful ways to utilize gesture controls on your home screen:
Swipe up to open app drawer
Swipe down to open notification shade
Double-tap to open app
Double-tap to lock phone 1
Two-finger swipe down for Quick Settings
Two-finger swipe up to connect to home Bluetooth speaker (Tasker task)
Two-finger swipe down to disconnect to home Bluetooth speaker (Tasker task)
Tap Home button (on home screen) to open Google app
Two-finger swipe up to turn on flashlight.
Swipe the Phone app to call Mom
1 A lot of users do this to avoid wearing out their power button, and for phones with double-tap to wake since they start getting used to double-tapping to wake and sleep. That last one is a swipe action. Nova Launcher allows you to not only assign actions to a gesture to the home screen but to individual apps on your home screen, called swipe actions in the shortcut editing screen. Swipe actions allow us to do things like: Direct dial mom by swiping the Phone app
Add a secret app to a folder by making it the shortcut gesture — I use this to avoid blank spaces in folders
Begin Navigating home when you swipe on Google Maps
Toggle Bluetooth when you swipe on Google Play Music
Start playing your drive-time playlist when you swipe on Google Play Music
TORONTO – Uber is apologizing to a customer who was charged more than $18,000 for a short ride in downtown Toronto.
Photos posted on social media over the weekend showed that an Uber rider was billed $18,518.50 for a 21-minute Uber ride.
An Uber spokesperson confirmed the incident, and says the rider had been fully refunded.
My friend was charged 18K for a 20 Min ride (!), and they are sticking to it. What in the world??? This is insane! @Uber_Support @badassboz @Uber pic.twitter.com/RjFihVLKIC — Emily Kennard (@emilykennard) December 9, 2017
Yes! Please RT or something to all your followers! It's insane. Uber is not backing down at the moment. — Emily Kennard (@emilykennard) December 9, 2017
Uber staff say the massive over-charge was a result of driver error, not a technical glitch.

Uber says the ride in question took place in a traditional taxi cab signed up to the ridehailing service — an option available to customers in Toronto — and that the driver made a mistake when entering the details of the fare into his cab's meter.
The spokesperson says the company continues to look into what happened.

LAHORE - Speakers at a seminar on Imperatives for Credible Electoral Process were of the unanimous view that if the 2018 election is delayed, it would harm Pakistan. They said this time most reliable election could be held. However, they hinted that dangers are also there which called for compatible measures to avert them.
The seminar was organised by PINA in collaboration with Punjab University Center for South Asian Studies & Pakistan Studies Center. Justice (R) Faqir Muhammad Khokhar presided over the seminar while former minister SM Zafar was the chief guest. Others who spoke included PILDAT's president Ahmad Bilal Mahboob, Dr Prof Ambareen Javed, Prof. Dr. Shafiq Jalandhary, Sajjad Mir, Dr Aman Ullah Malik, Dr Hussain Ahmad Piracha, Qayyum Nizami, Ehsan Wyne, Muhammad Mehdi, Advocate Zaheer Ahmad Mir & Prof Dr Saad Siddiqi.
Ahmad Bilal Mahboob president PILDAT, reviewing past 10 General Elections, said that 2018 elections has the potential of turning into the most credible ever exercise. The Electoral Act 2017 is the testimony of rendering electoral laws better, he added .
Prof Dr Amanullah said: “We should play our role with honesty to make the electoral process a credible phenomenon. He said it is the practice of viable nations to learn from the mistakes of the past and to strike change in these circumstances.”
Dr Shafiq Jallandhri paid tributes to the armed forces that by their unprecedented sacrifices.
Political leader Ehsan Wyne lamented that one of the political parties is being singled out for targeting it. This, he opined, obscures hope for transparent elections.
He said that decisions of Judiciary and NAB are influencing electoral process. Political parties are expressing that democracy is being subjected to adulteration, which the consciences people would not accept. Political Analyst Qayyum Nizami said that it would be more worthwhile to make reliable electoral system rather than electoral process. Brig. (R) Riaz Ahmad Toor said it may lead to complications if army personnel are put inside the polling station. Mr Muhammad Mehdi urged that transparent elections are sine quo non for our life and stability. Our elections are under the focus of the world. If the elections are disrupted, we may have to face great ordeals, he cautioned.
Advocate Zaheer Ahmad Mir said that it was the primary responsibility of ECP to arrange training of correct manner of exercising the right of vote. This training can be extended to all voters through the modern technology.
Prof Dr Saad Siddiqi said that the exercise of voting right in a responsible manner is a national as well as religious obligation.
SM Zafar said that the very conduct of election on time will be reckoned as victory for democracy and defeat of dictatorial mentality. This calls for that the political parties must, despite some impediments they experience, move forward. Boycott of elections, in the opinion of the jurist, would be very dangerous.
He suggested the ECP to arrange all parties conference to prepare a code of conduct with mutual consensus. The code should provide to desist igniting hatred and violence. He said that Supreme Court has made a putting off the hearing of Ahsan Iqbal's case after Election. The same policy should be adopted by NAB and other institutions. He objected to allot the symbol of Jeep to independent candidates. This policy, the demanded vehemently, be dismissed forthwith. He said the elections would not be reckoned credible by the announcements of ECP or foreign electoral observers. The veracity to elections being credible would come from the people.
Justice (R) Faqir Muhammad Khokhar said in his presidential address that 2018 election have great significance in our national life. I see that the present arrangements for elections far better than previous experiences. He expressed with optimism that there are scant possibility to experience rigging on the polling day.
He expressed that on the occasion of 2013 elections, General Kiyani cautioned the high brass of intelligence agencies that if any was found to indulge in elections, he would be dealt with severally. He said 1970 witnessed rigging of unprecedented dimensions when the Awami League occupied polling stations forcibly. He recalled that on the eve of 1977 elections, Mr. Bhutto wanted to prove that he was elected unopposed. For this, he abducted his opponent. The suit was followed by the CMs of other provinces. This led to conflicting atmosphere. He emphasized that holding of 2018 elections in transparent way was vital. If any movement this time started, the possibility of martial law cannot be ignored. However, in his opinion, the army would not interfere in the elections. He suggested that ECP should call a meeting of Chief Secretaries & IGs to urge upon them that any lapse in the security of candidates would not be tolerated. He said that the present level of the people's vigilance defeats the designs of adulterating democracy.
PINA Secretary General Mr. Altaf Hasan Qureshee said that we should put up suggestions to make the electoral process more reliable and credible, so that sustainability of democracy continues, and the impression of the people's rule is engraved deeper.
Prof Shabbir Ahmad Khan conducted the proceedings
Coquitlam Fire battled a 4-alarm fire at the 500-block of Cottonwood Avenue on Friday.
Twenty-six crew members were initially called to the scene.
Around 2 p.m. the City of Coquitlam said the fire had been contained but that crews would remain on scene for a while.

The fire began on the second floor of a wood apartment complex.
Cpl. Michael McLaughlin with Coquitlam RCMP said that no injuries have been reported at this point and it appears this will not be a police file.
NFL.com analyst Lance Zierlein will reveal the top CFB players to watch in 2018 at six different positions, beginning today with wide receivers.
The list of wide receiver prospects to watch during the 2018 college football season is an interesting collection, to the say the least. The top two prospects on my list made huge splashes in 2017 during their first seasons as starters for their respective teams. Colorado State lands two receivers on this list despite the fact that neither led the team in catches last season.
Ohio State is hoping that Parris Campbell's outstanding athletic ability will help vault the Buckeyes back into a title hunt, while South Carolina is looking to Deebo Samuel to stay healthy and impose his will on SEC cornerbacks. And Clemson, the new "Wide Receiver U," places yet another talented target on this list.
RANK 10 Hunter Renfrow - WR School: Clemson | Year: Senior (RS)
I thought about putting Louisville's Jaylen Smith or Buffalo's Anthony Johnson in this spot, as both players have more prototypical size/speed for the position. But ultimately, my goal here is to identify guys who will become good players in the NFL, and I'm more bullish on Renfrow right now -- even though he might not have the same upside as some others that could be listed here. Renfrow's production is relatively modest (he had a career-high 602 yards receiving last season), but he has also played on teams loaded with NFL talent. In clutch moments, Clemson QBs have not shied away from searching for Renfrow, and he's been able to deliver. His performances in back-to-back seasons against 2018 first-round pick Minkah Fitzpatrick should be an indicator of how good his hands are and how tough he is as a competitor. He's a slot-only receiver, but a darn good one.
RANK 9 Preston Williams - WR School: Colorado State | Year: Junior (RS)
Williams is a buzzed-about prospect in the scouting world, but there isn't much production to work off of just yet. He played in 12 games and recorded 16 catches during his two seasons at Tennessee before sitting out last year per transfer rules, but he's a classic "traits" prospect with a high-end combination of size (6-foot-4, 210 pounds, per school measurements), speed and athleticism. Scouts are waiting to see if the traits can transform into production, but he's one to keep an eye on in 2018.
RANK 8 Ahmmon Richards - WR School: Miami | Year: Junior
When it comes to the traits and measurables that NFL scouts look for from a primary receiver, Richards certainly is not lacking. After bursting onto the scene with an explosive freshman season that saw him average 19.1 yards on 49 receptions, great things were expected from him in his sophomore campaign. Unfortunately, injuries prevented him from playing or producing as much as expected in 2017. With his size (6-1, 205, per school measurements), speed and experience, Richards is an intriguing WR1-type talent who might be flying under the radar just a bit.
RANK 7 Olabisi Johnson - WR School: Colorado State | Year: Senior
Johnson was Robin to 2018 third-round pick Michael Gallup's Batman last season for the Rams, but when head coach Mike Bobo needs help this season, he'll be turning to Johnson to make things right. Nicknamed "The Standard," Johnson plays with a keen sense of consistency and technique on every snap. He maintains play speed throughout his routes. He also does a good job of setting up his route turns and stems to help open up workable passing windows for his quarterback. Johnson has the play traits and physical ability to work all three levels of the field and could be in for a big bump in production now that Gallup has moved on.
RANK 6 Nyqwan Murray - WR School: Florida State | Year: Senior
Murray has some of the most natural receiving talent of any player on this list. He has excellent ball skills, a good feel for space, the toughness to catch through contact and very reliable hands. The senior needs to improve his skill level and focus as a route runner to unlock his full potential. If the Seminoles can get more consistent quarterback play this season, Murray should put together a strong 2018.
RANK 5 Deebo Samuel - WR School: South Carolina | Year: Senior (RS)
On this list, you will find speedsters, finesse talents and long-limbed prototypes. Samuel? He's in a category entitled "tough-guy football players." That's not to say Samuel doesn't have size or speed. (He has both.) However, what stands out most on tape is his urgency and physicality as a receiver. Samuel wins by working back to the throw, keeping defenders on his hip and finishing catches with vice-grip hands. He also provides plus value after the catch with outstanding vision as a runner and a punishing demeanor that helps him grind out additional yards after contact. Unfortunately, Samuel missed seven games in 2015 with a hamstring injury and the final 10 games last year after suffering a broken leg. He has to prove he can stay on the field this year.
RANK 4 N'Keal Harry - WR School: Arizona State | Year: Junior
At 6-4 and 213 pounds (school measurements), Harry has prototypical size for an outside receiver. He's also proven to be a consistently productive target over his first two seasons, with 140 catches and 13 touchdowns. Harry has excellent ball skills and does a great job of owning the catch space with his big frame once the ball is in the air. An underappreciated part of his game might be how patient and poised he is when timing his attack on 50/50 balls. He has the play traits to be a physical possession receiver, but needs to prove that he can separate against quality man coverage and beat cornerbacks who try to crowd his routes over the top.
RANK 3 Parris Campbell - WR School: Ohio State | Year: Senior (RS)
To this point in his Buckeyes career, Campbell has been known as an explosive, multifaceted talent just waiting to take off. It felt like we saw his launch in 2017 and now we are expecting to see the payload as a senior. Ohio State could have as many as six receivers vying for catches this season, but Campbell handles slot duties, so I'm still expecting the Buckeyes to get the ball in his hands with jet sweeps, screens and quick-hitters in order to allow him a chance to hit the big play with the ball in his hands. Campbell has good size (6-foot, 200) and great speed. He also offers value as a kick returner and cover man on special teams. His hands are problematic and he still has work to do in terms of expanding his route tree, but his big-play potential certainly intrigues NFL teams.
RANK 2 A.J. Brown - WR School: Mississippi | Year: Junior
Brown is a compact, physical slot target on a team loaded with receiving talent. He racked up 1,252 yards last season, including five games with 150-plus. A 2016 draft pick of the San Diego Padres as an outfielder (19th round), Brown has tremendous ball-tracking talent and hand-eye coordination. He's a skilled route runner with the feel for uncovering out of his breaks and finding soft spots against the zone. Brown is also more than willing to get after defenders when it's his turn to block. He struggled in games against LSU and Alabama and will have to prove that he can rise to the occasion against the toughest competition this season.
RANK 1 Marquise Brown - WR School: Oklahoma | Year: Junior
Brown has played only one season at Oklahoma since transferring from junior college (College of the Canyons), but what a season it was: 57 catches for 1,095 yards and seven touchdowns. The junior is an electric talent with plenty of long speed and rare open-field elusiveness after the catch. Brown's thin (listed at 160 pounds), so he obviously needs to add more muscle and overall bulk to his frame by the time NFL teams are ready to consider drafting him. As one scout recently noted, "Hollywood surfs a tsunami of swag," and that swagger should only become more pronounced with another big season in 2018.

A protest marked by senseless bloodshed, announced by pharmaceutical manufacturers and chemists for Monday, took the side-line as an explosion ripped through the crowd gathered outside the Punjab Assembly, leading to the deaths of over 20 and injuring dozens of others.
In the wake of this attack, it is almost natural that most people are not aware about what the protesters were demanding, considering the fact that security concerns are now at the forefront.
The recently passed amendments to the Drug Act 1976 in the Punjab Assembly are the source of the consternation.
The tightening of rules and harsher punishments concerning the sale and manufacture of substandard drugs or those stored without adhering to precise temperature specifications alongside making the hiring of a licensed pharmacist at every pharmacy compulsory are some of the changes within the amendments.
It is important to separate the two stakeholders, the manufacturers and the retailers, and view them as mutually exclusive, although with a similar end result in mind.
Both want the amendments gone, albeit for entirely different reasons.
The manufacturers now have to ensure that all medicines being produced are registered and up to standards, which is not a bad thing in the slightest.
Greater transparency in the process of vetting and registering drugs is a possibility, but the public deserves medication that fulfils quality standards and provides treatment, instead of making patients sicker.
Retailers form the other half of this equation – for them the only problematic amendment to the old drug act is allowing for greater autonomy to drug inspectors and regulatory bodies for raids, inspection, seizure and then using the evidence gained for conviction.
The retailers complain that this allows for an increase in already rampant corruption of drug inspectors that are untrained and seek personal benefit.
They are not wrong, and provisions for transparency in the system of inspections must be allowed for; the drug inspector cannot be allowed to become judge, jury and executioner, leaving pharmacies at their mercy.
Greater regulation of local drug production and storage, especially temperature sensitive drugs, is necessary.
Increased monitoring is also a plus, no matter what the chemists or manufacturers say.
Chemistry is a very specific science, not to be trifled with; drugs cannot be developed or stored in imperfect conditions.
A fractional miscalculation can be the difference between life and death.
Having said that, there are valid concerns of the protesters that the government has not taken into account so far.
Widespread corruption in the drug inspector fraternity and other regulatory mechanisms often makes life harder for even those that are following the rules.
The Punjab government is attempting to make pharmacies and drug manufacturers more accountable, but must not do so at the expense of the entire industry.
I'm embarrassed to be “represented” in Washington by a congressman who doesn't resemble the honest, intelligent, empathetic people with whom I live and work. I'm ready — more than ready — for a change, and I hope others who feel the same will flood the polls on June 5 to ensure that we have a reputable and intelligent challenger to Rohrabacher on the November ballot.
LANSING, Mich. (AP)  Michigan legislative committees are considering legislation to steer more newly hired school employees into 401(k)-only retirement plans after a deal was reached between Republican legislative leaders and Gov. Rick Snyder.
House and Senate panels are holding hearings Wednesday, and majority Republicans are expected to move quickly so the full Legislature can finish passing the bills along with the state budget next week.
Under a new version of the legislation, teachers and other new school workers hired on or after next Feb. 1 would be automatically enrolled in a 401(k) plan unless they opt for a costlier pension within 75 days. There would be a "trigger" provision to stop new entrants from getting a pension in the future if the system is underfunded by a certain amount.
"This Is Me on a Plate" and 11 Other Things You'll Always Hear on MasterChef
There's a certain appeal about MasterChef that has kept it running on our screens year after year. Whether it's the general lack of cattiness between the contestants (a breath of fresh air on TV these days) or most importantly, all the food and culinary talent, we're certainly not ones to complain.
Naturally, like any long-running television series worth its loyal viewers, MasterChef has developed its own lexicon. Just like what "journey" or "the right reasons" are to the Bachelor franchise, below are the phrases, sentiments and feelings you'll see season after season on the cooking show.
ISLAMABAD - Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Sunday said elevation of the judges of superior judiciary was made purely in accordance with the constitutional mandate and command.
The Minister, in a statement here, said certain quarters known to be notorious in maligning others in order to justify their existence had now started to malign the highest judicial office of the state.
"The smear campaign is rampant on the social media designed specifically to undermine certain offices whose sanctity is sine qua non for the independent functioning of the justice system of the country," he added.
Khawaja Asif, who is also Minister for Defence, said Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was elevated to the position of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) strictly on merit and in accordance with Article 175A (3) of the Constitution which provided that the senior most judge be appointed as the CJP.
"The government or the PM (Prime Minister) has no role in his appointment. The appointment of any other person would have been unconstitutional," he maintained.
The Minister said after the decisions in the Al Jehad Trust and Sajjad Ali Shah cases and the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, only the senior most judge of the Supreme Court could be appointed as its chief justice. Justice Saqib Nisar, he said, being the senior-most judge alone could have been appointed as the chief justice, which was the constitutional mandate.
The appointment of anybody else would have been a violation of the constitution, he added. The Minister said Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was indeed the law secretary but appointed as the first non-judge after Sir Edmund Nelson for three reasons.
1. The Al-Jehad decision appeared to suggest that judges should not be appointed to such positions.
2. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah made it clear that no judge would be made available for this post.
3. Khalid Anwar, a lawyer of great eminence was the Law Minister and Saqib Nisar was his choice as the law secretary. He said, "The appointment of Saqib Nisar as an additional judge of the Lahore High Court was made on the recommendation of (then) Chief Justice of the LHC and in consultation with then Chief Justice of Pakistan Ajmal Mian.
"At the time of this appointment the Al-Jehad Trust Judgement was already in the field and the advice of the Chief Justice was binding on the Executive.
"He was confirmed as a judge of the High Court by former President Pervez Musharraf in consultation with then Chief Justice Irshad Hassan Khan.
"Later, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the binding advice of then Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry by former President Asif Ali Zardari.
"At the time of his oath taking, former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary had praised Justice Nisar and applauded his contributions and sacrifices towards the cause of the independence and sanctity of the judiciary by acting independently and not succumbing to the political desires of the government

Elder of Ziyon posted the recent data on hate crimes in Canada, with the data come from the Canadian government itself: Statistics Canada, Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey.
First, the graph, which just gives raw numbers of hate crimes for various groups over the last three years (data below):
Except for 2016, the numbers are highest for blacks, but these figures haven't been adjusted for population size. As Elders of Ziyon notes:
In 2016, there were more anti-Jewish hate crimes than even anti-Black hate crimes in Canada, which is almost certainly unprecedented. Anti-Jewish crimes always are the most prominent compared to crimes against other religious groups (anti-Muslim crimes actually went down while anti-Jewish crimes went up.) But to have antisemitic hate crimes outpace even racist crimes is extremely worrisome. There are some 380,000 Jews in Canada and nearly twice that many Blacks. There are over a million Muslims, meaning that Jews are about six times as likely to be victims of hate crimes than Muslims.
Now Wikipedia gives a Canadian population of 1,198,540 blacks and, for 2013, 1,153,677 Muslims—surely higher now. The actual per capita rates of hate crime per year in 2016, using these population figures and the raw data below, are these:
Jews: 0.121%
Blacks: 0.018%
Muslims: 0.012%
These data suggest that the rate of hate crimes against Jews is 6.7 times higher than for blacks and more than ten times higher than for Muslims.
Even if you assume 500,00 Jews in Canada, the upper limit given by Wikipedia, the per capita rate for Jews is still 0.04%—more than twice the per capita rate for blacks and more than three times the per capita rate for Muslims.
Here are the raw data:
Now I don't closely follow Canadian politics, but I bet a lot more press is given to hate crimes against Muslims than against either Jews or blacks—but I might be wrong. The higher per capita rate for Jews than Muslims also holds in the U.S., but you wouldn't know that from most of the liberal media. And that reminds me of a joke:
A guy walks into a bar and notices a man talking to the bartender down at the other end. The guy does a double take because the man talking to the bartender really resembles Hitler. So the guy goes up to the man and says “Excuse me, but did anybody ever tell you that you look like Hitler?” The man replies, “Oh, but I am Hitler. I have been reincarnated and I am back on Earth to kill 10 million Jews and 33 geese!” “Oh, my God! That's terrible! But why 33 geese?” Hitler then turns to the bartender and says “See? I told you nobody cares about the Jews.”

In their second outing in less than 24 hours, the Saskatoon Blades defeated the Prince Albert Raiders 3-2 on Sunday in Western Hockey League (WHL) action.
It was their second of eight meetings this season, after the Raiders defeated the Blades 4-3 in overtime in their first meeting on Oct. 21.
READ MORE: Saskatoon Blades fall 4-1 to Kamloops Blazers
Saskatoon got out to an early lead thanks to a goal from Cameron Hebig 4:58 minutes in, and the ice was flooded with stuffed animals, as the Blades hosted their annual teddy bear toss.
Jordy Stallard and Curtis Miske found the back of the net twice for the Raiders, both times to even the score, but Alec Zawatsky's goal in the third period would be the game-winner for the Blades. Their series with Prince Albert is now even at 1-1 this season.

Nolan Maier, 16, was making his tenth-straight start in net, and made a remarkable 34 saves in the contest.
The Blades now trail the Raiders by four points for the final Eastern Division wild card playoff spot. The WHL rivals will face off two more times, Dec. 27 and 28, before the new year.
Three months ago the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension turned over its file in the July 15 shooting of Justine Damond by Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. Freeman has vowed to make the prosecutorial decision himself rather than submit the case to a grand jury. We therefore await Freeman's charging decision in this apparently outrageous case.
It's an important case. Justice is due the friends and family of Ms. Damond, but the case is important for another reason as well. It opens one more window onto the Minneapolis kakistocracy.
When we last checked in on the story this past October, the Star Tribune had reported a story by Adam Belz on the strained relationship between former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and former Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau. Noor himself isn't talking, but Belz reported toward the bottom of his story:
When the BCA said July 18 that Noor shot from the squad car and Damond was unarmed, Harteau said she realized the full weight of the situation, because Noor's partner, Officer Matthew Harrity, offered no defense of the shooting. “It was clear to me that he didn't know why this happened,” Harteau said.
That may be the most illuminating piece of information reported since the initial flurry of stories following Damond's killing.
As we have awaited Freeman's charging decision for too long now, several readers have written to ask what is happening. The song remains the same: we await Freeman's charging decision.
In today's Star Tribune, Brandon Stahl returns to the story to remind us: we await Freeman's charging decision. Stahl doesn't add much to the story, but he notes that Freeman's decision should be imminent: he promised to announce his decision before the end of this year. Stahl's story at least makes it clear that the case has not been forgotten.
In today's rumor rundown the Carolina Hurricanes just made a trade for one of their defensemen almost a guarantee with the signing of Calvin de Haan on Tuesday. Who will it be? Also, it looks like there is a frontrunner for Erik Karlsson's services and a surprise team might be leading the charge. The Rangers have a decision to make on Kevin Hayes and
Carolina to Make Moves
After landing top-four defenseman Calvin de Haan in free agency, the Carolina Hurricanes must have something else coming. Of the many teams that needed another defenseman, Carolina really wasn't one of them so the expectation is that with Dougie Hamilton, Justin Faulk, Jaccob Slavin, Brett Pesce, Trevor van Riemsdyk (an RFA), young pros Haydn Fleury and Roland McKeown, and elite prospects Jake Bean, Luke Martin, and Adam Fox all on the roster, someone is moving. Logic would suggest that someone is Justin Faulk.
Luke DeCock suggests the Hurricanes now have their top four defensemen signed for the next three seasons at $19.3 million per season and Faulk isn't in that group.
One of the biggest surprises of the off-season is that the NHL Entry Draft and the opening days of free agency have passed and Carolina still hasn't moved at least one of Jeff Skinner or Faulk. The signing of de Haan allows new GM Don Waddell to make a move.
Chicago is a team rumored to be putting a package together.

Dallas Stars the Favorite for Erik Karlsson?
We talked yesterday about teams being granted permission to speak with Karlsson about an extension. This came after the Ottawa Senators offered the elite blueliner an eight-year contract that was not well-received. NBC Sports' Kathryn Tappen reported that the Senators' offer was for eight years at $10MM per season and Karlsson is looking for Drew Doughty and John Tavares money.
As teams reach out, it appears a frontrunner has emerged, that being the Dallas Stars. The Athletic's Chris Stevenson has heard from a source that Dallas and Ottawa are well into talks about a trade for Karlsson but one that does not include Bobby Ryan.
Shapiro believes that any deal for Karlsson would have to include young defenseman Julius Honka, while Ottawa may be asking about Esa Lindell. But, that wouldn't be all. More names like Miro Heiskanen, Radek Faksa, Devin Shore, Valeri Nichushkin, and Riley Tufte, or a combination of these players could be part of the deal as well.

Kevin Hayes for Jake DeBrusk?
Obviously, this is just one person speaking hypothetically, but New York Posts's Larry Brooks believes New York Rangers restricted free agent center Kevin Hayes would be worth $30 million over five years on the open market and the Rangers are trying to decide if they should offer him something in that range or move him for other help.
Brooks thinks it would be a mistake to go through arbitration and see a one-year deal come out as a result. He asks if the Bruins would consider moving Jake DeBrusk for Hayes?
Oilers to Move Zack Kassian?
With a cap hit of $1.95 million, Zack Kassian is being viewed in Edmonton as a player the team potentially can't afford since other options are out there in free agency that would cost less to acquire and he had a rough season in 2017-18.
Speculation is the Oilers would trade Kassian for a pick and then sign another forward or two to replace him. The names being tossed around are Jason Chimera, Nick Shore, Anthony Duclair or Scottie Upshall.
TAMPA, Fla. -- Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston found an unlikely training mate in former Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson this offseason. The two worked out together in Houston and Winston raved about Peterson on Monday when he was back in the Bucs facility.
"Being able to be in the presence of whom many consider to be one of the greatest backs, especially of this generation, my generation - to be able to learn [from] and see his work ethic, to see the way he works, man, you really know why he's great," Winston said.
"You know why he's been able to play at a high level in this league for so long, which helps me, because I want to be great," Winston said. "I want to be considered one of the best players in the league. To see that [after] 10 years, this man is still outworking everybody in his own facility, it's amazing. It's very eye-opening to me and motivating."
Jameis Winston had nothing but positive things to say about Adrian Peterson after spending some time working out with the free-agent running back. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images
Last year, Peterson opened a 35,000 square-foot gym called O Athletik, which features everything from free weights and machines, to a steep incline hill, batting cages, an indoor soccer field and an MMA training area. The club is more of a fitness center than an athletic training center, although it caters to both.
Winston chose Houston to gather several of his receivers a few weeks ago because several of them live in the area. Mike Evans, Derel Walker, Josh Huff, DeSean Jackson, Freddie Martino and Bernard Reedy all joined him, as did his trainer, Tim Grover, his quarterback coach, George Whitfield, and Peterson.
It wasn't just about bringing the group together, though. It was about "getting them around greatness," Winston said. "AP was able to work with us some. For them to be able to see what greatness is, it helps us, it helps build us, it helps motivate us."
When asked if he'd like to play with Peterson, a free agent, Winston said, "Absolutely."
"I don't know of anyone that wouldn't," Winston said. "But that's out of my league. I can only talk about what I learned from him and how he helped me this offseason."
The Bucs have some question marks at the running back position due to the suspension of two-time Pro Bowler Doug Martin, who will miss the first three games of the 2017 season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Martin was at One Buc Place on Monday to begin the team's offseason program, which he is eligible to participate in.
NEW YORK—Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged her live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special in Times Square made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through her short set, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of her songs playing in the background.Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.” Her representative Nicole Perna blamed technical difficulties, and in an interview with Billboard she said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance.“She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously,” Perna told Billboard. “A shame that production set her up to fail.”Perna said Carey's earpiece wasn't working and she flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when she got on stage.Article Continued Below“However, that was not the case, and they were again told that her earpiece was not working,” Perna said. “Instead of endeavouring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.”In a statement released on Sunday, the production company called such claims “absurd.”“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists,” it said. “To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”

WINNIPEG – Connor Hellebuyck made 25 saves for his fifth shutout of the season as the Winnipeg Jets blanked the Colorado Avalanche 3-0 on Saturday.
Patrik Laine scored his team-leading 24th goal, rookie Jack Roslovic was credited with his second and Nikolaj Ehlers put his 20th into an empty net for the Jets (31-13-9).
Blake Wheeler added a pair of assists as Winnipeg extended its point streak to seven games (5-0-2). It was the third game of a season-high, 10-game homestand (2-0-1).

Semyon Varlamov was back in net for Colorado. He missed 10 games in total with an injury and backing up Jonathan Bernier in the Avalanche's overtime win in Edmonton on Thursday. The veteran netminder stopped 29 shots as the Avalanche (28-19-4) wrapped up a season-long, six-game road trip with the loss (2-3-1).
Winnipeg led 1-0 after the first period and kept that edge until a Wheeler shot bounced off Roslovic and went up and over Varlamov into the net at 5:17 of the third.

For the past few months I've been shopping for a house. Not a particularly big house. Or an impressive one. Just a house that my family and I can move to where we'll be dry when it rains, warm when it gets cold, and comfortable when the Florida sun beats down in August.
If I were to put my search into aeronautical terms, I'm looking for a good, used Cessna 172. A reasonable purchase price coupled with modest long-term maintenance costs is what I'm hoping for. Oh yes, and I want this mystery house to be no more than a few miles from the house I currently call home.
To me, none of this seems irrational, elitist, foolhardy or reckless. And I assume most Americans agree with me, since more than 60% of Americans own a home, or are making payments toward the purchase of a place they can call their own.
This caused a thought to pop into my head. Why do so many Americans own homes? Presumably because they see value in the proposition.
They willingly struggle to save a down payment. They launch off on a tedious and sometimes disappointing search to find a home that is a good fit for both their family size and financial limitations.
They make offers, consider counter-offers, undertake inspections, and pay for those inspections even if they choose not to purchase the house because of inconsistencies discovered along the way.
And that's to say nothing of the inevitable and completely unknowable maintenance nightmare that's hiding in the future. The furnace, the plumbing, major appliances breaking down – it can all come back to bite you years from now when you were least expecting it.
It's true. The majority of Americans enthusiastically choose to go through all the pains and processes of becoming a homeowner in an effort to find and move into a structure they find satisfying. Something they could do far more easily and with much less hassle simply by making the decision to rent rather than own.
They do all this because of the perceived value they'll derive from home ownership. Even with the risks and unending workload of maintenance figured into the process, owning a home strikes most of us as a better deal than not owning. It's self-evident to us. So we buy, upgrade, and buy again.
Conversely, only a very small percentage of Americans learn to fly. Orville and Wilbur's ingenuity and industriousness haven't escaped their attention. It's not that they're unaware they have the ability to fly. They simply choose not to.
Presumably because they don't see the value in it. The cost, risk, and maintenance requirements of holding a pilot certificate outweigh the benefits, at least from the perspective of the vast majority of the population.
I find that interesting. And maybe a bit curious.
Learning to fly is perceived as being expensive, yet even a relatively dim bulb can learn to fly and earn a pilot certificate for roughly one-tenth the cost of a home in that same geographic market. In many cases, far less.
Which leads me to believe the challenge is in the perceived value of the certificate itself, not the cost of obtaining it. After all we buy cars and boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles that cost more than flight instruction would, and those vehicles will all decay and be worth close to nothing in only a decade or so. The pilot certificate lasts a lifetime.
I'm willing to bet that it all comes down to vision – and I don't mean the vision your doctor tests with an eye chart. I'm talking about the vision that allows one to see the potential for a more fulfilling life.
We know we can go to the ballgame in our RV and tailgate with fellow fans. We don't necessarily realize that both home and away games are accessible to those who have access to an airplane.
Many of us dream of saddling up the motorcycle and heading for parts unknown. Substantially fewer of us know that loading up the airplane will allow us to go farther, faster, and reach destinations that are virtually inaccessible by other means.
Motorcycling to the Bahamas for a long weekend is tough. Flying there is just a hop, skip, and a jump across some of the most beautiful scenery ever to catch your eye.
You could take a ferry to Catalina and back for less than $100. Your transportation will only take a couple hours out of your day-trip. Or you could fly yourself from Zamperini Field in just 15 minutes. The value of that decision comes down to having more or less time at your destination.
We aviation enthusiasts often talk about the cost of learning to fly, and the cost of maintaining our aircraft, yet we rarely get into involved discussions about the cost of finding, buying, and maintaining our homes. The value of a home is readily apparent. Consequently, the associated struggles are considered to be worth the hassle, the cost, and the headaches.
Imagine, if you will, the average American having a vision of being a pilot in their head that's just as clear as the image they conjure up of the value of owning a home. What if they saw the weekend trip with their significant other as being just as valuable and inducing as much pride as the new deck they labored to create back home? What then?
How might our numbers change, and how might the public at large benefit, if people focused more on the inherent value and unfettered freedom of being a pilot, rather than dreading the cost and complexity of becoming one?
That's an interesting question. One that I'm hoping you'll have an answer to that will shake the doldrums out of the majority of people who just can't wrap their heads around why anyone would want to learn to fly.
LEST WE FORGET: Christine Anderson brought a portrait of her father Arthur O'Brien which has been framed with the medals awarded during his 37 years of service between 194 and 1978. "He fought in WW2 and Korea and he'll always be a hero to me," she said.

EACH year, Christine Anderson brings her father's portrait to the Lismore Dawn Service and 2018 was no exception.
Holding the framed photograph of Arthur O'Brien, Ms Anderson said her father was a warrant officer who served in the 2/2nd Commando Unit out of Sydney.
Arthur O'Brien remembered:
"I always try to make the dawn service to represent my dad,” she said.
"I take him with me still.”
The Lismore resident has lived in town for 33 years and her mother currently lives at Banora Point with her sister Shirley.
"He met my mother Yumiko when he was serving in the British Commonwealth Occupational Force in Japan when she worked in the officer's mess,” she said.
"He served in Japan, the Pacific, Korea and Papua New Guinea and he never said much about the war except to say 'war is war, it's over now'.”
It was hard on her mother who grew up near Hiroshima, Ms Anderson said.
"They had to get special permission to marry as there was still the White Australia policy,” she said.
"To be married they had to go through three ceremonies, one in a traditional temple, one in the Japanese Consulate and one in front of the Australian Consulate.”
Ms Anderson said the army was in their family's blood and her sons had served in the 41st Battalion as reserve soldiers.
"Both my sons taught cadets in the reserves,” she said.
"After my father came home he taught cadets also.”

Husband and wife Paul Woolston, 42, and Victoria Woolston, 23, appeared at Teesside Crown Court for a plea hearing in connection with the offences which span between 2014 and 2016.
Paul Woolston, of Sheriff Street, Hartlepool, denies three allegations of acquiring criminal property totalling £14,450 between March 24, 2014 and January 29 of last year.
His wife is charged with six counts of stealing a total of £60,508 between February 25, 2014, and January 29, 2016.
She did not enter any pleas at yesterday's hearing due to outstanding issues.
Martin Towers, prosecuting, said: “The Crown's case is this was a substantial amount of money, which particularly during the course of 2014, was transferred out of the complainant's bank accounts.”
A trial will take place on April 16 next year.
Both defendants were granted bail and warned not to contact the alleged victim.
Judge Sean Morris said: “The trial is now set.
“If you fail to turn up you will be tried in your absence.”
Victoria Woolston's current address cannot be disclosed at this stage for legal reasons.
Saskatchewan's Emily Clark is set to embark on a quest for Olympic gold.
The forward will make her Olympic debut on the Canadian women's hockey team in Pyeongchang, South Korea, during the Winter Games, which run from Feb. 9 to 25.

According to Clark, hockey was her life's first calling.
“All my older brothers play and my dad being so involved coaching and now working at Canlan Ice Sports, it was natural for me to play,” Clark said over the phone from South Korea on Friday.
“A couple days after I was born, I was in the rink with my mom watching my brother, so it's all I've ever known,” she said. “I definitely fell in love with the game at a young age.”
Clark learned how to play hockey while growing up in Saskatoon and played three seasons with the Saskatoon Stars of the Saskatchewan Female Midget AAA Hockey League.

Her passion for the game and work ethic took her to the University of Wisconsin. In three years as a Badger, Clark has amassed 118 points in 113 games and led the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in game-winning goals last year.
She deferred to play the 2017-18 season with the Badgers to prepare with the Hockey Canada national team and will go back and finish her senior year next fall while studying economics.
“I'm not sure a lot of people know the full process of making it to this point,” Clark said. “[From the] end of May to mid-June we had what's called a bootcamp [from] 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. for just anything they could throw at us for three and a half weeks, so that was definitely tough and mentally challenging.
“It's been a long year, an emotional year and a tough journey, but honestly all worth it in the end.”
“Once the team was announced on Dec. 22, 2016, a weight was lifted off your shoulders to know you're on the final roster,” she added. “It was a pretty demanding and stressful year trying to make the top 23 to go [to the Games].”

While the Olympics will be a new experience for Clark, donning the Maple Leaf is something she's already accustomed to.
She's appeared in three IIHF women's world championships to date. At the 2017 championship, Clark scored twice and played on Canada's top line during the final two games of the tournament.
“Obviously it's always an honour and special every time you get to live out that childhood dream every time you wear [the Maple Leaf], but [the Olympics] is a much larger stage than a world championship or Four Nations Cup,” Clark said.
“To be a part of the Olympics is one of the greatest privileges any athlete can have and it will be different in the sense it's the multi-sport event … so I think it will be cool to be part of something much bigger.”
Clark is the only player representing Saskatchewan on this year's team in South Korea.
“It's amazing. I take a lot of pride being from Saskatoon and Saskatchewan and it's a pretty special feeling knowing that you're the only one,” Clark said.
“Definitely growing up playing in Saskatchewan, I learned a lot of traits that have gotten me here. Between my grit and my work ethic and looking at the history of hockey players in [the province], it's pretty special to know that I'm on the path to potentially being one of them.”

Clark also credits the strong support she's received from her family and community.
“My family has been absolutely amazing through my whole journey and … being the only one from Saskatchewan, I've received so much support from the community and people that I've never even met, but they're just so proud of me from being from there and representing them well,” Clark said.
The centre is also the youngest player on Team Canada's roster at 22 years old.
“I think being the youngest player, I bring a lot of energy,” Clark said. “I'm definitely looking forward to using my speed.”
With the opening ceremonies approaching, she believes her accomplishment of making it to the Olympics will finally sink in.
” I don't think it'll fully hit me until we're walking in the opening ceremonies,” Clark said.
“I know that I've done everything that I needed to do and could have done to prepare, so come puck-drop, I'll be ready.”
The upcoming Winter Olympics will mark the sixth time women's hockey has been part of the Games. Canada will be aiming for its fifth-straight gold medal.
Women's hockey opens on Feb. 10 and culminates on Feb. 22. Canada is scheduled to compete in Group A and begins preliminary-round play on Feb. 11.
It's time for the federal government to appoint an Indigenous judge to the Supreme Court of Canada – or explain why not.Beverley McLachlin has just announced she will step down as chief justice in December. That will open up a vacancy and hand the Trudeau government another opportunity to shape the top court and Canadian law for many years to come.The government should make it a priority to find the best-qualified Indigenous jurist to fill this crucial position. In 2017, as Canada marks the 150th anniversary of Confederation, it would be hugely symbolic for First Nations people finally to see one of their own on the high court.The importance of this goes beyond symbolism, however. It has long been accepted that diversity on the bench improves the quality of justice by widening the range of perspectives brought to judicial decision-making.It also increases public confidence in the court system. No less an authority than McLachlin herself has said that “many people, particularly women and visible minorities, may have less than complete trust in a system composed exclusively or predominantly of middle-aged white men in pinstriped trousers.”Article Continued BelowThis is especially important for Indigenous people, who are hugely over-represented in the justice system. As Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould pointed out last year, while they form about 4.3 per cent of Canada's population, they make up more than a quarter of prison inmates. In some parts of the country, Indigenous people are up to 33 times more likely to end up behind bars.At the same time, Canada's judiciary has been slow to change, although the pace has picked up under the Trudeau government. A survey last year showed that a scant 1 per cent of judges in provincial superior and lower courts are Indigenous (indeed, only 3 per cent are from visible minorities). The courts simply don't reflect the country's population.Of course, many will argue that judges should be chosen strictly by merit, without regard for other factors. But it is beyond belief at this point that only white (and still mostly male) lawyers can meet the standards of professional skill, experience and integrity to qualify for appointment to the bench.

StockX, a marketplace for sneakers, has announced that they've closed a $6M round from a group of high-profile investors like Mark Wahlberg, Scooter Braun, and Wale. They join existing investors like SV Angel and Detroit Venture Partners.
The sneaker reseller space couldn't be hotter right now. GOAT, one of the largest app-based sneaker marketplaces has raised more than $30M in just the last six months, and boasts over 1.5M users across the platform. Stadium Goods is another reseller and just raised $4.6M for it's blend of online and brick and mortar consignment shops.
But StockX has a unique twist that differentiates it from all of its competitors. The startup calls itself a “stock market of things”, meaning that it uses a “bid/ask” market to connect buyers and sellers – just like an actual stock market does.
For example, a buyer would place a bid for $650 for a pair of shoes, and a seller may be asking $680 for the same pair that they currently own. And when the bid/ask spread eventually meets, a transaction happens.
The advantage to this model is mainly transparency – you can see exactly how much more you'd need to spend to instantly meet the asking price and buy a pair of shoes, or as a seller you get a real-time view at how much people are willing to pay for what you are selling.
Plus a bid/ask model lets you instantly buy or sell at the current bid/ask price, assuming you don't want to wait for someone to match your offer.
StockX also utilizes this real-time pricing data to create a virtual “portfolio” for your sneakers. Essentially you can create a list of all the shoes you own, then track the aggregate value of your collection as prices on each shoe fluctuate up and down.
Like most sneaker resellers, StockX also has an authentication component where the seller ships their shoes to the startup for verification, after which they are sent to the buyer.
StockX will use this new funding to expand their sneaker business, but also to expand into new verticals for other limited-edition products, explained Josh Luber, co-founder and CEO of StockX. Two verticals Luber mentioned were watches and handbags, but it's easy to see StockX eventually playing host to any item that is in high demand on the secondary market and would need verification before being delivered to the seller.
Besides expanding into new verticals, StockX says they are also soon planning on allowing users from foreign countries to start selling on the platform.

NOUHA DICKO scored the only goal as Wolves dealt a huge blow to Leeds United's Championship play-off hopes.
Garry Monk's side were well on course for the top six heading into the international break but a return of four points from five games has seen them drop out on goal difference.
Wolves beat Brentford and Fulham on the road in March and they were full value for their half-time lead against an out-of-sorts Leeds.
Dicko's strike was only the fourth goal Leeds had conceded at Elland Road since November and the Whites went into Saturday's clash having won 10 of their previous 12 home games.
But Leeds were unable to draw on that record as they suffered their fifth home defeat of the season.
Wolves had eased their relegation fears with five straight wins but the mid-table visitors would have been determined to end their season on a high after back-to-back defeats.
Paul Lambert's side enjoyed a bright start and had the first sight of goal when George Saville - a goalscorer in last season's 2-1 loss at Elland Road - glanced a header well wide.
Leeds immediately threatened on the break but they were indebted to Robert Green for keeping out Andreas Weimann's low shot with his legs after he was left clean through following a collision between Gaetano Berardi and Pontus Jansson.
Green had to get down low to push Dave Edwards' low shot behind as Wolves continued to take the game to a Leeds side struggling with the away team's care-free approach.
Kyle Bartley threw his body in the way of a Saville strike with United again stretched before Dicko sent a 20-yard shot whistling past the right-hand post with Green beaten.
Berardi fired an ambitious volley into the crowd and Jansson headed over from a corner as Leeds got a foothold in the game.
But the hosts fell behind in the 38th minute when Dicko ran into space created by Jansson's charge upfield to latch onto Ben Marshall's through ball and roll a shot beyond Green.
Chris Wood twice threatened to get a shot off as half-time approached but the ball would not drop for the Championship's top goalscorer as Leeds' frustrations continued.
United were brighter after the break with Luke Ayling firing well over and Richard Stearman adjudged to have not deliberately handled Wood's cross.
Winger Hadi Sacko replaced defensive midfielder Liam Bridcutt in an attacking move by Monk before Jansson headed Pablo Hernandez's corner over with Leeds on the front foot.
For all United's pressure they had failed to test former goalkeeper Andy Lonergan until the 72nd minute when substitute Souleymane Doukara's header forced him to tip over.
Leeds were no closer to forcing an equaliser with full-time looming and were in desperate need of inspiration or a moment of good fortune.
Wolves substitute Kortney Hause headed Kemar Roofe's looping header off the line under intense pressure and when Wood headed over in stoppage time Leeds knew it was not their day.

Eating large amounts of cured meats was linked to worse symptoms among asthma sufferers, a French study found.
That was true even after taking obesity into account, the authors say.
So-called cured meats have been preserved and flavored by the addition of various combinations of salt, nitrates, nitrites, and sugar. Examples of such processed meats include bacon, ham, prosciutto, corned beef, pastrami, and pepperoni.
“Cured meat intake, a typical food in industrialized societies, has been associated with many chronic diseases, including lung cancer and COPD, but its association with asthma remained unclear,” study leader Dr. Zhen Li told Reuters Health in an email. Li is a researcher at Inserm and Paul Brousse Hospital in Villejuif.

As reported in Thorax, the research team had data on 971 adults from five French cities who answered questions about diet, weight, and asthma symptoms between 2003 and 2007.
On average, participants ate 2.5 servings of cured meats per week.
Just over 40 percent of the participants said they had had asthma at some point, and around half said they had never smoked. Each participant was assigned an asthma symptom score, ranging from zero to five, based on difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath during the previous year.
Follow-up surveys completed between 2011 and 2013 showed that about half of the participants had no changes in their asthma scores, over one-fourth said their symptoms had improved and about 20 percent felt their symptoms had gotten worse.
READ MORE: Here's a hierarchy of the healthiest sources of protein
After accounting for other factors such as smoking, physical activity, age, other dietary habits, and education, researchers found that participants who ate the most cured meat (four or more servings per week) were 76 percent more likely to see a worsening of symptoms compared to those who ate the least (less than one full serving per week).
About 35 percent of the participants were overweight and about 10 percent were obese, based on their responses. Those conditions probably explained about 14 percent of the association, the authors estimated.
“Our finding, together with other previous findings, suggests that patients with asthma might have benefits by following a multiple-interventional program,” Li said. “That means, besides the medication, weight control as well as dietary intervention such as reducing cured meat intake might also help them to control their asthma symptoms.”
Dr. Sunit Jariwala complimented the study but noted that its observational design means it can't prove cause-and-effect.
“Cured meats are rich in nitrites which may lead to any kind of oxidative stress related lung damage and asthma,” said Jariwala, who is director of allergy and immunology research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.

Jariwala, who was not involved in the study, believes obesity is an important consideration with asthma patients.
“In this study, as well as previous studies, obesity may be linked to systemic inflammation that can worsen asthma as well as other obesity related conditions such a sleep apnea,” he said.
Jariwala advises patients to follow a balanced diet that includes fresh, unprocessed foods and is low in salt, sugar, and saturated fats.

So far the authorities have shown the right diligence and attitude towards the horrific lynching in Mardan; politicians have made the right statements, institutions like the Supreme Court are taking the right initiatives and the police seem to be pursuing multiple leads in the case.
While it remains to be seen how motivated the authorities are to take these steps to their logical end, for the moment we must support the positive actions they take.
On Sunday, law enforcement agencies opened a hate speech investigation involving the two clerics who tried to disrupt the funeral rites of Mashal Khan in his hometown of Swabi.
According to a senior Swabi police official, “the mosque loudspeaker for hate speech against the slain student and his family and .
.
.
created hurdles for the people and another cleric to participate in the funeral.
” Hate speech and anti-terrorism legislation clearly outlaws the use of loudspeakers to incite hate and violence, and there exist strong precedence for clerics being indicted and punished for committing this crime.
In this case, there is ample evidence of the incident, multiple eyewitnesses and the political backing to try the perpetrators – this should be an open-shut case and nothing short of a successful conviction suffices in the circumstances.
The stakes in this case also make this a must-win case for law enforcement and prosecution teams.
While the actual murderers and their abettors surely need to be put behind bars, also on trial is a culture that encourages violent vigilantism on mere suspicion of blasphemy, supports targeting family members of the victims and intimidates all opposition.
While the shrine of Mumtaz Qadri, the “Lubaik Ya Rasool” movement, and other individuals – some in the government itself – seem beyond what the authorities are willing to tackle at the moment, these low level clerics who blindly propagate that toxic narrative need to be tried for their crimes and made an example off.
This is the least the government can do.
It is time that the authorities start looking at the bigger picture – instead of going after the individuals that commit these vigilante murders, the government needs to start targeting the organisations that propagate this narrative, who fund it, and who glorify murderers.
We are reminded by the incident in Mardan that unless the organisations who openly challenge the writ of the state and encourage people to take the law into their own hand are taken down, the lynch mobs will keep rising up.
Mardan is a test case for the government; it must show that it is capable of delivering justice.

Writing code is hard. Writing secure code is harder—much harder. And before you get there, you need to think about design and architecture. When you're writing code to implement security functionality, it's often based on architectures and designs that have been pored over and examined in detail. They may even reflect standards that have gone through worldwide review processes and are generally considered perfect and unbreakable.*
However good those designs and architectures are, though, there's something about putting things into actual software that's, well, special. With the exception of software proven to be mathematically correct,** being able to write software that accurately implements the functionality you're trying to realize is somewhere between a science and an art. This is no surprise to anyone who's actually written any software, tried to debug software, or divine software's correctness by stepping through it; however, it's not the key point of this article.
Nobodyactually believes that the software that comes out of this process is going to be perfect, but everybody agrees that software should be made as close to perfect and bug-free as possible. This is why code review is a core principle of software development. And luckily—in my view, at least—much of the code that we use in our day-to-day lives is open source, which means that anybody can look at it, and it's available for tens or hundreds of thousands of eyes to review.
And herein lies the problem: There is a view that because open source software is subject to review by many eyes, all the bugs will be ironed out of it. This is a myth. A dangerous myth. The problems with this view are at least twofold. The first is the "if you build it, they will come" fallacy. I remember when there was a list of all the websites in the world, and if you added your website to that list, people would visit it.**** In the same way, the number of open source projects was (maybe) once so small that there was a good chance that people might look at and review your code. Those days are past—long past. Second, for many areas of security functionality—crypto primitives implementation is a good example—the number of suitably qualified eyes is low.
Don't think that I am in any way suggesting that the problem is any less in proprietary code: quite the opposite. Not only are the designs and architectures in proprietary software often hidden from review, but you have fewer eyes available to look at the code, and the dangers of hierarchical pressure and groupthink are dramatically increased. "Proprietary code is more secure" is less myth, more fake news. I completely understand why companies like to keep their security software secret, and I'm afraid that the "it's to protect our intellectual property" line is too often a platitude they tell themselves when really, it's just unsafe to release it. So for me, it's open source all the way when we're looking at security software.
So, what can we do? Well, companies and other organizations that care about security functionality can—and have, I believe a responsibility to—expend resources on checking and reviewing the code that implements that functionality. Alongside that, the open source community, can—and is—finding ways to support critical projects and improve the amount of review that goes into that code.***** And we should encourage academic organizations to train students in the black art of security software writing and review, not to mention highlighting the importance of open source software.
We can do better—and we are doing better. Because what we need to realize is that the reason the "many eyes hypothesis" is a myth is not that many eyes won't improve code—they will—but that we don't have enough expert eyes looking. Yet.
* Yeah, really: "perfect and unbreakable." Let's just pretend that's true for the purposes of this discussion.
** …and that still relies on the design and architecture to actually do what you want—or think you want—of course, so good luck.
*** Nobody who's actually written more than about five lines of code (or more than six characters of Perl).
**** I added one. They came. It was like some sort of magic.

islamabad - Islamabad High Court (IHC) Wednesday directed Safa Gold Mall administration to submit a formal application with CDA for approval of eight floors of its building. The court directed Capital Development Authority (CDA)'s board to resolve the matter of floors of the mall within four weeks. Justice Aamer Farooq of IHC heard the case filed by Safa Gold Mall administration challenging sealing its building by CDA. During the course of proceeding, Member Planning CDA Asad Kiyani and counsel Kashif Malik appeared before the court.
Asad Kiyani said illegal approval for eight floors was given and the authority would conduct a separate inquiry on it. The bench asked how many floors are illegal. Member planning submitted that the construction of four floors of Safa Mall is illegal.
The counsel for Safa Mall argued that his client should be given permission to built eighth floor at his own risk. He said it was now difficult to demolish the big building after construction, saying there should be a way to resolve the matter. The court directed Safa Mall administration to file a formal application with CDA and adjourned the case until four weeks.

Alright, I finally went and did it. Many of you have asked, over and over again, since I started this gastro adventure, if I would check out a certain area place for a column. So with an arm twisted behind my back, which makes it very hard to eat by the way, I pointed my trusty little car toward a land called Sanford and visited a little place known as the Sanford Lake Bar & Grill.
I think Sanford Lake Bar & Grill was the No. 1 request from my extensive, and I mean extensive readership (at least that's what I tell myself as I cry my way to sleep every other night) since this column first came off the presses. So with such a fan base for this area staple, it was hard to make the right decision on which menu item to settle on for this column.
There are so many choices on the extensive menu. Several people told me the Sanford Lake Bar & Grill pizza was where it was at, while others said their Mexican food fare was the place to start. Another popular suggestion was the perch dinner that so many people rave about. Needless to say, all of these options looked wonderful, and it took a few days of cyber menu stalking to figure out the game plan before I arrived.
We were off to a good start when I chatted with a couple of very nice employees about what they recommended for a first timer, and my sweetheart of a server started me off with a nice little basket of popcorn to munch while I perused the voluminous menu.
For my meal I chose the beef wet burrito (chicken is also an option), a beautifully monstrous concoction that completely filled the plate it would not linger on too long. As always, a picture tells the story in the best possible way, and I don't know how you could look at that image and not have to wipe away a few tears in the process.
So how was it? The quick version is that I chose the right dish for my first visit to the Sanford Lake Bar & Grill, 3770 N Bailey Road. My food arrived quickly, and I could see that all of the ingredients seemed fresh and very high quality. I also discovered an interesting technique in the preparation of the wet burrito. The cook laid a soft tortilla down on the plate before doing anything else, and this little step created a nice baked giant tortilla shell that held everything together and made sure nothing got mushy before the plate was empty. Maybe other places do this as well, but this is the first time I was aware of it. Genius, and along with all of the other thoughtful prep, this made my meal a delicious experience.
Everything was cooked properly, and the wet burrito held together without turning to mush, which can easily happen. Another great thing about this meal is that the salsa, sour cream and jalapeno portions were more than enough, and I actually got to the end of the meal with sides to spare. So often you run out of the good stuff before you are done with your meal, and you end up asking for more condiments (and usually spending more for them). Bravo, Sanford Lake Bar & Grill.
This dish was big enough for two people, but logic like that has never stopped me from taking it on myself. And I nearly made it. Nearly. Yes ladies and gentlemen, your favorite foodie was finally bested by a dish. I could not finish it, no matter how hard I tried. Sadly, I had a long ride ahead of me on another mission, with no means of keeping that food fresh for a safe trip home. I hated to say goodbye to the remnants of my latest food romance, and I got that sad feeling of watching food leave the table, but not in a restaurant container under my arm. Oh well, I guess that just means I will have to return for another visit.
Sanford Lake Bar & Grill offers a dizzying amount of menu items for your visit, and of course being a bar, they can take care of that need for you if you plan on skipping a meal. But why on Earth would you want to do that? The menu is loaded with all kinds of wonderful-sounding appetizers, from fries to chickenkabobs to loaded tater tots (good night, sweet Irene) and even deep-fried green beans and broccoli bites. There are a boat load of sandwich options and even Koegel Vienna chili dogs, as well as their famous perch dinners. And of course, there is pizza, which will be the next thing I devour when I return for a visit.
Food options galore, fair prices, great portion sizes and awesome service add up to a place that has been on the map for a long time, and rightfully so. So as I massage the arm you twisted behind my back to get me to the Sanford Lake Bar & Grill, let me ask you just one question: Why didn't you tell me about this place before?

Parks Canada said it negotiated an agreement with Simpcw First Nation, which it says has been asking for several years to hold a harvest on their traditionally used lands. The move is part of reconciliation efforts between the government and Canada's First Nations.

Starting Friday and going for a week until Oct. 13, a temporary area closure will be put in place east of Snaring River, north of Highway 16 and the Athabasca River.
Parks Canada said the First Nation will be allowed to hunt up to a maximum of 10 animals: one mule deer, three whitetail deer, three bighorn sheep and three elk. Nine members of the community, located north of Kamloops, will take part in the harvest.
“Conservation and public safety are shared priorities for Parks Canada and the Simpcw First Nation,” said Steve Young, a Parks Canada communications representative.
“Parks Canada and the Simpcw First Nation are committed to ensuring the harvest supports the ecological integrity of the national park and the safety of members of the Simpcw First Nation, Parks Canada staff, and the public.”
The closed area will be marked and monitored, so hikers and other people enjoying the park this Thanksgiving long weekend are not put at risk.

When Canada's mountain parks were created between 1885 and 1914, they were operated based on European and North American ideas that did not consider the perspectives and traditions of aboriginal peoples.
Parks Canada said early managers considered many First Nation traditional activities inconsistent with national park goals. Hunting and gathering were no longer permitted in the parks and, as a result, aboriginal groups were forced to leave.
In recent years, many First Nations have become more involved in the management and operation of the mountain parks as part of reconciliation efforts.
The Jasper Indigenous Forum was created in 2006 as a link between the park and First Nations who have ties to the park. More than 20 different First Nations, Non-Treaty First Nations, and Métis communities from both Alberta and British Columbia, participate in the forum.
Parks Canada said other Indigenous partners support the Simpcw request for a traditional harvest.

People in Newcastle are being asked if they support plans to hand over their public parks to a new charitable trust to run.
Newcastle City Council's proposals, which come in the face of cuts to its park budget of more than 90% over seven years, are a first for a local authority, but could be adopted by cash-strapped councils elsewhere.
A consultation that runs until April 21 is seeking views of residents on transferring 33 green spaces and possibly 50 hectares of allotments to a charitable trust.
The parks, which are not a service local authorities are legally obliged to provide, would remain owned by the council and free to access.
But a trust with the sole purpose of running the parks could open up new sources of funding, ensure they are looked after and provide new volunteer opportunities, while maintaining paid staff levels, the council believes.
It has been advised by the National Trust on the plans and awarded a £237,500 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to develop them, with a requirement to share the findings with other local authorities that might want to take the same route.
A recent report by MPs warned the squeeze on council budgets across England means parks face a return to the neglect of the 1980s and 1990s without innovative management and funding measures.
Newcastle's cabinet member for culture and communities Kim McGuinness said: "Our parks budget has suffered greatly at the hands of central government, but despite this, we're committed to maintaining and sustaining the beautiful parks and green spaces the city is known for."
Pressure on overall budgets meant parks were an area that would "really suffer", she said, potentially having to close their gates, which the council was not prepared to let happen.
The public consultation, which has involved social media, online surveys, community events and workshops, was important because "it's a huge change, it's groundbreaking, it's innovative and that can be nerve-wracking".
"It's a case of making sure that the public are happy and comfortable with the plans and that they feel their views are heard."
Early statistics from the online survey suggest people think the main priorities for parks are to generate income to keep them maintained and to increase available facilities, each getting 28% of votes.
The main concern for their future is they will fall into a state of disrepair and become unsafe, with 44% most worried about this.
Consultation feedback also shows people are concerned about whether a trust can raise enough money to look after parks and whether the funding will be "ethical" and not involve creeping privatisation.
Ms McGuinness said all views would feed back into the plans.
She said: "The primary aim is the parks are protected, they are well managed and they are free to access. These are really non-negotiable."
Keith Pimm, a member of the Elders Council of Newcastle, said if it is to be successful, the trust must be accountable to people and give them a say in the future of the parks.
"This can be seen as a real change of situation, almost a new kind of cultural situation; where the local communities will really be much more in charge of the parks," he said.

Three NFL Network analysts have been suspended after Jami Cantor, a former wardrobe stylist at the network, filed a complaint against NFL Enterprises alleging sexual harassment by several men while she was employed with the company. NFL Network confirmed the suspension in a statement to Bloomberg.
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, names Eric Weinberger, a former executive producer at NFL Network and current president of Bill Simmons's media group, as well as Marshall Faulk and Heath Evans, retired football players who provide on-air commentary for the network.
According to the complaint, Weinberger pressed his crotch against her shoulder and asked her to touch it, in addition sending her “several nude pictures of himself and sexually explicit texts” and telling her she was “put on earth to pleasure me.”
Cantor alleges that Faulk asked her “deeply personal and invasive questions” regarding her sex life, fondled her breasts, and groped her butt.
Also named is another analyst, Ike Taylor, who the filing indicates sent Cantor “sexually inappropriate” pictures of himself and a video of him masturbating in the shower. Donovan McNabb, a former analyst, has also been included in the filing.
The men named in the suit are not included as defendants.
According to a spokesman for the NFL Network, Faulk, Taylor and Evans have been suspended while an investigation into the accusations is conducted.
Cantor said in the complaint that she informed Marc Watts, who coordinates talent for the NFL, of the alleged advances, but that he said it's “part of the job when you look the way you do.” Cantor also alleges that the network did not reimburse her for expenses, and failed to pay her adequately for the hours she worked.
Faulk has provided commentary for “NFL Total Access,” “Thursday Night Football,” and “NFL GameDay Morning” for five seasons. Taylor, hired in 2015, works primarily on “NFL Now.” Evans joined the network as an analyst in 2012.
Dana White, the owner of Paralee Boyd Salon of Southfield, recently launched her national brand with the grand opening of her second Paralee Boyd salon. The new salon is at 3939 Woodward Avenue in Midtown, Detroit.
White is planning to expand with a nationwide operation of salons.
Paralee Boyd Salon is not your average salon it is for women with thick and curly hair. The salon is named in honor of Whites grandmother Paralee Boyd who had a dream to become an entrepreneur that never came to fruition. The Paralee Boyd concept, as White calls it, are the lessons learned from her grandmother to find ones lifes purpose, let nothing stop you in achieving that purpose, and to treat people as you want to be treated The Golden Rule. When these values are incorporated with Whites technical knowledge of the principles of lean manufacturing - taken from the auto industry, and applied to the overlooked African-American haircare industry, you have the Paralee Boyd concept.
Im so thrilled to be launching our national franchise with the grand opening of our first flag-ship Paralee Boyd Salon in Midtown Detroit, White said.

This dream began back in 2012, when I left a successful career as an international labor relations specialist in New York City, White said.
The Paralee Boyd Salon concept began when White consulted with automotive engineers to study the process of women of color getting their hair styled, and applied it to the Detroit way of manufacturing things with quality, style, and efficiency in mind.
The Paralee Boyd Salon experience begins with a guest check-in where their information is maintained, updated, and monitored for continued hair health and growth. The customer then moves to a shampoo station where hair is cleaned and an optional Dominican Deep Conditioner is given. Next, the customer moves to the hair blow-drying station (the-Paralee-way of blow drying a woman of colors hair), which is a process that removes the need for a hot-comb to straighten their hair. Finally, after blow-drying is complete, off to the styling station with a flatiron, only, for better hair health, no curling irons are used. Thats it, a Paralee Boyd customer spends less than two hours in-and- out, and pays $40 for the blow-and- go service.
The salons are open seven-days a week, and do not accept appointments - as everyone is considered a walk-in guest.
White was born in Detroit, and reared in Highland Park for a short time while her father Damon White, a noted civic leader and politician from Highland Park was in office.
The first Paralee Boyd is at 29555 Northwestern Highway, in Southfield. For more information, visit www.ParaleeBoyd.com.

The Glen Rose Beavers (4-1, 2-0) were able to handle Jessieville (3-2,1-1) in Week 5, taming the Lions on the road 42-14.
Despite a sluggish start, which included a three-and-out and a blocked punt returned for a TD, the Beavers settled in during the second quarter, outscoring the Lions 28-0 for a hefty halftime lead.
“We started off slow,” said Head Coach Mark Kehner. “We came out not ready to play between the ears. We came out in the second quarter, though, and responded well.
“All of that was good, we just have to learn how to start games each and every week.”
In Week 6, Glen Rose keeps with the road tilts, traveling to Bismarck for more 5-3A action.
Bismarck (2-3, 0-2) fell hard to Harmony Grove, losing 42-7 at Sykes Stadium in Haskell.
“We need to come out and start the game like we are capable of starting it,” Kehner said. “Hopefully we get a chance to play a lot of kids and get them some experience. It is an opportunity, that if we handle the situation right, it will be good for all of our kids.”
Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.
A virtual reality cafe opened Wednesday in western Seoul in partnership between a PC manufacturer and VR content provider who are collaborating on a joint project for business expansion.
The cafe, named VRIZ, opened near Hongik University campus that has one of the highest foot traffic in the capital. It will be operated by PC maker Jooyon Tech Co. with YJM Games supplying VR games and other related contents.
(Yonhap)
While there are other VR-focused businesses in major cities that set up shop from latter half of last year, they have not caught on mostly because of lack of content.VRIZ combines a conventional gaming center charged by the hour, called PC rooms, with two more rooms for VR games. The VR game rooms are equipped with 70-inch monitors and high-quality HTC Vive headsets. The offered games are ones that have been officially licensed, including Raw Data and Kart Chase, both of which drew global popularity on games platform Steam. Operators said they will add seven to eight more games within the first half of this year.VRIZ will charge 10,000 won ($8.75) per hour and 18,000 won for an hour and a half, slightly more expensive than ordinary PC rooms.Operators said they plan to open cafe branches throughout Seoul, picking locations with high foot traffic. The store planned in southern Seoul is expected to be solely for VR games."Our goal is to widely distribute VR by finding killer content for VR cafes, just like Starcraft was a huge hit in PC rooms," Lee Jung-hoon, who handles franchising at Jooyon Tech, said.

Parks Canada is preparing for an increase in visitors this year as people across the country and around the world request free annual passes to explore the nation's natural treasures as part of Canada's 150th anniversary celebration.
Conservationists say it is important for people to connect with nature, but there are concerns about how more tourists may affect the ecological integrity of some of the more popular parks.

Ben Gadd, a retired nature guide and author of “Handbook of the Canadian Rockies,” said he is worried about increased vehicle traffic.
“Clearly the highway system in the mountain parks — it is going to be terrible next summer all summer long,” said Gadd, who has been hiking in the region since 1968.
“When you have that situation and animals trying to cross there are going to be more accidents, more animals killed.”
Gadd said he is also concerned about crowded attractions, trash and people feeding or getting too close to wildlife.

He hopes there are enough staff to properly maintain the parks and to explain the rules to visitors, especially newbies.
Watch below from Nov. 2: Starting Jan. 1, Parks Canada is waiving all gate entrance fees to celebrate Canada's 150th birthday. But as a Jayme Doll reports, not everyone thinks it's a good idea.
According to Parks Canada, more than 900,000 people ordered a free Discovery Pass in the first two weeks after they became available last month.
The government predicts visits to national parks, historic sites and marine conservation areas will top last year's attendance of about 24.5 million.
Eric Hebert-Daly, national executive director of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said the Parks Canada plan is a good idea in principle, but there are some dangers.
Some parks such as Banff, Jasper and the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario are already very busy. Adding more people could take away from their grandeur, he said.
READ MORE: Not everyone pleased with free entry into Banff National Park for Canada's 150th
Hebert-Daly said the government should consider better ways to handle traffic in busy parks, including the increased use of shuttle buses.
There are also not enough wardens and scientists to monitor the health of the parks, he said.
“This may be the year where we realize just how overstretched some of these places are,” Hebert-Daly said.
Canada's national parks have a long history of attracting tourists eager to view wildlife and wilderness. Increased media attention is expected to draw even more visitors.
National Geographic Traveler magazine has put the Banff area on its “Best of the World” list of 21 must-see places in 2017 and Parks Canada has been busy promoting on social media as part of the Canada 150 campaign.
On Dec. 1 so many people jumped online to get a free annual pass that the department's computer system slowed to a crawl.
Ed Jager with Parks Canada said staff know they are in for a busy year.
The number of cleaning and maintenance crews has been increased to ensure facilities will be kept in shape and that garbage doesn't attract wildlife, he said.
Jager said online orders for annual passes are being tracked to get a sense of which parks will see more traffic. Information about park rules is being sent to visitors.
Parks Canada is also trying to take some heat off of more popular parks by promoting other, less-visited destinations.
The department has released a list of “ten hidden gems” across Canada for people to explore including the Mingan Archipelago National Park reserve in Quebec, L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site in Newfoundland and Labrador and Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan.
“We can't actually love our parks to death — I think the death of our parks is when nobody wants to come to them and when they don't care about them anymore,” he said.
“We would much rather be in this place then in a place where nobody is showing up.”
Parks Canada plans to open its online reservation system for campsites starting with some parks in British Columbia on Jan. 3 and adding more parks across the country throughout the month.
While annual park passes are free in 2017, there are still fees for campsites, firewood and backcountry passes.
BOSTON -- When at last they reached Kenmore Square on Monday, the runners of the 121st Boston Marathon had to find one more burst of energy to get them through the final three-quarters of a mile to the finish line.
Craig Kimbrel had a similar feeling.
Kimbrel had pitched the previous two days for the Boston Red Sox, leaving manager John Farrell unsure whether his closer would be available for at 11 a.m. series finale against the Tampa Bay Rays. When the game began, Farrell figured Kimbrel could use the rest. As it progressed, the plan changed.
And when the ninth inning arrived, with the Red Sox holding a one-run lead, it was Kimbrel who jogged out of the bullpen, unleashed 15 pitches and struck out the side to save a 4-3 victory, the Red Sox's third win in a row.
“Initially, I think we were going to go with a day off,” said Kimbrel, who recorded three saves in as many days for the first time since July 24-26, 2015, for the San Diego Padres. “But as the day went on, before I went out to the bullpen, I told John I felt great and if the situation was there, I wanted it. And it worked out that way.”
It couldn't have worked out any better, actually. During the past three days, Kimbrel faced the minimum nine batters, struck out seven and looked to be, in Farrell's words, “in the best spot he's been in from a delivery standpoint in the year-plus that he's been here.”

“I think so, yeah,” Kimbrel said, agreeing with his manager's assessment. “I think last year I was battling through some things [with a knee injury that required midseason surgery] and maybe got in some bad habits. Right now, everything feels great. Hopefully I can keep it going.”
Kimbrel dealt with issues related to his delivery in spring training, struggled to command his curveball and white-knuckled his way through a few saves in the season's first week. On April 9 in Detroit, for example, he gave up one run on one hit and two walks and needed to rely on every last ounce of his power fastball to strike out the side and nail down a 7-5 win.
But Kimbrel showed no traces of those issues against the Rays. Of the 38 pitches he threw, 28 were strikes. And he threw everything, including his curveball.
Kimbrel should be the least of Boston's worries in a bullpen that is only beginning to establish order. With setup man Tyler Thornburg not yet close to returning from the disabled list, Matt Barnes has taken over the eighth-inning role. Heath Hembree got a chance in the eighth Monday with Barnes unavailable.
While Farrell's faith in hard-throwing Joe Kelly appears to have waned, he had enough confidence in right-hander Ben Taylor to bring him into a two-on, two-out spot in the seventh inning. Never mind that Taylor didn't find out until about 9 a.m. that he was being called up, just enough time to make the drive from the Red Sox's Triple-A home in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He allowed a Steven Souza Jr. single to load the bases before getting Logan Morrison to fly out.
But when it comes to the ninth inning, there isn't any ambiguity, even on days when Kimbrel isn't sure he has much in the tank.
Asked whether he could remember not taking the ball when given the choice, Kimbrel said, “I don't think I have. There might be a day, but today wasn't it.”
And as long as Kimbrel's delivery remains as smooth as it looked against the Rays, Farrell will sleep more soundly.
“I think any pitcher goes in and out of it as the year goes on,” Kimbrel said. “It's just [a matter of] not getting far away from what you're comfortable with so you can get right back to making a pitch when you need it."

PLANS by the government to haul person or persons before the courts to give an account of the monies spent to date on the uncompleted St. Jude Hospital Reconstruction Project are well advanced as three lawsuits are expected to be lodged soon.
Word of this new development in the hospital saga was confirmed to this reporter by a government source this week, who declined to name the parties against whom the litigations will be lodged.
The source insisted that the charges will be filed from the Office of the Attorney General and that those responsible will have to pay for failure to give accurate accounts of the monies spent on the hospital.
The government is said to have a witness who is prepared to testify at the trial. Prime Minister Allen Chastanet, two months ago, said that person, who conducted the technical audit on the project, has stated a willingness to testify.
But while the parties to the lawsuits were not revealed, hints that they very well may be from or associated with the Labour Party were given by Economic Development Minister, Guy Joseph, who told reporters that there was no way he would sit by and allow the Labour Party to get away with what it did to St. Jude when it formed the government.
“They can march as many times as they want, somebody must account for what happened at St. Jude,” Joseph said Monday, referring to the recently-held march for St. Jude organized by the Labour Party.
Joseph took former Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony to task, saying that by the latter's own account in 2015, he had expected to spend no more than $60 million on the hospital.
“I want him to account to the people of St. Lucia where the other $58 million and the other millions that are needed to complete the hospital, where is it coming from?” Joseph said.
Joseph wants public discussions on the hospital to move away from the almost $1 million spent on a technical audit for the hospital to the $118 million claimed by the audit to have already been spent on the hospital's reconstruction.
On Monday, Joseph showed reporters a letter purportedly written by the consultant on the hospital project, Mandish Singh, to someone named Clarita Posada, Product Manager of Biomedical International Corp. in Miami, Florida, indicating a tentative completion date for the hospital. That letter was written on January 13, 2016.
Singh, in that letter, stated that despite the numerous third party delays experienced over the years, and following discussions with the Project Management Unit, the aim was to complete the buildings by August 2016, after which testing and commissioning would commence.
“We are very optimistic that this date is achievable based on the progress of works to date and the projected works to be executed in the next two quarters,” the letter read in part.
According to Joseph, what is interesting about the letter is the announcement that the hospital would have been completed just about two months after his party came into office in June of last year.
He wants to know why the hospital has not been completed based on the information in the letter and why St. Lucians want to hold him accountable for that. He promised that the St. Jude Hospital matter will remain in the public domain because he will not step back and allow what has already happened to continue.
Regarding the company in Miami, Florida called Biomedical International Corp., Joseph said it was paid in excess of $5 million for equipment for St. Jude since 2011/2012. He said the time period for the procurement of the equipment had lapsed several times.
The technical audit stated that $118 million was already spent on the hospital, while a handover report by the Project Manager, Shanta King, placed that figure at $80 million.

He's one of the world's most successful DJs and has played in some of the world's biggest clubs - but one of Judge Jules' upcoming shows is in the most unlikely of locations, right here in Bristol.
The DJ, whose career spans more than 30 years, is headlining Vegfest at Ashton Gate next month in what is sure to be an unmissable show.
Jules has won a string of awards throughout his career and is currently busy touring the world, after completing a successful residency at Sankeys in Ibiza last summer.

He's widely looked upon as being one of the most well-respected figures in dance music and was previously voted the world's number one DJ by Mixmag. He also hosts a weekly radio show called The Global Warm Up, which notches up 750,000 downloads every single week via his podcast and is broadcast on more than 80 stations across the world.
His booking at Vegfest is a major coup for the vegan festival, which has experienced a great deal of uncertainty during recent months.
Founder Tim Barford announced at Vegfest 2017 that the festival would not return in 2018, owing to a hike in rent costs at its previous Harbourside location by Bristol City Council, but organisers and the council managed to strike a deal to host the festival at Ashton Gate Stadium instead this year.
The festival will host more than 220 fully vegan stalls and will take place indoors, so people can sit in Ashton Gate's stands and enjoy their food.
Vegfest 2018 will take place at Ashton Gate on May 26-27. Visit the Vegfest website to buy tickets.
The Egyptian striker is currently on top of the world, having scored another two goals this evening, in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Roma.
Last Sunday the Professional Footballers' Association named the best players of the season, with Egyptian striker Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) being awarded the Player of the Year title, with Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne coming second.
Salah, 25, and De Bruyne, 26, have something in common: they were both rejected by Mourinho when he had them at Chelsea.
Both are now worth at least three times what they were then. Lukaku is another player who Mourinho failed to get the best out of, and who now is one of the big names in the Premier League.
Salah never figured in Mou's plans
When Mou returned to Chelsea in June 2013, De Bruyne and Lukaku were already there. Six months later Salah joined, from Basel.
But the Egyptian never figured in Mourinho's plans, playing just 13 games in all competitions. At the end of the season, Salah was sent on loan to Fiorentina, and then sold to Roma for 12.5 million euros.
A year later Liverpool stumped up 50 million for him. Today... who knows what he's actually worth (add on a fair amount for his two goals and two assists against Roma in the Champions League semi-final first leg).
Mourinho said De Bruyne would be part of his team when he joined. Six months later he sold the player to Wolfsburg for 20 million euros. A good bit of business for the German club, who then sold him to Manchester City for 62 million euros.
Chelsea sold Lukaku to Everton for 30 million; last summer Manchester United, coached by none other than Mourinho, shelled out 103 million euros for him...
Nile Rodgers, cofounder of Chic and a legendary producer and songwriter, has few peers in today's music world: He co-wrote “We Are Family,” “Le Freak” and “Good Times,” the song that essentially created the backbone of hip-hop when interpolated by the Sugarhill Gang; he's produced massive albums and songs by Madonna, David Bowie, Diana Ross, Duran Duran, INXS, the B-52s and collaborated with Daft Punk (on the Grammy-winning “Get Lucky”) Pharrell, Disclosure, Lady Gaga and dozens and dozens of others.
He also worked extensively and was close friends with DJ and artist Avicii — who died of undisclosed causes Friday at the age of just 28 — although just one song has emerged, 2013's “Lay Me Down,” which was sung by Adam Lambert.
Fresh from two sets with Chic at Coachella and just ahead of his annual We Are Family Foundation benefit in New York on Friday — and with a new Chic album coming later this year — Rodgers (pictured above, far right, with Avicii (center) and Incubus guitarist/co-writer Mike Einziger) talked with Variety about his friend.
How did you and Avicii first meet?
I first met him at Radio City Music Hall [in 2012] — somebody said I should check it out. I pretty much know people at every venue in New York, even if I don't have a ticket people think if I walk up, “Oh Nile's here, he must be playing with that guy” and just let me in. So they let me in the back door but I hadn't told anyone I was coming, so I'm standing backstage and he hadn't arrived yet so I'm going “What do I do now?” So I hung out with his fans and they were really nice, I was like “Wow, this is so unlike some of the crazier DJ crowds I'm accustomed to,” so I figured if his fans were so nice, I gotta meet this guy.

I watched his set and afterwards I met him and he didn't recognize me right away, so somebody introduced us and he went, “Nile Rodgers! Half of the stuff that I play in my set is his!” We laughed and got along and I said “I'm coming out to LA to work with David Guetta, maybe we could knock out a couple of songs together.”
I went out there and he had his gear set up in the studio and I plugged in my guitar and played one little riff, and right away he asked the notes and he made a beautiful melody out of it, and we were off and running. He was extremely tired that night because he had just come in from Vegas so he ran out of gas early, but I was ready to go. So I called Prince and he said “I want you to meet these girls that I'm managing called King,” so he sent them over and they're extraordinary, and I had just met Adam Lambert, who had hired me to play on his record, and this friend named Russell Graham who's now in Chic was working on “American Idol” — so I put together a supergroup in about ten minutes! We finished the song, and when Tim woke up I said “Check your inbox!” He was like “What the hell? This is amazing!”
We just had that kind of relationship, and we always started from nothing — he would just come in and say “What do you want to do today, Nile?” I might say there's a classical composer named Boccherini, and there's one little passage that I used to play when I was a young classical guitar player, let's turn it into a lick,” and he would interpolate it and turn it into something else – that quick.
How many times did you work together?
It's hard to count the days because they're days in a row. The first time was 2-3 days, the next time was out in the Hamptons for another five days or so, and because things had gone so well with Adam Lambert we had him fly in, and then we did another thing where he rented Jimmy Iovine's studio in Santa Monica, and then one other time. And we did three live gigs together — and that was the last time I saw him, at a live gig about three years ago. That's the heartbreaking incident I talk about where he had told me he was never gonna drink again. I roll backstage and I'm so thrilled to see him, and he was woozy because he had been drinking so much and he hadn't even gone onstage yet. I'm like dude, how can you be that drunk before you even go onstage? But of course I loved him so we were all cool, and I've had my own fair share of drinking problems — I'm clean and sober 24 years in a couple of months. So I get it, and I wasn't gonna preach to him, that's not where I'm coming from. But he's the one who told me he wasn't drinking — that's the story I want people to get straight. I was not telling him not to drink; I know better than that. He was telling me. So I was a little depressed because he had gone on and on in this long diatribe about how he's not drinking, and I get to the show and he's lit! It made me cry because I cared about him so much. He was like my little brother, a young dude, “you're gonna kill this industry if you're doing this at such an early point in your career.”
Did that kill the friendship?
Oh hell no, please, no way. Other people drinking doesn't bother me — it's just the fact that he brought it up to me. If he hadn't said anything and was just enjoying being drunk I would have been fine. It was that he was drunk and said “I have to stop drinking” that I got alarmed, because that means you know something's wrong.
Did he remind you of anyone else you've worked with over the years?
Not really, because most everybody that I work with has a solid musical sense. I would say the artist who melodically remind me of Tim and don't have formal music training would be the B-52s. Typically when they write, they're very melodic (hums “Deadbeat Club”) — sweet and almost nursery rhymey in their cadence quality, and that's what Avicii had. Most people once they learn a little more about music and scales and references to tonal centers and things like that they become intellectually more developed, so that more innocent thing goes away, and it's very hard to keep it once you get smarter and smarter. That's one reason I liked him, he was like this diamond in the rough, the music business never said “You have to do THIS,” he was a young kid writing these songs that everybody can relate to.
It's interesting, Mike from Incubus said the same thing to us about him not losing that innocent quality to his music.
Yeah, that's a great thing that Mike picked up on. When you sit down to work with Avicii, I don't care who you are, he's not intimidated because you're from Incubus or you're Chris Martin from Coldplay — to Tim he was just making music and he was so happy that he was now in this arena. And he knew inherently that he could add something through his beautiful melodies. He really had this thing for melodies, that's a hard thing as you get older.
Just one more question, is there anything you recorded together that hasn't come out?
There are tons! Tons! We would go in in the morning and write 5-6 songs every single time we worked together. I played some stuff for Keith Urban and he said “I would do any of those songs, any of those songs would be a hit.”
Kaela Corraza is hoping to replace negative attitudes with positive ones one T-shirt at a time. She works at a Lethbridge printing shop and decided this year she would give Pink Shirt Day a local spin.
“I figured we could start #bekindyql,” Corraza said. “No one has used that hashtag and on the shirt it says: ‘You can sit with us.'”
She thought a few of her friends would buy the anti-bullying shirts and that would be it, but she has sold hundreds.
The shirts are $15 each and money raised goes to Beauty From the Inside Out. The Lethbridge-based program teaches girls confidence, self respect and leadership. A spot in the program costs $500 per girl.

“To have (money raised) going to sponsor the young women that attend my program… The schools or families that call me and say: ‘Hey, I want my daughter to be apart of this but I can't afford it…'
“I'm super excited that I have to means and the opportunity to say: ‘Yes, you can because this community loves your kid,” said Ranae Peterson, an organizer with Beauty from the Inside Out.
Corraza had high hopes but the community's response blew her away.
As national anti-bullying day approaches, she is busy printing more shirts.
“My heart is full… It's really good and it's really rewarding,” Corraza said. “I'm excited about the final outcome to see what we as a community can do for this organization.”
Benefits of Bringing Healthcare System Online in Pakistan
Information Technology (IT) has altogether transformed the way, healthcare had been delivered in developing countries like Pakistan. Advancements including online patient records, hospital information system, online support tools, the emergence of health portals and other ways of spreading health-related information to patients and other consumers are affecting the cost, quality, and accessibility to healthcare.
These transformations in the way healthcare is being provided are creating new room for innovative applications of information. With every new innovation, the plan is to achieve the best outcome at the lowest cost – as it is high time to move away from a health-care system organized around what physicians do and toward a patient-centred system organized around what patients need. Let's discuss the benefits that both patients and physicians can achieve by bringing the healthcare system online.
For Patients
The idea of bringing the entire healthcare system online is beneficial for patients to find a doctor at (https://www.marham.pk/) in number of ways including:
Real-time access to healthcare providers, physicians and specialists from home or work without compromising on patient's privacy.

Rome
Rome's populist mayor has called for a moratorium on new migrants arriving in the city, warning that setting up additional reception centers risked sparking explosive social tensions in the capital.
In the most significant challenge yet to the center-left Italian government's policy of distributing across the country the thousands of migrants arriving at southern ports, Virginia Raggi said it was “time to listen to the citizens of Rome.”
“We cannot permit the creation of more social tensions,” Raggi, a member of the populist Five-Star Movement, wrote on her Facebook page.
“That is why I am saying it is impossible, risky even, to think about creating any new reception structures.”
Her appeal is likely to fall on deaf ears. The ministry is asking all Italian municipalities to expand their reception facilities for the expected arrival of around 250,000 migrants over the course of 2017, compared with 181,436 last year.
With existing facilities jammed full, Italy is dealing with a mounting backlog of recently-arrived migrants as a result of neighboring states tightening their borders, making it harder for new arrivals to reach preferred destinations in northern Europe.
As of Monday, Italy had registered 61,903 new migrants in 2017, up from 52,275 in the same period of 2016. Arrivals generally peak over the summer months when sea conditions make it easier for traffickers to launch boats from Libya.
More than half a million people from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East landed in Italy between the start of 2014 and the end of 2016.

Processing records suggest at least 40 percent of them have a valid claim to asylum in Europe or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds.
The others, classified as illegal economic migrants, are liable to be deported but that is often difficult to organize because their countries of origin frequently refuse to take them back
It is not the first time Italy's government has been confronted by a local authority threatening not to take its share of migrants.
Previous challenges have been faced down by threats to cut funding from central government. But Rome's move could inspire other major urban centers to follow suit, particularly in northern Italy, where the anti-immigration Northern League is very influential. Raggi's move came on the same day that Five Star's leader, Beppe Grillo, announced a crackdown on ethnic Roma migrants from Eastern Europe living in makeshift camps in the Rome area.
“Now the music in Rome changes,” Grillo wrote on his blog. “Anyone who declares themselves penniless and drives a luxury car will be out. Anyone who begs in the metro with kids in tow, is out. Surveillance against pickpockets in the metro will be increased.”
Political rivals said Grillo's outburst and Raggi's move represented a tilt to the right in the populists' agenda after the young party's advance stalled in local elections at the weekend. The polls setback cast doubt on its ability to win national power in the next general election, expected in early 2018.
The pressure on Italy's refugee system has been exacerbated by its EU partners reneging on promises to take in asylum seekers under a scheme aimed at relocating 160,000 people from Italy and Greece to other EU states.
As of June 5, only 5,694 people had been relocated from Italy and several eastern European countries are refusing point blank to comply with the scheme. The European Commission on Tuesday began legal action against three of them, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, over the issue.—Agencies

Alleged wife killer Jason Rohde told his wife he wanted a divorce during a fight hours before her death.
That's emerged while he was testifying in his own defence in the Western Cape High Court.
The property mogul is accused of strangling Susan in their hotel room at the Spier Wine Farm in Stellenbosch in July 2016.
He claims she committed suicide by hanging herself.
Susan Rohde had learned about her husband's extra marital affair, a few months after it begun.
Jason Rohde has testified that their relationship deteriorated as a result.
He says his wife insisted on attending a company function at Spier in July 2016, because she wanted to keep him away from his mistress, who was also an employee of the company.
The accused has told the court they constantly argued that weekend and he describes their relationship as tense.
Rohde has testified that he attempted to send his mistress an SMS and that his wife caught him trying to delete it.
He says this resulted in another heated argument in their hotel room, where Rohde claims he told his spouse that he was done with their 23-year marriage.
He has told the court that while he loved his wife, he had 'fallen out of love with her' and wanted to call it quits.

A 50-year-old Muslim man named Shahid Iqbal was beaten in the city of Derby, England, by a couple who appears to be English.
According to Iqbal, woman passenger in his taxi grabbed the steering wheel while refusing to pay a fare of 7 pounds. In fact, the woman asked him to give £80 for her domestic needs which he declined immediately.
Just when he tried to call the police, woman bit his arm and slapped him on the face. Iqbal told that he was beaten by the woman and his partner when he got out of the car.
"I said just pay me and go but she lunged at me. She grabbed my phone and started to bite. Then she went for me again and bit my arm", told Iqbal about the incident.
Iqbal tried to pull out of fight with woman but then her partner took things in his hand and joined the woman in attacking the taxi driver where they punched and kicked the old man.
There were a few people watching the incident but the bystanders didn't react at all. Rather, they recorded the beating on their phones while singing songs.
The bystanders made fun of the Muslim man being beaten by the couple and made its footage.
Meanwhile, Iqbal has decided to leave his job of driving a taxi following the attack and his family is frightened that they will be attacked again.

The Washington Post said choosing a major can bring anxiety to many students and “it's very likely they will change their mind.”
Madison Quinn Baird, a junior studying family and consumer science, was just like many students at BYU-Idaho, trying to figure out what she wanted to do with her life.
Baird would soon discover her prayers could be answered even when it came to her career.
She said she thought a career in the fashion industry did not seem like the best choice for a member of the Church and this worried her.
“I actually wanted to be a fashion designer in high school but I didn't feel like that was an industry that I could go into and keep my Mormon standards at the same time,” Baird said.
She gave up on her dream in the fashion industry and pursued a career in engineering at BYU-I, not really knowing what she would do with that degree.
“I was studying engineering, completely different and I still … didn't like engineering,” Baird said. “I still wanted to be a fashion designer.”
At the time Baird was admitted to BYU-I, there was no program providing a way for Baird's dream to come true. So she waited and forgot about her dream, opting for the next thing she was good at.
“I just completely went a different direction,” Baird said. “I was studying engineering because it was something I was good at and I could make a lot of money. But it just wasn't a good fit for me.”
At this point, Baird did not think her childhood dream career would become a little more solidified until about a year ago when the family and consumer science was brought to BYU-I.
“I was really, really happy when they opened the program here,” Baird said. “I felt it was an answer to prayers for a lot of people that are currently in the major.”
She also expressed a time one of her professors shared an inspiring insight encouraging Baird to pursue her dream again.
“I really did not think I could do that until I heard one of my teachers talking about it,” Baird said. “She was talking about how we need Mormons, like Mormon designers in the fashion industry because there is a lot of people with good morals out there who still want to dress modestly that aren't necessarily Mormons.”
Before the program was established at BYU-I, why did Baird choose BYU-I as her school?
“It's just a really good school and I mean we have to put up with the weather, that's not so great, but the fact that it is such a good school and it is such a good atmosphere makes up for it,” Baird said.
In the past year, Baird has had the experience to participate in the fashion show hosted here at BYU-I during the fall and winter semesters.
“We get to see our work walking down a runway and it's an incredible experience,” Baird said.
Aside from the fashion show, Baird has also set up a website and an Instagram account dedicated to her career in the hopes of being taken seriously in the industry.
“I needed to be more professional, get business cards and have a website and an Instagram,” Baird said.
Baird is still building her portfolio and currently works on campus at the dance custom shop and has her alterations side business.
It took a while before Baird realized what she would be studying and even when she had already chosen a major, she still changed it.
“Don't give up on your dreams because we have talents for a reason,” Baird said. “God gave us each individual talent and I thought I couldn't use mine and be Mormon at the same time but in fact, it's important for us to use our talents and be a Mormon at the same time because those industries need to be influenced by our faith.”
Upon choosing her major, she had not realized her career could be a medium to project her faith, even in the fashion industry.
“Pick a major that interests you, but allow it and external experiences to help shape, not dictate, your mission in life” The Washington Post said.
Montreal was the hot Canadian real estate market for Chinese nationals last year as interest slipped in Toronto and Vancouver following the introduction of foreign buyers taxes, says a report from a website for buyers of overseas properties.
Juwai.com said Chinese buyers inquired about US$1.45 billion worth of Canadian properties in 2017.
Interest in Montreal grew by 84.5 per cent in 2017 and 43.3 per cent a year earlier.

Consideration of properties in Canada's largest city dropped by 25 per cent in 2017 after nearly doubling between 2015 and 2016.
Vancouver inquiries fell 18 per cent last year after growing by 9.3 per cent the previous year.
Metro Vancouver has had a 15 per cent tax on foreign home purchasers since 2016. The new provincial government hiked the levy to 20 per cent and imposed it in the Victoria and Nanaimo areas, as well as the Fraser Valley and central Okanagan.

A 15 per cent tax was imposed in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area — stretching from the Niagara Region to Peterborough — on buyers who are not citizens, permanent residents or Canadian corporations. In the first month after the tax was imposed in late April, foreign buyers made up 4.7 per cent of home sales in the region, according to Statistics Canada.
A separate report says no additional foreign buyers taxes are expected to be imposed in Canada and Australia this year, and New Zealand is the only major investment destination considering one this year.
Chinese were unfairly blamed for property price increases, the report's authors said, pointing to data that suggested other factors were at play, including historically low interest rates and population growth, said Juwai.
WATCH BELOW: Real estate prices up in Montreal
“After retreating from an exuberant peak in 2016 of US$101.1 billion, Chinese international real estate investment again appears to be on a growth path, although more steady and restrained that what we saw in that golden year,” stated Juwai's Foreign Buyer Restrictions Report 2018-19.
Realtor Mike Donia of Re/Max Realty, who specializes in Asian buyers, says he has not seen any waning interest in Toronto real estate.
“I'm still getting the same amount of calls, the same amount of leads. In fact, even more,” he said in an interview, adding that interest is growing because of anti-Trump sentiment.
The foreign buyers tax had an initial impact on “mom and pop” buyers, but most Chinese will just purchase through a corporation to bypass the penalty, Donia added.
More than half of Chinese buyers considering Canada were motivated to invest for their own use, nearly 26 per cent for investment and 17 per cent for education, said Juwai.

Chinese parents often buy properties for their children studying overseas. Canada is a top education destination for Chinese students, hitting a record 138,467 in 2017 or 28 per cent of the international student population, said the report.
More than 40 per cent of wealthy Chinese buy property abroad to live in. Six in 10 intend to buy overseas properties over the next three years.
Canada is the second most popular emigration destination for high net-worth Chinese, with 64 per cent having already migrated or planning to move overseas.
WATCH BELOW: Increasing real estate prices in Montreal
Nearly ninety per cent of Chinese interest came from 153 cities in China, led by Beijing and Shanghai. Almost seven per cent lived in Canada.
Ontario attracted the most interest with inquiries for US$500 million worth of properties. The top four cities were Toronto, Ottawa, Waterloo and London.
It was followed by British Columbia at US$328 million with Vancouver leading, followed by Victoria, Richmond and Kelowna.

Quebec attracted views of US$112 million of properties. The largest interest was in Montreal and then Lachenaie northeast of Montreal, Laval and Westmount.
Inquiries in Alberta increased almost nine per cent last year, worth US$56 million, after increasing by 223 per cent in 2016.
The most viewed property listing was a Vancouver mansion listed at C$18.8 million, with other property listings ranging in price as low as C$500,000.

If LSU can finally settle on a consistent offensive scheme and come together as a team after an embarrassing start, the Tigers could be very dangerous on the road for Florida, but if the same complacent and energy-lacking team from the last three weeks comes to play, this should be a fairly routine game for the Gators, especially given their strong home-field advantage.
The key for LSU and Florida will be how they can get their offenses going. Given the poor depth on the Tigers' defense, the Gators have a significant advantage there, meaning LSU will be forced to make that up on offense. The Tigers' offense has been in disarray the last two weeks, with offensive coordinator Matt Canada and Orgeron going back and forth between who's calling the plays and struggling with communication during games.
The two coaches of LSU and Florida are similarly feeling the pressure from their passionate fan bases. LSU first-year head coach Ed Orgeron has stumbled to a 3-2 start after another embarrassing loss to division opponent Mississippi State 37-7 in Starkville, leading to questions of Orgeron's firing at the end of the season. Florida head coach Jim McElwain felt similar pressures earlier this season after a flat 33-17 loss to Michigan to begin the season.
As for the actual game itself, both programs couldn't be coming in off of more different games. LSU suffered their most embarrassing loss in over 15 years, snapping their streak of 49 straight non-conference home victories last weekend with a poor 24-21 loss to Sun Belt team Troy at home. Conversely Florida struggled early on this season but has found their offense in some tight games this year, playing their best game of 2017 at home last weekend against Vanderbilt, a 34-28 win.
With the game moved to LSU last year, Florida will host the Tigers the next two seasons. This weekend's game is the premier game in the SEC for week six and is also Florida's homecoming game, something many LSU fans found disrespectful to the Tigers.
Arguably the most fuel to the fire was added just last year when Hurricane Matthew forced Florida to postpone their home game against LSU. Many accused the Gators of being scared of playing the Tigers and after weeks of back-and-forth feuding and name calling between the two programs, the game was rescheduled to be played in Baton Rouge, which Florida ended up winning 16-10 on a goal-line stand.
A few years later after the end of the Tebow-era in Gainesville, one of the greatest games between the Tigers and Gators came in 2010 when a LSU fake field goal run helped Les Miles' team to a first down with 30 seconds left in the game. Fakes would continue to be a theme through this rivalry, as in 2011 LSU punter Brad Wing scored a touchdown on a fake punt run, only for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to overturn it. Again in 2015, LSU faced a late fourth down with the game tied, calling a fake field goal pass to kicker Trent Domingue to score a touchdown, one that stood this time around.
The rivalry began to take shape during 2006-2008, when LSU and Florida won all three national championships those years. In 2006, the legendary jump pass play from Florida great Tim Tebow brought the annual game to new levels. The following year the fire in the game spread to fans as well when Tebow claimed to have received many threatening phone calls and texts from LSU fans, including death threats.
One of the biggest rivalries in the SEC, the cross-division showdown between LSU and Florida remains one of the most interesting games of the season each year, but things have gotten even more heated between these two perennial SEC contenders the last decade.
After a turbulent and exciting first month of the college football season, the road to the College Football Playoff begins to take shape as October hits. Fall is in full swing and after many intriguing non-conference games, the classic rivalries and heavy implications of conference play begin this week. This couldn't be more true than in this high-stakes SEC cross-division game as rivals LSU and Florida face off in their annual matchup, each looking for their best win of the 2017 season.
Welcome to live coverage of the SEC Football! My name is Thomas Cluck, and I am happy to be bringing you play-by-play coverage of LSU vs. Florida here on VAVEL.

Israel will not negotiate with hunger strikers

Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan vowed on Tuesday not to negotiate with hundreds of Palestinian detainees on the second day of a hunger strike led by popular leader Marwan Barghouti.
More than 1,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons launched the hunger strike on Monday, issuing a list of demands ranging from better medical services to access to telephones.
Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoner affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said on Monday that around 1,300 prisoners were on hunger strike and the number could rise.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Club had put the number at 1,500.
A spokesman for the Israel Prisons Service said around 1,100 prisoners started the hunger strike and roughly the same number were believed to be continuing on Tuesday.
Erdan vowed that Israeli authorities would not negotiate with the prisoners and said Barghouti had been moved to another prison and placed in solitary confinement.
"They are terrorists and incarcerated murderers who are getting what they deserve and we have no reason to negotiate with them," Erdan told army radio.
He said Barghouti had been placed in solitary confinement because calling for the hunger strike was against prison rules.
Some 6,500 Palestinians are currently detained by Israel for a range of offences and alleged crimes.
Of those, 62 are women and 300 are minors.
Some 500 are held under administrative detention, which allows for imprisonment without charge.
Palestinian prisoners have mounted repeated hunger strikes, but rarely on such a large scale.
Barghouti's call for the strike has given it added credibility, with the 57-year-old serving five life sentences over his role in the second Palestinian intifada or uprising.
He was convicted of attacks that killed five people.
He is popular among Palestinians, with polls suggesting he could win the Palestinian presidency.
"Decades of experience have proved that Israel's inhumane system of colonial and military occupation aims to break the spirit of prisoners and the nation to which they belong, by inflicting suffering on their bodies, separating them from their families and communities, using humiliating measures to compel subjugation," Barghouti wrote in a New York Times opinion piece.
"In spite of such treatment, we will not surrender to it."

* European stocks open lower * Deutsche Bank, Caixabank, Sabadell down after results * Apple posts record profit, Alphabet disappoints * Eyes on US payrolls data Feb 2 (Reuters) - Welcome to the home for real time coverage of European equity markets brought to you by Reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by Danilo Masoni. Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES DIP AS BANKING RESULTS WEIGH (0811 GMT) It looks like day five of straight losses for European shares, with the STOXX 600 index sliding further in early dealing. Aside from oil & gas, all other sectors are in negative territory, with the disappointing results from Deutsche Bank sending its shares 5 percent lower, while Spain's Caixabank and Sabadell are also among the biggest fallers among banks following earnings. We could see some volatility ahead of U.S. payroll data. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) ***** WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0745 GMT) European shares are set to open flat to slightly lower at the end of a week where rising bond yields and strength in the euro have pushed the STOXX 600 benchmark down around 1.7 percent. That is already the biggest one-week loss since early November when a slowdown in earnings growth and similar bond market jitters weighed. Futures were trading between flat and a fall of 0.2 percent. Tech stocks will be in focus after U.S. internet giants released their earning updates yesterday with a record profit at Amazon possibly boosting shares in companies like Zalando, while shares in semiconductor companies like AMS, Dialog Semi, and IQE are expected to open lower after Apple issued a light guidance and reported it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street had expected. There is a raft of results in Europe too that will keep investors busy. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed. Deutsche Bank shares are indicated down 4 percent after the German lender reported a bigger than expected net loss for 2017, which could test a strong rally in banking stocks seen so far this year which was fuelled by expectations over tighter monetary policy and strong economic growth. (Danilo Masoni) **** EARLY MORNING EUROPEAN HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0738 GMT) Lots of earnings today, here's what's jumped out so far: Deutsche Bank posts third consecutive annual loss in 2017 Spain's Caixabank Q4 profit falls 70 pct from Q3 Spain's Sabadell Q4 net profit more than doubles on one-off sales Danske Bank beats Q4 pretax expectations, expects lower 2018 net result Nordea banking group to list Finnish unit on Scandinavian exchanges Philips Lighting Q4 earnings beat estimates on cost cutting Tyre maker Nokian Q4 profit up 13 pct yr/yr Tools maker Husqvarna Q4 result, dividend better than expected Aker BP Q4 core profit lags market expectations Fortum Q4 profit jumps 57 pct yr/yr Tele2 says will aim to grow dividends, Q4 core profit matches forecasts Hexpol Q4 operating profit matches forecast​ Cevian Capital raises Ericsson stake to 5 pct of votes Spanish property developer Metrovacesa cuts listing price AirAsia CEO says looking at Boeing 787 for AirAsia X fleet growth AstraZeneca flags return to drug sales growth in 2018 Britain's BT says on track for year after Q3 meets its expectations Cobham sells communications units to Viavi for $455 million​ Doorstep lender Provident Financial names new CEO Satellite company Avanti appoints new CEO​ EU clearing house system passes stress test (Kit Rees) ***** BUT FUTURES POINT TO STEADY OPEN FOR EUROPEAN SHARES (0702 GMT) Contrary to earlier calls from financial spread-betters, European stock index futures have opened with slight gains, indicating this week's sell-off could ease somewhat. The STOXX 600 is down around 1.8 percent so far this week, set for its biggest weekly loss since November Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) ***** DEUTSCHE BANK POSTS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED LOSS (0643 GMT) Banks, recently buoyed by rising bond yields and optimism about economic growth, could be in focus today after the DAX-listed heavyweight lender disappointed analyst expectations with a 2017 loss of 497 million euros in 2017. (Danilo Masoni) ***** MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO EXTEND LOSING STREAK (0630 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. Rising bond yields and a stronger euro are likely to put European shares under pressure for a fifth day in a row, one day after the export oriented German DAX index fell 1.4 percent - its biggest one-day loss since early November. Over in Asia, the euro neared multi-year peaks as talk of policy tightening in Europe and expectations that inflation is set to gear higher drove up borrowing costs globally, a move that sparked a sell-off in Asian equities. Later in the day the focus will be the U.S. payrolls report. "Anticipation is elevated after a hawkish FOMC meeting... A strong number may increase the probability of four rate hikes this year," says Credit Suisse in its investment daily note. We'll also be keeping an eye on tech stocks here in Europe after results from big internet companies in the US. "Some anxiety is fuelled by a trend for companies that miss estimates to be penalized... Facebook bucked the trend, forecasting rising ad sales despite a dip in usage. Apple reported record quarterly revenue and profits after the bell, Amazon's results easily beat expectations, but Alphabet disappointed," adds Credit Suisse. Back to Europe, here are your opening calls, courtesy of CMC Markets. FTSE100 is expected to open 5 points lower at 7,485 DAX is expected to open 63 points lower at 12,940 CAC40 is expected to open 9 points lower at 5,445 (Danilo Masoni) ***** (Reporting by Danilo Masoni, Helen Reid, Kit Rees and Julien Ponthus)
If Farhadi's work has a governing theme, it might well be Renoir's great, compassionate insight — memorably stated in his 1939 masterpiece, The Rules of the Game that “everyone has their reasons.” This is as true of Babak, who conveniently withholds his former tenant's history when renting the apartment to Emad and Rana, as it is of their mostly unseen neighbours, whose gossip indirectly leads to the tragedy at hand. And it is surely true of the shamed tenant herself, whose face we never see, but whose possessions remain to bear defiant witness to her own unmistakable humanity.

KARACHI - The Sindh Assembly Wednesday once again witnessed heated debate between the treasury and opposition benches over the proposed budget 2017-18.
Opposition Leader Khwaja Izharul Hassan delivered his budget speech and said that the budget had no relief for the masses and was only a copy and paste of previous year budget.
He also demanded of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take notice of government interference and lack of cooperation in running the local government affairs.
“There are two mayors in Karachi one is an elected and other one is who wanted to become the mayor. The chief minister does not require visiting different parts of the city and review the local uplift projects instead it is the mayor who is responsible for it but the provincial government is not ready to either devolve powers or provide funds to elected mayor,” he added.
He said that out of 411 uplift projects worth Rs 99 billion under local government department, only 10 of them could be completed by June 2017.
He further said that excess amounts were spending on the uplift projects in Karachi than the estimates and the funds were looted in the name of uplift projects for Karachiites.
This is not a government instead it is cruelty that mayor is even deprived of even transfer and posting powers, he said adding that they had moved courts for the LG powers and would now not ask for them and instead would snatch them.
“We did not present our shadow budget for the first time due to non implementation on our shadow budgets in previous years,” he said.
Izhar said that he reject this budget on three points, first this budget is copy and paste of budget 2016-17, two it had raised the rural and urban divide and third there is not even a single rupee benefit for common man in it.
He said that government claims it as a tax free budget instead it had hidden taxes of Rs 26 billion.
“Rs 12 trillion is being spent on local bodies in last years in the province but no change on ground could be seen after this expenditure,” he said adding that a MNA was given a grant of Rs 8.5 million but an MQM MNA who was injured in an armed attack was given nothing.
Similarly a journalist was given a hefty amount but the others were neglected, he claimed.
He said that they admit their mistake that their reconciliation with PPP was a grave mistake and would not repeat that mistake again.
He said that price hike has reached its peak and in such scenario how a labourer with Rs 15,000 minimum wages would run his household. He demanded of the authorities to increase it to Rs 20,000.
Speaking on it, MQM lawmaker Faisal Subzwari said that it was unconstitutional to not give powers to the local bodies representatives and these councils do not come under the domain of the local government minister.
He said that PPP terms itself as democratic but when they staged a sit-in outside CM House in Qaim Ali Shah's period, a case under ATA was registered against them.
He said that the provincial government is asking a big share from federal government under NFC citing more contribution from Karachi but when they demand the same at local level then they are blamed for division in the province.
“If the provincial government is giving grant to the city then it is not their gratefulness instead the city deserves it. “Provincial government recovers over Rs 225 billion from Karachi in terms of provincial taxes but in return what was given was not even 1 percent to the city.
“Agriculture tax is not being implemented and despite improving the situation of the people who pay taxes only amount for departments are increased in budget,” he said.
“We do not discriminate on rural and urban basis instead they should be asked as where billions of those funds that were earmarked for rural Sindh were spent when the standard of life of the people are not improved,” he said.
He said that PPP had done nothing in last nine years for the province and if they would remain in power for next 20 years even then they could not do anything for people due to their lack of interest in improving lives of poor of the province.
Minister for Information Nasir Hussain Shah said that PPP had given land rights and free land to the poor and Asif Ali Zardari had distributed land among poor women.
He said that opposition is worried from the uplift projects carried out by the provincial government because they knew that the people would only vote for the PPP in next election keeping ion view the uplift work it had carried out in Sindh province especially in Karachi.
He said that the provincial government had also included reforms for journalists in the budget and introduced health cards for journalists and photographers.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Nisar Ahmed Khuhro said that Sindh could not be divided until they are alive and Sindh is the gateway of the Pakistan and Karachi is its port city.
“It is regretful that only Karachi is being discussed for revenue generation,' he said.
He said that Sindh was the only province that openly welcomed the migrants from India but now discrimination should not be made on the basis of linguistics in order to increase hatred.
“We will not tolerate any word against the province,” he said adding that it was PPP that raised the provincial share in NFC from 43 percent to 57 percent. He said that it was Musharraf who did not give share of the provinces under NFC and at that time MQM was supporting him.
“They are unable to see progress in the rural areas of the Sindh province,” he said and asked as to whether rural areas are not part of the province. “The province is dependent 70 percent on its agriculture that is in rural areas,” he said adding they also want less urbanization and wanted to improve situation in rural areas to avoid this situation.
Former Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah said that they are ones who had taken initiative in the Karcahi to maintain law and order situation and ultimately due to joint struggle and sacrifices of Rangers and police, peace was ensured in the city after a long period of brutality and massacre.
“We know that there are some people who asked for expelling Rangers from Karachi but we resisted it,” he said. The House was later adjourned for Thursday morning.
NEW YORK-Fashion shows are frequently staged in opulent, grandiose settings, but one designer chose Monday to make her New York catwalk debut on a school bus parked on a snowy street.
Amanda Mehl sent models sashaying down the narrow aisle of a standard American yellow school bus in vertiginous gladiator-style laced-up stiletto boots in school girl cool, all short skirts and hoodies. And where did she choose to park it? Near Fashion Week headquarters, where moments earlier the glitterati had descended for one of the hottest tickets in town: the Monse-Oscar de la Renta show.
Operating on a shoe-string budget, it cost her just $2,000 to rent the bus, buy lighting, heaters and blankets and even to put out brown paper bags with an apple and a carton of juice for guests.
That's a steal compared to the half or quarter of a million dollars that perhaps America's most feted contemporary designer Marc Jacobs told Women's Wear Daily it can cost to stage a catwalk show.
“I also thought it would be really fun, I think the collection really goes with this kind of alternative, fun, retro childhood,” Mehl, an Argentinian-born artist, told AFP. “It's clothes for girls who want to have fun,” she explained. “I like attention, I want people stopping me and talking about my outfit, but its clothes that you feel good in. Bold and fun,” she said.
Guests and photographers squeezed onto the child-sized seats clapping appreciatively and egged on by an MC sitting in the driver's seat who periodically shouted encouragement such as “very nice school outfit.”
The models swung their hips as if walking to impress the boys at the school gates, wearing gothic makeup and hair in pigtails, ponytails of grunge-style mini buns dotted over their head.
The clothes were sexy and playful - cocktail dresses with jewel-colored embellishment, school girl box-pleat skirts in satin, matching camis and quilted pvc jackets.
Straps were inventive - such as an old-fashioned black twisted telephone cord on a little black dress and like those on a backpack.
“I thought it was fun,” said friend and architect Danielle Bokor, one of those who attended the show.
“It was completely different than anything else I've been to and exciting and I wanted to wear everyone of those pieces, I wanted to be one of those cool girls in school!”
“It was dope,” agreed working model Michael Rosario, 21, though he laughed when asked if it brought back fond memories of school.
“You got made fun of if you got in the yellow bus!”
Mehl said she would absolutely be doing another fashion show. But on a bus? “May be. Probably not,” she said.
The memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion had been partially funded by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.
Republicans say a judge should have known that "political actors" were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently and strenuously denied.
Steele's research, according to the memo, "formed an essential part" of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, a firm initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to do opposition research on Trump. Steele didn't begin work on the project until after Democratic groups took over the funding.
The FBI this week expressed "grave concerns" about the memo and called it inaccurate and incomplete. Democrats said it was a set of cherry-picked claims aimed at smearing law enforcement and that releasing the memo would damage law enforcement and intelligence work.
For one, Democrats said Friday that it was misleading and incorrect to say a judge was not told of the potential political motivations of the people paying for Steele's research.
Beyond that, though, the memo confirms the FBI's counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was "triggered" by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and is co-operating with Mueller's investigation.
The timing makes clear that other Trump associates beyond Page, who was part of the election effort for only a short period and was not in Trump's inner circle, had generated law enforcement scrutiny. The memo also omits that Page had been on the FBI's radar a few years earlier than part of a separate counter-intelligence investigation into Russian influence.
The memo focuses on Page, but Democrats on the House committee said "this ignores the inconvenient fact that the investigation did not begin with, or arise from Christopher Steele or the dossier, and that the investigation would persist on the basis of wholly independent evidence had Christopher Steele never entered the picture."
Other details in the memo could also challenge Republican claims of bias. The warrant requested was renewed on three additional occasions, meaning that judges approved it four times. One of the Justice Department officials who signed off on it was Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.
Trump, who lambasted the FBI and Justice Department on Twitter, was asked if he was more likely to fire Rosenstein and if he still had confidence in the official. The president simply said, "You figure that one out."
The memo had been classified because it deals with warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The White House declassified it Friday and sent it to Nunes for immediate release.
That disclosure is extraordinary because it involves details about surveillance of Americans, national security information the government regards as among its most highly classified. The release is likely to further escalate the conflict between the White House and Trump's law enforcement leaders.
Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray had personally lobbied against the memo's disclosure, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent.
The memo's release also comes amid an effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to discredit Mueller's investigation. His probe focuses not only on whether the Trump campaign co-ordinated with Russia but also on whether the president sought to obstruct justice.
Two pilots have filed lawsuits alleging sexual harassment by the billionaire behind LaCroix sparkling water, claiming 82-year-old Nick A. Caporella inappropriately touched them on multiple trips while they were flying with him in the cockpit of his business jet. The allegations by the former employees, both men, were made in lawsuits filed in the past two years in Florida and name both the chief executive and National Beverage Corp. as defendants. Mr. Caporella is the chairman, chief executive and controlling shareholder of National Beverage, which has a market value of $5 billion (U.S.), thanks to surging LaCroix sales.

Mr. Caporella, a rare CEO who also pilots the corporate jet, and the company have denied the allegations in court documents. The suits claim the unwanted touching occurred on more than 30 trips from 2014 to 2016. Glenn Waldman, an attorney for Mr. Caporella and National Beverage, called the allegations false and “scurrilous.” The lawyer said the company's management hired him to conduct an investigation and he determined the allegations were meritless. He said the plaintiffs were targeting the CEO because he is wealthy and in his 80s. Mr. Waldman said he spoke with other pilots who flew with Mr. Caporella and they said they had never seen such behaviour. “I talked to all of the former pilots going back decades,” Mr. Waldman said. “Nothing like this ever happened.”

In court filings, Mr. Caporella and National Beverage denied any inappropriate touching occurred, writing in separate responses to both lawsuits that “any contact would be the equivalent of an innocuous pat on the back or handshake after a completed flight.” In court documents, the company says both pilots left their positions because of poor performance. One lawsuit, filed in December 2016 in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, was settled in January 2018, according to court records. Terms weren't disclosed. The other lawsuit, which was partly dismissed by a federal court citing jurisdiction, was refiled in December 2017 in Circuit Court in Broward County and is pending. Both pilots were hired in recent years to fly as second-in-command alongside Mr. Caporella, whom the company's court documents described as an accomplished pilot. The men were paid by Broad River Aviation Inc., the company that operates the jet used for National Beverage business trips, according to the lawsuits and federal and corporate records. North Carolina state records list Mr. Caporella as Broad River's president. The two pilots complained to executives at the aviation company and National Beverage about Mr. Caporella's alleged inappropriate touching, but the behaviour continued, according to the lawsuits. The pilots' attorney, Lee Schillinger, said Mr. Caporella pays his crew a generous salary. One of his clients had previously been working three jobs to make the salary that Mr. Caporella offered, according to court documents. “He reaches over and grabs his co-pilot,” said Mr. Schillinger. “He's trying to prove that he's in control.”
Mr. Schillinger confirmed one case has been settled. Mr. Waldman said the settlement was “de minimis” and covered “modest wage claims.” He said he reported findings of his investigation to National Beverage's senior management and didn't know if the board had voted on the settlement. “It would be immaterial from a board point of view,” he said.

A spokeswoman for National Beverage referred questions to Mr. Waldman. Mr. Caporella is chairman of National Beverage's five-person board. The business jet, a twin-engine Falcon 2000EX, flew regularly during the period in question from National Beverage's home city of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to destinations including Portsmouth, N.H., Oakland, Calif., and Los Cabos, Mexico, according to federal flight records. The travel matches the dates of trips alleged in the two suits. One lawsuit was filed by pilot Terence Huenefeld and his wife. Mr. Huenefeld, who spent about five months working for Mr. Caporella, accused the CEO of unwanted touching on 18 flights between March and July 2016, according to court documents. The lawsuit alleged Mr. Caporella engaged in “repeated unjustified, unwarranted and uninvited grabbing, rubbing and groping of Terry's leg in a sexual manner, reaching up towards Terry's sexual organs.” Mr. Huenefeld withdrew all of his allegations against Mr. Caporella as part of the settlement, according to a document dated Feb. 2 and provided by Mr. Waldman. Mr. Huenefeld couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Waldman said his investigation into the second lawsuit is ongoing and depositions are scheduled for later this month. The second pilot, Vincent Citrullo, alleged in his lawsuit a similar pattern of behaviour during more than a year flying alongside Mr. Caporella. The lawsuit claims that on 14 flights from March 2014 to July 2015, Mr. Caporella engaged in unwanted touching, including grabbing Mr. Citrullo under his armpit, under his thigh and moving his right hand up Mr. Citrullo's left leg towards his genitals. Reached by phone Tuesday, Mr. Citrullo said he stands by his allegations “100%. It was definitely inappropriate.” National Beverage was a distant competitor to bigger beverage companies until the recent success of LaCroix, a once-sleepy flavoured seltzer brand that has been a hit with consumers as they turn away from diet soft drinks and sugary sodas. National Beverage acquired it in 1996 and successfully relaunched it with neon-colored packaging, targeting Perrier drinkers with a lower-priced alternative. Mr. Caporella, who has run National Beverage since 1985, owns 73.5% of the beverage maker's shares, according to the company's 2017 proxy statement. Under a structure that has been in place for decades, Mr. Caporella and some other top executives aren't direct employees of National Beverage, even as they serve in top positions. They work for a management company, Corporate Management Advisors Inc., that is owned by Mr. Caporella. The management company also owns 20% of the aircraft that National Beverage uses, according to SEC filings. In June, National Beverage changed its corporate charter to give Mr. Caporella more control over its affairs, allowing for the removal of directors without cause and eliminating the need to win minority-shareholder support for a merger or acquisition.

Following the news of her shocking death at 60, Carrie Fisher is being mourned by friends, family, and fans. But now, with the completion of her autopsy announced, there remains uncertainty about what caused the Star Wars actress to die. Always candid about everything from her weight loss struggles to her bipolar disorder to past drug use, Fisher's passing remains something of a mystery, and the “exact cause…is still unclear,” according to the New York Daily News. The death certificate for Carrie revealed that the cause was “not obvious,” which reportedly means that additional testing will need to be performed. However, despite the uncertainty as to the cause, the certificate was released in order to allow her family to begin the funeral services. TMZ reported that the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office performed an autopsy but has “deferred” a conclusion on the cause. After her heart stopped on a plane flight just 15 minutes from landing in Los Angeles, Fisher was transported to the UCLA Medical Center, where she lingered on life support prior to dying. Carrie Fisher was famed for her performance as Princess Leia in ‘Star Wars,' but she also was known as a mental health advocate. [Image by Sascha Steinbach/Getty Images] Scientific American noted that in addition to her success as an actress and writer, Carrie became “a prominent mental health advocate,” famed for her outspoken approach to her bipolar disorder along with drug and alcohol addiction. She recently revealed that she initially was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 24, and finally accepted the diagnosis at 28, “when I overdosed and finally got sober.” She also spoke out about the need to connect with others with the condition. “We have been given a challenging illness, and there is no other option than to meet those challenges.” Noting that there has been speculation that her “substance abuse and struggles with her weight may have contributed” to Carrie's passing, the media outlet pointed out the possibility that her bipolar disorder contributed as well. Several studies have linked bipolar disorder to mortality and cardiovascular disease. However, Santa Monica Observed cited several experts who noted that Fisher's self-confessed past drug addiction may have caused heart damage. The actress admitted taking cocaine and Percodan during the 1970s and 1980s and also confessed that she had used LSD during the filming of the Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back. Dr. Reef Karim, an addiction medicine expert and director of the Control Center in Beverly Hills, described the impact on the body from cocaine use. “Cocaine use can cause long term cardiovascular problems that can be acute such as arrhythmias or irregularities on how the blood is pumped throughout the body.” Dr. Gabe Mirkin also revealed that the use of cocaine can result in “long term muscle damage to the heart,” raising the blood pressure even after the drug is no longer used. In addition, the director of cardiovascular disease prevention at Danbury Hospital, Dr. Harvey Kramer, noted that the use of drugs as well as alcohol abuse can both result in cardiovascular health concerns and worsen any pre-existing conditions. But beyond Carrie's bipolar disorder and substance abuse, the Daily Mail noted that Fisher battled her weight for years, which also could have contributed to her sudden heart failure. Carrie Fisher reportedly struggled with her weight for years. [Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images] In 1976, Carrie “only got the part of Princess Leia” because she agreed she would lose 10 pounds, according to the media outlet. She also spoke recently about her feelings regarding her body. “I have serious body dysmorphia issues. But I must admit being somewhat proud looking back at…photos.” The Daily Mail described Fisher's life as “haunted by weight loss and body issues,” noting that she admitted in 2011 that she detested “wearing big clothes.” Moreover, when the actress once again took on the role of Leia for 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, she was reportedly told to lose 35 pounds prior to filming. “They don't want to hire all of me, only about three-quarters,” stated Carrie in an interview. “Nothing changes, it's an appearance-driven thing.” Fisher called the pressure to lose weight “so messed up,” comparing it to being ordered to “get younger” because it was just as challenging. “I'm in a business where the only thing that matters is weight and appearance.” New research has revealed that losing and gaining repeatedly, sometimes known as yo-yo dieting, can have “negative effects on your heart,” reported Medical News Today. The new study revealed that yo-yo dieting can boost the risk of dying from heart disease among older women, including those who are at a “normal weight.” These women who repeatedly gained and lost were 3.5 times more likely to die from sudden cardiac arrest than the women whose weight stayed the same, according to the new research.

Prince's Family Files Wrongful Death Suit Against Hospital, Pharmacy Chain
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images
Prince's heirs have filed a wrongful death suit against the drug-store chain Walgreens and an Illinois hospital where the singer was treated, then released, the week before his fatal overdose in 2016.
Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic reports that attorneys representing Prince's estate allege that Trinity Medical Center, in Moline, Illinois, where Prince's plane made an emergency landing on April 15, 2016, failed to appropriately diagnose and treat his overdose.
The singer was given two doses of Naloxone, a drug designed to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.
Prince died on April 21 at age 57. He was found unresponsive at his home in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen. The suit alleges his death was a direct result of the inadequate care he received in Illinois the previous week.
On Thursday, Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said that the two-year investigation into Prince's death concluded that he died after taking a counterfeit Vicodin pill laced with the powerful and dangerous opioid Fentanyl. However, Metz said, investigators were unable to find out how Prince obtained the pills, so there was no evidence to charge anyone.
The lawsuit, filed in Chicago's Cook County, also names Walgreens Co., alleging that pharmacists at two of its Minnesota branches dispensed "prescription medications not valid for a legitimate medical purpose."
Both Walgreens and the hospital parent company declined comment.
As The New York Times reports, "Based on documents related to the criminal investigation released on Friday, prosecutors believe that Prince had likely overdosed [on April 15] on what he believed to be prescription opioids like Vicodin, but were actually black market versions containing the much more powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Authorities determined that, without knowing, Prince most likely took a counterfeit drug containing fentanyl," that resulted in his fatal overdose six days later.
At the hospital, The Associated Press says, "Prince refused medical tests but was asked what drugs he took. Documents show a pill that he had with him, which was marked as Vicodin, was sent to the pharmacy for testing. A hospital pharmacist said it appeared to be Vicodin and returned it to Prince."
"We will have much to say when the time is right," attorney John Goetz, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Prince's family, said in a statement, according to Rolling Stone. "We have client interests to protect at the moment, including our theory of the case. What happened to Prince is happening to families across America. Prince's family wishes, through its investigation, to shed additional light on what happened to Prince. At the same time, further light on the opiate epidemic will hopefully help the fight to save lives. If Prince's death helps save lives, then all was not lost."
Mike Godwin, creator of Godwin's law, has rescinded his own rule for those outraged by vile fascists marching the streets of Virginia, USA, at the weekend.
In other words, it's OK to call these un-American white supremacists exactly what they are: "By all means, compare these shitheads to Nazis. Again and again. I'm with you," Godwin said on Sunday evening.
Godwin's law states that "as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one." The unofficial extension of this is that the first person to bring up Hitler automatically loses the argument.
Godwin created the aphorism in the early 1990s, when he was the first in-house lawyer for the EFF. It was created partly as a humorous aside on bulletin board behavior and partly as an exercise in mimetics and to encourage people to read more history. More than 20 years later it's still cited online.
In the wake of white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, which left one protestor dead and 30 injured, Godwin has, at least in this case, suspended his own law – or, rather, granted permission to break it. This comes after a plea from a fan online for him to respond to the scenes of fascists in America's streets.
"Your adage is invoked so very often to shut down discussions about politics and social issues as soon as any comparisons to Nazism and 1930s Germany are made, but now that videos have surfaced showing the Nazi flag being waved in the Charlottesville parade," one netizen wrote on Godwin's Facebook page.
"Sir, would you please make a public statement? I've noted before that sometimes sheer irony can pierce to the heart of an argument, to deflate the opposing side."
The attorney's response was quick and to the point. When talking about white supremacists and their supporters, the four-letter N word is back in play.
By all means, compare these shitheads to Nazis. Again and again. I'm with you. — Mike Godwin (@sfmnemonic) August 14, 2017
Certainly anyone watching the weekend's rallies in Charlottesville would have difficulty not describing the protestors as Nazis – given the swastikas and Heil Hitler salutes on display. While the marchers themselves prefer terms like alt-right or true patriots, it's clear the rest of the country and world would rather call a spade a spade when they see neo-Nazis march. ®

The shopping complex where Abbotsford police Const. John Davidson was shot and killed in the line of duty on Nov. 6 now has a permanent memorial to the officer.
After memorial services for Davidson that drew thousands of people, staff at the Sun Life Financial branch in the shopping complex along Mt. Lehman Road wanted to know how best to honour his memory.
Staff there reached out to their landlord to see if there was anything they could do.
Coverage of Const. John Davidson's memorial on Globalnews.ca:
They chose to dedicate a spot in their lot as “police only parking” and put up a sign with Davidson's badge numbers from when he served in Canada and the U.K.
“We didn't know what we wanted to do, but we knew we wanted to keep something in his memory,” said Bam Sidhu, manager at Sun Life Financial.
“We as an office reached out to the landlord and he graciously said, ‘yeah, by all means.' We spoke to [Sgt. Judy] Bird at the [Abbotsford Police Department (APD)] and they were in full agreement of doing something.”
The APD and the shopping complex had numerous conversations about a memorial for Davidson, but Bird said police had little input in the project.

“They gave us some ideas and they wanted to know what would represent John and if we had any suggestions so we tossed some suggestions back and forth between the two of us, but ultimately what you see is their design,” Bird said.
“We're honoured that they would even consider doing something like that.”
Pumpkin pros from around the state have spent months getting ready for this moment. From the start with pollination to the final moment of weighing, these giants will be celebrated and weighed for the grand prize of $1500 on October 14 from 10am – 3pm at the Fort Collins Nursery.
“The giant pumpkin weigh-off at Fort Collins nursery is one of the best in all of Colorado. I look forward to the event every fall, with its great prize money payout, games for the kids, and amazing food trucks,” said Pete Mohr, President of the Northern Colorado Giant Pumpkin. “Seeing giant pumpkins over 1,000 pounds always puts a huge smile on my face.” Mohr is a Fort Collins Nursery Giant Pumpkin Weigh-Off champion.
Colorado state record holder Joe Scherber was last year's contest winner with a monster pumpkin weighing in at a whopping 1,410 lbs. He holds the Colorado state record at 1,685.5 pounds.
The largest pumpkin in the world weighed in at 2,624.6 pounds in 2016, according to http://giantpumpkin.com. Also according to the site, the pumpkin was the first one ton vegetable in 2012 at 2009.0 pounds.
“I've always enjoyed the more absurd corners of horticulture, and it doesn't get much more absurd and fun than giant pumpkins. When you're a kid, there's something magical about encountering a pumpkin that is literally big enough to shelter you and a few friends,” said Jesse Eastman, Owner/GM of Fort Collins Nursery. “With our focus on getting kids excited about gardening, hosting this contest was a no-brainer.”
In its 9th year, the weigh off features $3500 in cash prizes along with events throughout the day.
“Even as an adult, it is hard to wrap your mind around just how massive these things really are, and that kind of surprise and awe is such a great experience that I love sharing with my community,” said Eastman.
For the kids, there will be face painting, pumpkin bowling and unicorn pony cart rides around the nursery from 11:30-2:30. Adults will enjoy yard games, great food from Schmickels Hot Dog Cart and a beer tent with proceeds benefiting community radio station, KRFC 88.9. KRFC will also provide the tunes with a local/fall inspired play list.

Customers of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company will begin to see the financial benefits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act beginning in March.
The two utilities announced today that they will file a unanimous settlement agreement with the Kentucky Public Service Commission requesting approval to return tax savings to customers this spring.
If approved by the commission, customers would see nearly $180 million in savings in the form of a reduction on the Environmental Surcharge line item on their bill in March, followed by a new line item credit on the bill based on energy consumption starting in April.
Kentucky, which opened the proceeding on the tax changes in late December, was one of the first regulatory commissions to take action and begin a process that would allow utilities to return the savings to customers as soon as possible.
“We had been supportive of the Tax Act all along because of the savings for our residential and business customers, so we are pleased that the commission acted quickly to enable us to deliver these savings so expeditiously. The other parties to this case — the Kentucky Attorney General and the Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers — truly had the customer in mind and a willingness to work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution,” said Kent Blake, chief financial officer at LG&E and KU. “With the colder-than-average winter, and subsequent high energy use, these savings will come at a key time for our customers.”
“This settlement is important for Kentucky's industrial customers and the economic advancement of our state,” said Mike Kurtz, attorney for the Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers. “We appreciate the initiative in the plan that LG&E and KU outlined, the willingness of the parties to negotiate, and the commission's expediency that has enabled us to be in a place where we could be able to put these savings back into the Kentucky economy in a timely manner.”
The settlement is subject to KPSC approval, but if approved, KU customers will receive an estimated $91 million in savings. For a residential customer using an average of 1,179 Kwh per month, that is about a 5.3 percent bill reduction.
LG&E customers will receive an estimated $86 million in savings. For a LG&E residential electric customer using an average of 957 Kwh per month, that equates to a roughly 5.6 percent bill reduction. For a LG&E residential gas customer using an average of 55 Ccf per month that equates to approximately a 3 percent bill reduction.
As the vacation rental sector heats up — with Airbnb making even more moves to expand its portfolio of services to include multiple tiers of rentals — there's going to be more and more of a need for people who manage a large number of properties.
Guesty is one service that aims to do that, and today a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission notes that it's raised $19.75 million in a new Series B round of financing. While Airbnb may be the dominant home vacation rental service, there are others like VRBO, and managing those properties across multiple different platforms could require handling all of that information in something more analog like an Excel sheet. It's a kind of CRM tool for property management, ranging from tracking guest check-ins to the amount of revenue a property owner. Guesty also helps property owners by providing tools to manage operations beyond just the tracking.
Airbnb earlier this year started rolling out more tiers of home categories that are geared toward different kinds of travelers. That included high-end tiers called Airbnb Plus and Beyond by Airbnb. While these new categories potentially offer a more granular set of choices for consumers, it might make managing those properties a little more difficult — especially if it's across multiple different services like Airbnb and VRBO, or even more analog channels. Tools like Guesty can help owners of multiple different properties (that might span multiple tiers) turn those homes into an actual business.
There are also plenty of platforms that are looking for additional services for people managing multiple properties on vacation rental sites. There are startups like Beyond Pricing, which look to help property managers figure out how to best price their homes. Airbnb has its own pricing algorithms, but there's clear demand for tools that cross multiple platforms. Guesty was party of Y Combinator's winter 2014 class, and raised $3 million in May last year.
While Airbnb continues to try to expand into new categories and offer homeowners a way to rent out their homes — or for owners of multiple properties to run a side business — it's not the only approach to vacation rentals. One startup, Selina, is looking to convert existing properties into kinds of campuses that cater to different tiers of travelers, ranging from travelers looking to stay in a hostel to ones that are willing to pay for their own rooms. Selina earlier this month said it raised $95 million. Selina is more of a hotel-ish model as it expands from geography to geography, but it also shows that there's demand for an experience that can cater to a wide variety of guests.

Tokyo—Nintendo Co. is bringing together the magnetic appeal of Pokémon, smartphones and the Switch console into an interlinked gaming experience. Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu and Pokémon: Let's Go Eevee were unveiled by the Kyoto-based video-game maker on Wednesday. They're designed to capitalize on the blockbuster success of the Pokémon Go smartphone game and a solid year of sales for the Switch tablet-hybrid gaming machine. The two new games go on sale Nov. 16 at $70 apiece.

Nintendo is betting it can entice mobile gamers to buy Switch consoles and continue strong sales of the tablet-hybrid gaming machine into its second year. Along with a new Switch controller in the shape of a Poke Ball, the variety of gaming scenarios involving different gadgets and games might risk befuddling many adults, but will make perfect sense to kids and Pokemon-generation gamers. The unified gaming experience is straight out of Nintendo's playbook, encouraging people to move around and get physical. Investors cheered the news, sending the shares up 4.3 per cent in Tokyo. “It's right for Nintendo to aim to connect smartphone and Switch Pokémon players,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Markit. “Inevitably some prospective buyers will be put off by the price, but I still expect this to drive sales over the holiday season.” Read More:

Switch sales give Nintendo a boost as company taps new president Nintendo unveils Labo, DIY cardboard accessories for the Switch console Nintendo's billion-dollar future may lie in cardboard The two new titles are based on a Pokémon game released for the Nintendo Game Boy in the late 1990s. Players can catch and train Pokémon then transfer them between the Switch and Pokémon Go on their phones. While the titles are multiplayer and feature high-end graphics, they don't have a sophisticated combat system and lack other features, which led to some fans expressing their frustration on social media. Anticipating the backlash, Nintendo also announced a more ambitious and “completely new” Pokémon game in the second half of 2019. Although details are scarce, the new game will focus more on the Switch as a portable hand-held device, while the just-announced games are designed with home gaming in mind.
“These games really combine the broad appeal of Pokémon Go with the functionality offered by Nintendo Switch,” said Junichi Masuda, an executive at Game Freak Inc., the developer of the games announced on Wednesday. “They allow an easy to pick-up-and-play experience for players who are new to our Pokémon RPGs, while also providing a fresh experience for long-time fans of the series.” Analysts were impressed by Nintendo's aggressive release schedule, with many not expecting back-to-back new Pokémon games in both 2018 and 2019. “The event was better than expected because of the surprises: the Poke Ball, the rapid launch of the free-to-play game, and the early announcement of the 2019 title,” said Serkan Toto, founder of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games Inc.

The Pokémon franchise has been around for two decades, and includes trading cards, arcade games, anime and manga series, as well as titles for Nintendo's hand-held games and consoles. Nintendo's partnership with Pokémon is deep. The firm behind the franchise, Pokémon Co., is partly owned by Nintendo, Game Freak and another company called Creatures Inc., which all own the rights to the brand. More than 800 million people have downloaded the Pokémon Go smartphone app and 65 million play it monthly, while 17.8 million Switch units have been sold since it went on sale in 2017. Switch sales will probably benefit, and analysts are already predicting that Nintendo will surpass its target of selling 20 million consoles in the year through March 2019. Nintendo also unveiled the $60 Poke Ball Plus, a controller for the Switch that vibrates and lights up in the same way that Poke Balls behave in the Pokémon world, where the spheres are used to store Pocket Monsters. They're designed to be used during gameplay, and so that people can carry their Pokémon around with them. Nintendo for now only announced prices and release date for Japan. This year's titles won't include any online features, and are focused on face-to-face multiplayer gaming. That could be disappointing, given that Nintendo is planning to roll out its Switch online service in September. Also on Wednesday, Pokémon unveiled Pokémon Quest, a free-to-play game that will be released right away for the Switch and by at the end of June for smartphones. Described by the company as a “rambunctious action-adventure RPG,” the title offers simplified gameplay of hunting for treasure that is used to upgrade Pokémon, and then taking a team to battle other Pokémon in the wild.

Are you feeling drift compatible? Because the first trailer has arrived for Pacific Rim Uprising, Legendary and Universal's upcoming sequel starring John Boyega as Jake Pentecost, son of Idris Elba‘s Pacific Rim hero, who's following in his father's footsteps as a Jaeger pilot.
Directed by Daredevil‘s Stephen S. DeKnight, the sequel to Guillermo del Toro‘s 2013 movie will introduce a whole new league of Jaegers to battle the Kaiju threat, fully equipped with trading card-worthy names like Gipsy Avenger, Bracer Phoenix, Saber Athena, Titan Redeemer and Guardian Bravo.
As someone who really enjoyed the first Pacific Rim, it pains me to say this sequel looks kind of terrible. The inherent premise of Pacific Rim—giant robots fighting giant monsters—gave way to cliche and derivativeness, but Guillermo del Toro sidestepped those two pitfalls for the most part, keeping the film fresh, unique, and emotionally genuine. This follow-up, however—from the aesthetic to the story—feels like a bad Transformers ripoff with some Power Rangers sprinkled in for good fun. Everything is overlit, there's no weight to the designs, and even the camera work looks like Michael Bay. There's always the possibility that this is just a poor trailer, but man, this has really hampered my enthusiasm for this follow-up.

Apple Inc. isn't ready to take on the titans of TV — at least not yet.
The company is wading slowly into the business of producing original television shows, a cautious approach that seems to belie the ethos of the tech giant famous for its game-changing innovations from the smartphone to the tablet computer.
Apple is planning to start with just two shows exclusive to the Apple Music service. “Carpool Karaoke” — a spinoff of a segment on CBS' “Late, Late Show” that has become a viral sensation — will debut in April. Apple later will add “Planet of the Apps,” a contest-reality show, in which would-be entrepreneurs pitch their concepts for new mobile apps with the hope of winning funding.
Many in the TV industry were expecting the Cupertino, Calif., company to use its clout to immediately challenge the heavyweights of premium TV, including Netflix, Amazon.com, HBO and Showtime.
But Apple plans to begin with small bites.
“Look, we are just starting out,” Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said Monday night at the Code Media conference in Dana Point, trying to downplay expectations.
“These shows bring something to customers that they haven't seen before,” Cue said. “We are trying to do things that are unique and cultural.”
Apple has flirted with the notion of playing a starring role in television several times, only to retreat in the face of roadblocks or opt for smaller and more surgical moves. The tech company plans to use the original productions as a way to attract and retain users of its Apple Music service.
The TV shows will help differentiate the service from Spotify, Google Music Play and other subscription services. “We think video can be a very important part of Apple Music,” Cue said.
Apple, he said, is hoping to field shows that are relevant to pop culture. The two new shows that will debut this spring are loaded with celebrities: Will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba will serve as the mentor judges on “Planet of the Apps.”
“Carpool Karaoke” will bring together unlikely celebrities to spend time together and sing karaoke. CBS' “Late, Late Show” host James Corden, who turned the sketch into a popular feature on his TV show and YouTube, will appear in only a handful of the episodes for the Apple series.
Still, at the Orange County conference sponsored by Vox Media, some members of the audience seemed skeptical about Apple's strategy.
Cue was asked why Apple didn't just go out and buy an entertainment company or blow up the TV industry by offering existing TV channels a la carte rather than in a big bundle.
But Cue didn't take the bait, and instead promoted the two shows.
“This is new for us. We've never done anything like it before,” Cue said, at one point adding, “We know what we don't know.”
He said the two shows probably would be the first of many original shows for Apple. “But how fast, and how much, remains to be seen,” he said.
“Planet of the Apps” comes from Propagate Content, the TV studio managed by former NBC Entertainment Chairman Ben Silverman and his longtime business partner, Howard Owens.
About two years ago, the two executives, along with Will.i.am, were pitching the show to the big broadcast networks. The unscripted show takes a Silicon Valley twist on ABC's “Shark Tank,” in which would-be inventors pitch their projects to potential investors.
Before making a deal with one of the networks, Will.i.am brought the concept to the Apple executives, who also were intrigued and eventually bought the show. It is expected to be different from a TV series because it will have interactive components. For example, viewers can pause the program to learn more about the contestants or various elements of the app development process.
Silverman said he was happy with the outcome.
“A show about apps doesn't work unless you are partnering with Apple,” Silverman said. “And it will also be an app, which is very meta and cool.”

Auston Matthews scores his second of the game, this one in overtime, to lift the Maple Leafs over the Red Wings 5-4 in the Centennial Classic. (0:45)
TORONTO -- At almost the halfway mark, Auston Matthews is on pace to finish with one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history.
The Toronto Maple Leafs' 19-year-old star scored twice, including the overtime winner, in Sunday's Centennial Classic and leads all first-year players with 20 goals and 32 points through 36 games.
The No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft is on pace for 46 goals, a mark reached by only six rookies in NHL history -- Alex Ovechkin the most recent in a mostly Hall of Fame group that includes Teemu Selanne (76), Mike Bossy (53), Wayne Gretzky (51), Joe Nieuwendyk (51) and Blair MacDonald, who was 26 years old when he tallied 46 for Edmonton.
Editor's Picks Auston Matthews rises to Centennial Classic occasion The kid from Scottsdale, Arizona, looked right at home in his first outdoor NHL game. And Auston Matthews and the rapidly maturing Maple Leafs might just have hit fast-forward on their rebuild.
Matthews accomplishing the feat might be more impressive.
Everyone on that group, save Gretzky, was older than Matthews as a rookie.
And Matthews is performing in an era when the goalies are much better and scoring is down substantially.
When Selanne tallied 76 goals for the Winnipeg Jets, for example, teams were averaging 3.63 goals per game with an average save percentage of .885.
Now, the average is 2.73 goals per game with an average save percentage of .914.
Matthews isn't doing most of the scoring on the power play as Ovechkin did with Washington, when power-play opportunities rose substantially amid rule changes following the 2004-05 lockout.
The Russian winger scored 21 of his 52 goals with the man advantage, while adding 28 at even strength.
Ovechkin finished with more than 450 minutes of power-play time. Matthews is on pace for just over 220 with clubs averaging almost three fewer power plays per game.
Matthews is on track for the second-most prolific rookie scoring season at even strength.
He's on pace for 39 even-strength goals, which would trail only Selanne's 52. The Great One had 37.
Eric Lindros, also age 19 for Philadelphia in the `92-93 season, scored 32 goals at even strength in only 61 games, but did so in a league with more offense and power plays and poorer goaltending.
For Matthews to reach these stats in this era at this age, again, makes his potential feats all the more striking.
"I don't think I'm surprised anymore," Zach Hyman, Matthews' season-long linemate, said. "When you have a shot like he does and his skillset, where he's able to get open, and when you take as many shots as he does -- it's hard to get that many shots and he's able to generate tons of shots.
"With his shot, he's going to score a lot of goals."
Matthews, to that point, is again heading toward mostly uncharted waters in terms of the number of shots, averaging 3.7 per game and on pace for more than 300.
Only four rookies in NHL history have had that many shots in a season: Ovechkin with a record 425, Selanne at 387, Dale Hawerchuk at 339 and Brian Leetch at 308.
Matthews doesn't seem to be overly lucky either. He's scoring on 15 percent of his shots, a fairly sustainable number.
"He's got a skillset that allows him to do things that a lot of other people can't do," defenseman Morgan Rielly said. "But on top of that he's got a good brain, he works hard and he's been playing with good teammates."
Perhaps seeking to calm the growing hype, Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock noted that how a Matthews-led line struggled Sunday at points against Detroit's top unit.
Henrik Zetterberg's line struck for three goals when Matthews was on the ice, including the game-tying tally from Anthony Mantha with 1.1 seconds remaining in regulation.
Despite that, Matthews finished at almost 50 percent puck possession.
The Arizona-born center is struggling in the faceoff circle, among the league's worst at 44.2 percent, following a 41 percent performance against the Wings.
Still, Babcock has started matching Matthews against top lines in recent weeks, an uptick in his responsibility for the Leafs.
Babcock protected Matthews in the early months this season by starting him in the offensive zone as much as possible, often against lesser lines and defensive pairings, but that's stopped of late.
Matthews had a 17 percent offensive zone start percentage against the Wings.
"I don't look after him at all anymore," Babcock said.
Beyond the potentially prolific NHL marks, Matthews is also consequently on track to shatter the Leafs rookie records for goals and points; Wendel Clark had 34 goals in `85-86, Peter Ihnacak had 66 points in `82-83.
"He's just going to get better," Babcock said. "He's going to get quicker through the neutral zone. He's going to play with more pace. He's going to understand more. He's just going to get better."
REUTERS - The 3-0 whitewash to India at home was the worst series loss Dinesh Chandimal has ever experienced, Sri Lanka's new test captain has said while apologising to the fans for the team's performance.
Sri Lanka failed to challenge the world's top-ranked test side during the three-match series and the gulf in quality between the two sides was clearly visible.
"This was the toughest series in eight years playing international cricket, no doubt," Chandimal told reporters after his side lost the final test in Pallekele on Monday.
"We were not able to take the games to five days.
"The previous two were four-day tests, and this was a three-day test. Since I've been in this team, this is the worst series loss I've experienced."
Angelo Mathews stepped down as captain last month after Sri Lanka's maiden one-day international series loss to Zimbabwe at home calling it the lowest point of his career.
Chandimal was handed the reins of the test team and led the side to a four-wicket victory in the test against the African side.
The 27-year-old, however, missed the opening test against India in Galle with pneumonia but returned to captain the side in the remaining two matches.
While citing injuries to top players as one of the reasons for Sri Lanka's lacklustre performance, Chandimal said the lack of runs from senior batsmen was a factor as well.
"Consistency has been a huge issue this series," Chandimal said. "Some players cannot perform well in every series. As seniors, you have to do well, and then the youngsters will follow.
"Angelo and I couldn't get amidst the runs, and we take a lot of blame for that. But we were trying very hard in the middle ... and we've been training very hard.
"I have the lot of faith the seniors will come back strongly when we take on Pakistan."
Sri Lanka will next play a full series against Pakistan and the skipper asked the fans to keep supporting the side.
"I want to convey our disappointment to all of our fans," Chandimal said. "To all Sri Lankan fans here and away from home, we are very disappointed about our performance.
"The fans have always supported us. They encourage us always. Although we were losing, people were still applauding us. That is what the team needs now. We cannot let the players be mentally down."

Iowa fans woke up to good weather as they prepared to head out to today's Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida.
The temperature was 69 with mostly clear skies at 10 a.m. There is the possibility of a shower during the game, but the weather otherwise should be clear.
Black and Gold Hawkeye fans have been seen in the Tampa area as well as the nearby beaches. The coldest day of the week came Thursday
during the beach party in Clearwater when it was in the low 60's and windy.
This will be the 31st Outback Bowl today and the fourth time Iowa has participated. The Hawkeyes last appearance was in 2014 when they lost 21-14 to LSU.
It will be the third time they've met Florida in this game. Iowa won 37-17 bin 2004, and the Gators won 31-24 back in 2006.
Kickoff is noon Iowa time.

Living at Water's Edge Might be a Dream Come True
SobelCo, one of South Florida's top builders, started the construction on one its most sought after residential projects, 321 at Water's Edge. A modern 11-story tower, this project was specially designed to be a sophisticated collection of waterfront condominium estates, with 23 exquisitely finished residences, offering between 2,600 and 3,800 square feet of living areas.
Of course, living at Water's Edge is not exactly for everyone, as potential customers will have to pay at least $1.95 million to enjoy one of these stunning waterfront residences. But it's well worth mentioning that four lucky residents will be also allowed to dock their 70′ yacht in a private boat slip, so you'd better hurry up.
Set for completion in the first months of 2019, this project sits on the widest stretch of Fort Lauderdale's Intracoastal Waterway. A few steps away from pristine beaches of Downtown Fort Lauderdale, this project delivers much more than wonderful views and exclusivity. For instance, there are three lavish penthouses, private rooftops, and eight unique home designs you might be interested in.
As you try to make a decision, we're going to share with you more details about this luxurious property. You see, the two-and-three bedroom homes boast oversized floor plans, with open living room layouts and spacious bedrooms, his and her walk-in closets, and many other goodies.
Four private elevators, a private wine club and lounge with a personal wine locker, a catering kitchen, several saunas, and a dog park are all included in this amazing package. It goes without saying that 321 at Water's Edge is the place to be.
Furthermore, this property will also over 7,000 square feet of chic lobby spaces, fashioned by award-winning design firm Interiors by Steven G.; but most of you will appreciate the sky view terrace, the indoor and outdoor poolside lounges, a stunning pool/Jacuzzi overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway, private poolside cabanas, picnic area, an ocean view fitness center, and 24-hour valet attendant as well.
So, do you have that kind of money laying around the house?
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Hendrick Motorsports enjoyed a laser-frenzied, glow-stick-filled evening Thursday night as it unveiled its 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series paint schemes in the ballroom adjacent to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.
The 2018 drivers were all there. As were the inspirations -- Bill Elliott, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. -- for the paint schemes. The sponsor executives were there after a series of meetings earlier in the day, getting pumped for 2018.
And, of course, the merch went on sale online afterward.
But wait a second, don't we still have seven races left in 2017?
"It's far from over -- especially where I'm sitting," seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson said about the 2017 season. "We've got a lot of work to do."
The Hendrick drivers could be forgiven if they've already started thinking about 2018 as the organization has managed just four victories this season thus far. But the two returning drivers, Chase Elliott and Johnson, still are among the 12 finalists for the 2017 Cup title.
Editor's Picks NASCAR Cup 2017: Breaking down the second round playoffs grid Martin Truex Jr. is a pretty safe bet to make it through the NASCAR playoffs' second round, but you never know. With Charlotte, Talladega and Kansas this round, our man breaks down the 12 drivers left vying for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup.
Turn 4: Do we know yet what playoff points will really mean? Is it clear what playoff points really mean yet? Is racing Sunday afternoon at Charlotte a good idea? Is a winless driver on the cusp of a breakthrough? Will Chase Elliott have a Dover loss hangover? Our gang has at it. 1 Related
Granted, they have led a combined 557 of the 8,371 laps this year with a combined 12 top-5s in the 29 races. Those numbers don't exactly scream championship.
While Elliott and Johnson finished 2-3 Sunday at Dover, the 1-mile high-banked concrete track doesn't predict success in future races. There are no 1-mile high-banked tracks, and no concrete tracks, left on the schedule.
The quarterfinal round sandwiches a pair of 1.5-mile tracks (Charlotte this weekend and Kansas in two weeks) around the restrictor-plate roulette of Talladega. The semifinal round features a short track (Martinsville), a 1.5-miler (Texas) and a 1-mile flat oval (Phoenix) before the championship is decided on the 1.5-mile progressively banked oval at Homestead.
"Our speed is up there now, and you just can't make any mistakes and you've just got to be there," team owner Rick Hendrick said. "If we can get there [to Homestead], we can win it.
"We haven't been leading that many laps until Sunday, and we finished second and third and all those [top] guys were there. So, we've just got to keep executing like we did Sunday and see how we end up."
With all that, it would seem that the drivers would want to remain focused on 2017. But the drivers didn't mind a little bit of work on 2018 before they embark on the rest of 2017.
"We had to unveil them at some point, I guess," Johnson said. "This is different -- this is early. From a superstitious standpoint, we'll reserve our opinion until next year and see what happens. ... It's actually nice to have this over and done with.
"I don't have to worry about it during the offseason. So I can spend more time skiing."
Elliott will drive the Elliott family No. 9 next year, and William Byron will move into the No. 24 made famous by Gordon. There was Elliott, hanging with his 2018 paint scheme and number.
"This number feels like home to me, but I do feel like I have an obligation to finish the year out strong in the 24," Elliott said. "It's not only an obligation that I feel like I have because I'm switching numbers but I really want to have success in that car in that number."
Elliott probably would take anything as a distraction over how he lost Sunday at Dover. He saw a four-second lead evaporate at the hands of Kyle Busch, who passed Elliott with a little more than a lap remaining to earn the win.
Johnson and Elliott talked Sunday night about learning from the race and about moving on from it.

"You're never going to forget days like that," said Elliott, winless in 70 career starts. "You're always going to wonder the what-if game and whatnot in your mind and look back into the things that you could have or should have done differently."
Thanks to his three wins, Johnson is fifth in the standings while Elliott is 10th. They likely will need to qualify well and earn some stage points during the second round if they want to advance by points. A win is possible, but Johnson hasn't won since Dover in June, and Elliott still seeks that elusive first win.
"They know they're not in a points position with the stage points to carry themselves through easily and they've got to perform at a high level," said Gordon, who has an ownership stake in the organization. "I think they're ready to step up and do that."
Gordon said Johnson can't be counted out, especially with some of his best tracks coming up, and Elliott gained confidence in leading laps at Dover.
Both Elliott and Johnson indicated they felt they had a strong opening round of the playoffs.
"I think we're doing well," Johnson said. "Of course, we want more speed. Of course, we want to be faster. I think we're off to a good start [in the playoffs]. ... This format, in general, doesn't suit us.
"But we love a challenge and we'll figure it out."

Steven D. McCulley named new Atherton Chief of Police
The Town of Atherton selected Steven D. McCulley as its new Chief of Police following a recruitment process that yielded over 30 applicants and included interviews with four separate community panels and one peer panel plus a second day interview with the City Manager, the Mayor and the Vice Mayor.
Chief McCulley was born in Spokane, Washington, and was raised in the Seattle area. He is a graduate of Washington State University with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Criminal Justice and Sociology. He is also a graduate of the Northwestern University School of Executive Police Staff and Command, the University of Arkansas Rural Executive Management Institute, and the University of Northern Florida Institute of Police Technology and Management School of Administrative Investigations. Chief McCulley has been a well-respected leader and law enforcement professional and executive in Washington State for the past 33 years.
Chief McCulley began his law enforcement career at age 21 becoming a Washington State Patrol (WSP) Trooper. During his WSP career which spanned more than 27 years, he promoted through the ranks and held numerous positions including Criminal Investigations Detective, Detachment Sergeant, Administrative Investigations Sergeant, Criminal Information and Technology Section Commander, Assistant District Field Operations Commander, Homeland Security Assistant Division Commander, the WSP statewide Bomb Squad Commander, and the WSP statewide Rapid Deployment Force Commander.
For the last 6 years Chief McCulley served as the Chief of Police for the City of Snoqualmie, Washington. Concurrently, he also served as the contract law enforcement services Chief of Police for the neighboring City of North Bend, his hometown of the last 25 years. During these six years Chief McCulley worked diligently and improved transparency, accountability, and risk management within the police department and with both communities, ensuring community policing was at the forefront of all police operations.
Chief McCulley and his wife Lynn have been married for 27 years. They have two daughters, Megan and Peyton, who are both graduating from universities in Washington this summer. The Chief and his wife are excited to move to the Bay Area and become part of the Atherton community.
“I was strongly drawn to the Town of Atherton because of the professionalism of the Town management team and the police department's true dedication to a very strong community oriented policing philosophy,” he said. “The department is committed to providing the highest levels of customer service to the residents of Atherton, creating a safe and secure community. ”

While “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” has yet to hit theaters, Marvel has already set James Gunn to return to write and direct a third installment.
Gunn announced the news on his Facebook page on Monday, shortly before embarking on the “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” press tour.
“So, after many months of ruminations and discussions, I know the answer. I could save this answer for the first, random interviewer to ask me during the press junket but instead I thought I'd share it with the most important people in the Guardiansverse – you, the fans, who have been so incredibly supportive and enthusiastic over the past five years, it has moved me to tears on a regular basis,” he wrote. “So, yes, I'm returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.”
More to come…
A new state law went into effect last month requiring public high schools, new drivers and police officers to receive training in how to act during police interactions.
Senate Bill 30, which was proposed shortly after the controversial death of Sandra Bland, is designed to aid the growing tension between law enforcement and civilians.
“This is not the silver bullet that will impact the entire relationship between law enforcement and citizens,” state Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, one of the measure's authors, told the Texas Tribune after the proposal of the bill. “But it's a step in the right direction.”
Sam Houston State University is responsible for training officers, but the new legislature is said to have a minimal impact on the university's teachings.
“It's still too early for us to plan exactly what we're going to do,” Dean of the College of Criminal Justice Phillip Lyons said. “Our response to this is likely to be very minimal.”
State driving education programs are set to add police interaction into their curriculum in order to educate young adult drivers on how to behave during a traffic stop. The new instruction for law enforcement is mainly oriented towards wide-level officers, which SHSU does not provide training for. The training requirements stated in Senate Bill 30 are mainly met at police academies.
“The University Police Department will not play a role in this initiative other than the training requirements for our officers,” Director of Emergency Management David Yebra said. “The remainder of requirements of Senate Bill 30 are pre-licensing requirements. We are not involved in licensing drivers and the pre-licensing training requirements.”
Although Senate Bill 30 does not aim to educate college students, UPD is already involved in outreach programs with students and the community. Officers are engaged with fellow Bearkats in a number of different forums, from formal training to one-on-one engagements when out on vehicle or foot patrol.
“I think in general it's a good idea for people to be aware of what to expect at a traffic stop and what their rights are,” Lyons said. “It also never hurts to remind the police of that as well.”
Police interaction courses will become a part of the high school curriculum next fall. Even though students at SHSU will not be required to take any specific interaction courses, the Criminal Justice department is listening to the voice of the student body.
“Our usual approach is we always try and respond to student needs, and if there is a desire from a part of students to learn more about this [interacting with police], then regardless of the legislation we would step up and do that,” Lyons said. “The legislation doesn't really target our students, but as with anything else, if there's a student need we'll help them anyway we can to meet that.

Craig Charles has praised the producers of Coronation Street for standing by him as he struggled to deal with an addiction to crack cocaine.
The 51-year-old actor went through a difficult spell in 2006 when he was cautioned by police for possessing the Class A drug.
Appearing on Jon Bishop's TV show In Conversation With, Craig opened up about his struggles.
And he took time to acknowledge that Corrie producers threw him a lifeline when they suspended him from the show instead of sacking him outright.

“I had a job that I loved and I had enough people who knew what I was like to say, ‘let's care about him, let's get him well, rather than let's sack him',” he explained.
Explaining the reasoning behind his turn to hard drugs, Craig - who is best known by many as a star of iconic Sci Fi comedy Red Dwarf - said it was a response to difficult personal loss.
“When my mum died I got into drugs,” he explained.

"When my dad died, I did again, and it was just a case of… I was stuck in this little flat in Manchester missing my family, working like 14 hours a day, then travelling vast amounts of motorways all the time like that,” he continued.
"So, you know, it was just a way of coping,” he added.
Following his suspension on Corrie in June 2006 he returned to the soap in January 2007.
He played Lloyd Mullaney in the ITV soap and left in 2015.
LIMINGTON, Maine (AP) - Officials have ordered a Maine town's fire department to "stand down" because the group's rescue gear is outdated and doesn't meet national standards.
The Portland Press Herald reports the Limington Board of Selectmen released a statement Sunday explaining that the Limington fire department's gear is more than 10 years old, and it doesn't meet the National Fire Protection Association's standard. The standard is required for safety concerns and applies to jackets, pants, helmets and boots.
Officials say they recently discovered the gear exceeded the "mandatory retirement age."
Nearby fire departments will help Limington if a fire occurs. Town officials say the fire department will continue to respond to medical emergencies.

TADLEY CALLEVA picked up a single Wessex League point from their two Bank Holiday fixtures that saw teenage winger Andy Trott play a game and a half in goal.
Trott was forced between the sticks midway through Saturday's 1-1 draw at Weymouth Reserves when Tom Hindmarsh turned an ankle.
Tadley were trailing to Conor Jevon's first half goal after Andrew Charsley had seen an early penalty saved by goalkeeper Gabriel Borowski.
But Tadley hit back to earn a point when defender Vasilleias Mellos headed home from skipper Scott Kinge's flick-on following a corner.
Trott had to keep the gloves for Monday's home game with Shaftesbury, who scored a 3-2 win to secure the third promotion place in Division One.
Tadley were two-up inside seven minutes through Brett Denham and Dan Vickers but Dan Finnegan Sean Holohan and substitute Jak Cull took the visitors into the Premier Division in their first season in the competition.
HOUSTON (AP)  J.J. Watt is more than a little antsy.
After not playing football since Sept. 22, the Houston Texans star was more excited than anyone for the start of offseason workouts Monday.
Sure, those workouts were simply conditioning and a chance to reconnect with teammates after the offseason. But after missing games for the first time in his six-year NFL career last season while recovering from back surgery, Watt relished the day.
Youre away from the game for a year, like Ive said many, many times before, it reaffirms how much you love it, how passionate you are about it, how badly you want to go out and play with your teammates and just enjoy the game, Watt said. I cant wait.

Watt, who was NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2014 and 15, missed training camp and Houstons four preseason games after surgery in July to repair a herniated disk. The defensive end started the teams first three regular-season games before reinjuring his back and undergoing season-ending surgery.
Hes healthy now, and although the season is still almost five months away, hes already envisioning being back on the field.
My body feels really good, so Im really looking forward to this whole offseason process and OTAs and just getting back to just playing football, he said. I think thats the biggest thing. I just want to play football. I cant wait to get back out there and play some ball.
Watt is a workout freak and has acknowledged he sometimes would do too much in his preparation for the season at the expense of his health. Now hes learned that such tactics arent healthy and even though he wants to make sure hes ready when the season begins, hes learned to be smarter about his workouts.
I need to make sure that I balance myself and not get overly crazy in the offseason and things like that, he said. So I think its been a really good time for me.
Watt enjoyed watching Houstons defense thrive last year despite his absence. He raved about the work the unit did in finishing the season ranked first in yards allowed. A big factor in the groups success was the emergence of 2014 top overall pick Jadeveon Clowney.
It was a lot of fun to watch, Watt said. He obviously played very well and I think our whole defense played very well, and those guys  it was a lot of fun to watch them play, see them grow throughout the year, see them overcome a lot of adversity.
Though no one questions that Watt has established himself as one of the top defensive players in the NFL, some wonder if hell be the same force who piled up 76 sacks. Watt has heard those whispers following two back surgeries, but doesnt spend any time worrying about what outsiders think about him.
All I can do is give it everything I have every single day, whether its practice, meetings, or film, he said. Im going to give it everything I have. Im going to go out there, Im going to have fun. Im going to play the game the way I know how to play it, with energy, with enthusiasm, with excitement, rallying around teammates, having a lot of fun. Just enjoying football again.

A portion of ocean water in Laguna Beach is closed to swimming, surfing and diving after about 5,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the water Friday.
A buildup of grease blocked a sewage line in the 1100 block of Gaviota Drive, sending raw sewage up through a manhole and into a nearby storm drain, said Anthony Martinez, water quality program manager for the Orange County Health Care Agency.
The agency closed the area between Legion Street and Bluebird Canyon Drive at about 7 p.m. Friday.
The agency plans to reduce the closure area to 500 feet north and south of Brooks Street by Monday afternoon, Martinez said. The entire area could reopen as early as Tuesday, he said.

In what may be the most dramatic mix-up ever, “The Bachelor” contestant Rebekah Martinez — or Bekah M., as she's known on the show — was reported missing in November by her mother. At the time, Martinez was still filming on Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season, where the show's production team requires that contestants hand over their phones.
The erroneous missing person's report was discovered this week, when North Coast Journal posted on its Facebook page asking if readers recognized any of the 35 people listed as missing from Humboldt County on the California Department of Justice website.
Some online pointed out that one of the people was Martinez, who is currently getting national attention as one of Luyendyk's frontrunners, despite their 14-year age difference. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office removed Martinez, 22, from the missing persons list after contacting her and confirming she was not missing.
The paper reported that it was Martinez's mother who reported her absence on Nov. 18, after having not heard from her since Nov. 12. The “Bachelor” contestant had recently moved to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm, according to the Sheriff's Office. On Sept. 17, Martinez had posted on her Instagram “HI ALL I'm giving up my phone and social media for the next several weeks, so if you need to contact me, welll… tough luck!” She next posted on Nov. 22, four days after she was reported missing.
On Tuesday, Martinez tweeted a response to The Journal‘s story, writing “MOM. How many times do I have to tell you I don't get cell service on The Bachelor??” She later joked, “Honestly the scariest thing about this story is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted” and tweeted a photo of herself on a milk carton.

MULTAN-Stringent security arrangements will be made on the occasion of martyrdom day of Hazrat Ali (RA) to maintain sectarian-harmony and law and order in the district.
Chairing a meeting of district peace committee here, Deputy Commissioner Nadir Chattha said that clerics and leaders from all schools of thought would be with the district administration, adding that screening of the routes of all mourning processions as well as Imambargahs had been done. He said that the concerned departments have been issued directives to fix streetlights. He said that police, Rescue 1122, Civil Defence and all other departments would accompany mourning processions.
He disclosed that the security would be put on red alert on the martyrdom day and additional troops would be deployed to keep the route clear. He disclosed that the police have also released a foolproof security plan.
Mayor Naveedul Haq disclosed that the Municipal Corporation staff would start operation against encroachments by tonight while the broken roads on the routes would be repaired. Chairman district council Dewan Abbas Bokhari was also present on the occasion.
Police Khidmat Centre
The district police have set up a Khidmat Centre at Qila Qasim Bagh to offer seven different facilities under one roof.
The one window operation will offer Character Certificate, found and loss report, FIR copy, learner license, tenant registration and vehicle registration facilities to the citizens.
“It's another step towards changing the thana culture. This centre will serve the masses in true sense,” said the CPO Ahsan Younus while briefing the journalists on the new facility. Khidmat Centre is the only of its kind in entire province and it has been established at the spot proposed for a new CPO office.
The CPO told journalists that the district police set up the centre on self help basis with its own funds. Giving details of the functioning of the centre, he said that the citizens coming to the centre would first get a token out of machine installed at the centre and then wait for their turn. He added that the vehicle verification process had been made further transparent and now a picture of chasis number would also be made besides documents. He told the journalists that any resident of Multan living in the precincts of any police station would be able to report loss of his documents at the centre while the character certificate would be sent to the residence of the citizen by courier. “No one will have to visit the centre twice. Similarly, the centre will not ask you to bring any photocopy of any document,” he added.
Admin, police okay security for Youm-e-Ali
KASUR/HAFIZABAD-At least 1,000 policemen will be deployed to ensure foolproof security on Youm-e-Ali (RA) to be observed on 21st of Ramazan, DPO Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said.

He said the police will guard the processions, taken out from 18th to 23rd Ramazan across the district in connection with Youm-e-Ali (RA). The DPO said all available resources will be utilised for the purpose and negligence on the part of officials will not be tolerated.
In Hafizabad, the district administration and police have made foolproof security arrangements to maintain peace in the district on occasion of Youm-i-Ali (RA) to be observed on 21st Ramazan.
Addressing scholars belonging to different schools of thoughts, Acting DC AD Warraich and DPO Dr Ghias Gul appreciated efforts and role of the Ulema in maintaining interfaith-harmony and called upon them to keep vigilant eye on the suspicious character to maintain traditional peace in the district.

Dylann Roof appears at a court hearing in Charleston, S.C., on July 16, 2015. (Grace Beahm/The Post and Courier via AP, Pool)
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - The same jury that last month unanimously found Dylann Roof guilty in the slayings of nine black worshipers at a South Carolina church is returning to court to begin contemplating his punishment.
With the 22-year-old representing himself, the process is sure to be unconventional. But even if Roof is sentenced to death, it's highly unlikely he'd be executed anytime soon.
While prosecutors plan to call up to 38 people related to the nine people killed and three who survived the June 2015 slaughter at a church in Charleston, Roof said last week he plans on calling no witnesses and presenting no evidence.
Roof was found guilty last month on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. A jury took less than three hours to return its verdict, and a judge dismissed the jury for a break over the holidays.
Typically in what's known as the sentencing phase, defense attorneys call relatives and other witnesses to testify about their client's unsteady state of mind before and during the crimes. Given that background, the defense hopes, a jury might be more likely to spare the defendant's life and opt against the death penalty.
But Roof, who is acting as his own attorney, has said he plans to do no such thing.
In his journal, which was read in court during his trial, Roof said he doesn't believe in psychology, which he called “a Jewish invention” that “does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't.”
Roof also seems to be determined to try to keep evidence embarrassing to him or his family out. Not only did he take over his own defense, but he asked the judge at a hearing Wednesday if he could file a motion limiting what prosecutors can introduce.
Roof also was adamant that a transcript of a hearing where he was found mentally competent not be released to the public.
“I know this is not a legal argument, but the unsealing of the competency hearing defeats the purpose of me representing myself,” Roof said at last week's hearing.
Neither Roof, nor U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel nor prosecutors have given specifics on the evidence Roof is objecting to.
On Thursday, Gergel ordered another competency evaluation of Roof “in an abundance of caution,” after his standby counsel filed a sealed motion again questioning Roof's mental ability to proceed. The judge's order specified he saw no reason to delay Tuesday's start of the penalty phase.
On Monday, over the objection of an attorney representing media outlets including The Associated Press, Gergel ordered the competency hearing to be closed to the public. Saying he'd have to sequester jurors if he opened up the proceedings, the judge promised to release a transcript after Roof is sentenced.
“This is an incredibly sensitive moment in this proceeding,” Gergel said. “We are putting in the hands of 12 people the life and death of a person.”
Roof's lawyers tried repeatedly both to stop him from being his own lawyer and to work mental health-related evidence into the first phase of his trial, saying they feared Roof fired them because he feared the attorneys would present evidence that would embarrass him when trying to save his life.
Prosecutors objected at every turn, and Gergel wouldn't allow any of it into court, ruling mitigation evidence is allowable during sentencing and not before.
Court papers show prosecutors are expected to present evidence showing that Roof picked his victims because of their race, killed them to incite more violence, showed no remorse and killed three particularly vulnerable people who were 70 years old or older.
Evidence speaking to Roof's mental state, one expert argues, could make the difference between life and death.
“The Dylann Roof case is a classic example of the type of problem you can have when an obviously mentally ill or emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to represent himself,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “There's a huge difference in the eyes of a jury between someone they perceive as evil or despicable and someone they perceive as being seriously mentally ill. … If you take mental health out of it, you are putting a thumb on the scale of death.”
Both the judge's decision to allow Roof to represent himself and waive the introduction of mental health evidence are sure to be raised in an inevitable appeal, Dunham argued.
Roof also faces nine murder charges in state court, where prosecutors have also said they will seek the death penalty in a trial likely to begin sometime next year.
Whether he's sentenced to death or not, it's unlikely Roof would be executed anytime soon, in either jurisdiction. The federal government hasn't executed anyone since 2003, and there are years of appeals between a death sentence being levied and carried out.
South Carolina's death chamber hasn't been used since 2011, due at least in part to a lack of availability for the drugs the state uses for lethal injection.

A high school in Elmvale is attempting to break a Guinness World Record for the largest game of “knockout” basketball on Thursday.
Students and staff of Elmvale District High School will attempt to break the record with the help of students from surrounding elementary schools including Birchview Dunes Elementary School, Hillsdale Elementary School, Huronia Centennial Elementary School, Minesing Central Public School and Wyevale Central Public School.
Lindsay Burke, a teacher at EDHS, and organizer of the event says the idea sprung from construction annoyances. She explained, “last spring we learned that the construction on EDHS would be starting in the fall so we knew it was going to be a long year without a gym, cafeteria and other parts of the school being torn down. I thought that our students deserved some kind of reward for all the annoyances that the construction would bring.”
The game knockout, commonly known in Canada as “bump,” is an elimination style game which pits two competitors against each other at a time to see who can score a basket first. Burke says that she always loved the game, and thought this would be a great opportunity for the students to band together to accomplish a large goal, while also having some fun.
The world record is currently held by the Dallas Mavericks from Texas, which won a game of over 701 people back in 2015. EDHS will need to beat that turnout, however, Burke is aiming for around 900 participants.

Burke says they are also using this as an opportunity to do good for the community. “Since the event is completely free for all students to attend, we felt it would be a good opportunity for kids to give something back to the community so we asked each student to bring a donation for the Elmvale Food Bank with them,” she says.
The winner of the game of knockout will be awarded eight tickets to watch the Barrie Colts from a private box, and will have their name listed on the Guinness World Records website, should the participation exceed 701 people.
Due to the construction of the school's gym, the event will be held at the Elmvale Community Arena, on April 26 at 9 a.m.
Detectives in Edmonton want to speak with anyone who saw a violent road rage incident on Dec. 17 near 75 Street and 78 Avenue.

11:04 by ENCA Have your say: UPDATE: Grace period in Mugabe assault case
• Editor's note: This article is updated each time new information becomes available.
Jurors in the Bill Cosby sexual assault trial on Wednesday asked to review yet more testimony as deliberations wound down for a third day without a verdict.
After nearly 30 hours of deliberating, the sequestered jury has been unable to come to a unanimous decision on the guilt or innocence of the famed entertainer. They're deciding on three counts of aggravated indecent assault related to a January 2004 incident in which Cosby digitally penetrated Andrea Constand after providing her with unidentified pills.
The jury came back with two requests for Judge Steven T. O'Neill on Wednesday — it wanted to hear again trial testimony from Constand and Richard Schaffer, a police officer from Montgomery County, Pa., who was part of a team that interviewed Cosby in early 2005. Court personnel have been rereading transcripts from the proceedings out loud.
Jurors have now heard replays of testimony concerning details of the night in question from nearly every major angle given in the trial. Earlier in the week, they reviewed a deposition Cosby provided in a civil suit and an interview Constand gave to a police officer in her native Ontario, Canada.
The reread of Schaffer's testimony took a particularly large chunk of Wednesday as the transcript for the 45 minutes of his testimony that the jury requested was still being prepared before it could be read aloud.
At 9 p.m. the judge dismissed the jury. “It's been 12 hours. That is enough,” O'Neill said. Deliberations will begin again at 9 a.m. Thursday.
Because it involves multiple accounts from each of the two principals, the Cosby case comes with an added layer of complexity. There is a relatively small set of facts about the night but many interpretations — some of them not always in harmony even within one principal's narrative.
Still, the longer that deliberations wear on, the greater possibility of a deadlocked jury, which would ultimately result in a mistrial if the stalemate can't be broken. O'Neill is expected to send the jury back to the deliberation room several times to try to resolve any tie-ups before declaring a hung jury.

Montgomery and Wetumpka police are investigating multiple gas station robberies.
Investigators in both cities believe the same man might be responsible.
In Wetumpka, two gas stations were robbed Sunday. Between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. a man robbed the Shell Convenience Store at the intersection of U.S. Highway 231 and Redland Road and the Red Eagle Chevron at the intersection of Highway 231 and Red Eagle Drive.
According to cashiers, the suspect was armed with a knife and club. Other witnesses told police he was dressed in a blue poncho or coat. He was last seen driving a silver four-door sedan.
Montgomery investigators are also searching for a man who robbed a gas station with a "club." Witnesses say the man went inside the convenience store in the 8000 block of Vaughn Road Tuesday and robbed the business of cash.
He was last seen driving a four-door silver sedan.

FOR THE LOVERS Grouplove – Tongue Tied An absolute bop that will get you dancing like no one's around. It's all about that youthful, naive, exhilarating love that seems like it could last forever. Favourite lyric: “I loved you then and I love you now.” Cage the Elephant – Trouble First heard on the soundtrack to Edge of Seventeen (a perversely funny coming-of-age film), this track is hazy and romantic in a non-suffocating way. Favourite lyric: “I said it was love and I did it for life.” Weaves – Drag Me Down A spooky and delightfully unrecognisable cover of a One Direction song, this female-led track features on the horror-comedy TV series Crazyhead. Still, it's a hopeful one. Favourite lyric: “All my life you stood by me, when no one else was ever behind me.” Ibeyi – Faithful Ibeyi is a duo of French-Cuban twin sisters and here, they deliver us a sparse, languid tune about what love requires in order to survive. Favourite lyric: “My heart is set, you are the one for me.” The Mowgli's – Say It, Just Say It An uptempo tune, Say It, Just Say It is for someone who hasn't found love but would do anything to. Favourite lyric: “You make me feel like I've been waiting my whole life, and I could die to find that simple kind of love you can't deny.” Jagged Edge (feat Run of Run DMC) – Let's Get Married We're ending with a throwback tune about marriage, because why not? From the year 2000 — a golden era for R'n'B — Jagged Edge get pretty adorable here. Favourite lyric: “We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it.” FOR THE HATERS The Neighbourhood – Afraid An aggressive start to our playlist, The Neighbourhood know exactly how to make bitterness sing. Favourite lyric: “It hurts but I won't fight you. You suck, anyway.” The 1975 – Loving Someone The 1975 like to mix social commentary with indie pop, and Loving Someone is no different. Favourite lyric: “I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques.” The Kooks – Bad Habit The title says it all — who needs love when you've got your vices? Heavy on the percussions, Bad Habit is funky, smooth and addictive. Favourite lyric: “Oh man, you know I wish I had it all.” Melanie Martinez – Cry Baby The kind of song you'd imagine playing in the background of a bizarre heist. Favourite lyric: “Your heart's too big for your body, it's why you won't fit inside.” Olly Murs – You Don't Know Love This tune somehow manages to be about both a terrible relationship and not realising what you've had until it's gone. Favourite lyric: “You don't know love ‘til it feels like you died when it's missing.” Hailee Steinfeld – Love Myself Self-love on Valentine's Day = crucial. Steinfeld takes a tired cliche and turns into something fresh and fun. Favourite lyric: “I LOVE ME.”

Buddy Pough to return for one more season at SC State
ORANGEBURG, S.C. (WOLO) – South Carolina State athletic director Stacy Danley announced two different moves in regards to the future of the Bulldogs' athletic programs Monday.
Head football coach Oliver “Buddy” Pough will have his contract extended with the school, his alma mater, to serve as the leader of the team through the 2018 season.
SC State finished the 2017 campaign with a 3-7 mark. Next fall will be Pough's 17th season in charge in Orangeburg. He has been a part of 14 of the school's 16 MEAC titles as either a player, assistant, or head coach. Buddy's overall record is 120-64 (94-33 conference).
“I believe this decision is best for the overall athletics program as we begin to focus on transitioning and move into rebuilding mode,” said Danley, who was hired to the Director of Athletics position in April. “The nucleus of that rebuilding is our football program. Coach Pough holds the record as the second winningest coach in school history. His winning tradition, extensive relationships throughout the state as well as his familiarity of the program and the MEAC Conference all played a role in helping form the decision. Coach Pough has agreed to be part of the rebuilding process and the University is looking forward to his input and expertise in securing his replacement.”
Danley also announced that the Bulldogs' women's tennis program will be reinstated. The team has won 12 Mid-Eastern Athletic Championships since 2002 under the watch of returning head coach Hardeep Judge.
The Edmonton Police Service's arson unit and homicide unit has been called in to investigate after a body was found at an apartment building in the area of 117 Avenue and 80 Street on Wednesday.
Staff Sgt. Bill Clark said the man's body had “obvious signs of trauma” and the fire was being treated as suspicious.

Officers were driving past the apartment building at about 3:30 p.m. when they saw smoke and called Edmonton Fire Rescue Services to the scene.
“We want to talk to anybody who's been at this address — especially in the last 24 hours — anybody who hangs around this area,” Clark said. “We do want to talk to anybody who saw anything, may have seen anything overnight, all the way to the time of the fire this afternoon.”
Clark said the body was found in a suite on the second floor of the three-storey building. He added that “there's been some issues here,” while speaking about what police know of the building.

Hartlepool families are being urged to get their children walking to school as part of an international campaign for sustainable travel.
International Walk to School Month is running throughout October and has received the backing of Hartlepool Borough Council initiative, the Hartlepool Active Travel Hub, to promote alternatives to travelling by car.
Tony Davison
The campaign says by walking to school, children have improved health benefits by increasing fitness and air quality is improved by less congestion.
Tony Davison, the council's sustainable travel officer who co-ordinates the work of the hub, said: “By driving to school less frequently or not at all, parents and carers can help to really make a difference.
“Fewer cars outside schools mean less congestion and improved air quality as a result of reduced vehicle exhaust emissions.
“Walking also brings obvious health benefits and children who walk tend to be more alert and ready to learn when they arrive at school.
“If walking all of the way to school is not feasible, we would ask people to consider driving only part of the way and completing their journey on foot.”
International Walk to School Month is also being supported by the national charity Living Streets, with whom the council has close links.
Chief executive Joe Irvin said: “Motor traffic is the biggest cause of air pollution and so encouraging people to walk short everyday journeys, such as the walk to school, is a big part of the solution to this growing problem.
“Encouraging children to be active every day also helps them maintain a healthy weight and develop healthy habits for life which will stave off chronic health conditions in the future.”
Efforts to promote walking have also been boosted with the news that Hartlepool Council's Road Safety Team has secured funding for a three-year programme of pedestrian training for local school children.
The funding is being provided by the Government's Access Fund via the Connect Tees Valley programme managed by the Tees Valley Combined Authority, which aims to promote and develop sustainable travel across the Tees Valley.
Mr Davison added: “The training programme links to the Government's new Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy which, amongst other things, aims to encourage more children aged five to 10 to walk to school.”

CALGARY – Corey Perry scored the overtime winner for the Anaheim Ducks in a 5-4 playoff win over the Calgary Flames on Monday.
Perry's sharp-angled shot at 1:30 in the extra period deflected off bodies and by Flames goaltender Brian Elliott.
Trailing 2-1 and 4-2 at period breaks, the Ducks battled back to take a 3-0 stranglehold in their best-of-seven Western Conference quarter-final series.
Calgary must win Wednesday's Game 4 at Scotiabank Saddledome to avoid a sweep.
The Flames started stronger, were more disciplined and sharper in the faceoff circle than they were in a pair of 3-2 losses to open the series in Anaheim.
But Calgary squandered that effort giving up three unanswered goals to the Ducks starting at 19:11 of the second period.
Shea Theodore scored twice for the Ducks with Nick Ritchie and Nate Thompson also scoring for the visitors. Defencemen Kevin Bieksa and Hampus Lindholm each had two assists.
John Gibson was replaced by Jonathan Bernier in the second period following Calgary's fourth goal. Gibson stopped 12 of 16 shots with Bernier turning away all 16 he faced in relief for the win.
Sean Monahan had a goal and an assist for the Flames.
Kris Versteeg, Sam Bennett and Michael Stone also scored for Calgary with Mikael Backlund and defenceman T.J. Brodie each contributing a pair of assists for the hosts.
Elliott turned away 22 of 27 shots in the loss.

Calgary's combined 31 penalty minutes was a factor in its two losses in Anaheim. It was the Ducks paying the price for undiscipline Monday.
The Flames scored three power-play goals on five chances in the first two periods. Anaheim pushed back, however.
Theodore scored his second goal of the game on a shot from the point to tie it 4-4 at 15:39 of the third.
Thompson deflected a Lindholm shot from inside the blue-line under Elliott at 11:14 of the third period to pull within a goal. The play was reviewed for a high stick, but the goal stood.
While Ducks forward Perry was digging into the Flames bench for his lost stock, Theodore's wrist shot from the boards deflected off Elliott's left pad and into the net with 49 seconds remaining in the second period.
Mark Giordano's blast from the point deflected off Bennett's foot for a 4-1 Calgary lead at 8:33, which prompted Anaheim's goaltending swap.

Stone scored even-strength at 4:34 threading a shot through traffic and past Gibson stick side.
Calgary scored first and led after the opening period for the first time in the series on a pair of power-play goals.
But Anaheim's Ritchie halved the deficit at 15:33 knocking in a rebound off an Antoine Vermette shot from the top of the faceoff circle.
Versteeg banged a rebound by a sprawling Gibson during a goal-mouth scrum at 9:18 for a 2-0 lead.
Monahan, on Gibson's doorstep, converted Troy Brouwer's feed from behind the net into his third power-play goal of the series at 2:10.
Giordano was soundly booed in Anaheim because of a regular-season collision with Cam Fowler that took Anaheim's big-minute defenceman out of their lineup to start this series.

Calgary fans responded by adopting Bieksa as the Saddledome villain. Bennett steamrolling Bieksa in the first period was loudly cheered.
Ducks defenceman Sami Vatanen participated in the morning skate, but was scratched a second straight game. He sustained an upper-body injury when he was checked by Calgary's Lance Bouma in Game 1.
Fowler skated after his teammates in the morning. Ducks head coach Randy Carlyle indicated the 25-year-old from Windsor, Ont., is recovering from his knee injury, but did not provide a timetable for Fowler's return.
“We think that he's on pace to be available to us some time here shortly,” Carlyle said.
Still no word on Google Store availability.
At Google's October 4 hardware event, one of the more surprising announcements was the Google Home Max – a beefed-up version of the regular Google Home with two 4.5-inch woofers, custom tweeters, 20 times the audio power, and a whole lot more. A listing in late November suggested that the Home Max would be released on December 11, and that appears to have been quite accurate.
The Home Max is now available for purchase online at Best Buy, the Google Store, Verizon Wireless, and Walmart for $399, and no matter which retailer you choose to shop at, you'll be able to get the smart speaker in either Chalk or Charcoal color options.
Delivery estimates vary from store-to-store and based on which color you pick, but it looks like shipments are going out rather quickly with some delivery dates being as soon as a couple days out.

Aug 12, 2017; London, United Kingdom; Muktar Edris (ETH) wins the 5,000m in 13:32.79 ahead of Mo Farah aka Mohamed Farah (GBR) and Paul Chelimo (USA) during the IAAF World Championships in Athletics at London Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Park.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Olympic and world champion Mo Farah said the British media were trying to destroy his achievements and repeated that he was a clean athlete during an emotional outburst on Sunday.
"It's like I have achieved what I have achieved and you are trying to destroy it," he told reporters. "You guys, so many times towards me, you have been unfair. I don't know why."
Farah won silver in Saturday's 5,000 metres at the World Athletics Championships -- his final track race of a career in which he won two successive Olympic 10,000 and 5,000 gold medal doubles.
The 34-year-old, who was born in Somalia and moved to Britain at the age of eight, has also won three world titles each in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres.
In February, Farah's coach Alberto Salazar denied administering banned supplements to his athletes and issued a firm rebuttal of what he said were false allegations against him in a British newspaper.
The Sunday Times had reported that Salazar had used prohibited infusions of supplements to improve the performance of his runners, citing what the newspaper said was a leaked United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report.

Farah has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
"It's like a broken record repeating myself," said Farah when the subject was brought up on Sunday. "If I have crossed the line, and Mo Farah has done something wrong, then prove it."

"You can write what you like but I'm a clean athlete... and I sleep well at night, loving my kids, hugging my kids, showing (them) what's right. That's all that counts."
Farah, speaking calmly but looking exasperated, said his achievements spoke for themselves.
"History doesn't lie -- everybody's proud of me," he said.
"The fact is, I work hard at what I do and I achieve (it) through hard work... putting my balls on the line, year after year, and delivering for my country, and for the people out there."
"I'm going to still keep fighting, keep working, making my country proud," said Farah, who will now concentrate on running marathons. "I am proud to be British and put my GB vest on and do it for my country."

The Predators ended up losing their finals series with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but Underwood took to social media this afternoon (June 14) with a positive spin on the whole situation.
Underwood posted a photo with her husband, writing, “Had a lovely night last night celebrating with the players, wives and staff of the @predsnhl …oh, as well as with this hunk! We are so thankful for such an incredible season and the amazing group of people we got to spend it with! 💛💙 #blessed”

Not having a security perimeter in Quebec City when protesters converge in the provincial capital next week to mobilize against the G7 summit is intelligent, Mayor Régis Labeaume said Wednesday.
“You shouldn't be obliged to give them an objective,” Labeaume told reporters Wednesday after he spoke to a business luncheon in Montreal.
“The last (summit) there was a barrier — so the protesters knew exactly where to put on a show. So, we've evolved.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is welcoming world leaders for the 44th annual G7 summit in La Malbaie, about 140 kilometres north of Quebec City.
The town of 8,000 will be in virtual lockdown during the June 8-9 meeting and protesters won't be able to get anywhere near the hotel where the heads of state will be staying.
READ MORE: In sleepy Quebec town, residents prepare to welcome the world for G7 summit
Activists have chosen instead to gather in Quebec City for three consecutive days of activities and demonstrations, beginning June 7.
Businesses and citizens with property around the downtown area are worried, Labeaume said. Gatherings of leaders from wealthy states often attract thousands of protesters, with some engaging in violent acts toward property and the police.
During a recent tour of La Malbaie, Trudeau said “discussions are ongoing” when he was asked who would pay the tab for any property damage in Quebec City.
The federal government has budgeted $600 million to pay for its year-long, rotating G7 presidency, the responsibilities for which include hosting the summit.
READ MORE: Security top of mind as Charlevoix's Manoir Richelieu prepares for G7 summit
Ottawa explicitly said it would pay for costs associated with loss of revenue for businesses affected by the security perimeter around La Malbaie, but has so far offered no guarantees about property damage.
Labeaume said he's confident the federal government would assume the costs.
“The summit costs $600 million — I think there will be money left over to reimburse business owners,” he said.
World leaders from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan and Italy — which represent the majority of global wealth — will participate in the summit, as will a representative from the European Union and other dignitaries.
Activists and labour leaders denounce these heads of state for representing and propping up a capitalist system they say increases inequality through the exploitation of the poor and that appropriates the world's resources for profit.
The G7 leaders have done little to address offshore tax havens that deprive governments of billions of dollars that could be used for public services, said Dominique Daigneault, president of the Montreal branch of a large Quebec labour federation.
Global leaders often explain their failure to act against tax havens by stating that many countries need to act together to stop the problem.
“These leaders often use the excuse that they need to co-ordinate with other countries to fight tax havens,” said Daigneault, whose labour union will be present for the protests in Quebec City.
“But the G7 is a perfect time to address this — and you know they won't.”
‘Special laws can be voted in quickly'
Arij Riahi, a defence lawyer who often represents activists arrested during demonstrations, said she hopes things don't get out of hand next week.
But she said she shares the concerns of one civil rights advocacy group, who, along with Amnesty International, plan to send a delegation to monitor how police treat protesters.
The human rights groups have deplored the fact the RCMP's security perimeter in La Malbaie will keep protesters far from the hotel, increasing the likelihood, they say, of large-scale arrests.
READ MORE: Charlevoix prepares to host world leaders ahead of G7 summit
Police in Quebec, Riahi said, are ready to declare a protest illegal and to attempt to shut it down if only a small minority of people participating cause trouble.
That violates people's right to express themselves and criminalizes protesters, she said.
Riahi, however, believes it's a good thing Quebec's legislature didn't copy the Ontario government, which passed a special law giving authorities additional temporary powers to detain people around the security zone during the 2010 summit in Toronto.
But she said that just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't.
US PGA Championship Diary: Clutch Thomas watched by Spieth, Fowler on thrilling final day
Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler watched on as Justin Thomas won the US PGA Championship on Sunday.
by Omnisport News 14 Aug 2017, 05:31 IST
American Justin Thomas
Justin Thomas sealed a US PGA Championship victory in front of friends on a day of drama, and trick shots, at Quail Hollow.
Thomas completed a two-shot win with a three-under 68 in the final round on Sunday.
Watching on as he claimed his first major title at the 18th were good friends Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler.
Meanwhile, unusual shots featured heavily as Jon Rahm and Anirban Lahiri took different approaches on the final day.
SPIETH, FOWLER WATCH ON
Thomas' victory was not yet complete when he made bogey at the 18th, as fellow Americans Spieth and Fowler watched on.
Spieth, who was bidding to become the youngest player to win a career Grand Slam, finished the tournament at two over, while Fowler shot a 67 in the final round to be tied for fifth.
But the duo, and Thomas' father, watched on in support as the world number 14 claimed what would prove to be a deserved win.
CLUTCH BACK NINE
It was quite the way for Thomas to seal his win.
He birdied the 10th after waiting 12 seconds for his putt to drop and then chipped in at 13.
Wait for it ... wait for it ... GOT IT. #PGAChamp pic.twitter.com/FUR5HciqxM — PGA of America (@PGA) August 13, 2017
If the 'Green Mile' was there to make him nervous, it was no so, a par at 16 followed by a brilliant seven-iron that led to a birdie at 17.
He held a three-shot lead after his tee shot at the last, a bogey enough to seal his win.
DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY
Rahm and Lahiri were far from orthodox.
Unwilling to get wet on 18, Rahm played a ridiculous shot backwards as he made bogey.
Lahiri, meanwhile, played left-handed from a bunker on the 14th, also bogeying.

" 'All this will I give you,' he said, 'if you will bow down and worship me.' " — Matthew 4:9
The prospect of Sen. Roy Moore has been both horrifying and clarifying. It would be difficult to design a more controlled, precise test of the moral gag reflex in politics.
In this political lifeboat dilemma, Republicans are being asked what principles they are willing to throw overboard in the interests of power. A belief that character matters in politics? Splash. A commitment to religious and ethnic inclusion? Splash. Moral outrage at credible charges of sexual predation against teen girls? Splash.
Those remaining in this lightened boat display a kind of shocking clarity. They value certain political ends — tax cuts, a conservative judiciary — more than ethical considerations. When it comes to confirming judges who oppose Roe v. Wade, the vote of a statesman is no better than the vote of a sexual predator — or, presumably, of a drug dealer or a murderer. This type of calculation admits no limiting principle.
OTHER COLUMNS BY MICHAEL GERSON
So, in this view, it does not really matter that there is (as Ivanka Trump put it) “no reason to doubt the victims' accounts” in Moore's case. It does not matter that Moore's explanations have been shifting and slippery. It does not matter that Moore has said that homosexual behavior should be illegal, or that he compared resisting gay marriage to resisting the Holocaust, or that he referred to Asians as “yellows,” or that he doesn't believe President Obama is a natural born citizen, or that he believes there are communities living under Shariah law in Illinois and Indiana.
Those willing to swallow all this — all the ignorance, cruelty, creepiness and malice — have truly shown the strength of their partisan commitment. A purity indistinguishable from mania.
The Moore test has been useful in its own way. It has exposed corrupt leaders. President Trump's eventual endorsement of Moore was predictable, given his personal interest in discrediting the credible accusations of exploited women. The support of the Republican National Committee revealed a political party with no judgment, no standards and a cloudy future among the young and morally sentient. All Moore's allies and enablers have marked themselves as unfit for leadership. The untainted — among them Sens. Mike Lee, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Steve Daines, Bill Cassidy and Ben Sasse — are far and away the best positioned to play positive roles in a Republican recovery.
The Moore test has exposed corrupt arguments. All those who say “Let the voters of Alabama decide” are applying popular sovereignty to a matter of basic morality. Abraham Lincoln would not be amused. If Republicans have any remaining ties to the great man, they will not count votes when fundamental principles are at stake. We do not let the people decide on the rights of minorities. And the people do not decide on the rules of morality.
And the Moore test has exposed corrupt institutions. The basic argument here — that ethics can be ignored in the process of doing great work in the world — is precisely what brings institutions into disrepute. The Catholic Church covered up sexual predation on the justification that it was otherwise doing great work in the world. Some evangelicals are now publicly downplaying credible charges of sexual predation for the same reason. And they are doing tremendous damage to the reputation of the Christian church in the process.
Though I probably don't say it enough, many evangelicals are doing great work in the world — feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless and welcoming the stranger. But a self-selected, highly visible group of politicized evangelicals is engaged in a remarkable project. Once they were known for harsh moralism — for being eager tutors in our national sins. Now they argue that character doesn't count and the ends justify the means. The moral majority has somehow lost its taste for decency.
The hope for American politics is found in the reverse, the photographic negative, of all these trends. In leaders who affirm and exemplify the nobility of the political enterprise. In arguments that elevate principle above expediency. In institutions that shape character, confront corruption, take the side of the exploited and echo the newly pertinent question: “For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?”

By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - World stocks were set to post their biggest weekly drop since late 2016 on Friday, as talk of central bank policy tightening and expectations of higher inflation boosted borrowing costs globally, a move that sparked a sell-off in shares.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.4 percent. The index was set to snap its longest winning streak since 1999 - 10 weeks of gains - and record its biggest weekly loss since November 2016.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury jumped to more than 2.8 percent, its highest level since early 2014. That markedly steepened the yield curve and squeezed out investors who had feverishly bet on a tighter spread between longer-dated and short-dated yields.
Global central banks have recently struck a more hawkish tone, with impressive economic data and buoyant oil prices driving up long-term inflation expectations.
The European Central Bank, for one, is widely expected to end its asset-purchase programme as early as September. That has pushed five-year German Bund yields above zero for the first time since 2015. UK gilt prices also cheapened significantly.
The Bank of Japan did its best to stem the rise in borrowing costs, stepping into the market on Friday with a promise to buy as many bonds as it would take to keep yields low.
Some investors have also grown wary of the global equity bull run. Bank of America Merrill-Lynch's indicator of market sentiment hit a “sell” signal pointing to a downturn for risk assets, the bank's strategists said on Friday.
“If you look at a variety of indicators, it looks like we have swung to levels of extreme bullishness. We have seen substantial inflows,” said Paul ‘O Connor, head of UK-based Janus Henderson's multi-asset team.
“We have seen consensus crowding into the long equity trade so actually we have begun to fade the move and take some equity risk off in the last few weeks.”
In currencies, after initially failing to get a boost from the pickup in U.S. Treasury yields, the dollar index had inched up 0.2 percent by noon in Europe. Still, the index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was not far above its lowest levels in three years.
“Bond investors are selling out of U.S. treasuries and at the same time liquidating out of their long U.S. dollar positions,” Nordea Markets Chief Analyst Niels Christensen said, explaining why the dollar had failed to gain on the spike in U.S. treasury yields.
He described the turnaround on Friday for the dollar as led by “some profit taking ahead of the US jobs numbers” and a small move.
The United States is witnessing deep partisan political divisions and intra-party squabbles with lawmakers unable to find common ground on most issues. The federal government shut down last month for three days when Republicans and Democrats failed to strike a deal to fund public operations.
Investors now await January's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for clues on the strength of the labour market.

America's Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has finally acquiesced to the wishes of President Donald Trump by clarifying that he has not “called that moron a moron.”
Answering a question posed by ‘The Dependent's' foreign correspondent in Washington, Tillerson sighed exasperatedly before saying “Fine. I did not call the moron a moron. Is he happy now? God what a moron.”
The Secretary of State had been in hot water after it was revealed that after a spat with President Trump back in July, he had called the Commander in Chief a “moron” in front of a number of people including at least four administration officials.
Tillerson had earlier tried to deflect the matter by saying he would never consider leaving the State Department and was committed to his job.
“Dude Putin will be sooo made if I lose this gig. Really would never quit. And besides, it really depends on what the meaning of the word moron is.” he had told the media back then.
Despite the apology, Trump was further incensed by the fact that he did not explicitly refute ever calling the President a “moron” and it was this that prompted the clarification.
“God what does he even think about himself? I can guarantee you that every person on earth that knows any intelligible language has called this man a moron at least once. Now he wants us to lie about it!?” he added.

“Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”
–President Ronald Reagan in a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1987.
The Berlin Wall, when created in 1961, signified the differences between the communist Soviets, and the capitalistic West, including France, Britain, England and the United States, during the Cold War.
It was a symbol of oppression of the people of disunited Germany who were not only split as East and West Germans but could not enjoy basic luxuries.
They were denied access to the opposite side of their country and many were even killed in an attempt to cross the heavily guarded wall.
For many years it remained a point of contention between the Soviets and Americans and it wasn't until 1989, towards the end of the Cold War, that the wall was taken down and over two million Germans visited West Berlin to celebrate their freedom.
It still remains a precious moment for the Germans who were not only ensured their basic rights but celebrated the unification of their beloved, once powerful, country which had gained a fraction of stability.
It can be argued, in the political arena, that the fall of the Berlin wall signified something more than individualistic freedom.
It paved a way to the establishment of the West and its capitalistic ideologies as dominant.
The US, after the fall of the wall sent military troops to protect the Western Germans from the soviets.
This sort of imperialistic system was validated so much so that we, in the status quo, are living under it as an imposed form of modern government.

Scunthorpe Telegraph newspaper vendor Derek Cartwright took part in a charity swim to raise funds in memory of a man who died suddenly in 2015.
Nathan Slade died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in August 2015, aged 26.
Derek, who has a learning disability and epilepsy, completed 40 lengths of the Riddings swimming pool to raise money and awareness for SUDEP.
It took place on the cusp of the second anniversary of Mr Slade's death on Sunday (August 13).
Derek has raised more than £6,000 thanks to all the local businesses and friends making donations and filling out sponsor forms as he personally championed the charity.
He said the swim, which he completed in just over 48 minutes, was "good".
Derek received a certificate of appreciation from SUDEP.
Nathan's mum, twin sister, nana and friends were there on the day cheering him on.
Boxer Dec Spelman was the special guest on the day.
Derek wished to thank Nettl, Eazy Parks, Quality Bathrooms and everyone else for their support.
Nathan's mum Toni added: "A big thank you to those people who came to support us and a big thanks to Derek who wasn't even out of breath at the end!"
It's been three days since violence over a white nationalist rally erupted in Charlottesville — including on the University of Virginia campus — yet, just days before the school year is set to begin, the university has been silent about how it is handling new security concerns for students.
The day following the violent clash on campus, a white supremacist killed one and injured 19 others when he crashed a car into a crowd of counterprotesters not far from UVA.
This isn't the first time Charlottesville has been a flashpoint for hate groups, and related violence and protests may well not be over for the community. Members of the alt-right are apparently calling Charlottesville one of the main battlegrounds for their struggle to save white America, according to The Atlantic.
What will actually play out going forward in Charlottesville is, of course, unclear, but statements like this one are cause for concern for some UVA students.
#UVA21 what happened today won't be the last thing to happen here. You'll be tested whether it be microaggressions or out and out racism. — Ki. (@twiceastough) August 13, 2017
I attend UVA and I feel absolutely unsafe right now and I fear for my life. I feel a scholarship to the University of Florida is needed — 1k (@ChrisGotti5_) August 13, 2017
So, does UVA plan to take extra precautions to protect students? No word on that yet.
The administration sent three emails to students Sunday and Monday, all obtained by USA TODAY College. None of them directly address security measures.
One message included a statement from the president reaffirming the importance of safety, without details. “The safety and well-being of all UVA community members continues to be our top priority,” Teresa A. Sullivan, UVA's president, wrote in an email to students Sunday. It went on to provide contact information for mental health counseling.
As of Monday afternoon, neither the university's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness nor the police department had updated safety information on the university website or social media accounts in the wake of the demonstrations.
In response to requests for comment from USA TODAY College, university spokesperson Anthony P. de Bruyn provided no further details on safety plans.
The campus does have existing emergency safety measures in place, like the blue light phone system used on many campuses across the country and a text/email alert system.
The university has released multiple statements condemning the white supremacists' actions and movement.
And Rector Frank M. Conner III wrote to the community that “the actions of those who visited evil upon us are nothing short of white nationalist and white supremacist terrorism intended to intimidate our community.” He added, “They will not succeed. We will not surrender.”

Marvin Bagley III, who was the top player in the class of 2018, will join Duke earlier than expected as a member of the class of 2017. (1:08)
Now that Marvin Bagley III is headed to Duke, the discussion is over. Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils are the clear-cut favorites (again) to cut down the nets come April 2 in San Antonio.
We've hemmed and hawed about it all spring and summer. Who should be preseason No. 1?
Arizona was the pick in our latest Way-Too-Early top 25 rankings from May -- but you could also make a strong case for Michigan State. And what about Kansas? Or Kentucky and all its newcomers?
Editor's Picks No. 1 Bagley III to classify for '17, play at Duke Marvin Bagley III, the nation's No. 1 high school senior, says he is reclassifying to the Class of 2017 and will play at Duke this upcoming season as a freshman.
Marvin Bagley adds more star power to 2018 NBA draft The top-heavy 2018 draft now features another serious contender for the No. 1 pick. 1 Related
None of that matters now. Bagley's decision on Monday night to commit to Duke and reclassify to 2017 means the race is over.
Bagley isn't just another five-star or top-10 prospect committing to Duke. He's the consensus No. 1 prospect in the 2017 class, was No. 1 in 2018, and is the heavy favorite to be the No. 1 pick in next June's NBA Draft. Oh, and he would have been the No. 1 pick had he been eligible for this past June's NBA Draft.
Everyone wanted Marvin Bagley. Duke got him. Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire
In fact, one can make a legitimate case that Bagley is the best prospect to come out of high school since Anthony Davis in 2011. Coincidentally, Bagley going to Duke and reclassifying to 2017 marks only the second time since 2007 that No. 1 prospects have gone to the same school in consecutive years, according to ESPN Stats and Info. Harry Giles was the No. 1 prospect a year ago. He spent one season at Duke before heading to the NBA. The last time? Anthony Davis and Nerlens Noel (who also reclassified) in 2011 and 2012.
Bagley would have been enough to put USC in the conversation for preseason No. 1. The same USC team that only made the NCAA tournament via a First Four berth would've been perhaps the most talented team in the country with Bagley in the fold. He would have been enough to push a UCLA team that lost four starters into the top-10 conversation.
Duke was already in better shape than either of those teams, and now the Blue Devils are a notch above Arizona, Michigan State, Kansas and any other candidate for the top spot.
Yes, this is the same thing nearly everyone said before last season. In our defense, it was impossible to foresee Krzyzewski needing back surgery in the middle of the season; or Grayson Allen being the biggest story in college basketball for tripping opponents; or a late-January locker room ban; or Giles contributing next-to-nothing for essentially the entire season due to injury; or Jayson Tatum and Marques Bolden also starting the season injured and taking time to get acclimated.
By the time the NCAA tournament rolled around, though, Duke was one of the favorites to cut down the nets, coming off an ACC Tournament title and wins in 12 of its last 15 games.
Could that all happen again? Of course. But it's the preseason, and preseason rankings should come down to talent.
And as far as talent goes, it's Duke then everyone else.
It starts with Bagley. He's a supremely skilled 6-foot-11 prospect who can play any position in the frontcourt and also handle the ball or make shots from the perimeter. The lefty averaged 25.5 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.0 blocks on the Nike EYBL circuit this past spring and summer with the Phoenix Phamily AAU program. In a 20-game season, Bagley hit the 30-point mark on four separate occasions and the 20-rebound mark three times. He has a terrific motor, but makes it look effortless at the same time.
Marvin Bagley can do it all, which is why he was one of the most sought-after recruits in years. Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire
But there's a lot more. Duke is only the second team since 2007 with four top-10 freshmen entering the program.
Trevon Duval is the best point guard entering college basketball, and a legitimate game-changer at the point of attack. The past couple years, Krzyzewski has had to use guys like Allen and Frank Jackson at point guard -- talented offensive players, but not true point guards or consistent distributors. Duval is different, and will do a better job of keeping the surrounding talent happy.
Wendell Carter was the best power forward in the 2017 class before Bagley reclassified, and he gives Duke a go-to-guy in the post to balance the offense. Giles' health didn't allow him to do that last year, and Amile Jefferson was never been a dominant offensive player. Carter is a double-double waiting to happen.
Duke is also welcoming the No. 1 freshman shooting guard in Gary Trent Jr., one of the best scorers in high school basketball the last couple seasons. He can take -- and make -- contested jumpers, and should find plenty of space on the perimeter with Duval and Allen attacking off the bounce.
There's also the return of Allen, who was the odds-on favorite for the Wooden Award at this time a year ago. He won't have that target on his back with the other stars in the lineup, and he won't have the pressure of being the primary playmaker in the backcourt. He's only one season removed from averaging 21.6 points and shooting 41.7 percent from 3-point range.
Former five-star Bolden provides potential off the bench; Jordan Tucker was one of the best 3-point shooters in the 2017 class; and Javin DeLaurier and Alex O'Connell can play minutes as well.
Without Bagley, there was enough on the roster for a top-five ranking in the preseason.
With Bagley, it's not even close.
The best player in college basketball will be playing for the best team in college basketball.

Tired of the kids spending their days online rather than outdoors? Need a little light cleaning done around the house? It might be time to hold the WiFi password hostage.
In this case, in order to get the WiFi password, the kids have to send mom a picture of a clean kitchen, complete with a box of crackers so they can't reuse the picture over and over.

Gordon (his now-wife, portrayed by Zoe Kazan) was a left-field indie hit. But Romano and Hunter carry much of the film's heart with their nuanced portrayal of Gordon's worry-stricken parents, who arrive when their daughter falls into a coma and are thrown together with Nanjiani in an unflinchingly honest way that side-steps the genre's easy cliches.

An animated David Pumpkins: Helped along by an always-game Tom Hanks, this “Saturday Night Live” sketch from last year built around a haunted ride, a jack-o'-lantern suit and two dancers in skeleton suits was a surreal highlight of the season. Now, because “SNL” loves too much of a good thing, Pumpkins will become a one-off cartoon special that will probably build a story and logic around a gag that was funny because it defied both. “Any questions?” the animated Pumpkins will surely ask to reprise his goofy catchphrase. Yes. Why couldn't NBC leave this alone?
The ‘Curb' comeback: Six years after its last episode, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” has returned, and for all the impeccable achievements on Larry David's comic resume both with this series and “Seinfeld,” something seems a bit off with the formula this time. Maybe it's because we've seen David ignore the feelings of others or inflate a petty grievance to the level of a volcanic eruption one too many times, or perhaps pampered male rage is funny for only so long. Or maybe it's simply because there's now someone else who acts out this sort of “comedy” on the world stage every day.

ANKARA - Turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 189 lawyers as part of an investigation into followers of a Muslim cleric accused of orchestrating last July's attempted coup, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday.
The scope of purges that have also seen more than 130 media outlets shut down and some 150 journalists jailed has unnerved rights groups and Western allies, who fear President Tayyip Erdoğan is using the coup bid as a pretext to muzzle dissent.
The 189 suspects were sought by anti-terrorist police across eight provinces including Istanbul for alleged links to the network of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, the agency said. He has denied involvement in the failed putsch.
Police have so far detained 78 of the lawyers, some believed to be users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers.
Since the July coup attempt, authorities have jailed pending trial 50,000 people and sacked or suspended 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups, including Gulen's network.
Erdoğan says the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt in which 240 people were killed.

Florinda Lorenzo has been in the U.S. illegally for more than a decade but checks in with federal immigration agents in Baltimore several times a year. Until recently, it had become routine, almost like a trip to the dentist.
Many immigrants — like Lorenzo — who are here illegally are not in hiding. Hundreds of thousands of them report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a regular basis. They've been allowed to stay because past administrations considered them a low priority for deportation.
But with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, that once-routine check-in has become a nerve-wracking experience. In recent weeks, some immigrants say they've been detained without warning at their ICE check-ins.
"It creates a lot of chaos for me," Lorenzo says through an interpreter. "I know lots of people are getting deported now, and I wouldn't want to be deported."
Lorenzo came to the U.S. from Guatemala 14 years ago. She has three children, two of them U.S. citizens who were born here. Lorenzo was arrested in 2010 and charged with selling prepaid phone cards without a license. The charges were dropped, but she's been required to check in with ICE since then.
Before her most recent appointment earlier this month, Lorenzo looked nervous. Her eyes were red.
"It's hard for my family, for me ... my kids, my husband," Lorenzo says. "It's very painful and stressful for me. ... I just hope I go back to my children today."
A few dozen friends gathered to pray and show their support — both for Lorenzo's sake, and for ICE officials, in case they were watching. Nick Katz, a lawyer with CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group, accompanied Lorenzo to provide legal help in case she was detained.
"The environment is so uncertain," Katz says. "We've heard stories of people being taken into custody. We know of at least one mother who was taken into custody out of a check-in."
Across the U.S., judges have issued final removal orders for more than 900,000 people in the country illegally. Many remain as long as they check in regularly with ICE.
Under the Obama administration, they were not considered priorities for deportation because they had clean criminal records, or strong ties to their communities. The Trump administration, however, is taking a more aggressive enforcement stance.
President Trump signed executive orders that broadly expanded the number of people who are priorities for deportation. That category now includes many immigrants whose only offense may be entering or staying in the country illegally.
Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, applauded the move. Von Spakovsky says criminals should be the priority. But, he says, that doesn't mean everyone else should get a free pass.
"You're in the United States illegally; you broke the law to come here illegally," von Spakovsky says. "And the government agency is basically saying, 'That's OK, we're not going to do anything about it.' That just to me is a complete violation of the rule of law."
An ICE spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the check-ins.
Several cases of unauthorized immigrants being detained at their ICE appointments have gotten widespread attention. That could have unintended consequences, says Alonzo Pena, who served as deputy director of ICE in the Obama administration. If agents detain large numbers of immigrants at their check-ins, he says, other immigrants may decide it's too risky to report.
"It's going to send a bad message to others, and it's going to really backfire," Pena says. "They lose faith in the system ... and you don't know where they're at.
"There's nothing good that will come out of that," he says.
Lorenzo emerges from her appointment in the ICE field office with a smile on her face.
"I feel very happy right now. ... My heart isn't as heavy anymore," Lorenzo says. "I don't have the words, but I feel relief."
Lorenzo found out that she can stay, at least for a few more months. She doesn't have to check in with ICE again until October. But neither Lorenzo nor her lawyers can say what will happen when she does.

Beijing
Some areas in northern China including Beijing will pass New Year's Day under a cloud as the national observatory renewed an orange alert for air pollution on Sunday.
Heavy smog will persist in some parts of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hubei and Anhui from Sunday to Monday morning, according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC).
The northeast Liaoning and Jilin, central Hubei, and eastern Jiangsu will be hit by moderate smog.
China has a four-tier warning system for severe weather, with red being the most serious, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
An orange alert means heavy pollution — PM2.5 higher than 150 — for three consecutive days. When the alert is in force, outdoor activities in schools are canceled and construction work suspended.
Beijing issued an orange alert for air pollution on Thursday that will last till Sunday. Heavy polluting vehicles and trucks carrying construction waste are banned from roads and some manufacturing firms have cut production.
Outbreaks of smog are common in the winter in north China, where cold weather and burning of the dirty coal for heating combine to exacerbate the situation.
In a five-year plan on environmental improvements released on Dec 5, the State Council ordered strict control of the consumption of coal.
The Charleston County Sheriff's Office and MUSC are partnering to collect unused or expired medications.
Every weekend in February, the agencies will conduct a takeback location where people can drop off unwanted or expired medications for safe disposal.
Examples of items that will be accepted are pain medications, ADHD medications, sedatives, and pet or veterinary medicines.
Liquids, needles, syringes and lancets cannot be accepted.
The tour dates and locations are as follows:
Saturday: MUSC Horseshoe, 171 Ashley Ave., Charleston
Feb. 10: New First Missionary Baptist Church, 1644 Hwy. 174, Edisto Island
Feb. 17: Awendaw Town Hall, 6971 Doar Road, Awendaw
Feb. 24: Hollywood Town Hall, 6316 Hwy. 162, Hollywood
The times for each location will be from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.
The tour is a collaboration of the MUSC Presidential Scholar Equity Group, the Charleston County Sheriff's Office and MUSC Public Safety.
The safe disposal of unwanted prescription medication can prevent misuse by others. MUSC says three in five teens say prescription pain medications are easy to get from their parents' medicine cabinet.

Newly appointed Motion Picture Association of America chief Charles Rivkin had a message for theater owners at CinemaCon on Tuesday: I'm one of you.
Before he was a top State Department official and ambassador to France, Rivkin spent time in Hollywood. He served as president and CEO of the Jim Henson Company and headed an animated film, TV and merchandising company called Wildbrain.
“Like you, I know what it means to make payroll and to watch box office returns with hope and anticipation,” Rivkin said. “More importantly, like you, I share a deep passion for this industry and I share your optimism and belief in the future of theatrical exhibition. And like everyone in this room, I love the movies.”
CinemaCon is taking place as domestic cinema attendance has stagnated and questions linger about the ability of movies to compete with video games and streaming services. Despite these challenges, Rivkin argued that the movie business is well positioned to succeed. He noted that the global box office hit a record $40.6 billion in 2017, which helped off-set declines in the stateside theatrical business. He also chooses to look at the domestic total of $11.1 billion in glass half-full terms, noting it was the second highest total in the past decade.
“That is pretty remarkable when you consider how large, diverse and mature this market is,” said Rivkin. “I believe we will always be moving between record high or near-record high years.”
Rivkin, who took over from Sen. Chris Dodd at the MPAA last year, did sound a few notes of alarm. He noted that the business needs to work to combat piracy and protect open markets.
“Making sure our creative works are valued and protected is one of the most important things we can do to keep that industry heartbeat strong,” said Rivkin, adding, “As Chairman and CEO of the MPAA, I guarantee you that fighting piracy in all forms remains our top priority.”
Rivkin said the MPAA has formed a coalition of 30 content creators, including the major studios, called the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment. The group is working to strengthen copyright laws at a time when films and television shows are being illegally recorded, downloaded, and shared around the world.
“Protecting our creativity isn't only a fundamental right,” said Rivkin. “It's an economic necessity, for us and all creative economies. Film and television are among the most valuable — and most impactful – exports we have.”
The entertainment business is responsible for some $16.5 billion in exports, he said, representing four times what the U.S. imports. Using a factoid that should register with a White House consumed in reducing trade deficits often by using economic brinksmanship, Rivkin said the entertainment industry registers a trade surplus with nearly every one of the 130 countries in which it does business.
The movie business is synonymous with red carpets and glitzy premieres, but Rivkin said that masks what is at its heart, a blue collar industry, one that supports 2.1 million jobs and $139 billion in wages every year.
“Those jobs and wages go to set builders and ticket takers,” he said. “Artists and engineers. We provide economic opportunity to more than 400,000 businesses across the country. Most of them are small businesses that employ fewer than 10 people.”
The speech wasn't just a dry recitation of statistics, cherry picked to suggest that the movie business bolsters local economies and enables thousands of people to put food on their tables. Rivkin cited his time as a diplomat to illustrate the power of movies to cross-cultural barriers and inspire people around the world. When he was in France, Rivkin said he arranged to have Samuel L. Jackson visit an impoverished neighborhood.
“When [people] complained about a lack of opportunity and other issues, [Jackson] told them the only reason the American dream worked for him was hard work,” Rivkin remembered. “Early in his career, he had to take unappealing roles. But he played those roles with everything he had. The roles got bigger and better, and he became successful. Sam told the residents to stop complaining and start working to fulfill their lives.”
The message resonated because Jackson arrived with a unique type of charisma.
“At that moment, he turned from Sam Jackson, movie star, to Sam Jackson, aspirational figure and ambassador for the American dream and, by extension, the entertainment industry,” said Rivkin.
It's nearly impossible to keep up with Ulta Beauty's happenings these days. Between the 21 Days of Beauty sale and the constant brand additions, there's enough going on to make your head spin. With news that Chanel beauty is coming soon to Ulta, the retailer has just given the makeup obsessed another good reason to loose their minds.
Ulta can't seem to stay out of the spotlight. The beauty mecca has added one internet-loved makeup brand after another to its repertoire— ahem, Morphe, Dose of Colors, ColourPop, and Storybook Cosmetics— and has even snatched up a few Sephora fan-favorites like Nars and Cover FX. It's enough to keep the retailer on every beauty lover's radar.
Offering both drugstore and prestige hair, skin, and makeup essentials, the massive retailer has always been a one-stop beauty shop. But now that Chanel Beauté will be making its debut in Ulta stores, the retailer is truly living up to its "all things beauty, all in one place" motto.
All of the juicy deets haven't been revealed, but word that Chanel is in fact expanding beyond their fragrances in Ulta is enough to celebrate. When you learn what's going down in stores, prepare to kiss your money goodbye.
The exciting announcement comes via a fourth quarter sales call between Ulta CEO Mary Dillion and the retailer's investors. There's no official word on which exact stores will receive Chanel merch and when the launch will roll out, but makeup lovers can expect to see the new finds on Ulta shelves soon.
"Following our long-standing partnership with Chanel offering their iconic fragrances in hundreds of our stores, we are honored to introduce Chanel Beauté in a small number of Ulta Beauty doors this year," said Dillon during the conference call. "This will be an edited assortment featuring a Chanel-branded makeup station with the first Chanel store opening in Westport, Connecticut, in just a few weeks."
The news may help explain Chanel's recent surge of Instagram content. As reported by Racked, The brand recently launched two beauty-specific accounts, @chanel.beauty, featuring posts generated by the brand, and @welovecoco, a source of regrammed content from beauty influencers and fans of Chanel makeup.
The brand that brought the industry the iconic quilted bag and Chanel No. 5 perfume, has some beauty offerings worth keeping you on standby. Among them are their cult-favorite Le Vernis nail lacquer, the Les 4 Ombres eyeshadow quads, and the Vitalumière Aqua Skin foundation. There's no telling which Chanel favorites will line shelves for sure, but that doesn't make the launch any less exciting.
Naturally, fans are so on board for the high-end additions, already planning to put their rewards points to good use.
You've got to give it up to Ulta for making such a major move.
Gone are the days of having to make a separate trip to a department store if you want to play in a luxury brand like Chanel.
It's convenience at its finest, not to mention many beauty lovers consider Ulta stores to have a much more lax shopping environment.
There was a bit of opposition, however, as some beauty lovers believe Chanel offerings in Ulta may tarnish the brand's luxury status.
Some even questioned whether the brand's founder would have signed off on such a deal.
Pushback aside, the news got many beauty lovers hype.
Shoppers can soon snatch up drugstore favorites and if they're feeling extra fancy, Chanel Beauté can make its way into their orange shopping bag, too.
Chanel coming to Ulta is major and it makes it hard to resist shopping at the beauty super center that really will have it all soon. As long as the retailer is upping their game like this, beauty lovers are going to have a hard time pinching pennies in the future.
The province's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has invoked its mandate after a woman received life-threatening injuries Monday morning outside of a downtown Toronto residence.
The SIU said Toronto police arrived at a St. Clarens Avenue house at around 4:45 a.m. Monday and a short time later officers found a 60-year-old woman between the house and another home.

The woman was then taken to hospital in life-threatening condition, the SIU said.
Toronto police, who said they can't comment further since the SIU invoked their mandate, tweeted out at 6:31 a.m. that officers were responding to an “unknown trouble” call near Lansdowne Avenue and College Street. Police said at the time officers found one person “in distress and injured,” adding the circumstances were being investigated.
SIU will be invoking their mandate in relation to this call, we cannot comment further. Questions can be directed to @SIUOntario ^ma — Toronto Police OPS (@TPSOperations) January 2, 2017
The SIU is an independent enforcement agency that investigates incidents involving police that have resulted in death, serious injury or alleged sexual assault.

A 16-year-old boy is being credited for saving his family and tenants when their Victoria home caught on fire.
Fire crews were called to the house fire on McClure St. in Fairfield at around 11:30 am on Monday.
“We knew pretty early on that the fire was deep seeded in the structure and we went from offensive to defensive,” said Deputy Fire Chief Dan Atkinson.
Mike McComb says he's the owner of the house. “My oldest son Sam got everyone out of the house. His two younger brothers and his grandmother. He attempted to put out the fire, but it got too big, so he made the right decision getting out.”
Neither McComb nor his wife were home, because they were at work.
Tenants living in the lower suite of the house were also alerted and got out safely.
From the outside, the damage looks extensive but McComb says it doesn't matter because everyone is safe.
“It's only stuff, my tv, my Xbox, clothing can all be replaced.”
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
Krzyzewski didn't think so.
"Ponds was really as good a guard offensively as we've played against," Coach K said. "We came in prepared."
Freshman sensation Marvin Bagley III scored 19 for Duke but sat out a significant chunk of the second half with four fouls. Wendell Carter Jr. added 14 points and 15 rebounds.
Outhustled all afternoon, Duke was coming off an easy win Monday over Notre Dame that followed a 65-63 loss at home to No. 2 Virginia last weekend.
"I thought they made us look bad, but we made ourselves look bad. We did not play basketball the first 32 minutes worthy of our program. And we had blank faces, we didn't talk, we were like five individuals out there and it was disgusting, really," Krzyzewski said. "I do not know why. I can tell you that's not the group I've coached all year, and they were a very frustrating group to coach today because they didn't respond to anything until the last eight minutes and that's unacceptable."
Winless in 11 Big East games this season, the Red Storm improved to 11-2 in nonconference play. They led by 11 with 6 1/2 minutes left before Duke stormed back and took a 73-72 advantage on Trent's two free throws with 1:35 to play, its first lead since early in the second half.
That brought fans of both schools to their feet for an exciting finish.
Ponds, who also grabbed seven rebounds in his second consecutive 30-point game, put St. John's back in front with a driving layup and then drained a contested 3-pointer from the wing with the shot clock winding down to make it 77-73 with 40 seconds left.
"We stayed composed," he said.
Greyson Allen's only 3 seconds later trimmed the margin to one, but Owens hit two free throws with 32.2 seconds to go.
Bagley made one of two foul shots with 20.4 seconds left and Ponds did the same to make it 80-77 with 17.5 seconds to go. Allen missed a 3 at the other end and Owens grabbed the rebound before sinking one of two free throws with 2.7 seconds remaining to seal it as Ponds waved his arms, spurring on the sellout crowd of 19,812.
"The Garden was rockin', no question," said Mullin, recruited by Krzyzewski out of high school in 1980-81. "Duke has that brand. They bring 'em in. ... I was glad our guys stepped up not only to the challenge, but on the biggest stage."
It was the first meeting between the teams since Krzyzewski got his 1,000th career win with a 77-68 victory at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 25, 2015.
BIG PICTURE
Duke: Fell to 34-19 at the Garden, including 29-11 under Coach K. ... The Blue Devils will be back in New York City next month for the ACC Tournament across the river at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. ... Duke leads the all-time series 16-7.
St. John's: After three competitive losses this season to teams currently ranked in the top 10, the Red Storm finally broke through. They have played the fifth-toughest schedule in the country according to the NCAA, the school said. "It felt like all those other games, it really did. But to come out on top feels much better," Mullin said. "To turn it around against one of the most storied teams in college basketball, it's great. ... I'm happy for the guys. They needed it more than anything."
FIVE STAR
The matchup between two of the top-10 winningest programs in Division I history was played in tribute to the late Howard Garfinkel, who ran the famous Five-Star Basketball Camp from 1966-2008, attracting many of the game's greatest players before they blossomed in college. The logo at centre court read "The Garf."
UP NEXT
Duke: Plays at North Carolina on Thursday night, the first of two regular-season meetings between the longtime rivals.
St. John's: In their first meeting with top-ranked Villanova this season, the Red Storm lost 78-71 on Jan. 13 at Madison Square Garden.

By Mike Fitzpatrick, The Associated Press
LAHORE - The Jamaat-e-Islami has proposed comprehensive electoral reforms to pave the way for impartial and transparent elections that could help establish a strong democratic system in the country.
The proposals included full administrative and financial autonomy for the election commission on the pattern of the Supreme Court, scrutiny of the candidates in the light of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution and election on 50 per cent of seats on the basis of proportionate representation. Highlighting major proposals of the JI, acting JI chief Liaqat Baloch said in a statement here on Wednesday that the staff of the election commission should be appointed on a permanent basis and the PEC should have full powers for appointments and transfers and taking administrative actions if necessary. He said that all political parties must be directed to hold internal elections in the supervision of the Election Commission in a manner that no family has control over a party and a true democratic spirit prevails. Baloch said that a mechanism should be developed to control the spending by the candidates and the parties during the election. He said that those indulging in overspending should be declared ineligible for election. Candidates should not be allowed to make transport arrangements on the election day; rather it should be arranged by the Election Commission, he proposed
. He said that spending on publicity by political parties should also be restricted. He was of the view that switchover to the proportionate representation system would help minimise election spending, reduce the clout of individual candidates and develop a tendency to vote for a manifesto.
The JI also suggested that polling stations for the ladies should be within one kilometre of their homes and special transport arrangements should be made for female voters. Female election staff should be posted at the ladies polling stations, it added.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea violated United Nations sanctions to earn nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports, according to a confidential report by independent U.N. monitors, which also accused Pyongyang of supplying weapons to Syria and Myanmar.
The report to a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee, seen by Reuters on Friday, said North Korea had shipped coal to ports, including in Russia, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, mainly using false paperwork that showed countries such as Russia and China as the coal origin, instead of North Korea.
The 15-member council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
“The DPRK (North Korea) is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries and the international banking system,” the U.N. monitors wrote in the 213-page report.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. Russia and China have repeatedly said they are implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
SYRIA, MYANMAR
The monitors said they had investigated ongoing ballistic missile cooperation between Syria and Myanmar, including more than 40 previously unreported North Korea shipments between 2012 and 2017 to Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which oversees the country's chemical weapons program.
The investigation has shown “further evidence of arms embargo and other violations, including through the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs,” the U.N. monitors wrote.
They also inspected cargo from two North Korea shipments intercepted by unidentified countries en route to Syria. Both contained acid-resistant tiles that could cover an area equal to a large scale industrial project, the monitors reported.
One country, which was not identified, told the monitors the seized shipments can “be used to build bricks for the interior wall of a chemical factory.”
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013. However, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect Syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability.

The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.
The U.N. monitors also said one country, which they did not identify, reported it had evidence that Myanmar received ballistic missile systems from North Korea, along with conventional weapons, including multiple rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles.
Myanmar U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said the Myanmar government “has no ongoing arms relationship, whatsoever, with North Korea” and is abiding by the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
BANNED EXPORTS, IMPORTS
Under a 2016 resolution, the U.N. Security Council capped coal exports and required countries to report any imports of North Korean coal to the council sanctions committee. It then banned all exports of coal by North Korea on Aug. 5.
The U.N. monitors investigated 16 coal shipments between January and Aug. 5 to ports in Russia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. They said Malaysia reported one shipment to the council committee and the remaining 15 shipments violated sanctions.
After the coal ban was imposed on Aug. 5, the U.N. monitors investigated 23 coal shipments to ports in Russia, China, South Korea and Vietnam. The U.N. monitors said all those shipments “would constitute a violation of the resolution, if confirmed.”
“The DPRK combined deceptive navigation patterns, signals manipulation, transshipments as well as fraudulent documentation to obscure the origin of the coal,” the monitors said.
The U.N. monitors “also investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation (of U.N. sanctions) ... and found that the network behind these vessels is primarily based in Taiwan province of China.”
The monitors said one country, which they did not name, told them North Korea had carried out such transfers off its ports of Wonsan and Nampo and in international waters between the Yellow Sea and East China Sea between October and January.
The report said several multinational oil companies, which were not named, were also being investigated for roles in the supply chain of petroleum products transferred to North Korea.
“Criminal Minds” stars Kirsten Vangsness and A.J. Cook have closed deals to return to the 13th season of the CBS series, Variety has confirmed.
Their new deals — and pay raises — come after actresses negotiated together to seek parity with their male co-stars, Joe Mantegna and Matthew Gray Gubler, who both closed their contracts last month.
Bringing back both Vangsness and Cook keeps “Criminal Minds” from another major cast shakeup, following last season's departure of Thomas Gibson, who was fired from the show after an altercation on set. Just this past weekend, Damon Gupton, who starred on the CBS procedural drama for just one season, was not asked back, due to creative changes for Season 13.
Vangsness spoke on record earlier this year about seeking a pay raise to put her on a closer pay scale to her male co-stars when TMZ asked if she would not return to “Criminal Minds” if she did not get a raise. “That's the way it works sadly,” she said. “I feel so uncomfortable about it and I feel so sad. You know what it would be telling me? That my value isn't what I thought what it was and in that case, I need to go get another job.” Speaking of Mantegna and Gubler, she continued, “There is the rationale that they're a little more popular or they've paid their dues a little more — that's absolutely true and that's why I'm not asking to be paid the same amount as them. I'm asking to be paid closer. Just closer.”
While the terms of the duo's new deals were not disclosed, Deadline, who first reported the news, says both actresses' salaries are now “essentially on par” with Gubler.
Vangsness and Cook have both been on the show since its debut in 2005, though Cook was not a series regular for the sixth season when the series made cuts; she was then asked back for the show's seventh season as a regular.

The Penticton United Church is erecting “no trespassing” signs and is demanding action to address homelessness and addiction as it grapples with increased drug activity around the church in the downtown core.
“We're finding more and more that transients and the homeless are coming to our building and using our fire escapes as a place to hang out,” said minister Laura Turnbull.
“We notice that they are indeed using drugs. We watch them shoot up as we are coming and going. They leave their drug paraphernalia behind as they move on.”

The church is also home to the Playshare Pre-School run by OneSky Community Resources.
“We have a playshare program that operates out of the church and so it's not safe for the little ones to have drug casings left behind,” Turnbull said.
The Penticton United Church is planning to erect “no trespassing” signs at the recommendation of police and city bylaw officers.
“We would welcome the opportunity to work with local government and organizations to try and deal with the current downtown problems in a more proactive manner,” said a news release.

“We know that there is a housing crisis in town here, we know that too many folks are dealing with mental health issues, that are dealing with addiction issues, and our agencies in town are doing the very best they can but it's just not enough at this point in time,” Turnbull said.
Turnbull recommends the City of Penticton and the Interior Health Authority (IHA) work together to open a supervised consumption site in the city.

A supervised consumption site is a legally sanctioned, medically supervised facility designed to reduce nuisance from public drug use. Individuals are able to consume illicit recreational drugs intravenously.
“We certainly know that in other communities, safe injection sites lower the risk for those who use drugs, that there is a better ability to keep the control on safety and that you can monitor the dosage with the drugs, so it just makes a lot of sense to have a safe injection site,” Turnbull said.

Patti Skinner, chair of the Penticton United Church council, echoes the sentiment.
“It's very sad, if they could have safe, clean drugs instead of buying them off the street.”
Anthony Haddad, director of development services with the City of Penticton, said IHA in consultation with B.C. Housing would be responsible for initiating an application to open a supervised consumption site.
READ MORE: City in crisis: Homelessness and drug use on the streets of Penticton
As far as the city's role, he said the “no trespassing” signs will allow the city to enforce local bylaws.
“For example, camping isn't a permitted use for a lot of those properties downtown, so that will increase our ability to enforce that matter.”
Haddad added that two affordable housing projects are currently under construction.

“B.C. Housing invested a lot of money and they've worked with the city on partnering on public land for the development of those facilities.”
From a policing perspective, Penticton RCMP Supt. Ted De Jager said the detachment has increased patrols in areas of concern.
He said a ‘Community Active Response Table' is also in the works, which seeks to address those at the most elevated level of risk to get them off the streets and into housing and/or treatment.
“Homelessness and addiction are not crimes. The duty of the police in dealing with this segment of the population is to build relationships with them in order to transition them to the support they need to move into a less vulnerable lifestyle,” he said.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Clergy in robes. A woman handing out flowers. Black Lives Matter activists. Armed militia members. Students. Angry anti-fascist protesters.
The diverse group of people who came to oppose a weekend gathering of white nationalists in this Virginia college town seemed to outnumber the rally-goers. The counter-protesting groups didn't organize collectively. Instead, it was a largely organic effort among groups who shared the same mission: showing that hate wasn't welcome.

“They just wanted to come out and say no. They wanted to come out and show a robust love for community and what America is meant to stand for,” said Lisa Woolfork, a University of Virginia professor and 17-year Charlottesville resident. “And I find that very heartening, very encouraging.”
Officials have not provided a crowd estimate, but there appeared to be at least 500 people supporting the rally sparked by Charlottesville's decision to remove a Confederate monument. At least twice as many appeared to be there to oppose them.
The violence between the groups erupted well before the event was supposed to start.

Neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members other white supremacists made their way to the park at the same time as counter-protesters, and the two sides clashed. People threw punches, screamed, set off smoke bombs, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Others darted around, trying to avoid the chaos.
“I've never seen that kind of hatred up front. It was pretty raw, pretty coarse,” scholar and activist Cornel West, one of the most high-profile counter-protesters, told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
There were pockets of peaceful resistance, too. One woman quietly handed out flowers. A group stood in a circle, hands uplifted, singing hymns. One man toted a tuba.
Volunteer medics bobbed in and out of the fray, helping people who had been sprayed with chemicals, and others passed out water and snacks.

Walt Heinecke, another University of Virginia professor, obtained city permits for events in two nearby parks, and counter-protesters used the sites as a place of respite.
Heinecke said he was surprised to see members of an armed leftist group who stationed themselves nearby, providing protection for people there.
Meanwhile, many of the rally attendees stood behind barriers officials had put up, waiting for the event to get underway. But the speakers never got the chance.
WATCH: Virginia rally…what happened
As the chaos grew, authorities declared it an unlawful assembly and forced the crowd to disperse. The rally leaders, including organizer Jason Kessler — a local right-wing blogger and activist — urged supporters to go home.
Kessler blamed the violence on police, saying they didn't do enough to maintain order and protect his group's right to free speech.
About two hours later, pockets of counter-protesters who had been marching through town converged on a downtown street. Hundreds were streaming along, cheering, and waving flags.
“There was a real feeling like we had driven them out of the town,” said Ross Mittiga, a UVA researcher who recently ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state House of Delegates.
That was quickly shattered when a car plowed into the crowd, hurling people into the air. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed and 19 others were injured. Just hours later, a state police helicopter that had been deployed as part of the response crashed in a field outside of town, killing two.
In blog posts after the violence, the Daily Stormer, a leading white nationalist website that promoted the Charlottesville event, pledged to hold more events “soon.”
Opponents said they'd be ready.
“We have got to keep fighting, keep the love in it, keep sacrificing for justice,” West said. “We have no choice at this point.”
Associated Press reporter Josh Replogle contributed to this report
Pastor David Daniels didn't really have a choice. The refugees were desperate. He could feel that. Their need was great. He could see that. But God was also talking and that, well, he could definitely hear.
So in 2015 he sponsored a Muslim family fleeing Syria and helped them settle in Fort Worth. What's happened at his church in the years since is a reminder of what decades of studying the Bible has taught Daniels — that God's will doesn't always aim toward the easy route. Enter through the narrow gate, the Book of Matthew prescribed.
If God did go for the smooth road, perhaps God wouldn't have put Daniels in the buckle of the Bible Belt — next to notches of Waffle Houses, Whataburgers and Wal-Marts — and ask him to welcome refugees at a time when the president of the country would rather keep them out.
The national anxiety over immigration and terrorist threats has been felt here in Texas, too, as members of Pantego Bible Church wrestle with their faith, their politics and even the nature of what it means to be a Christian.

The political DNA of his church, by Daniels' measure, is GOP. With exit polls showing 81% of white evangelical Christians supporting President Trump in November, he figured most at Pantego Bible Church voted for the Repubican, too. Still, he challenged his congregation to not follow the president's path. Since Daniels urged his church to embrace refugees, 300 members have left, some out of displeasure with Daniels' refugee policy.
“I realize not every church is for every person,” he said. “But there is an internal frustration. I just have to accept that it's OK for them to move on, and not take it personally.”
But most did not move on — the congregation still numbers 1,300.
Lupe Salazar feels the conflicting emotions of those who disagree with Daniels about refugees but have stayed with their church.
“I wish I had eight hands,” he said, gesturing with his God-given two after a Sunday service. “One the one hand, I agree with the president and extreme vetting, but on the other I know we are Christians and should welcome the stranger. But on the other hand, we need to be secure and safe.”
Salazar heads up security at the church. The first-generation American — and 100% Texan — served in the Marines and proudly recites his family's journey from Mexico to the Lone Star State. He voted for Trump.
He stayed at Pantego Bible Church because he has roots there and relationships there. His kids grew up there, and his faith has grown there, too. Mostly, he said, he feels that Daniels always listens to his perspective, even if they disagree.
He also respects Daniels' passion for the issue.
“I agree with his fundamental interpretation of God's Scripture,” Salazar said. “This isn't a political issue for David. It's deeper than that.”

Daniels' journey really began in 2009, when two African refugees displaced by war showed up at Pantego Bible Church after a Sunday service. One had come from a refugee camp in Tanzania and the other from Burundi.
The Burundi man, Method Bigirimana, told him they were looking for a place to hold a church service. Might they use a bit of space outdoors? Daniels helped coordinate a space indoors for them and Bigirimana brought about 150 refugees to the church.
Brett and Shannon Brier say Daniels expects a lot from his church and has been slowly building the congregation up to be welcoming of refugees. “You can't expect to come and not do anything,” she said.
The Briers sponsored a teenager who came from a refugee camp in Tanzania. They were inspired by Daniels and others in the church.
It was not an easy path.
Shannon Brier said the 17-year-old they took in spoke almost no English and seemed sullen and ungrateful for their help, and the pressure took its toll on the Briers' home life.
“Two weeks in and I was crying every day," she said. “Whatever we had thought it would be, it wasn't that.”

But both agreed their faith and the support of the church helped them. And Brett Brier said living with a refugee opened up them up to a different level of understanding.
Brett Brier, 38, who sports a thick beard and sounds like Matthew McConaughey, had just come back from taking Aline — the 17-year-old — from getting her driver's license and was having a drink at Starbucks. She seems happier now, they say. She's even active on her new Instagram account.
In talking to Aline and other refugees, he's learned they harbor deep psychological scars from trauma they escaped. Brier works in the medical field and says he knows of a doctor who came as a refugee but can't get work because he doesn't speak English. Many educated refugees can't land jobs on par with what they had in their homeland. That frustration explains what at first appeared to be ingratitude.
“In their home country, they were somebody,” he said. “Here, they felt like nobodies.”
Mohammad Afshoun can relate to that.
When he, his wife and six children arrived at the airport in Dallas after fleeing Syria and registering as refugees in Jordan, they didn't speak any English. His wife was pregnant.
He left a good-paying job as a mechanic at a shop he had taken over from his father. He had employees. An apartment. A life. Then came Fort Worth.
“I didn't know anything about Texas,” he said through an interpreter. “I didn't know if it was good or bad. I just hoped it was safe.”
Daniels and his wife, Tiffany, met Afshoun after they agreed they wanted to get more deeply involved in helping refugees. At Pantego Bible Church, the family's Muslim faith did not escape notice.
“You could feel a little bit of a tremor in our church,” Daniels said. “It was never huge, but you could feel it.”
More than a year later, Daniels is a regular visitor to Afshoun's apartment. On Friday, he stopped by to help with getting the family their green cards.
When he arrived, he was swarmed by Afshoun's children. Inside, a large meal was prepared. Afshoun, who hasn't been able to find work yet, recalled their escape from Syria. How he had gone to the supermarket with 4-year-old Yousef and left him in the car. When he came out, a soldier was holding a gun to his son's head.
“You need to raise him well, otherwise we'll kill him,” he was told.
He explained how their apartment was bombed while the family was visiting his wife's sister. They fled to Jordan and registered through the United Nations as refugees.
Afshoun said he wished Syria could return to what it once was. If it did, he would like to go back. He liked being a mechanic and fixing things. Afshoun smiled as he told Daniels about how, when he was 10, he took apart a radio just to put it back together again.

JACOBABAD - Coalition for Tobacco Control– Pakistan (CTC-Pak) officials Wednesday said: “Give priority to health over business” during their nationwide awareness activities from all over Pakistan on World No Tobacco Day.
CTC-Pak officials Jan Odhano, Nadeem Behrani, Qurban Ali and others said that tobacco is the primary contributor to 16 percent of all non-communicable diseases (NCDs) deaths particularly cardiovascular. And cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks are the 19 percent of the total deaths making it the highest NCD in Pakistan. Cancer and other chronic respiratory diseases account for the majority of other NCDs related deaths, they added.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) report, tobacco use disproportionately harms some of the world's most vulnerable populations. More than 80 percent of the world's smokers live in low-and middle-income countries, where the harms of tobacco use are further exacerbated by a lack of access to health care.
Tobacco use also creates economic burden, costing countries a staggering $1.4 trillion dollars a year in health care costs and lost productivity.
The global tobacco epidemic kills more than seven million people each year and in Pakistan, 108,800 deaths are associated with tobacco. This is an established medical fact that tobacco use is major cause of heart attacks or strokes in the country.
Jan Odhano said that the government is responsible for protecting people's health from tobacco exposure and for this purpose it has to strictly enforce the tobacco control laws in Pakistan to restrict access to tobacco. “We urge the government to take immediate action such as enforce the long delayed 85 percent Pictorial Health Warning (PHW) on cigarette packs to inform about health hazards associated with tobacco use,” he said and adding “We need to caution the smokers and others around him on priority basis. Unfortunately the decision for larger pictorial warning on cigarette packs in public health interest has not been implemented even after three years of its announcement in 2015.”
He further said that the government also compromised on tobacco tax this year as well by accommodating the tobacco industry by continuation of the third tier which allows most selling brands with the least tax.
The consumption has increased two folds. The government has already lost revenue during 2017, by playing into the hands of the tobacco industry. Cigarettes are cheaper now and accessible to anyone including children and youth, he added.
Nadeem said: “We need strict policies, enforcement measures and more awareness to better understand the laws and demand 85 percent PHW.” He said high authorities need to increase the taxes on tobacco to protect our present and next generation.
He added that Pakistan ratified and became a party to the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2004.
He said that after 14 years, Pakistan has still a long way to go in order to fulfill its international obligations by implementing stronger tobacco control policies. The Coalition for Tobacco Control – Pakistan is a coalition of more than 250 civil society partner organisations hailing from all four provinces of Pakistan and is working towards strengthening the development and implementation of tobacco control policies in Pakistan.

Azerbaijan, EU to end talks on strategic partnership deal by year-end
2017-06-14 20:37 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, June 14
Trend:
Azerbaijan and the EU plan to finish negotiations on a strategic partnership agreement before the EU summit, to be held by late 2017.
This was stated at the meeting of Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov and Luc Devigne, director for Russia, Eastern Partnership, Central Asia and OSCE of the European External Action Service, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said June 14.
A delegation led by Devigne is now on a visit in Azerbaijan to attend the next round of negotiations on the agreement.
During the meeting, the sides expressed satisfaction with the constructive and intensive course of negotiations. At this stage, the talks are ongoing on cooperation in the political and trade spheres.
In the upcoming June 16 talks, various aspects of cooperation, in particular in transportation, trade, communications, etc. will be discussed. A delegation headed by EU Commissioner for Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Johannes Hahn will visit Baku to participate in the negotiations.
The European Council adopted a mandate for the European Commission and the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy to negotiate, on behalf of the EU and its member states, a comprehensive agreement with Azerbaijan in November 2016.
The new agreement should replace the 1996 partnership and cooperation agreement and should better take account of the shared objectives and challenges the EU and Azerbaijan face today.
The agreement will follow the principles endorsed in the 2015 review of the European Neighborhood Policy and offer a renewed basis for political dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and Azerbaijan.

THE community of Pierrot in Vieux Fort North will continue the observance of Emancipation with the hosting of the second annual night of Dance and Traditional Cultural Games, called ‘”Swawi Jwe” (Night of Games).
The event takes place this Friday at the Pierrot Parish Hall from 7:30 p.m. and is organized by the Parliamentary Office in collaboration with the Positive Youth Uprising youth group from Pierrot. It follows an evening of drumming on Emancipation Night, which was organized by the groups Avot Sevis of Belle Vue and Soufriere Action Theatre (SAT).
The Night of Dance and Traditional Games will take the form of teaching /learning sessions. Older folk from the community will teach participants the patterns and meanings of dances and games that were reserved for wakes and burials in times past.
Vieux Fort North MP, Moses Jn. Baptiste, stated that while these traditional dances and games are fading, communities in Vieux Fort North are making a special effort to ensure that the patterns, games and dances, still flourish. He said there are many lessons of human cooperation and peace which can be learnt by all, through the use of our traditional cultural activities.
According to Jn. Baptiste, the evening of Dance and Games is critical to efforts throughout Vieux Fort North to create community cohesion, foster a greater understanding of the dynamics of the communities and help people value and respect each other.
The evening will be coordinated by experienced community and cultural animators from the Tanbou Mele drumming and popular theatre group and two elderly people from Pierrot. Participants will also be treated to Saint Lucia's age-old specialty of dumplings and cocoa tea.

ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):Azerbaijan and Pakistan have to establish direct banking channel and air connectivity, lift off tariff barriers, and create alternative rail and road network, as well as visa free regime to enhance bilateral trade relations, said President of the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) Zahid Latif Khan on the eve of Business Opportunities Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan.
The RCCI president added that there is a need to explore new avenues of joint ventures and trade connectivity under the umbrella of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
“CPEC has now become a reality on the ground. Pakistan would become hub of regional connectivity as CPEC would put it on a center stage due to new energy infrastructure and trade routes,” Latif Khan was quoted as saying by AzerNews.
The RCCI president concluded reminding that Azerbaijan has always been very friendly towards Pakistan, which was among the first three countries to recognize Azerbaijan immediately and reestablish diplomatic ties in July, 1992.
The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) is organizing Business Opportunities Conference and 31st International Achievement Award ceremony in Azerbaijan's capital city on July 4-5.
The events will be aimed at promoting business and investment opportunities of Pakistan in Azerbaijan's business community.
Over 450 Pakistani participants representing tourism, pharmaceutical, chemical, plastic, textile, surgical goods, furniture, food, construction and other industries will be attending the events.
Further, Pakistani and Azerbaijani business communities are going to hold B2B meetings.
Latif Khan also noted that this initiative would lead to creation of new joint ventures in the future.
What a difference a year makes.
Last year, streaming services nabbed 10 Golden Globe nominations between Amazon and Netflix (5 each) — an impressive haul, to be sure. But this year, they proved a force to be reckoned with on the awards scene.
While HBO retained its lead atop the list of most nominated networks at the Golden Globes, Netflix jumped to second place, with 9 noms (to HBO's 12). And while Amazon fell to just 3 noms (thanks to the snubs of “Transparent” and perennial Globes favorite “Mozart in the Jungle”) Hulu made its presence known with three nods for “The Handmaid's Tale.” That overall total of 15 noms outpaces broadcast, which only earned 8 overall (5 for NBC, 3 for ABC).
Netflix's surge to second place is credit to the wide range of series on the streamer. While the western “Godless” and serial killer thriller “Mindhunter” didn't make the cut, several others did: “The Crown” (2 noms), “Master of None” (2), “Stranger Things” (2), “13 Reasons Why” (1), “GLOW” (1) and “Ozark” (1). Netflix has two of the five contenders in the drama race, as it did last year: reigning champion “The Crown” and “Stranger Things.” “Master of None” broke into the comedy race, as did its creator/star Aziz Ansari.
It's no surprise that Hulu made its mark on the Globes: Its dystopian drama “The Handmaid's Tale” won near universal acclaim and captured the best drama trophy at this summer's Emmy Awards. Now the question for Hulu is what's next, beyond that show's second season. Buzzworthy 2018 offerings include the 9/11 thriller “The Looming Tower,” starring Jeff Daniels, and Beau Willimon's futuristic drama “The First,” with Sean Penn set to make his TV debut.
Globe voters have always had a love affair with Amazon — recognizing “Mozart in the Jungle” and “Goliath.” The streamer worked its magic again this time out, with two nominations for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and a surprise nod for Kevin Bacon in “I Love Dick.” They weathered the shutout of “Transparent,” which had to have been impacted by the sexual harassment allegations against series star Jeffrey Tambor. (Similarly, Netflix's “House of Cards” got shut out, but it's never been a major force at the Globes; Robin Wright landed the show's only nod last year.)
How this success will impact Amazon's 2018 strategy remains to be seen, as the streamer searches for a replacement for head of content Roy Price, who stepped down amid his own allegations of sexual harassment. The studio is said to be embracing a new programming strategy, mandated by Jeff Bezos, focusing away from niche series and more on high-end dramas with global appeal, like its upcoming adaptation of “Lord of the Rings.”
It didn't happen overnight, but the planned revival of a community garden in Otterburn Park is finally starting to bear fruit.
“We basically had a neglected garden with brush and trees and it had been let go for a few years,” said Brian Peddar, the Riverside School Board employee behind the project.

Peddar and others cleared an abandoned stretch of land behind Mountainview School that once had served as a community garden.
They put two elevated box planters in the garden for seniors last year and two more this year. The garden abuts a senior home and the Mountainview School.

The garden can now accommodate about 80 plants. Both seniors and Grade 2 students at Mountainview grow food to benefit a local food bank.
When Global News visited the site, people were planting garlic, strawberries, leeks and yellow beans.
“It is a bit of a responsibility,” said Brenda Coleman, a Grade 2 teacher at the school.
“I have watering teams, so each week there was a watering team of two or three children.”
Now, as the school year closes the students won't be able to tend to the seeds planted here. The Grain d'Sel food bank will take over. @Global_Montreal pic.twitter.com/hiHrNFl7O1 — Billy Shields (@billyshields) May 30, 2018
With summer on the horizon, the school year is nearly done.
Peddar said the Grain d'Sel food bank will take over the crops later in order to make sure the seeds started by the students go to the disadvantaged.

President Donald Trump prepared to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for talks that could shape the contours of future Middle East policy as Palestinians warned the White House not to abandon their goal of an independent state.
For decades, the idea of creating a Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel has been a bedrock U.S. position, though the last negotiations broke down in 2014.
But in a potential shift, a senior White House official said on Tuesday that peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestian statehood, and Trump would not try to "dictate" a solution.
Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But he has also spoken of a "state minus" option, suggesting he could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty.
Palestinians reacted with alarm to the possibility that Washington might ditch its support for an independent Palestinian nation.
"If the Trump Administration rejects this policy it would be destroying the chances for peace and undermining American interests, standing and credibility abroad," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in response to the U.S. official's remarks.
"Accommodating the most extreme and irresponsible elements in Israel and in the White House is no way to make responsible foreign policy," she said in a statement.
Husam Zomlot, strategic adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinians had not received any official indication of a change in the U.S. stance.
"NO GAPS"
For Netanyahu, the talks with Trump will be an opportunity to reset ties after a frequently combative relationship with Democrat Barack Obama.
The prime minister, under investigation at home over allegations of abuse of office, spent much of Tuesday huddled with advisers in Washington preparing for the talks. Officials said they wanted no gaps to emerge between U.S. and Israeli thinking during the scheduled two-hour Oval Office meeting.
Trump, who has been in office less than four weeks and has already been immersed in problems including the forced resignation of his national security adviser, brings with him an unpredictability that Netanyahu's staff hope will not impinge on the discussions.
During last year's election campaign, Republican candidate Trump was relentlessly pro-Israel in his rhetoric, promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, backing David Friedman, an ardent supporter of Jewish settlements, as his Israeli envoy and saying that he would not put pressure on Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians.
That tune, which was music to Netanyahu's ears and to the increasingly restive right-wing within his coalition, has since changed, making Wednesday's talks critical for clarity.
Trump appears to have put the embassy move on the backburner, at least for now, after warnings about the potential for regional unrest, including from Jordan's King Abdullah.
And rather than giving Israel free rein on settlements, the White House has said building new ones or expanding existing ones beyond their current borders would not be helpful to peace.
That would appear to leave Israel room to build within existing settlements without drawing U.S. condemnation, in what is the sort of gray area the talks are expected to touch on.
For the Palestinians, and much of the rest of the world, settlements built on occupied land are illegal under international law. Israel disputes that, but faces increasing criticism over the policy from allies, especially after Netanyahu's announcement in the past three weeks of plans to build 6,000 new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
A bigger national cotton crop last year has revved up cash flow earnings from ginning activities and cottonseed and lint sales to deliver a big boost in Namoi Cotton's consolidated net profit to $6.8 million.
The current season crop, now being picked, is tipped to generate even more cash flow.
Namoi's 2017-18 ginning throughput is expected to rise as much as 18 per cent on last autumn's 1.01m bales, thanks to an expected 23pc increase in the size of the total cotton harvest to about 4.6m bales.
Last season's total Australian crop was also up, by 38pc, on the 2.7m bale harvest in 2016-17.
Namoi, which shed its co-operative status last year to become fully listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, increased its profit for the year to February 28 by about $6.5m – up from just $300,000 in 2016-17 trading period.
Chief executive officer, Jeremy Callachor, said Namoi had notched up a strong financial performance on the back of the significantly bigger harvest across NSW and Queensland.
The company's full-year profit result coincides with a resignation announcement by long-standing independent director and influential rural accountant, Michael Boyce, who joined Namoi's board in 2002.
I feel the time is right to step down and for a change of stewardship to take the business into the future as a fully listed public company - Michael Boyce, Namoi Cotton.
“After almost 16 years of involvement, and with to restructure completed and representing a new era for Namoi Cotton, I feel the time is right to step down and for a change of stewardship to take the business into the future as a fully listed public company,” Mr Boyce said.
Chairman, Stuart Boydell, said the board was working through a director recruitment process as part of its succession planning following to restructure.
He said Mr Boyce had been a strong and effective contributor to Namoi and provided invaluable stewardship through the transition from a co-operative.
His counsel and guidance was greatly appreciated by his fellow directors.
Mr Boydell said the past trading year's strong operational performance and financial results had ensured the company could pay a final 1.9 cents a share dividend, equivalent to 40pc of net profit after tax.
Group earnings before before interest, tax and depreciation, restructure costs and business combination gains were up from $11.1m in 2016-17 to $23m.
Mr Callachor said ginning volumes last season increased 43pc, while cottonseed trading business had shipped and handled 266,000 tonnes, up from 172,000 the previous year.
Joint venture business with Louis Dreyfus Commodities, Namoi Cotton Alliance, had increased cotton lint sales from 507,000 bales to 636,000, but its containerised grain commodity packing venture lost ground, largely because of a reduced chickpea crop.
Commodity packing volumes dropped from 226,000t to 168,000t and the business was not anticipating the current year to deliver any notable increase.
However NCA expected to market between 700,000 bales and 800,000 bales of cotton from the current crop, or as much as 26pc more than it traded last season.
A fan of AMC's “The Walking Dead” and the graphic novels they were based on, Michael Cudlitz cared more about the story being told than whether or not he survived the zombie apocalypse.
Well, in some ways.
The departed Sgt. Abraham Ford, who was brutally killed by the barbed bat-wielding Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) at the end of Season 6, was a fan favorite who sacrificed himself for the sake of the group.
That physically taxing death scene, in which Negan bashes Abraham's skull with his bat Lucille, was an important one, but Cudlitz didn't want it to eclipse another character's demise.
“Being a fan of the show, I wanted to make sure that my death didn't take away from Steven's [Yuen] death. I was very concerned about that as a fan,” Cudlitz said when he stopped by The Times' video studio for a pre-Emmy chat.
“I'm kind of happy that a majority of the focus leaned on Glenn's death. Abraham had become part of the fabric of the show, but I felt that Steven [as] Glenn made the show. I watched him grow up as an actor… Steven and Melissa McBride … I felt they had the greatest arc that I enjoyed following most. They were sort of the heart and soul — so far as the direction, the moral compass, always pulling everybody back, especially after Hershel had passed.”
The most-read Entertainment stories this hour »
As Abraham bravely faced his fate, Cudlitz credited the writers with crafting the scene. However, it was Cudlitz who chose how Abraham would present himself to Negan.
“That was him being a soldier. He knew. He had assessed this whole situation. He knew that someone in this group had to go, and he is the ultimate solider was willing to take it for the next guy.”
Cudlitz was also familiar with his own arc after following Robert Kirkman's graphic novels. He knew the death was coming, and it was confirmed when writer Scott M. Gimple called him to set up a meeting.
“I knew, I mean, I knew it was time,” he said. “It's always sad to leave a place where the working conditions are fantastic, the stories were great, the people were great. I understand that [he had to die]. I processed that. But the actual leaving of that group, sure, it was sad.”
But actually watching himself being dispatched wasn't as dramatic an experience as much as a technical one.
“It's hard to separate all the technical stuff, because there's a lot of prosthetics involved up until the actual hit,” he said of the shooting of Abraham's death.
The grueling 12-hour scene was shot in frigid temperatures. The actors were on their feet for nearly four hours straight, Cudlitz said, and he had chosen to make Abraham stay upright, which he regretted 30 minutes into shooting.
“You know how the audience is going to react, but you don't react the same way, because you are so much a part of it.”
For him, watching it “was not a big deal.”
“For us, that moment is broken down into two nights of six hours each night of prosthetics. For us, [as actors], it's a very technical thing. So we're looking to see if that technically looks good rather than ‘oh my gosh, that's horrible.' When I saw Steven get beaten, it was horrific, because he was my favorite character.”
Watch Cudlitz's full interview below:
The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he'd seen his favorite characters get killed off. His favorite part about playing Abraham? "The fan reactions," he says.

A 43-year-old Carbondale man who police say collided head-on with another car while drunk Sunday afternoon fled while bleeding from the crash before being caught near his home.
Charles L. Wedeman, 166 Fallbrook St., left a trail of debris, including an empty case of Miller Lite and an assortment of empty beer cans, outside his vehicle near the crash by 9 Fallbrook St., Patrolman Aaron Haley wrote in a criminal complaint. Police received the call at 3:34 p.m.
Police saw that Wedeman's vehicle, identified as his through his license plate number, crossed the road's double yellow line and collided head-on with another vehicle.
Wedeman got out of his car and left the scene, bleeding from his face, police said. He left footprints in the snow, which police said traveled into some woods.
Haley located Wedeman near his Fallbrook Street home but Wedeman fled. Haley chased Wedeman for a short distance before taking him into custody.
Wedeman reeked of alcohol, police said, but refused to do a field sobriety test or a chemical test.
Wedeman received a bandage but refused treatment at a hospital, police said.
Wedeman is charged with driving under the influence and for leaving the scene of the accident. At the time of the crash, police wanted Wedeman for a separate warrant, filed in November, for recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct.
Magisterial District Judge Sean P. McGraw arraigned Wedeman on both cases Sunday and set bail at a combined amount of $10,000. He has preliminary hearings scheduled for Monday and Thursday.

KL Rahul last played an ODI in January this year More
​
What's the story?
MSK Prasad, Indian team's chief selector, has made it clear that Lokesh Rahul will bat at No.4 for India in the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. The 25-year-old, who made his comeback from injury in the Test series against the Lankans, is one of the fifteen members to face the hosts later this month in five ODIs and one T20I.
“He [Rahul] is too good to be left out of playing XI at the moment. [Shikhar] Dhawan-Rohit [Sharma] are in good form at the moment”, Prasad was quoted as saying.
In case you didn't know…
Injuries have halted KL Rahul's progress in international cricket, who made his ODI debut for the national team last year, hitting an unbeaten century on debut. His last ODI was against the visiting English side in January this year, scoring 11 in the series' final ODI at Kolkata, before a shoulder injury laid him low for the next few months.
In six ODIs, Rahul averages exactly 55, with a century and a fifty to his name.
The heart of the matter
Speaking to the media in Sri Lanka, MSK Prasad spoke extensively about building the Indian team in the lead up to the 2019 World Cup. With less than two years to go, the selectors have started identifying a core group of players who will form the crux of the team under Virat Kohli's captaincy.
Specifying that KL Rahul will bat at No.4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Prasad said that they need to identify someone at the top spot and give them a run for a few months to see how they fare. He also said that Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will continue to open for the team, just like they did in the Champions Trophy held two months back.
He said Rahul is the first player being tried at the No.4. spot, but others could also get a look-in at that position in the future.
What's next?
After the end of the final Test at Pallekele, the two teams will have less than a week to cool off, with the first ODI scheduled to be held at the Rangiri International Stadium in Dambulla.
Author's take
Barring a spate of injuries, KL Rahul has impressed one and all with his impressive strokeplay in all three formats, fitting in the Indian team seamlessly. Although he has played at the opening spot in all the six ODIs he has played till date, it is very difficult for him to displace the combination of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, who have, over the last two years, forged fruitful partnerships for India in limited-overs.
As Virat Kohli had recently mentioned, it is very important to give KL Rahul the required backing at the top most level, and the youngster will look to justify the confidence shown by the management on him.

President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the Nigerian army to partner other security agencies in the fight against insurgency. Represented by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, at the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Annual Conference in Ibadan, Buhari also reiterated his government's determination to fight insurgency in Nigeria.
"I want you to look ahead with the aim of sustaining the nation's democratic efforts. It is evident that the nation's armed forces have moved to the next level,” the president said.“The nation appreciates the enormous sacrifices of our gallant officers and pray for the repose of the souls of our soldiers whom we have lost in the course of enthroning sustainable peace in the country.”
He equally called on leaders in the country to key into the change agenda of the government. The week-long conference is an annual forum where senior officers in the army brainstorm on their activities.
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF/LONDON (Reuters) - Top managers at Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel have reached out to the European Commission to seek approval for a landmark joint venture deal, with legal experts and analysts saying they might have to sell assets to get it.
Germany's ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger and Chairman of Tata Steel Natarajan Chandrasekaran pose at a joint news conference after signing a final agreement on Saturday to establish a long-expected steel joint venture, in Brussels, Belgium July 2, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel on Saturday agreed to merge their European steel activities into a 50-50 joint venture, creating the continent's No.2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in combined sales.
Informal talks with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager began a few weeks ago and will likely address the issue of disposals in some niche areas, including packaging, the sources say.
Tata Steel Europe already has an asset sale programme underway.
“Even without knowing all the details of the transaction, much speaks in favour of discussing asset sales,” said Jens Steger, counsel at law firm Simmons & Simmons, who advised Monsanto on antitrust matters in the takeover by Bayer.
Steger said he had received several requests from third parties who are interested in becoming part of the process, adding these could, in theory, be competitors keen on assets that might come up for sale or shareholders who oppose the deal.
Earlier this year, larger rival ArcelorMittal was able to secure EU approval for its purchase of Italian group Ilva only after pledging to sell a string of businesses across Europe to address competition concerns.
NICHE PRODUCTS
Experts see few problems regarding crude steel production of the combined Thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel venture, which Moody's reckons will own just 14 percent of the European market, a distant second to ArcelorMittal's 29 percent, which includes Ilva.
“But there could be remedies with regard to niche products,” said a senior steel banker. “There you would have to sell individual parts. And that would not be a problem.”
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel would have about a 50 percent share of the European packaging steel, or tinplate, market, which could require them to dispose of some of those assets, a person familiar with the industry told Reuters.
“Our understanding is that while upstream consolidation does not raise red flags, downstream specialty products such as tinplate may require remedy measures,” Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said in a note.
Rasselstein, Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit, made sales of 1.16 billion euros in the fiscal year 2015/2016 and employs about 2,400 employees.
It is also unclear how an ongoing asset disposal programme at Tata Steel Europe, initiated before the signing of the joint venture deal, will play into antitrust negotiations.
It has put a number of assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels, and about 1,100 employees, or about 5 percent of Tata Steel Europe's workforce, would leave the group should all deals be realised.
“I would be surprised if antitrust considerations did not play a role here,” Simmons & Simmons' Steger said.
The European Commission and Tata Steel declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp also declined to comment, saying that merger control proceedings had not officially been opened yet.

CAMDEN — Passersby in Camden may have wondered recently why a group of 15 or so mostly young adults were briskly walking around the downtown area of Camden staring up at buildings, then clustering in a group, apparently to discuss the view.
The observers were witnessing Miami University's History 400S course, “The Hidden History of Small Town America”, taught by Doctor Steven Conn, on a Sept. 20 field trip to Camden. Doctor Conn had contacted Helen Whitesell, President of the Eleanor I. Jones Archives of Camden – commonly known as the Camden Archives – in late July to ask if the Archives would be willing to take the class on a walking tour of historical buildings and sites in the downtown area, and in particular the Camden Railway Station area.
Dr. Conn's syllabus for History 400S reveals the motivation for this particular course, and for the field trip: “The election of 2016 put a new focus on the fate, plight, and condition of rural America. And if we don't know as much as we should about rural Americans, then historians are partly to blame. While urban history is a thriving field within the discipline, there has been comparatively little research done or scholarship about the history of small towns and other rural places. Our job in this seminar is to rectify that situation. And we will do so by looking around us: at Oxford, at Butler County and in Southwest Ohio.”
Conn's students are being challenged to complete original research and write a formal research paper based upon primary and secondary sources. Going to the source is what put Camden on the HIS 400S field trip list.
“I was very excited to get Doctor Conn's call asking if a guided tour would be possible,” notes Whitesell. “And of course, it was something that we were happy to be involved with.”
Whitesell and co-guide, Archives volunteer, Cherry Anderson, began the tour in the Council Chamber of the recently reopened Camden Town Hall. When Anderson started the discussion by asking the students how many had actually ever lived in a small town of 5,000 or less, few hands were raised. Whitesell and Anderson discussed the Town Hall's history (built in 1889) before leading the group outdoors.
Using notes, information long committed to memory, anecdotal stories and historical photos they carried with them, Whitesell and Anderson discussed such local landmarks as the Dearth building that used to stand at present-day Veteran's Memorial Park, the Majestic Theater, the Doctor McQueen/Doctor McKinley home, the IOOF building, the White House Hotel (now 4J's Restaurant), the Railway Station Area, the Bohn Building, and more.
At each stop, student questions and Doctor Conn's insights and contextual remarks added to the experience.
The Archives plan to keep the material organized for this particular class tour, expand upon the walking tour concept to give additional tours to interested parties in the future, and perhaps also devise a self-guided historical walking tour map. For more information, contact Helen Whitesell at 937-452-3197 or Cherry Anderson at 513-796-0005.

Pipeline protesters are still dangling high above Burrard Inlet, determined to halt Kinder Morgan tanker traffic.
Seven climbers rappelled from the bridge Tuesday morning, while five additional climbers were on the bridge's catwalk.
Greenpeace Canada is taking responsibility for the aerial blockade, which it says is to protest the Trans Mountain oilsands oil tanker traffic.
The climbers say they are currently in the path of the oilsands oil tanker, Serene Sea, which is docked at the Vancouver terminal. They say the tanker was scheduled to leave port on Tuesday morning but is now being blocked from leaving by the climbers.
However, in a statement to CKNW, Kinder Morgan said: “There is no impact to our operations at this time as there are no vessels scheduled to arrive at or depart Westridge Marine Terminal [Tuesday] morning.”

Protesters say the goal is to get the attention of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
“I'm going to do whatever it takes to prevent this crude bitumen travelling through these waters,” protester William George, who is dangling from the bridge, told Global News Tuesday.

There are still "unknown numbers" of bodies in Grenfell Tower following the devastating inferno, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton has said.
At least 12 people died after the huge fire destroyed the block in north Kensington, west London, where flames could still be seen burning more than a day on from the disaster.
The commissioner said: "Tragically now we are not expecting to find anyone else alive. The severity and the heat of the fire would mean it is an absolute miracle for anyone to be left alive."
She said there are still "unknown numbers" of people in the building.
More than £1 million has been raised to help those affected as fire tore through the 24-storey building while volunteers and charities helped feed and shelter people who could not return to their homes overnight.
Ms Cotton said the upper floors of the building are still to be searched.
"Sadly we do anticipate the death toll will rise - we haven't done our searches of the top floors yet," she told reporters at the scene.

No doubt about it, Katherine Heigl has had a rough go of it lately. Her departure from "Grey's Anatomy" seven years ago earned Heigl a reputation for being "difficult" that, fair or not, she hasn't been able to shake.
Her film career fizzled out and her would-be comeback vehicle, the "Homeland" wannabe "State of Affairs," was canceled after just 13 episodes on NBC. Once the star of blockbuster romantic comedies like "Knocked Up," Heigl has more recently appeared in ads for cold medication and kitty litter -- a fact that seems to delight her detractors in a way that seems at least a little sexist.
Whether "Doubt," premiering Wednesday on CBS, will revive Heigl's career is difficult to predict, but — sorry, haters — it is a worthy, highly watchable effort. While a bit tonally uneven in early episodes and not especially groundbreaking — it is, at its core, yet another legal procedural — "Doubt" is elevated by witty banter and a stellar supporting cast.
Heigl stars as Sadie Ellis, a skilled and ambitious attorney at a famed New York City firm run by Isaiah Roth (Elliott Gould), a famed liberal lawyer seemingly inspired by William Kunstler, who represented the Black Panthers and members of the Weather Underground. Roth's idealistic mission, laid out in a speech recited from memory by his employees, is to stand by his clients so that they don't have to stand alone.
Like seemingly every dramatic heroine on the small screen these days, Sadie is an emotionally closed-off workaholic prone to romantic complications at the office. In this case, she falls hard for her client, Billy Brennan (Steven Pasquale), the son of a prominent politician and a hunky pediatric surgeon (swoon) who may or may not have killed his high school girlfriend. (Nobody's perfect, right?)
Of course, their budding romance presents an ethical minefield, and there is something a wee bit stereotypical about a female lawyer falling for a hot, but possibly homicidal, client (see also: HBO's "The Night Of"). But hey, in 2017 does anyone really care about conflicts of interest anymore?
"Doubt" weaves this soapy ongoing narrative in with cases of the week, loosely ripped from the headlines: a college student who wears a sandwich board denouncing the man who raped her; a schizophrenic young man who pushed a woman to her death on the subway tracks.
Despite Heigl's involvement, "Doubt" shouldn't be mistaken for a star vehicle. It's a well-cast ensemble piece that democratically spreads the drama among the supporting characters, including Dulé Hill as Albert, Sadie's colleague and close friend, and Laverne Cox as a transgender Ivy League graduate named Cameron. Cox's casting -- a first for a transgender actress in a series regular on broadcast television -- has gotten "Doubt" some early buzz. The series deals sensitively with Cameron's gender identity while also treating her as a fully realized person, and marks a major step forward for CBS, a network that has been criticized for its lack of diversity.
Though underused in early episodes, Gould is as appealingly avuncular as ever, while certified national treasure Judith Light is ferociously good in a few scenes as Sadie's mother, a former radical activist imprisoned for killing a state trooper. (And yes, Sadie has a few mommy issues.)
Created by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, former executive producers on "Grey's Anatomy" and "Madam Secretary," "Doubt" bears traces of both shows. But it seems more obviously influenced by "The Good Wife," and not just because it shares with it numerous cast members, starting with Pasquale and Dreama Walker as a naive second-year associate.
Like "The Good Wife," which ended its acclaimed run on CBS last year, "Doubt" attempts to blend high courtroom drama with moments of lighthearted comedy and sophisticated, rat-a-tat banter. It's a tricky tone to get just right, and there are some awkward attempts at irreverent humor early on, including a clunker of a joke about lupus. But there are also some genuinely funny one-liners. (After pulling an all-nighter at the office, Walker's character complains of smelling like "Scotch and MSG.") Heigl, who won an Emmy for her performance on "Grey's Anatomy," is particularly well-suited to this mix of melodrama and screwball comedy.
"Doubt" also delves into the moral ambiguity of the legal profession, particularly the ethical dilemmas faced by defense attorneys. In one episode, Albert struggles with whether to reveal information shared with him by a client convicted of killing a teenager, and finds his humanity at odds with his professional obligations. There are also knowing lines (“This isn't TV, the DNA's not coming back overnight”) that suggest the show is at least attempting to subvert the genre's most glaring clichés.
If anything, though, "Doubt" could do more to embrace this moral and narrative ambiguity, which was a hallmark of "The Good Wife."
Is Isaiah, Sadie et al idealistic crusaders, craven opportunists, or both? And how are they paying for their swank offices and designer wardrobes? Hopefully as the series progresses it will explore these fertile subjects with more depth. Similarly, the did-he-or-didn't-he cloud of suspicion surrounding Billy would be more convincing if the show really tapped into Pasquale's proven ability to be both ridiculously handsome and deeply menacing (exhibit A: his turn as Mark Fuhrman in "The People v. O.J. Simpson.")
This "Doubt" ought to sow a little more doubt.

THERE was a happy ending after this stolen dog was reunited with its grateful owners after two months apart.
Ellie the chocolate spaniel was spotted wandering near the Paices Hill traveller's site in Aldermaston by police and public protection partnership (PPP) staff inspecting the caravan site last Wednesday.
Pc Matthew Allen said there was no evidence to suggest that travellers in Aldermaston were responsible for stealing Ellie.
“She was on a public highway that goes through the site and she was just wondering around there,” he said. “She could have come from anywhere.
“It was chucking it down with rain and we saw this poor little dog.
“It was dragging its back leg around and was sad and bedraggled.
“It didn't have any shelter and it was drowned. I thought ‘I've got to do something about it'.”
Ellie received treatment, but no one came forward to claim her and she was taken to a
local vet, where she was scanned and a microchip was found – but it had not been registered.
Pc Allen said that because of birth defect in Ellie's leg, combined with mange, the vet was going to put her down on the Thursday morning if no one came forward to claim
her.
Dog owner Pc Allen said: “Once the vet said we are probably going to put it down I went home and I thought ‘have I done the right thing?'”
But through the power of social media, police and council staff, her owners were tracked down in the nick of time to save her.
Dog warden for the partnership, Mandy Dorman, posted on Dog Watch and Dog Lost to see if anyone had lost a spaniel, which received hundreds of responses.
After going through all of the responses and checking their lost dog register, the partnership established that two spaniels had been reported stolen from the Arborfield area in November.
Ellie was reunited with her owner the next day, but their other spaniel, Daisy, is still missing.
Pc Allen said that police were appealing for information on her whereabouts and anyone with information should call 101 to speak to Pc 5110 Allen.
He said: “I'm a dog owner myself, they are part of the family.
“It does get to you.
“The third dog had been pining for the other two.”
He added that stolen dogs were rarely found and that Ellie's story had provided a bit of job satisfaction.
PPP chairman Norman Jorgensen said: “What a great example of multi-agency working this has been.
“Working with Thames Valley Police, the public protection partnership has managed to return another stolen dog back to its rightful owners.”
He urged dog owners to register their pets' microchips with a vet or by contacting the relevant microchip database company online or by phone.
The public protection partnership is a shared service provided by Bracknell Forest Borough Council, West Berkshire District Council and Wokingham Borough Council.
Call the partnership on (01635) 519171 to find out more about microchipping your dog.
Huntington Beach planning commissioners reviewed a draft of the city's updated general plan Tuesday, providing sparse feedback on the document that will guide the city's development decisions through 2040.
The state-mandated general plan, not comprehensively updated since 1996, is expected to change little of Surf City's existing development blueprint.
According to city reports, it doesn't add any new specific plans or modify the maximum density requirements. It also doesn't change any existing residential zoning designations or propose new residential areas, but it does allow for residential growth in current residential areas.
During Tuesday's hearing, Commissioner Dan Kalmick spoke more than his colleagues, providing a long list of issues he'd like to see considered, such as policies related to autonomous vehicles and an analysis of how the Breitling air show could affect Bolsa Chica wildlife.
City officials have been working on the general plan update since 2013, when the City Council voted to hire planning consulting firm Michael Baker International to assist with the process.
The plan, which will need final approval from the council, is scheduled to return to the Planning Commission in a study session June 27. The panel will discuss its environmental impacts.
City Hall will hold a public hearing on the draft Aug. 15. The council will host one Sept. 18.
The public can review the draft EIR at hbthenextwave.org/documents.
Comments on the EIR must be sent by July 7 to Villasenor by email at jvillasenor@surfcity-hb.org or by mail at 2000 Main St., Huntington Beach, CA, 92648.

Manitoba Moose forward Darren Kramer will have to serve a suspension next season before he can play in a game.
The American Hockey League issued Kramer a three game suspension on Monday for his actions in the Moose final regular season game last Friday. Since the Moose season is already over Kramer will serve his suspension the next time he's on an active AHL roster.
Kramer was involved in a fight from the Moose bench in their win over the Cleveland Monsters. During a second period altercation in front of the bench, Kramer grabbed Monsters forward Jordan Maletta and the fists started flying.
RELATED: Manitoba Moose win fight filled finale
Kramer was given a five minute fighting major and a 10-minute misconduct for fighting off the playing surface. Both Kramer and Moose head coach Pascal Vincent were ejected from the game following the incident.
Kramer had three goals with one assist and 89 penalty minutes in 42 games with the Moose last season.
The Moose finished the season in seventh place in the Central Division to miss the playoffs for the second straight year.
The drama. The loyalty. The speculation about who stays and who goes. The Trump administration has it all. And so did Donald Trump's run on The Apprentice.
The personality that made the show a hit is also what propelled Trump to the presidency. But as with his administration, Trump also stirred controversy on the set. A former producer tells the NPR podcast Embedded that at times Trump used "really unfathomably despicable words" while the cameras were rolling — remarks that have never been made public.
Of course, people weren't watching then for insight into how the show's star would eventually approach the presidency or what effect it would have on his public political image. But in retrospect, there are a handful of lessons that say something about the man now in the Oval Office.
1. Questionable language
In October 2016, just before the election, an Access Hollywood tape emerged of Trump using crude language about women, saying, "[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." When that story broke, former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt tweeted that there were "far worse" tapes from Trump's time on that show.
Pruitt says he does not have the tapes and has signed a nondisclosure agreement, but he tells NPR that the comments he was referring to were racist in nature and included remarks about African-Americans and Jews. Pruitt says Trump's language was not a reflection of the culture of the crew — that at times there would be an "audible gasp" from those who heard the comments.
A White House spokesperson called Pruitt's story "the same recycled and false attacks from over a year ago."
There have been multiple accusations of Trump publicly using inappropriate or offensive language. He started his campaign by referring to immigrants as "rapists." This summer after the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., Trump was widely criticized for not immediately denouncing white supremacists and instead spreading blame to people who were counterprotesting the neo-Nazis and KKK members. Those comments follow a history of ambiguity on white nationalism, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported.
2. A businessman with baggage
The first time Trump appears in the pilot episode of The Apprentice, he's seated in the back of a black limousine, introducing himself directly to the camera.
"My name's Donald Trump," he begins, "and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York." He lists off his holdings: buildings, casinos, golf courses, model agencies and much more.
Then he briefly hints at his past financial challenges.
"But it wasn't always so easy. About 13 years ago I was seriously in trouble," he says, in reference to four bankruptcies involving his properties in Atlantic City and New York in 1991 and 1992.
"I was billions of dollars in debt," he continues. "But I fought back and I won, big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out. Now my company's bigger than it ever was — stronger than it ever was."
In all 14 episodes of The Apprentice's debut season, these 20 seconds are the only substantive acknowledgement of the rocky financial history some of Trump's businesses had faced. From then on, the show consistently paints Trump as a triumphant underdog, with his troubles squarely behind him.
"Donald Trump is an icon," contestant Kwame Jackson told the producers in the season finale. "He's someone who, when people said, 'You couldn't do it,' always got it done." That's a sentiment also echoed by Trump supporters during the campaign.
Multiple episodes were set at Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which he described on the show as "the No. 1 hotel in Atlantic City." Flattering shots of the exterior and interior portray the resort as thriving.
In fact, the Taj Mahal, along with other Trump casinos, would file for bankruptcy in late 2004, just months after The Apprentice debuted.
Still, Trump's business savvy was part of his pitch during the campaign, and many who voted for him looked forward to having an outsider perspective on the inside. Despite his bankruptcies, Trump largely maintained his image of success.
3. Ever the salesman
Every episode of the show centered around a task — a business-related contest between two teams. Who can make the most money selling lemonade on Wall Street? Managing the Times Square Planet Hollywood for a day? Fixing up and renting out an old apartment? The winning team, besides steering clear of a scolding from Trump inside his dimly lit boardroom, would receive a reward.
Sometimes these rewards were simply a chance to visit classic New York landmarks: a private tour of Yankee stadium or a boat trip around the Hudson Bay. But more often than not, the rewards also showcased and elevated Trump's wealth and business acumen.
There was the walk-through of the extravagant penthouse in Trump Tower where Trump and his then-girlfriend Melania, now wife and first lady, lived; the picnic at Trump's estate in Bedford, N.Y. ("where the richest people live," Trump narrates); the driving range at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. ("the best golf course in New York state"); the overnight stay at Trump's Taj Mahal casino ("you're staying in the most beautiful suite you've ever seen"); the jaunt to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort ("the No. 1 club anywhere as far as I'm concerned").
In Episode 9, one contestant's savvy business move earns him a reward of 10 minutes with Donald Trump. "You know, a lot of people would like that opportunity," Trump tells a visibly appreciative Nick Warnock.
Trump's financial ties have followed him to Washington, with watchdogs arguing for further separation from his businesses. Trump and his lawyers argue they have done enough by setting up a trust, rather than fully divesting as past presidents have done.
Even amid criticism of being too close to his businesses while in office, Trump has spent many weekends at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., and his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. His hotel in Washington, D.C., has raised concern about whether world leaders would spend money there to curry favor with the president. And Trump hasn't shied away from talking about his properties. Even during controversial remarks about Charlottesville, Trump took to the opportunity to mention his winery in the area.
4. Loyalty is paramount
It didn't take the president's unearthed conversations with former FBI Director James Comey to remind the public of how highly President Trump values loyalty. But the clues were also there in 2004, particularly during the firing of one contestant named Tammy Lee.
In the seventh episode, as Trump dissects the losing team's failure as they sit before him, Lee breaks with the rest of her team to bluntly blame the team leader for having done a poor job of negotiating. Trump questions the rest of the team about Lee's dissension, asking, "Was she honest or disloyal?"
The team and Trump agree Lee had not shown enough loyalty.
"Your disloyalty has been just terrible. ... I mean it is so obnoxious in this particular case," Trump tells Lee as the music swells, signaling he would soon deliver his signature sentence: "Tammy ... you're fired."
Comey has testified that the president asked for his "loyalty" and for him to end the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump denies ever asking for a loyalty pledge, but it has been clear that Trump does expect loyalty from his team — even if he does not always reciprocate.
5. Trump can stoke a fight, even between others
From the start, Trump was one of the executive producers of The Apprentice (even into his presidency). And, like any good reality television producer, he appeared to have a gift for identifying and, in some cases, amplifying squabbles between contestants.
Take a tense scene in the boardroom in Episode 6. Trump is interrogating the losing team, leading to the typical chain of recriminations. Controversial contestant Omarosa Manigault (now an aide to the president) begins by complimenting her teammate, Heidi Bressler, before also adding that when she first met Bressler, she didn't think she had much class.
"Do you think Omarosa has class?" Trump asks Bressler, looking for a response to her teammate's backhanded compliment. He adds, "If somebody said that about me, I wouldn't like her. I don't care what they do."
Trump then turns to another contestant, Jessie Connor: "Do you like Omarosa, the way she just talks to you? I mean do you like her?" Connor refuses to take the bait, instead trying to keep the peace by saying she does in fact like her teammate.
But Trump isn't finished sussing out the conflict.
"How can you like her, the way she's talking to you? You know she's got a very sharp edge," he says about Manigault. And on it goes.
The president has had his share of direct Twitter wars since taking office, but he also has a history of publicly stoking feuds between others.
During the campaign, Trump created divides to his advantage. He tried to create a chasm between Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas on one side and Marco Rubio of Florida and now-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. In October 2016, he reminded supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., how Hillary Clinton had wronged them, saying, "To the Bernie Sanders people, you got sold out." In September, following a wave of kneeling protests by professional sports players, the president sought to remind the public of what he perceived to be a newly forming divide between the NFL's athletes and its fans.
6. On ratings and popularity
Trump has never struggled with being known, which made the first season of The Apprentice a huge success. Instead, his challenge has been to be seen as "favorable."
The show's first season in 2004 was a game-changer for a network in trouble. NBC, which was just about to lose its blockbuster hit Friends, saw over 20 million viewers settle in each week to watch Trump preside over the fates of 16 young entrepreneurs vying for a job with his company, The Trump Organization.
Attracting 28 million viewers, the April 2004 season finale was the most popular show on television that week. According to opinion polls conducted by Gallup, when Trump flirted with a presidential run under the Reform Party ticket in 1999, the percentage of respondents who saw him as "favorable" declined precipitously: from 41 to 33 percent in less than a month. But in 2005, one year after The Apprentice debuted, Trump clocked in at 50 percent.
Trump had never before — and he would never again so far — eclipse the 50 percent mark in Gallup's polls. As of Oct. 5, nearly nine months into his presidency, Trump is at 39 percent. However, what has been a historically low approval rating for a first-term president recently stabilized.
2018 marks the year we wave goodbye to a number of retail and restaurant brands, with the likes of Toys R Us, Maplin and Carpetright being just a few of the biggest names who are closing down.
High street retail giants Debenhams and House of Fraser recently announced plans to close a number of their department stores resulting in hundreds of job losses, while eateries Prezzo and Jamie's Italian are also shutting some of their branches.
British Home Stores was founded in 1928 and managed an impressive 88 years of trading
With online shopping and services such as Deliveroo and Just Eat providing consumers with a more convenient alternative to trawling the city centre streets, it's likely these won't be the last closures of 2018.
Here are a few other big brands we've bid farewell to over the years.
Allders
It was once one of the biggest retail chains in the UK but after running into financial difficulties, the company went into administration in 2005 with all but one of its 45 stores forced into closure.
Allders department store closed down in 2005, after the company went into administration
The Croydon store continued trading until 2012 after it was purchased by Harold Tillman, owner of the fashion chain Jaegar, but it was later closed for good on 17 January 2013.
Woolworths
Famed for its pick 'n' mix sweets, school clothing and stationary offering, Woolworths may have been a popular stop on the high street but it was forced into administration in 2008, after struggling with £385 million of debt.
Its 800 stores were closed down and more than 27,000 people lost their jobs.
Renting videos, DVD and games is now a thing of the past, thanks to the rise of online streaming
Blockbuster
It may now be considered old school, but heading out to rent a DVD on an evening was the thing to do before online streaming came about.
It was once the place go for entertainment, but it met its demise in 2013 and its 528 stores are no more.
Lewis's
The British sports retailer met it end in 2012 after its share collapsed to 1.2 million
Opened in Liverpool 1856, Lewis's was a much loved department store and its flagship home store served as the location of the world's first Christmas grotto in 1879, entitled 'Christmas Fairyland'.
The company went into administration several times over the years, but it saw its final day on 29 May 2010 having been hit by the recession and been unable to compete with rival brands.
BHS
It managed an impressive 88 years of trading, but the clothing and houseware stores presence on the high street came to an end in 2016 having failed to meet competition posed by other brands.
However, a website is still up and running and offers plenty of bargain prices.
JJB Sports
The sports retailer was the place to go for all of the latest active wear and sport equipment, but it met its end in 2012 having dropped from being worth £500 million in 2010 to a mere £1.2 million just two years later.
Rival retailer, Sports Direct, bought the brand name, website and twenty stores in October 2012 for a cost of £28.3 million, saving around 550 jobs.
Comet
The electrical retailer saw its final day on 18 December 2012 after a long 79 years of trading.
Its 236 stores were closed and its bitter end cost the government around £49 million in redundancy payments.
Zavvi
It once boasted more than 100 stores around the UK, but the entertainment retailer - originally Virgin Megastore - vanished from the high street in 2009, although its website is still up and running today.
Borders
Having suffered from competition posed by online retailers and cut-price supermarkets, Borders bookshop met its last chapter in 20009, with financial difficulties leading to the closure of its 45 UK stores.
Comment Oracle is industry's single largest database vendor. That was great during the days before cloud and open source.
Now, however, the on-prem RDBMS giant faces a challenge – a challenge compounded by cloud. According to Gartner, Oracle owns a tiny sliver of the cloud infrastructure market – 0.3 per cent. But that tiny figure doesn't quite explain how this also hurts Oracle's database business.
A developer's first decision is a cloud platform. The database they elect to use then follows from the options made available by that cloud platform. By making it cost prohibitive to run Oracle DB on the public clouds that developers actually use – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – Oracle has tied its database future to the mast of its sinking cloud ship, with open-source databases reaping the benefits of its myopic strategy.
Opening up the database
Yes, open-source databases. While databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Apache Cassandra have long scored points with web developers, historically they didn't compete on Oracle's core database turf. That was then, this is now. According to recent Gartner analysis, open-source databases now constitute 7.6 per cent ($2.6bn) of the global database market, worth $34bn. If that doesn't seem like much, consider that over the past two years the open source DBMS market averaged 75 per cent growth, compared to a more tepid 7.7 per cent growth in the total market.
Where is that growth coming from? In part, it reflects developers' desires to run new applications with modern databases. Those decisions have been made much easier by AWS, in particular, which has taken many of the most popular open source databases and turned them into services, removing the complexity of managing them. As such, according to DB-Engines, which ranks database popularity across a number of factors, half of the world's most popular databases are now open source.
Widen that aperture a bit and you get MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, in the 15th spot. Widen it even further, and you see a host of other open source databases, and particularly those that AWS has turned into cloud services, roaring up the popularity charts.
As noted, developers are increasingly turning to the cloud for their databases, spurring a host of database services from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to rocket up DB-Engines' rankings. For those that want the option of running a database in the cloud or in their datacenter, the primary choice is between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
The former is often the preferred choice for a developer that wants to stick with a relational database but wants to remove the cost or complexity of Oracle. MariaDB is also increasingly an option for this crowd. MySQL, somewhat out of favor since its acquisition by Oracle, has been declining in popularity over the last several years.
The other option, MongoDB, gets picked when a developer is refactoring her application and needs a significant boost in developer productivity or the scale-out architecture that MongoDB's document database affords. Either way, the choice is for open source, not Oracle.
It would be comforting to the Oracle faithful to believe that this open source onslaught isn't having an impact on the database behemoth. It would also likely be wrong. In a conversation with Gartner analyst Merv Adrian, he noted that Oracle has lost market share every year since 2013. As a club, the top-five database vendors have seen their collective share of the market drop from 91 per cent to 86.9 per cent since 2011. While open-source databases can't take all the credit for that slide, what with proprietary cloud databases like Amazon DynamoDB or Microsoft CosmosDB also in play, it's almost certain that open source databases are wreaking havoc to the tune of billions of of dollars.
Nor do those dollars tell the whole story.
Gartner, after all, measures market share based on revenue. Open source databases, however, are used for free far more often than they are used “for fee.” Recognizing this fact, Gartner posits that “a good overall rule of thumb is that paid customers only account for 1 per cent to 5 per cent of the actual user base.” In other words, open source databases may earn $2.6bn for their vendors, but they annihilate orders of magnitude more paid value that other vendors like Oracle might otherwise earn.
But wait! It gets worse for Oracle.
Making developers happy
The biggest risk to Oracle is not the cost of an open-source database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. While license fee savings from open source hit 100 per cent, open-source databases also yield significant savings in hardware costs. All in, companies can expect to save 70 per cent by shifting from Oracle to a database like MongoDB (even once you account for the cost of migration, re-skilling DBAs, etc.) On the AWS platform, the list price for running Oracle (RDS) is $25.68 per hour. Running PostgreSQL or MySQL (RDS) is 1/8th to 1/10th that cost.
As big as those savings are, however, the bigger cost differential derives from developer and DBA productivity.
For DBAs skilled with Oracle's database, they can often manage up to 25 database servers, on average. That same DBA can manage a million database servers on Amazon's RDS, thanks to the benefits of automation. Talk about scale.
On the developer side, given that developers are the new kingmakers, as Redmonk likes to remind us, shifting to an open-source DBMS is much more about super-charging developers than any belt-tightening exercise around license or hardware costs. Mat Keep, director of product marketing at MongoDB, put this in a personal context:
When I joined MongoDB, about 5 per cent of all projects were relational migrations - now it's 30 per cent as companies look to transform. Cost can be a factor, but more often it's development speed and running at scale. It's not unusual to see developer productivity up 3 to 5x after switching [from an RDBMS], coupling MongoDB with a shift to cloud, microservices, and agile/devops.
Even in areas where Oracle likes to trumpet the richness of functionality it offers, like Oracle HA, the reality is that much of the “richness” is actually external to the database itself. You “have to add a ton of stuff outside of the database [to make it work] for replication, failover, monitoring, etc,” Keep says. Of course, this being Oracle, each of these add-ons is sold separately, resulting in a fat price tag and a seriously complex system to manage. Even worse for Oracle, the only way for a developer to get access to such Oracle extras is on the Oracle cloud, which basically no one wants to use.
Nor are such add-ons all that revolutionary. On its latest earnings call, Oracle said, with a straight face, “[T]he amazing thing about the autonomous database is it's the only database in the planet that requires no human labor to administer the database.”
This is 100 per cent false. Behind the scenes Oracle has scads of people running around to keep the lights on, even as AWS and other cloud vendors deliver truly automated databases at dramatically bigger scale. If anything, Oracle is way behind the cloud versions of open source databases.
But, but, but…
Of course, there's a reason Oracle continues to make bajillions of cash selling its database: it has decades of experience building databases, and does so very well. The problem, however, is that what worked for Oracle 10 or 20 years ago is looking less and less ideal today. Its strengths like serious scale-up architecture are now relics of a bygone era.
Name the last big company to stake its future on Oracle. Salesforce probably comes to mind, though rumors have rumbled that it's not happy with its choice. Meanwhile, the other big SaaS companies like Workday have been building on open-source databases like MySQL, often running them on AWS or other clouds. As enterprises move to distributed computing, they're trying to minimize the cost of failure, separating, for example, storage from compute. As they do so, Oracle simply isn't a consideration.
Open-source databases like PostgreSQL and MariaDB remove the bureaucracy inherent in acquiring Oracle's database. PostgreSQL, in particular, has made it relatively straightforward to migrate things like stored procedures from Oracle to PostgreSQL.
Even non-relational databases like MongoDB have obviated the need to stick with Oracle. Oracle has conditioned developers and DBAs to think such relics of relational data modeling – like multi-record transactions – are essential. They're not, and more companies are discovering that they either don't need the “full-fat” Oracle database and can go with a lower-cost relational open-source database, or they're seeing that they don't need a relational database at all and can instead benefit from increased developer productivity and improved scale that a NoSQL database (with ACID guarantees) like MongoDB offers.
What does this mean to Oracle? Given how much friction is involved in moving to alternative databases, Oracle's database should last a long, long time. Much more likely is the fact that we'll see all the growth go to open-source databases and cloud databases (with particular growth in those databases that are both open and cloudy). Expect, also, Oracle to keep buying SaaS companies as its future becomes fueled more by SaaS applications and much less so by database dominance. ®

Needed for Northern Gas & Power Stadium: Mirrors. Lots of mirrors.
For Hartlepool United's players and coaching staff to have a look at themselves.
Make no mistake, Pools are destined for relegation.
The hurt felt by those players who collapsed to the floor on Dean Whitestone's full-time whistle at Brisbane Road will be nothing compared to the pain of that fall through the Football League trapdoor.
Pools were utterly clueless at both ends of the park and weak in between as they were outplayed and outfought by the worst League team in the country.
Leyton Orient extended their stay in League Two by at least five days thanks to only their fifth home victory of the season and 10th in total.
Top marks must go to the Eastenders, who fielded just THREE senior players, the rest were run-all-day kids who did their young caretaker boss, Omer Riza, their shirt and club proud.
Their opponents should be hanging their heads.
There will never be a better opportunity to put some daylight between themselves and Newport in 23rd.
With the Welsh side annihilated 6-1 at Plymouth, even a streaky 3-2 win for Pools, while undeserved, would have been welcome.
But Pools could not hit the proverbial cow's rear with a banjo.
Dave Jones's side have a one-point advantage over County but, despite their thumping yesterday, you'd put money on them beating Accrington and Notts County at home.
That means Pools probably need to win at least two of their last three fixtures - Barnet (H), Cheltenham (A) and Doncaster (H).
Jones fronted up afterwards - lesser men may have despatched their assistant to face the Press - but his assertion that some players “froze” beggars belief.
If they freeze at, no disrespect to the O's, an inferior team four fences from home, what are they going to be like against Barnet on Saturday, when anything less than a win is almost certain to put them in the bottom two?
Or at Cheltenham, who seem to be making a successful fist of their fight for survival?
Or at home to championship-chasing Doncaster in the last day of the season when the club could fall out of the Football League?
No, the Pools team need those mirrors to see whether they are mice or men?
Very few emerged from yesterday's embarrassment with any credit.
Yet, it could have been so different.
Leyton Orient are bottom for a reason - they can't keep the ball out of their net.
And when Rhys Oates gave Pools an eighth-minute lead, that should have been the cue for them to take the game by the scruff of the neck and put the O's to bed.
Oates did well, showing strength and composure under heavy pressure to beat Sam Sargeant from six yards.
The lead lasted 10 minutes as Pools were undone by two teenagers.
Michael Clark skinned Liam Donnelly down the right and his low cross was slammed in high and first time by Victor Adeboyejo, giving Joe Fryer little chance at his near post.
Pools though again exposed Orient's fallibility at the back five minutes later when Oates did great work to release Padraig Amond.
The top scorer laid it on a plate for Lewis Alessandra who had the whole goal to aim at, only to shoot tamely at Sargeant.
Fryer kept Pools on level terms with a point-blank reaction save from Adeboyejo who also shot just wide from a narrow angle.
The O's had threatened a second and it duly came in the 34th minute.
Goal one came via two 19-year-olds with two 18-year-olds combining for the second.
Steven Alzate did the spadework to set up Tristan Abrahams who shot home superbly with his left foot.
Jones removed Nicky Deverdics at the break, though there were seven or eight other candidates.
He sent on Michael Woods who he had dropped and he soon made an impact, powering forward and almost getting in Oates, with Sandro Semedo making a last-ditch interception.
Soon after, Woods was involved five times in a 14-pass move which ended with no one in the six-yard box when Alessandra drove the ball across the face of goal.
It did offer promise, but for all the promise there was no end result.
There were shouts for a penalty when a defender seemed to handle when under pressure from Amond and from a Nathan Thomas shot. And there were appeals too when Alessandra went down. Each time, Mr Whitestone said no.
Orient had a golden chance when Abrahams was in on goal but Fryer produced a stunning save.
Pools then squandered a great chance in the 67th minute. Thomas played a delightful cross in which Oates missed completely, with the ball eluding the unmarked Amond behind him.
In Amond's defence he surely could not have expected his comrade to get nothing on the cross.
Amond could not get a clean connection shortly afterwards, but to see the leading scorer subbed was baffling, even more so when the replacement was Devante Rodney rather than Louis Rooney.
Pools had a late fling with further unanswered pleas for a spot-kick when Thomas went down, but the ref looked spot-on with his decision.
A point for Pools would have given some crumb of comfort but they could not even manage that, yet they had the perfect chance.
Thomas was the provider, teeing up Oates who fluffed his shot from six yards with Aron Pollock clearing off the line.
The dreadful afternoon was capped when Donnelly chased Mr Whitestone after he awarded a goal-kick rather than a corner, with Pools claiming Thomas's shot was deflected by a home player.
He was inches away from the official when he roared his discontent.
Mr Whitestone showed him a yellow card when a red was probably merited and when Donnelly would not leave him alone produced a second yellow and his marching orders.
An embarrassing end to a humbling day.

After an intense two-day search, local military forces Friday recovered the body of a U.S. Army commando who was inadvertently left behind after a daylight ambush by militants killed three other Green Berets in a rugged border region in Niger.
Pentagon officials had not previously announced that a Green Beret was missing in action after the surprise attack on a joint patrol of U.S. commandos and Nigerien troops Wednesday. Six of the 12 Americans on the patrol were killed or wounded.
Officials hoped the missing U.S. Army Special Forces operative might still be hiding in the dense brush, rather than taken captive, and launched a massive search-and-rescue mission with aerial drones and other aircraft, as well as Nigerien ground forces.
The death of four Green Berets in remote West Africa marks the worst single loss of U.S. forces under fire since President Trump took office. The president was briefed on the search and the discovery of the body, officials said.
The casualties came as a heavy blow to the insular special operations community that increasingly shoulders the burden of America's counter-terrorism operations overseas. The four fatalities, as well as two wounded Green Berets, were in the 3rd Special Forces Group based in Ft. Bragg, N.C.
The Pentagon identified the first three fatalities as Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash.; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Ga.
Officials did not release the name of the Green Beret whose body was found Friday. It wasn't immediately clear if he was killed in the firefight or died later.
According to the Pentagon, the Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha, otherwise known as an “A-Team,” went on a routine patrol Wednesday afternoon with about 20 troops from the Niger Armed Forces when they came under heavy fire.
Officials said a barrage of machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades from about 50 militants forced the U.S. and Nigerien troops into defensive positions near the border with Mali. The fire peppered the troops' trucks and shattered windows before they could regroup and fire back.
The soldiers called in support from French attack helicopters and fighter jets. It's not clear whether the aircraft fired.
Amid the chaos, the officials said, one of the 12 Green Berets was left behind in a border region notorious for drug smuggling, human trafficking and myriad extremist militias, including allies of Al Qaeda and Islamic State.
The other Green Berets only noticed his absence after they had pulled back.
Col. Mark Cheadle, spokesman for U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations on the continent, said commanders are reassessing whether U.S. forces on patrol are properly supplied to defend themselves.
“We are reevaluating,” he said. “This was not expected. This was clearly something that, had we anticipated this sort of attack, we absolutely would have devoted more resources to it to reduce the risk.”
Cheadle said the patrol had planned to talk to local leaders about security. He said the military has no indication that someone tipped off the militants to set up an ambush in the brush.
“It would've been easy to have good concealment in this terrain,” he said, adding that an unarmed surveillance aircraft was overhead, but no armed air cover because the threat was considered “unlikely.”
Four Nigerien soldiers also were reported killed, with eight wounded. The two wounded Green Berets were flown to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. military hospital overseas.
The deadly attack drew attention to the little-known U.S. military presence in Niger, an impoverished desert country in Francophone West Africa. About 800 U.S. personnel are deployed there.
Niger is considered strategic for U.S. counter-terrorism operations. It lies between Nigeria to the south, where Islamic State affiliate Boko Haram has been fighting to establish Islamist rule, and Mali to the west, where multiple extremist militias are active.
In all, U.S. special operations teams are deployed in 124 countries to train, advise and assist friendly forces, although most are focused in Africa and the Middle East.
The special operators' clandestine operations and extensive training in guerrilla warfare became critical in tracking terrorist networks rooted in the Middle East and Horn of Africa.
Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, former commander of U.S. Special Operations Command in Africa, told Special Warfare Magazine, an internal military publication, in January that the future for special operations “isn't in Iraq or Afghanistan but in areas where we're seeing violent extremist organizations spreading, like Africa.”
The program has vastly expanded in recent years as the Obama administration sought to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and rely more on U.S.-trained and -armed local forces for counter-terrorism operations.
But it has put a burden on special operations forces who face repeated deployments in remote areas that often have little resources in the case of emergency.

Police are searching for the culprits after a mobility scooter was allegedly thrown into the sea on Saturday night.
Officers are searching for four male youths who were seen in the area around the time of the incident who police believe can help with enquiries.
The incident happened near Battery Parade in Whitby at around 9pm.
A police spokesman said: "If you have any information in relation to this incident, please call us on 101 stating reference NYP-09122017-0459."
It's quite a number to fathom.
But in February 1973, Hartlepool United had gone 523 minutes without conceding a single goal.
Len Ashurst.
At the other end, they were knocking in fine goals.
And the only downside to it all was that a mid-season slump meant this wasn't going to be anything other than a run which confirmed Hartlepool's safety for another season.
But while it lasted, it was a phenomenal effort and the latest victory was a 1-0 away triumph at Stockport County.
Our reporter at the time said: “They played the masterful away game, holding Stockpot well at the back and eventually frustrating them so they ran out of steam and spirit, and then grabbing a crippling winner midway through the second half.”
It's nothing you can really describe but in the dressing room and during training for some time now there has been the sort of feeling there was at Sunderland when we won promotion Len Ashurst
Pools had soaked up a lot of early pressure yet they had done it in real style.
A back line of Smith, Dawes, Green and Potter controlled the defensive play with Barry Watling in commanding form behind them. Our reporter said: “He made two magnificent saves and several good ones.”
Mick Spelman did more work in midfield than he'd had to do the previous week. But after all, Stockport were an outside bet for promotion.
Bobby Smith and Ron Young grew in terms of the influence they had on the game as the match wore on.
And up front, John Coyne, Ward and Bryan Conlon enjoyed plenty of the ball.
The fans grew more and more confident that this was going to be a two-pointer as the game wore on and this was confirmed with a stylish goal. It arrived on the 73 minute much to the delight of the travelling fans.
It came after County's Steve Ingle went into the book and Bobby Smith sent in the resultant free kick.
It reached the near post where Coyne risked injury to get to the ball before keeper Alan Ogley and head it out of his hands and just inside the post.
Manager Len Ashurst said afterwards: “It's nothing you can really describe but in the dressing room and during training for some time now there has been the sort of feeling there was at Sunderland when we won promotion.”
He described the result as “a great win” and added: “It is very good to see all the planning during the week, turned into a game and coming off.
“The lads did all that was asked of them and did it well.”
The only black point was four bookings for Pools.
But even that wasn't going to put this confident team out of their stride.
FAISALABAD : State Minister for Power Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali has said that critics of Metro Bus project of the Punjab government are now replicating it in Peshawar, with some reports of corruption
He said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is completing the Metro Bus project in Peshawar with Rs 57 billion, instead of original proposed cost of Rs27 billion.
Talking to the media after inaugurating new building at Government MC Girls Primary School, C-Block Allama Iqbal Colony, Faisalabad on Monday, he said Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif had introduced Metro Bus Project to provide comfortable, easy and cheap traveling facilities in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Multan.
The state minister said embezzlement of funds has also been detected in KP government's one billion tree plantation project. He said that corruption story starts from one political leader and end at other leader. However, their conspiracies against democracy would not succeed, he added.
Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali said that National Accountability Bureau (NAB) should take notice of embezzlement of funds in Metro Bus Project Peshawar and in a billion tree plantation plans.
He said that Begum Kalsoom Nawaz, spouse of PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, is seriously ill in London but he and his daughter Maryam Nawaz are engaged here and could not go abroad.
On the other PPP leader Dr Asim who is involved in corruption has been allowed to go abroad. “These are double standards and the people of Pakistan would not allow it, as they love their leader Mian Nawaz Sharif,” he said and added that the people would reject such elements in general election 2018 who are hatching conspiracies against democracy and PML-N, he added.
He said that the PML-N is a symbol of development as the country is making progress by leaps and bounds. Chief Minister Punjab has also made tremendous achievements by taking revolutionary steps for up-gradation of health, agriculture, livestock and education sectors.
The PML-N government is striving to provide all basic facilities at people's doorsteps and Pakistan would emerge ‘Asian Tiger' very soon, he added. Provincial Parliamentary Secretary Mian Tahir Jameel, MPA, and others were also present on the occasion.

Islamabad-The Capital Development Authority (CDA) seemed to have succumbed to the pressure exerted by the encroaching traders of the capital markets despite the fact that the anti-encroachment operation was appreciated by a segment of the community.
Soon after the teams of Enforcement Directorate conducted an operation to remove sheds and other encroachments from the Aabpara Market at the weekend, a number of traders reached the Mayor office with a narrative that the CDA teams have exceeded from their limits and removed what was not necessary to ease movement of the pedestrians. The CDA teams have had removed movables from the corridors, canopies and sheds that were erected illegally in front of the shops. The Enforcement Directorate teams demolished 200 sheds constructed illegally in front of different shops and plazas of Aabpara Market. Moreover, 35 illegally constructed shops, within the plazas of the market were also demolished. Some supported the operation while others opposed it and the latter seemed to have dominated the will of the Authority with no follow-up operation.
Again on Monday, a representative group of Traders Actions Committee met with Mayor Islamabad Sheikh Anser Aziz to demand even regularisation of the encroachments - canopies and sheds. The group led by Ajmal Baloch, according to a press release, asked the Mayor to legitimize canopy and sheds in front of the shops in the city markets. The traders demanded that anti-encroachment operation be undertaken after taking the traders into confidence. They said the CDA teams must not interfere in the basements of the plazas. They further demanded that concerned union council must be approached before the operation in the future. According to the press release, the Mayor termed himself an elected representative of traders and Sardar Mehtab Khan, a UC chairman has been appointed focal person on the issue.
The division between the traders on the issue is visible as another group of traders has posted a banner at the main gate of CDA headquarter, inscribed with expression of thanks to the CDA teams who conducted operation to clear the encroachments from the city markets. The press release from the group which met the Mayor on Monday said: “the conspiracies have come to an end with the authorities recognising the traders' delegation as representative of the community”, strengthening the impression of division between the traders' groups.
To further pressurise the CDA on the issue, office-bearers of All Pakistan Tajir Ittehad also urged the Authority to take market associations into confidence before launching any campaign against the encroachments. Terming it use of state force, Central President All Pakistan Tajir Ittehad, Muhammad Kashif Chaudhary said the recent anti-encroachment drive has caused tension between the local government and the trader community. Terming it an unjustified operation, he demanded the Authority to halt it immediately so that trader organisations could be heard on the issue. So much so, he said, the operation could lead to a clash between the Authority officials and the traders and demanded that honest officials should be deputed at the markets so that they do not encourage encroachments for monetary benefits. He also demanded that the officials should avoid losses to the community during the operation. He took a plea that removal of canopy, sheds and clearing verandas and basements is not mandated of the Enforcement Directorate, rather it falls within the domain of Building Control Section of the CDA. He also demanded the Authority to exercise leniency on the issue.
The traders seem to have started a campaign against the anti-encroachment operations at a time when a ‘political body' is running affairs of the Authority. Removal of encroachments from city markets has had been a longstanding demand of the residents who time and again called for action against the encroachers. The business centres in Blue Area, Super Market, Aabpara Market, Jinnah Super Market and other commercial centres of thecity are crowded with encroachers while footpaths and roadsides are occupied by the vendors. The CDA occasionally launches the anti-encroachment operations, and the very next day, the same situation is observed across the city. The residents and even a segment of traders believes that most of the encroachers have the backing of the officials of the Enforcement directorate who get monthly payments from them.
The encroachments on footpaths and roads in the name of security measures by placing sand bags and barbed wires are another phenomenon the CDA is fighting with. CDA has always been very lenient as far as encroachments in the name of security are concerned. Schools, mosques, foreigners' residences and big hotels are reflection of the same. Taking advantage of the CDA's leniency, some private organisations and residents have also started encroaching upon roads and footpaths in the name of security. Offices of political parties are no exception, which have erected barbed wire and huge piles of sand bags to protect the premises. At some places, the roads are completely closed and all this is being done in the name of security. Margalla Road, which is a busy road, is partially occupied by the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy and creates a lot of inconvenience for commuters during rush hours. NESCOM has blocked part of the road passing its campus in sector H-11. Marriott Hotel is also encroaching upon part of the road passing it. The Diplomatic Enclave is an area where encroachment abounds. Various pieces of land have been taken over by foreign offices and embassies in order to safeguard them from terrorism threats.
Mayor Islamabad Sheikh Ansar Aziz, in the wake of Aabpara anti-encroachment operation a few days before, had said that Aabpara Market was losing its beauty due to increasing encroachments, adding a number of complaints were also received from the general public regarding encroachments in the market.
He said that in the past anti-encroachment operations were conducted but not a single operation remained successful. “Therefore, a well-planned and coordinated operation was required for complete eradication of encroachments from Aabpara Market,” he viewed. It is to be seen whether he abides by the promise or succumbs to the pressure of the traders on the issue.
For reasons beyond my understanding, we as a society have turned our backs on grains. It's not a new thing, but it is becoming increasingly trendy to not only avoid eating grains like rice and bread (potatoes, while not a grain, are also a victim here) but also to create healthier, vegetable based dishes.
Out with the noodles and in with spiralized vegetables.
I happen to be in a very long-term relationship with bread. I certainly don't eat mountains of it, but I could certainly see myself winding up in a fist fight with Oprah over who loves bread more (she would win, I mean I'd see her and just be in awe of her). However, I am guilty of joining the vegetable substitution bandwagon. I make zoodles with pesto pretty often. I sometimes tease my friends by preparing buffalo cauliflower bites instead of making buffalo wings.
Given that this time of year there's an abundance of dense meals being passed around the holiday tables I thought it might be a good idea to try something to give my body a break from the series of bread rolls that have graced my plate.
I haven't tried to make fake bread yet, but I did attempt fried cauliflower rice to see if it could hold its own again fried rice.
As I've mentioned in a previous column, I'm very attached to my Chinese food, so the idea that I could snub regular rice and be some sort of health goddess by replacing it with shredded cauliflower was tempting. Admittedly I was hesitant to try this out, as I wasn't sure if there would be enough soy sauce in the world to stomp out the cauliflower odor and allow me to forget that I wasn't eating rice, but it turned out pretty well.
Fried Cauliflower Rice
Serves 4
1 head of cauliflower
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 carrot
2 garlic cloves
2 eggs
2 tablespoons soy sauce
6 scallions
Shred the cauliflower with a cheese grater or a food processor until the pieces are the size of rice grains (pre-shredded cauliflower is also available in most grocery stores). Cube the carrot and dice the garlic (or if you have a jar of pre-minced garlic just use 2 tablespoons of that) and stir fry them in a skillet with the sesame oil over a medium low heat. After five minutes add the cauliflower and cook until it is tender. Once the cauliflower is tender, lower the heat and make a well in the middle of the pan. Crack the eggs in the opening and scramble them. Once the eggs are fully cooked add the soy sauce (low sodium works) and the chopped scallions and serve.
The rice is pretty simple, so feel free to add pork or edamame to the recipe. Or if you hate veggies, the recipe could be used to make regular fried rice by nixing the cauliflower for the real deal. Happy eating!
LaForge said he's slowing down and instead of so many ‘stings' wants to focus on law reform to keep pedophiles in jail longer
Surrey Creep Catchers' president Ryan LaForge said he's “done with citizens arrests” and “done getting the police involved” after pleading guilty to two counts of assault this week.
“It has nothing to do with police themselves, every cop I've dealt with has been good,” LaForge told the Now-Leader Tuesday, the day after he pleads guilty to two counts of assault in Surrey Provincial Court which stemmed from “stings” his group did in Whalley on April 3 and 19, 2017.
“I have no hard feelings or whatever, but they're up against the same battle we are, as a community…. I don't know what it's going to take for everyone to wake up at the same time and say enough's enough,” he added.
In the April 3 incident, LaForge said he performed a “citizens arrest” on a man he alleged came to pay for sex with a six-year-old outside the Tim Horton's at Central City Shopping Centre, in the 10100-block of King George Boulevard.
While the convictions have led to LaForge discontinuing such “citizens arrests,” they don't deter him from continuing to conduct “stings,” which involve Creep Catchers representatives posing as children online, arranging to meet adults who think they've been communicating with a child and confronting them, while filming them.
LaForge said Tuesday he is still live streaming videos of “stings” on Facebook, which he then removes from Facebook and posts on his website.
While the group was doing about “five catches a day” in their early days in 2016, LaForge said he aims for one a week now.
“I've slowed down for a couple of reasons,” he said Tuesday. “One is just for my mental well-being. I'm just taking it a lot slower, to just take care of myself mentally, have more time for my family and stuff. I work more, I kind of ran out of my savings after a good year, so I'm back to work.”
LaForge said he's changing gears, to a degree, and instead of so many “stings,” wants to focus his time on changes to legislation to keep convicted pedophiles in prison longer.
“I knew I had to attack this epidemic from another position,” LaForge said. “I'm sitting here catching guys all the time and yes, it's exposing them, people are seeing it, it's creating awareness, but I feel like a dog chasing my own tail. I want to see the laws change so if and when these guys are caught by police there's a mandatory minimum sentence.”
Long sentences are “too rare,” he added.
“It's not fair, they leave a trail of broken children,” LaForge said, noting he's also become frustrated with other aspects of the system.
“People say ‘it's not even a real child,'” when referencing Surrey Creep Catcher stings, he said, “but that's what's wrong with the justice system. They wait for a victim before they can do anything. Unfortunately, I get parents messaging me all the time…. Our laws are a joke. That's the sad, sad thing. India just adopted a death penalty for sexual assault under the age of 12. We have third and second world countries taking stands against this and here we are, protecting them.”
Further, LaForge said the group is also pushing for a public registry of sex offenders.
But, he acknowledged, those would be “huge, huge steps” and said he's working with “not a lot of resources.”

In court on Monday, LaForge plead guilty to two counts of assault. While he had also faced charges of uttering threats and breach of undertaking, those were stayed.
LaForge will not serve any jail time, but was handed 12 months probation and was given a conditional sentence.
His conditions include keeping the peace, notifying the court and probation office of any change in employment or occupation, to not possess anything resembling a weapon, and to not publish or make publicly available on the internet any information about individuals targeted by the group.
A former member of the group, Lance Loy, on May 22 also plead guilty to assault in connection to the April 19, 2017 incident.
Also facing charges after the April 3 incident is Burnaby resident Kuljinder Singh Bhatti, 35. Bhatti is accused of trying to lure a minor for a sexual purpose and making an arrangement with a person for a sexual offence involving a person under age 18.
Bhatti's next appearance in Vancouver Provincial Court is set for Aug. 27.
Since Surrey Creep Catchers' inception, Surrey RCMP have cautioned the public against such work.
“Police want to remind the public that vigilantism, no matter how well meaning, poses significant risks to the safety of all those involved,” Surrey RCMP Corporal Scotty Schumann said last year. “Using our highly trained investigators in a controlled environment is the best way to get dangerous offenders off our streets and ensure they are held accountable.”
He said police advise the public to go to www. cybertip.ca to report incidents of online sexual exploitation of children.
Meantime, Surrey Creep Catchers made national headlines September of 2016 after a woman working with the group posed as a 15-year-old girl and allegedly communicated with an off-duty Surrey Mountie online after posting an ad on Craigslist.
A meeting was set up outside the Boston Pizza at Surrey Central Shopping Mall in Whalley and LaForge and his crew live-streamed the sting on the Internet.
Constable Dario Devic was arrested on Sept. 9, 2016 and suspended from police duty. Devic was then charged in October, 2016 and currently faces one charge of child luring. He is due in Surrey Provincial Court on June 4.

Martin Keown has named the two Arsenal legends who make up one Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang .
The Gabon striker moved to the Gunners from Borussia Dortmund on transfer deadline day for a club record £56million.
Aubameyang then made his debut for Arsenal on Saturday evening as a new-look Gunners side demolished Everton 5-1.
Arsenal's January signing made an instant impact, playing a crucial role in the game's opening goal.
Aubameyang flicked the ball on to Henrikh Mkhitaryan who then delivered a brilliant cross for Aaron Ramsey to slot home.

Laurent Koscielny then doubled the host's lead before Ramsey got his second of the game.
Aubameyang then got a goal of his own, linking up with old friend Mkhitaryan just before half-time.
Prior to the game, ex-Gunners defender Keown revealed Aubameyang has attributes of both Ian Wright and Thierry Henry.

"He reminds me of an Ian Wright finisher, with the pace of Thierry Henry," said Keown on BT Sport . "That will do nicely for Arsenal."
On his relationship with Mkhitaryan, fellow pundit Steven Gerrard added: "The chemistry between them is unbelievable. If they connect for Arsenal, then going forward they're going to be a scary team."
Two high-risk sex offenders released from custody earlier this year, and one released last year, are back behind bars after violating conditions of their release.
William Astle, 82 , was released Feb . 1, 2018, while serving a four-year sentence for i ndecent e xposure to a minor and f ail ure to c omply with a p robation o rder.
Officers said Astle park ed his vehicle near a playground May 21 for several minutes in the area of Dufferin Avenue and Main Street. His probation order prohibits him from being anywhere near children.
He was arrested and charged with two counts each of breach of recognizance and failure to comply.
On May 23 and 24 respectively, Apay Ogouk, 34, and Cecil Houle, 42, were arrested separately for violating terms of their release.
Houle was released from federal custody Jan. 17 , 2018, after serving a 12-year sentence for manslaughter and sexual assault causing bodily harm.
He was considered a high risk to re-offend in a sexual manner.
Police said on May 23, Houle did not abide by a court-ordered curfew and was arrested the following day.
Ogouk was released on statutory release April 10, 2017, while serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for aggravated sexual assault.
He was arrested in the West Broadway area on May 23 following unspecified parole violations.

While a majority of Canadians say they don't care about a politician being a visible minority when voting for the country's leader, a new Angus Reid poll suggests about three-in-ten voters also say being a practising Sikh might hurt new NDP leader Jagmeet Singh's chances in an election.
The study looked to gauge how Canadians feel when it comes to voting for the new federal NDP leader based on his religion and visible characteristics as a Sikh man.
Singh won the federal New Democratic Party leadership in September, becoming the first visible minority to lead a major Canadian political party. He won without holding a seat in the House.
On voting for a visibly looking Sikh man
Of about 1,400 people surveyed, seven-in-ten Canadians out of B.C., Alberta and Ontario responded to the poll saying they themselves would consider voting for a national party leader who wears a turban and carries a kirpan.
Respondants out of Quebec showed the greatest hesitancy in voting for a Sikh man, with about half saying they wouldn't vote for such a person, regardless of their policies.

READ MORE: MP Nathan Cullen endorses Singh in NDP bid
Broken down by age, almost 40 per cent of those aged 55 and older said they couldn't support such a leadership, as well as 40 per cent of Conservative Party supporters.
The survey also touched on perceptions Canadians as a whole feel towards a Sikh prime minister.
Asked to think about how their close friends and family members would vote, half said either “most” or “some” of the people in their lives wouldn't favour a visible minority leader. When asked about “society as a whole,” respondents said they suspect 80 per cent would not show their support in the voting booth.
On if religion will get in the way for voters
Visible aspects aside, when asked if Singh's religion will hurt the NDP's electoral chances, 54 per cent of respondents said it would.
The pushback was found to be strongest in Quebec, where debates over public officials wearing religious symbols and accommodating religious minorities are part of both recent history and an ongoing political process.
Two-thirds of that province agree with the statement about Singh's religion hurting his party's electoral standing. Atlantic Canada is the only other region where more than 50 per cent agree.
CAIRO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Average yields on Egypt's three- and nine-month treasury bills rose at an auction on Sunday, central bank data showed.
Yields on the 91-day bills rose to 19.257 percent from 19.171 at the last sale a week earlier, while yields on the 273-day bills rose to 18.838 percent from 18.746.
Appetite for Egypt's domestic debt has grown since the central bank floated the pound currency a year ago. Since then, the CBE has raised key interest rates by 700 basis points. (Reporting by Arwa Gaballa)

The Latest on a fatal shooting captured on video and later shared on Facebook (all times local):
7:35 p.m.
A vigil has been held in Cleveland for the victim of a deadly shooting that was videotaped and then posted on Facebook.
Dozens of family, friends and community members gathered Monday evening to remember 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. They carried flowers and balloons and hugged and comforted each other, while urging an end to the violence on their city streets.
Police say 37-year-old Steve Stephens killed Godwin Sunday afternoon in what appeared to be a random shooting while the retiree was picking up aluminum cans. Stephens then uploaded the gruesome video of the killing to Facebook.
Authorities are searching multiple states for Stephens, who is considered armed and dangerous. A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the capture and prosecution of him.

Authorities searching multiple states for a suspect in the deadly shooting of a Cleveland man say they have no idea what led up to what they say appears to be a random shooting.
Cleveland's police chief said Monday that only Steve Stephens knows the answer.
Police say the 37-year-old Stephens shot a Cleveland retiree picking up aluminum cans Sunday and then posted a video of the killing on Facebook.
In the video, Stephens names a woman and tells the victim, Robert Godwin Sr., that "she's the reason that this is about to happen to you."
Authorities say Stephens is considered armed and dangerous and could be anywhere.
Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams says authorities have already searched every location Stephens has been associated with in the Cleveland area.

A former girlfriend of the suspect in the slaying of an elderly Cleveland man has told CBS News in a text that 37-year-old Steve Stephens was "a nice guy" who was generous to everyone and was "kind and loving" to her and her children.
Joy Lane says Monday she had a relationship for several years with Stephens, now the target of a nationwide manhunt for the Easter slaying.
Stephens, in a video he posted to Facebook, mentions Lane's name to 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. and says she is "the reason that this is about to happen to you" before the random attack.

A spokeswoman for the behavior health facility where the suspect in the shooting of an elderly Cleveland man worked says the man underwent an extensive FBI background check before being hired in 2008.
Beech Brook spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer says Monday there was nothing in the background check for 37-year-old Steve Stephens that caused any concerns.
Kortemeyer says Stephens' job since 2015 as a vocational specialist involved preparing youth and young adults ages 16-25 for employment.
Stephens had referred to himself as a case manager. Kortemeyer says he did have a caseload of clients that he managed.
Authorities say Stephens did not have a criminal record.
Officials say Stephens shot and killed 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. on Sunday and posted the gruesome video on Facebook.

Police in Ohio are urging residents in surrounding states on Monday to be on alert for a man who they say shot and killed an elderly passerby and then posted a gruesome video of the killing on Facebook.
Thirty-seven-year-old Steve Stephens is wanted on a charge of aggravated murder in the death of Robert Godwin Sr. on Sunday afternoon in Cleveland.
In a statement early Monday, police warned residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan to be on the lookout for Stephens, who they say should be considered armed and dangerous.
In a separate video posted on Facebook, Stephens claimed to have killed more than a dozen other people. Police say they have not verified any other shootings or deaths.
The FBI is assisting in the investigation.

People may be happier when they feel the emotions they desire, even if those emotions are unpleasant, such as anger or hatred, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.
“Happiness is more than simply feeling pleasure and avoiding pain. Happiness is about having experiences that are meaningful and valuable, including emotions that you think are the right ones to have,” said lead researcher Maya Tamir, PhD, a psychology professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “All emotions can be positive in some contexts and negative in others, regardless of whether they are pleasant or unpleasant.”
The cross-cultural study included 2,324 university students in eight countries: the United States, Brazil, China, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Poland and Singapore. The research, which was published online in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, is the first study to find this relationship between happiness and experiencing desired emotions, even when those emotions are unpleasant, Tamir said.
Participants generally wanted to experience more pleasant emotions and fewer unpleasant emotions than they felt in their lives, but that wasn't always the case. Interestingly, 11 percent of the participants wanted to feel fewer transcendent emotions, such as love and empathy, than they experienced in daily life, and 10 percent wanted to feel more unpleasant emotions, such as anger or hatred. There was only a small overlap between those groups.
For example, someone who feels no anger when reading about child abuse might think she should be angrier about the plight of abused children, so she wants to feel more anger than she actually does in that moment, Tamir said. A woman who wants to leave an abusive partner but isn't willing to do so may be happier if she loved him less, Tamir said.
Participants were surveyed about the emotions they desired and the emotions they actually felt in their lives. They also rated their life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. Across cultures in the study, participants who experienced more of the emotions that they desired reported greater life satisfaction and fewer depressive symptoms, regardless of whether those desired emotions were pleasant or unpleasant. Further research is needed, however, to test whether feeling desired emotions truly influences happiness or is merely associated with it, Tamir said.
The study assessed only one category of unpleasant emotions known as negative self-enhancing emotions, which includes hatred, hostility, anger and contempt. Future research could test other unpleasant emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness or shame, Tamir said. Pleasant emotions that were examined in the study included empathy, love, trust, passion, contentment and excitement. Prior research has shown that the emotions that people desire are linked to their values and cultural norms, but those links weren't directly examined in this research.
The study may shed some light on the unrealistic expectations that many people have about their own feelings, Tamir said.
“People want to feel very good all the time in Western cultures, especially in the United States,” Tamir said.”Even if they feel good most of the time, they may still think that they should feel even better, which might make them less happy overall.”

SADIQABAD-The traffic police are taking effective steps for implementation of traffic rules to avoid road accidents.
Traffic In-charge ASI Hafiz Nooruddin Zangi said while talking to media here the other day. He said that wheelie-doers will be dealt with sternly. The drivers, who use pressure horns and operate tape records loudly in the vehicles, will also be punished, he added. The traffic in-charge said that the police efforts for making traffic flow smooth in the city have brought positive results, adding it has also brought a noticeable decrease in traffic accidents.
He appealed to the public to cooperate with the police for traffic rules implementation.
A top aide to President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview aired on Sunday that the White House may have disproportionately punished Russia by ordering the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies.
Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on ABC's "This Week" that Trump will be asking questions of U.S. intelligence agencies after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions last week on two Russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Obama also ordered Russia to vacate two U.S. facilities as part of the tough sanctions on Russia.
"One of the questions that we have is why the magnitude of this? I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken? Maybe it was; maybe it wasn't but you have to think about that," Spicer said.
Trump is to have briefings with intelligence agencies this week after he returns to New York on Sunday.
On Saturday, Trump expressed continued skepticism over whether Russia was responsible for computer hacks of Democratic Party officials.
"I think it's unfair if we don't know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don't know so we cannot be sure," Trump said.
He said he would disclose some information on the issue on Tuesday or Wednesday, without elaborating. It is unclear if, upon taking office on Jan. 20, he would seek to roll back Obama's actions, which mark a post-Cold War low in U.S.-Russian ties.
Spicer said that after China in 2015 seized records of U.S. government employees "no action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken when millions of people had their private information, including information on security clearances that was shared. Not one thing happened."
"So there is a question about whether there's a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response," he added.
PRESSURE IN CONGRESS
U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organizations and operatives before the presidential election. Moscow denies this. U.S. intelligence officials say the Russian cyberattacks aimed to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on foreign cyber threats and has said that Russia must be made to pay the price for attacks "on our very fundamentals of democracy.
The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on the same ABC program that Congress would push for an even harsher reprisal against Russia and warned Trump against undoing Obama's sanctions.
FAISALABAD : Rana Sanaullah on Saturday appeared before the committee to probe him for the clarification of his stance on Khatm-e-Nabuwwat faith.
The Punjab Law Minister clarified his stance on the sensitive religious matter upon the demand of ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) aide and estranged lawmakers. He hoped for the friendly resolution of the matter.
Meeting of the probe committee formed by Pir Hameeduddin Sialvi took place in Faisalabad today. Zaeem Qadri, Maulana Rehmatullah and other political and religious names took part in it. According to sources, the members of committee expressed satisfaction at the clarification presented by Rana Sanaullah over his statements.
Sialvi's nephew Nizamuddin Sialvi said that some members of the committee didn't participate in the meeting. The mutual decision will be announced after the consultation with all members of the committee.
Sialvi had called off his sit-in against the Punjab government on the request of Punjab chief minister (CM) Shehbaz Sharif who had formed a six-member committee to probe Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah upon his rift with Sialvi who demanded the resignation of senior PML-N leader. The cleric had warned the Government of Punjab to impose sharia law within a period of seven days lest the religious groups would shut down the entire province.

England striker Jamie Vardy will check out non-league prospects at his V9 Academy before heading to the World Cup.
Having risen from non-league in Sheffield with Stocksbridge Park Steels to become a Premier League champion, the 31-year-old Leicester forward launched the academy in 2016 to help give players outside the Football League a chance to follow in his footsteps.
Six players from the V9 Academy broke into the professional game last year, with Danny Newton the standout performer having been named player of the year by both Stevenage's fans and players.
The second season of the academy kicks off at Manchester City's Etihad Campus on June 3, with Sheffield-born Vardy and his family going to the showcase matches as it comes to a close on June 8 – the day after England take on Costa Rica.
Gareth Southgate's men have their final bit of downtime before heading to Russia following the Elland Road friendly and the former Sheffield Wednesday youngster will use it to run his eye over the academy's non-league hopefuls.
“After last year's success, I wanted to build on what we achieved last summer and having watched Danny's and (Peterborough defender) Alex (Penny)'s career develop and unfold this season I knew we had to be back this summer,” Vardy said of the academy he funds.
“Gareth and (Football Association technical director) Dan (Ashworth) have been extremely supportive of V9 and what I set out to achieve since day one.
“My focus is 100 per cent on the World Cup with England but I must admit I've been keeping tabs on what players we have been signing for V9 and I can't wait to see them in action next week.”
AMMAN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Syrian rebels shot down a Russian warplane on Saturday and killed its pilot on the ground after he ejected from the plane, Russia's defence ministry and Syrian rebels said.
The SU-25 came down in an area of Syria's northern Idlib province that has seen heavy air strikes and fighting on the ground between government forces backed by Russia and Iran, and rebels who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Syrians opposed to Assad see Russia as an invading force they blame for the deaths of thousands of civilians since Moscow joined the war on the side of the Syrian government in 2015.
The Russian plane was shot down over the town of Khan al-Subl near the city of Saraqeb, close to a major highway where the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias are trying to advance, a rebel source said.
Although the Russian pilot escaped the crash, he was killed by rebels who had tried to capture him, the source said.
Tharir al-Sham, a jihadist group spearheaded by the former Syrian branch of al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for shooting down the plane, saying one of its fighters had scored a direct hit with a shoulder launched anti-aircraft missile.
“This work is the least we can do to revenge our people. Let the criminal invaders know that our skies are not a picnic and they will not pass through without paying a price God willing,” senior commander Mahmoud Turkomani said in a statement released by the group.
Russia's Defence Ministry also said that the aircraft was downed by a portable surface-to-air missile. The pilot reported that he had ejected by parachute, and he was later killed on the ground.
“The pilot died in a fight with terrorists,” it said.
Tass news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying Moscow retaliated with a strike from an undisclosed high-precision weapon that killed more than 30 militants in an area of Idlib province where the plane was downed.
The Syrian opposition released footage on social media that purported to show the wreckage of the plane and the body of the pilot surrounded by fighters.
Rebels said the downed warplane had taken part in strikes that targeted civilian convoys fleeing along a major Syrian highway from villages that the army and foreign militias had overrun.
Syria's civil war, which is now entering its eighth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes.
A Russian plane was blamed for the death of seven civilians and scores of injuries after cars were targeted on the highway, according to a witness and two rebels sources.
Syrian soldiers and Iranian-backed militiamen were now around twelve kilometres from Saraqeb, advancing towards the Damascus-Aleppo highway under cover of heavy Russian air strikes, two opposition sources said.
Related Coverage Group linked to Syrian former al Qaeda branch says it shot down Russian jet
At least five civilians were killed in Saraqeb city on Saturday, which residents blamed on Russian planes.
Syrians in rebel-held areas say they can distinguish between Russian warplanes and those of the Syrian air force, because the Russian planes fly at higher altitude.
Residents say thousands of people have been forced by air strikes to flee the area, moving further north to the safety of makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the Turkish border.
Russia's Defence Ministry regularly says it targets only hardline Islamist militants in Syria.
ISLAMABAD - The verdict that a judge of the apex court will supervise accountability court proceedings against the Sharif family in the Panama Papers case has raised eyebrows and the legal fraternity is insisting on fair application of the law.
The legal experts are of the view if the apex court's priority is to eradicate corruption from the society, a judge should have been appointed to supervise the Ogra and Eobi scams in which the SC had itself observed that billions of rupees had been misappropriated.
Senior advocate Tariq Asad commented: “If we really want the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution, it should be applied equally to every citizen of Pakistan whether he is a civilian, a military or a judiciary official. If we want a different treatment on the basis of the position or the job, it is better to amend or withdraw Article 25 from the Constitution,” he added.
The Panama Papers contain names of around 400 Pakistanis, including a high court judge. The apex court proceeded against the Sharif family only and disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif while the case against the high court judge for allegedly having an offshore company has not been decided despite a lapse of 15 months.
Former chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, while addressing the New Judicial Year gathering and the Islamabad High Court Bar Association in 2015, had said the fate of pending cases against judges in the Supreme Judicial Council would be decided on priority basis.
Senior lawyers say that in the case of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry's son Arsalan Iftikhar, the JIT was changed when it was pointed out by Arsalan that its members were not impartial. The lawyers question why the apex court in the Sharifs' case outright rejected the allegations of Hussain Nawaz against the JIT members' bias without giving reasons.
Supreme Court Bar Association former president Kamran Murtaza said the money-laundering and corruption issues were not bigger than the subversion and abrogation of the Constitution. He asked why the Special Court comprising three judges of different high courts could not decide the case against former dictator Pervez Musharraf in four years. “Why could they not even secure the presence of Musharraf?” he further asked.
Lahore High Court Bar Association former president Sheikh Ahsan-ud-Din said when Musharraf was summoned by the court, the whole military establishment stood behind him, he was kept in AFIC and a medical certificate was issued to him declaring him a heart patient.
Sheikh Ahsan, who is also a focal person for Pakistan Justice and Democratic Party, said after the Panama Papers case, the people of Pakistan were now looking towards the judiciary for equal application of law and Constitution. He said it was responsibility of the courts to provide justice to every litigant. He said the case against Musharraf was of very serious nature and the superior judiciary should take notice of it and intervene. He said like trial of politicians the court should not hesitate to take trial against a military dictator to its logical conclusion.
Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa's judgment on former chief justice Hameed Dogar's appeal against the special court's order to include others in the Musharraf high treason case was not complied with. His judgment says: “The Special Court is expected to proceed with the trial of respondent No 2 (Musharraf) without any unnecessary delay.” The apex court has not taken any notice of its compliance despite a lapse of one year.
Similarly, the apex court on October 19, 2012, announced a judgment in the Asghar Khan case in which it had clearly stated that former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, ex-army chief Aslam Beg and ex-DG ISI Gen (r) Asad Durrani acted in violation of the Constitution by facilitating a group of politicians and political parties. “The acts of Mirza Aslam Beg and Asad Durrani have brought a bad name to Pakistan and its armed forces as well as its secret agencies in the eyes of the nation,” the SC said, directing the federal government to take necessary steps against them under the Constitution and law, although they had retired from service.
The legal experts are of opinion that the Supreme Court should have proceeded in the same manner against the army men as it did in cases against politicians and civilians.
The apex court supervised compliance of its judgments directly or indirectly in the National Reconciliation Ordinance, the rental power projects, National Insurance Company Limited (NICL), the appointment of Tauqir Sadiq as Ogra chairman, Bank of Punjab, Hajj scam, missing of ISAF containers cases and sought reports from the FIA or the NAB. Former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani was sent home for not writing a letter to Swiss courts. Former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry had issued a contempt of court notice to former interior minister Rehman Malik for transferring Tariq Khosa as he was heading an FIA team which investigated corruption in Pakistan Steel Mills.
However, in the appeals against the death sentences awarded by the military court, the lawyers who represented the convicted persons' families had complained to the apex court bench that despite its orders the record of military courts trial was not shown to them, but the bench which heard the cases neither took contempt notice nor did it pass any judgment against the military officials.
A petition challenging the removal of Musharraf's name from the ECL is pending even after lapse of two years.
Abida Malik, wife of Tasif Malik, had filed an application before the court to arrange a meeting with her husband detained in an internment centre in Kohat. The then chief justice Nasir-ul-Mulk had passed an order to arrange the meeting, but despite the clear order, Abida Malik has not been able to meet her husband. Although she had filed a contempt of court petition, no action was taken against the internment centre authorities. Similarly, the Lal Masjid case also is still pending.
Tariq Asad said that ex-premier Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif had made history by following the Supreme Court order and appeared before the joint investigation team. Former PMs – Sharif and Gilani – not only appeared before the court but also stepped down following the apex court judgments, he said.
On the other hand, when the military personnel were summoned by the courts, they, instead of complying with the orders, took refuge in the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology, Rawalpindi.
Musharraf was summoned by the special court on three occasions in the high treason case, but he defied the orders. When non-bailable warrants were served on him and the Islamabad police were directed to produce him before the court, he was admitted to the AFIC.
Former Defence Secretary Lt-Gen Asif Yasin Malik was issued a contempt of court notice in December 2013 in a case of local government polls in cantonments. The next day he also got himself admitted to the AFIC and remained there till the retirement of ex-CJP Iftikhar who had summoned him.
Similarly, when Balochistan Frontier Corps Inspector General Maj-Gen Ijaz Shah was issued a contempt of court notice by the Supreme Court in a law and order case, he was also admitted to the AFIC in connection with a heart ailment.
LAHORE - Opposition's boycott following remarks of a treasury legislator against PTI and its female workers led to premature adjournment of the Punjab Assembly proceedings on Wednesday.
Demanding apology from treasury legislator Rana Jamil, Opposition staged a walkout after pointing quorum. Though treasury managed to complete quorum after ringing bells for five minutes, the chair adjourned the session till Thursday at 2pm as none of the opposition legislator was there to take part in debate on supplementary budget.
The session started one hour and 45 minutes beyond the schedule with Deputy Speaker Sardar Sher Ali Gorchani in the chair.
Taking part in debate, treasury legislator Rana Jamil said that the political party that introduced dances of women at public gathering was criticising ‘pro-people' budget. He said that the government had carried out record development in the province.
On a point of order, Opposition leader Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed said that use of such language for female political workers was unacceptable. He said that criticism was right of everyone but women were respectable as mothers and sisters. He threatened that opposition would not allow continuing proceedings until treasury legislator tenders apology on floor of the house.
Earlier, Nabila Hakim Ali said that it was not supplementary but a TA/DA budget. She said that ministers and bureaucrats were beneficiaries of this budget. She said that supplementary budget to the tune of Rs1.68 billion was unacceptable. Such huge allocation, she maintained, could be made to meet any calamity. Nausheen Hamid said that more than 90 per cent of the population had no access to clean drinking water but government was purchasing luxury vehicles for blue eyed.
Sheneela Ruth said that such huge allocation was a plan to purchase bureaucracy for winning polls. Taimor Masood said that vehicles worth Rs22.5 million have been purchased for ministers, parliamentary secretaries and bureaucrats. He accused the government of releasing Rs30 million for staff of chief minister without prior approval. Waheed Gull, Haseena Begum and Ali Asghar Manda also took part in the discussion.
On completion of agenda, the chair adjourned the session till Thursday (today) at 2pm. Finance Minister Ayesha Ghous Pasha has arranged an Iftar for legislators to keep the house in quorum on Thursday for approval of supplementary budget.

Producer Harvey Weinstein is on indefinite leave from his own company while it investigates harassment claims. (Photo: Jordan Strauss / AP)
Los Angeles — For decades, Harvey Weinstein has held a lofty position in Hollywood as one of the industry's most powerful figures — an old-school, larger-than-life movie mogul who was never shy about throwing his weight around.
But Weinstein's name — such a regular refrain on countless Oscar nights — on Thursday rang out in a different way. In a bombshell expose, The New York Times reported that Weinstein had reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment. With allegations levied by actresses including Ashley Judd and former employees at both the Weinstein Co. and Weinstein's former company, Miramax, the report detailed decades of abuse.
On Friday, Weinstein was placed on indefinite leave from the company he co-founded while an internal investigation into the allegations against him is completed, The Weinstein Co.'s board of directors announced.
In a statement, the board said that Weinstein's future with the company depends on his therapeutic progress and the results of the internal investigation. It said Weinstein's leave commenced Friday.
“Next steps will depend on Harvey's therapeutic process, the outcome of the board's independent investigation and Harvey's own personal decisions,” the statement read.
Weinstein's attorneys also did not respond to emails seeking comment Friday. But many in Hollywood are wondering if his leave might be permanent. Is this, like the accusations that felled Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes, the end for the sharp-elbowed independent film pioneer whose editing-room meddling earned him the nickname “Harvey Scissorhands” and whose unprecedented run of Oscar glory made him a Hollywood deity?
“Harvey Weinstein's career in Hollywood is likely over,” declared industry trade Variety.
Others were less sure if this was indeed the downfall of Weinstein, who has weathered downturns and bankruptcy before. Weinstein was contrite in an earlier statement on Thursday, acknowledging “the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain.” He added: “I want a second chance in the community but I know I've got work to do to earn it.”
“I don't know if he's done because Harvey is the kind of person who has the ability to rise again, which he has done so many times from a business perspective,” said Sharon Waxman, CEO and founder of trade website The Wrap, and author of “Rebels on the Backlot.”
“If he can make amends, if he can apologize then I think a lot of things are possible,” said Waxman. “Hollywood is not public office, you are not required to have a morality clause necessarily. It's business. And ultimately he has to run his business which has also survived near death experiences many, many times, and has also been sold for $600 million. I would say it's up to him as to whether he survives in Hollywood.”
Weinstein's attorneys earlier signaled a fight was still to come. Weinstein's attorney Charles J. Harder, who recently waged a successful suit for Hulk Hogan against Gawker, said in a statement that the Times story is “saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein.” In an interview with the New York Post, Weinstein alleged the Times has “a vendetta” against him, and said “the next time I see (New York Times Executive Editor) Dean Baquet it will be across a courtroom.”
A spokesperson for The New York Times responded: “We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting.”
“Anyone who does business with (blank space) is complicit,” actress Rose McGowan tweeted. The New York Times reported that a settlement of $100,000 was paid to McGowan by Weinstein after an incident in 1997.
Dems donations
go to charities
Congressional Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and potential 2020 presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren among them, are starting to give charities thousands of dollars in donations they had received from disgraced Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein.
Weinstein and his family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, virtually all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

ATTORNEY General George Brandis has defended Barnaby Joyce remaining in federal parliament and retaining his ministry roles like agriculture and Northern Australia in the Coalition government, while the High Court decides his eligibility.
In an explosive sitting of parliament, it was revealed yesterday that Mr Joyce - the Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leaders - was a dual citizen of NZ with his father born there.
The matter has now been referred to the Court of Disputed Returns to assess the Agriculture and Water Resource Minister's eligibility under section 44 of the constitution, relating to dual citizenships.
But Labor will continue a sustained attack on the government hoping Mr Joyce will buckle under pressure.
Senior power-broker and former Agriculture Minister Tony Burke yesterday questioned the government's legitimacy, with a cloud hanging over Mr Joyce's future as the member for New England and as the second highest ranking cabinet minister, in a one seat majority parliament.
RELATED READING:
However, Mr Brandis said on ABC television he was aware of what the NZ government had said, with NZ Prime Minister Bill English yesterday confirming Mr Joyce's citizenship, which he learned of last week, was held “unwittingly or not” due to the nation's automatic process.
“It is a matter for the Australian system to decide how Australian law applies in his case and how they deal with this issue,” he told media in NZ.
Senator Brandis said the point of law to be assessed was whether in the circumstances of this case, when Mr Joyce “had no idea at all that he was a citizen of NZ, according to their view, at least, of events”, the disqualification applied to him.
He said the government had taken the Solicitor-General's advice and on the basis of it, “we are confident that on the proper interpretation of Section 44, Mr Joyce, because of his unawareness of his status as a NZ citizen, if, indeed, that turns out to be the case, would not be disqualified”.
Senator Brandis said, in previous rulings, the High Court had made it “very clear” that Section 44 can't be read in broad terms because if it were, “it could operate in a completely irrational way”.
He said a country hostile to Australia could pass a law to say that every Australian citizen was deemed by the law, of that hostile country, to be a citizen of that country.
“Now, if Section 44 would be interpreted literally, that would mean that every single Australian citizen would be disqualified from being a member of the Australian Parliament, which is plainly absurd,” he said.
“The High Court has already told us that Section 44 cannot be given a black and white literal interpretation and, therefore, what we must do - and this is precisely where the grey area lies - is work out what the limitations are.”
Mr Brandis said there was a difference between Mr Joyce's scenario and Queensland LNP Senator Matt Canavan who stepped down from the ministry recently while the Court of Disputed Returns assesses his eligibility to stay in parliament under Section 44, due to revelations he holds dual Italian citizenship.
He said the Prime Minister took the view that on the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice there was no “sufficient reason” for Mr Joyce to resign.
“Now, in the case of Senator Canavan, Senator Canavan made a decision that he would prefer to stand aside,” he said.
“Both the facts and the legal issues in Senator Canavan's case were entirely different from the facts and the legal issues in Mr Joyce's case.”
Mr Joyce assumed Senator Canavan's ministerial roles for Resources and Northern Australia, after he resigned from the ministry, due to the citizenship matter.
Farm groups have backed his capacity to handle the extended work-load but declined to comment on the latest development regarding his eligibility to sit in parliament which may not be resolved until December.
Today on Sky News, Mr Joyce's Assistant Minister and NSW Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker said his party leader had acted “totally appropriately” in handling the matter which has now been referred to the High Court to gain “clarity”.
Mr Hartsuyker said based on the government's legal advice the Deputy Prime Minister was within his rights to continue in his various roles.
He said the difference between the two High Court eligibility cases concerning members of his party was that Senator Canavan was “signed up” to be an Italian citizen without his knowledge, but Mr Joyce wasn't listed on any citizenship register.
“We're certainly confident the High Court will find in favour of the Deputy Prime Minister,” he said.
Mr Hartsuyker also defended questions about his own citizenship, with a Dutch born father who came to Australia in 1951 at age 17 with his mum being a fourth generation Australian.
“I never sought to gain a Dutch passport,” he said, adding that under Dutch law you may be regarded a national, until the age of 28 - but he was 43 when he entered parliament.
Mr Hartsuyker has also said he's been advised by the Dutch Embassy in Canberra that he was no longer a Dutch National due to not taking any action to renew his Dutch nationality.
On Twitter, Sydney radio broadcaster Alan Jones said, on Mr Joyce's latest issue, that if being born in Tamworth doesn't make you an Australian citizen “we may as well close the whole show”.
Mr Joyce told media reporters in Canberra this morning that he was born in Tamworth, as was his great grandmother.
He also said he found out last Thursday that due to an inquiry made in NZ, by reason of his father, he was a New Zealander and now he was doing everything he could to “fix it up”
“I'm sure the High Court who are vastly wiser than me, will come up with all the answers,” he said.
Shonda Rhimes is coming to Netflix.
The writer/producer whose television empire spans from West Coast hospitals to a scandal-wracked West Wing is joining the Netflix stable of exclusive content.
It's a blow to Rhimes' longtime distributors at ABC, whose parent company Disney announced earlier this week that they'd be pulling their titles from Netflix's streaming service.
The multi-year production deal with Netflix will see Rhimes' Shondaland production company produce new series “and other projects” for the video streaming and dvd rental service.
The deal doesn't affect Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, which will continue to air in the U.S. on ABC.
“Shonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix, in a statement. “Her work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she's a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We're so excited to welcome her to Netflix.”
Betsy Beers, Rhimes' longtime partner, who has helped ABC make over $2 billion from the licensing and sales of Shondaland shows, will make the move to Netflix as well.
For her part, Rhimes said that the deal is the result of a “shared plan” between herself and Netflix's Sarandos. “Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous reach provided by Netflix's singular sense of innovation.”
While thanking ABC Studios president Patrick Moran and Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment Group, the move to Netflix is the latest in a series of high profile acquisitions that have shaken up the entertainment landscape and a blow to ABC's parent company.
Within the past week Netflix has managed to coax talk show legend David Letterman out of retirement, snatch up the (somewhat middling) comic publishing house Millarworld for new exclusive programming, and snagged Academy Award winning writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen for a new Western series.
It's the latest sign that the war for talent in Hollywood is well and truly on. Netflix has already spent around $6 billion this year on its original programming, and secured a $500 million line of credit earlier this year to buy even more. Meanwhile Amazon is throwing piles of its own (not-insignificant) cash horde at original programming as well.
The house that Bezos built has spent about $4.5 billion on new, original programming this year, which is hardly chump change.
Meanwhile ABC's parent company, Disney, has been spending billions of its own to roll out a new streaming service in 2019.
Last year Disney bought a minority stake in BAMTech for roughly $1 billion (with an option to acquire the entire company). It's the BAMTech service that will provide the foundation for Disney's new streaming offering.
And the company is already pushing an on-demand subscription video service for Disney movies in the UK (and briefly in China) called DisneyLife.
As TechCrunch's Sarah Perez previously reported:
DisneyLife was seen as a way for Disney to experiment with streaming, before a larger public launch. This not only includes being able to test out the underlying infrastructure for such an endeavour, but also what sort of content users respond to, what features they want, how parental controls should work, and so on. On DisneyLife, consumers pay a small monthly fee that lets families of up to six stream Disney movies, TV shows, even music, audiobooks and e-books online, on mobile devices, and to TVs through AirPlay and Chromecast. If anything, DisneyLife is very much like a Disney-flavored Netflix, and could be looked to as an example of what's to come.
Terms of the deal with Netflix weren't disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Rhimes' ABC production deal is worth more than $10 million per year to produce shows — and she has profit participation which means a percentage cut of all international deals and reruns.
Baker, 32, was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft following an outstanding career at USC, including first-team Walter Camp and second-team Associated Press All-American honors as a senior.
The government's flagship initiatives have barely spent any of the money allocated to them, a parliamentary committee has reported, raising questions about the on-the-ground implementation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's most high profile national programs.Although the government insists the figures are wrong, a report from the parliamentary standing committee on urban development said Modi's six top infrastructure initiatives spent on average just 21 per cent, or $1.2 billion, of the $5.6 billion allocated.India's "Smart Cities" program, which Modi has championed, used just 1.8 per cent of the funds released to it, the committee said, or just $28 million of a dedicated $1.5 billion. Other programs like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Swachch Bharat , used less than 30 per cent of the available funds, the report said.The central government releases funds to states to roll out the initiatives, but the committee said India's Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had "not made realistic projections or proper planning." Despite the ambitious-sounding goals of some of the programs -- such as providing "housing for all," or ending "open defecation" across India -- they suffer from a lack of proper funding, as well as "slack implementation," the committee said."They're coming up with all these grand schemes," Pinaki Misra, a BIju Janata Dal MP and chair of the standing committee, said in an interview. "Too much has been promised, by way of too many projects, with too many fancy acronyms, that haven't really been thought through."The government rejects that view. The small spending amounts in the report don't accurately reflect construction work being done, said Rajeev Jain, a spokesman for the housing and urban affairs ministry.Funds are only considered officially spent once all the work is completed and project managers have sent back "utilization certificates" proving they have spent the cash, Jain said, adding project managers have up to two years to do so, leading to delays."It's not a barometer of the implementation of the project," Jain said. "The payment to a company that is implementing a project is only made when the work is completely over."So far, $3.7 billion worth of projects have been "completed or started," Jain said.Misra, who leads the urban affairs standing committee, said the ministry was "trotting out the usual excuses" by blaming bureaucratic delays in accounting for spent funds."It's an age-old gambit when the center doesn't want to release funds because they don't have funds," he said.The parliamentary report warns that Modi's "well-meaning" projects "will remain a distant dream" if they receive only "meager" funds.In India, where the central government must cooperate with the states, "national transformative projects" such as Modi's smart cities and Clean India initiatives will take time to implement, said Jaijit Bhattacharya, a consultant and adjunct professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.The smart cities program involved a competition supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, which was started by Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP."One cannot pass a diktat forcing people to use toilets. It has to be through persuasion, and that takes time," Bhattacharya said. "However, it is also important that the government machinery actually implements the projects in an honest manner. It is too early to note whether the projects are getting implemented appropriately."
If you're a fan of Kylie Jenner, there's a good chance you know who Jordyn Woods is. The model is the best friend of the Kylie Cosmetics creator, and based on social media, they're practically inseparable. It makes total sense that a Kylie Cosmetics' Jordyn Woods lip kit would finally be coming from the brand. After all, Jenner has worked with sisters Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney Kardashian as well as mom Kris. Now, it's Woods' turn.
If you're not familiar with the model, she worked with successful plus size for fashion brands like ASOS and is a frequent part of Jenner's social media presence. Plus, she was included in Jenner's baby Stormi announcement video with Woods revealing that she was actually with Jenner when she took her pregnancy test. Clearly, these two are had a serious bond. Now, they share a lip kit.
According to Jenner's Instagram account, she's launching four new lip kit shades with her Kylie Cosmetics brand. Two of them are actually relaunching of former shades in older collections (Red Velvet and All Nighter), but two are brand new, and one of them is named Jordy after Woods. The same is a gorgeous cool red shade that is actually in Jenner's velvet formula, not her classic matte.
Woods isn't alone in getting her own lip kit, though. A few days ago, Jenner announced that another close friends of hers would also be getting her own shade. The Kylie Cosmetics founder is close with her assistant Victoria Villarroel, who is also featured in her baby announcement video and was also present when Jenner discovered she was pregnant. Jenner also helped Villarroel get engaged back in 2016. Clearly, this is a friendship and not just an employer and employee relationship.
As for Villarroel's shade, it's also a gorgeous cool red, and Jenner even mentions in her Instagram story that it's a sister shade to Woods' lippie. However, unlike Woods' Jordy, Villarroel's Victoria lip kit is a classic Kylie Cosmetics matte formula.
As for when you'll be able to snag the new Jordyn Woods inspired lip kit and the Villarroel lippies, they'll be coming to the Kylie Cosmetics website on June 1 at 3pm PT. If cool toned reds are your jam, you're in luck. Not only do you not have long to wait to shop the new kits, but with such similiar colors, you can practically pick which formula is right for you: velvet or matte.
While Woods nor Villarroel created a collection with Jenner, her brand is still known for honoring her friends and family with its lipstick names. Like her best friend and her assistant, Jenner's grandmother Mary Jo has a shade named after her. While sister Khloe Kardashian does have collections with the brand, KoKo K also seems to be named after her as well. Then, of course, there's the shade named for her niece Penelope Disick. Plus, her own daughter Stormi has an entire Weather Collection inspired by her. Clearly, Jenner's brand is deeply personal and as such, so are her shade names.
As for the price of the lip kits, they clearly won't change from the current prices listed on the brand's website. As of press time, matte lip kits retail for $29 and velvet lip kits cost $27.
If you want to celebrate Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods' friendship by purchasing the new Jordy lip kit, it'll be up for grabs super soon. Hey, why not even grab one for your own bestie? Mark your calendar for June 1 if you want to shop yet another expansion of Jenner's ever growing cosmetics empire.
Just when you thought the Montreal Canadiens scoring woes couldn't get any more troublesome, it managed to get a whole lot worse on Thursday versus the Carolina Hurricanes at PNC Arena.
Following a 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night where the team managed only a late third-period goal against backup goalie Carter Hutton, the Canadiens looked to bounce back versus the Hurricanes who had surrendered the 10th most goals in the NHL going into the game. Instead, Cam Ward stopped all 23 shots faced to beat Montreal 2-0 and earn his first career shutout versus the Canadiens.
Credit to the veteran goaltender for a job well done, but the Canadiens certainly did not make it overly difficult. Montreal created only 20 scoring chances, 10 high dangerous chances and very few quality opportunities, according to captain Max Pacioretty.
“It's no secret this team is struggling to create offence. We have to figure out why and make adjustments to our game in order to get that offence,” said Pacioretty. “The chances we do get either seem to be too much from the outside or one-and-done.”
It was the seventh time this season the Canadiens failed to score in a game. Their 2.51 goals for per game ranks 29th in the NHL, and the solution to the problem seems to be lost on most of the players in the dressing room.
“I don't know if it's a chemistry thing or something we need to work at as a group, but it's obvious that the goals aren't there so we have to figure out ways to create,” added Pacioretty.
Unsatisfactory Play at Centre
Part of the Canadiens' scoring issue can be attributed to their play down the middle of the ice. This season, only two regularly-used centreman have won over 50 percent of their draws (Tomas Plekanec and Phillip Danault). In Carolina, the Hurricanes won 79 percent of the faceoffs, and only Jonathan Drouin managed to win more than 25 percent of his attempts for the Canadiens.
“When you don't win draws, which we didn't do a good job at all tonight, you spend a lot of time and waste a lot of energy chasing the puck,” said head coach Claude Julien following the loss. “It would be a lot nicer if we could start with it and save our good energy for managing the puck and being on offence.”
“A lot of time too, [the faceoffs] are 50-50 battles and other guys need to get in their and win those,” added Julien.
Inadequate Pressure in Front of the Net
Generating a presence in front of the opponent's net is something the Canadiens have struggled to do this season, which would also explain for their insufficient scoring. Players like Brendan Gallagher and Nicolas Deslauriers are fixtures in opposing creases, but you'd be hard-pressed to find any other consistent net-front presence.
“All goalies in the NHL will stop a shot if no one is in front of the net. You have no chance to score,” said Deslauriers. Even I haven't been there lately. It's tough to get in front of the net. The defence is always trying to box you out, but it's a sacrifice that needs to be made. I think when we were having success, that's what was making the difference.”
Julien echoed Deslauriers' statements, insisting that more pressure needed to be applied in front of the net. The Canadiens worked on the issue in practice on Wednesday and will continue to do so in the future.
“We'd like to see more guys going to the front of the net,” said Julien. “Is it frustrating? Absolutely. That's why we worked on it yesterday and will continue working on it until we get it right.”
The frustration is not only felt by the coach. The shortage of goals and positive results has inevitability taken its toll, and hiding individual irritation has become more difficult to cover up.
“Its becoming very frustrating for sure,” said Paul Byron. “Every game we lose, it becomes less likely that we make the playoffs. Every game we lose, it becomes more and more frustrating.”
The Canadiens playoff chances fell to 0.3% with the loss to the Hurricanes. Nobody within the organization is happy about the present circumstances, but Julien understands that there is still work to be done to mend the shortcomings of the season, and will remain optimistic along the way.
“It's equally frustrating to lose for players and coaches,” said Julien. But my job remains trying to improve and change the outcomes. I'm allowed to be frustrated, but I have the responsibility to rectify the errors we made tonight. In that sense, we have to stay positive.”

American Airline passengers were horrified after staff on a plane allegedly dragged a 'half-naked' dying woman down the aisle of the aircraft after she suffered a heart attack .
Those aboard the Boeing 737 from Dallas to Minneapolis-St Paul said Theresa Hines, 48, had fallen ill in the toilets.
Crew noticed Ms Hines had been in the cubicle for some time after they gave landing instructions for everyone to return to their seats.
When she is woman did not emerge, they discovered that she had collapsed.
(Photo: Reuters)
But passengers say that emergency responders did nothing to cover Ms Hines' modesty as they dragged her from the back of the aircraft to the front exit.
Art Endress, who was seated close to the bathroom where she is believed to have suffered a fatal attack, told the Star Tribune : "The EMT was out of line."
The 63-year-old research engineer added: "The flight attendants could have thrown a blanket on her."
Mr Endress said Ms Hines was naked from the waist down,
But another passenger, Dave Sampsell, rubbished these claims and said: "She was not half-naked. Her pants were unfastened, but I saw nothing that any of the airline of EMT staff did inappropriately."
American Airline officials said Ms Hines was wearing a shirt and underwear at the time and that their focus was getting her medical help.
The patient , from Carrolton, Texas, was then pulled past 150 passengers on a portable stretcher.
(Photo: Facebook)
Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines , told the Star Tribune that flight crews "do what they can when a passenger is in medical distress".
They then "hand over the responsibility for the passenger to the local first responders and stand clear of the situation. We let them do their work."
Mr Endress said that after realising Ms Hines had been in the bathroom for around 45 minutes, the crew asked passengers if any doctors or nurses were on baord.
A doctor, three nurses and other passengers are said to have tended to her.
After landing, Ms Hines was immediately removed from the plane where paramedics were waiting.
(Photo: AFP)
She was taken to the jet bridge where emergency services spent around one hour attempting to resuscitate her, but Ms Hines sadly passed away.
In a statement the airline said: "We are deeply saddened by this event and our thoughts and prayers go out to our passenger's loved ones.
All other travellers were kept on the plane while medics tried to resuscitate the Ms Hines.
When they were eventually let off, a piece of tarpaulin was erected to cover her.
It is believed she died after suffering a heart attack.
EATON —Last week, a Preble County jury convicted Lewisburg resident Gabriel Schaaf, 58, in the December 2016 bludgeoning death of his 29-year-old son Jonothan Schaaf.
According to Prosecutor Martin Votel, Schaaf was found guilty on Tuesday, Jan. 23. Schaff was on trial for the aggravated murder of his son, Jonathan.
On the evening of Dec. 27, 2016, Gabriel Schaaf placed a frantic 9-1-1 call from his home at 3994 Sonora Road, according to Votel. He reported “that he had just returned home from work to find his door ajar and the body of his son on the living room floor.”
Gabriel Schaaf told the Preble County Sheriff's Office two “guys from Eldorado” had threatened his son several weeks before, and that the victim had also received text message threats from an unknown female, Votel noted.
“The Preble County Sheriff's Office pursued these leads with no breaks in the investigation,” Votel reported.
On June 8, 2017, detectives re-interviewed Schaaf and confronted him with inconsistencies in his statements and incongruities between his statements and the physical evidence in the case, Votel said.
“The defendant finally admitting to killing Jonathan with a large wooden ‘stick' and a hatchet, but suggested he acted in self-defense. The defendant admitted that the 9-1-1 call had been a lie – an attempt to point the finger of suspicion at an unknown intruder,” Votel explained in a press release.
The State of Ohio was represented by Prosecuting Attorney Votel and Schaaf by defense attorney Kirsten Knight. Judge David N. Abruzzo presided over the trial.
“The state presented the testimony of the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Jonathan Schaaf. The pathologist confirmed that the victim had been hit in the head several times with ‘great force', shattering his skull and causing a severe brain bleed. After this, the back of the victim's neck sustained 5 ‘chopping' injuries, the most significant of which cut the spinal column in half, nearly decapitating the victim,” Votel said in the press release.
“In the state's estimation, the defendant's claim of self-defense was defeated by this physical evidence, and by several recorded phone calls placed by the defendant at the Preble County jail after his arrest,” Votel said. “In the phone calls, the defendant told family and friends that the victim had inflicted the injuries upon himself.”
“This was a barbaric crime employing multiple weapons and traumatic force,” Votel said. “While the motive for the killing remains unknown, it is beyond dispute that this defendant wanted his son dead and that he acted swiftly and with specific intent to end his life.”
Sentencing in the case is set for March 13, at 1 p.m., in Preble County Common Pleas Court.
Schaaf was convicted of aggravated murder, an unclassified felony carrying four possible statutory sentences: 20-years-to-life, 25-years-to-life, 30-years-to-life, and life without the possibility of parole, according to Votel. His conviction for murder will merge with the aggravated murder conviction, meaning he will not be separately sentenced upon the murder count.
He was also convicted of one count of tampering with evidence is a felony of the third degree carrying a maximum possible sentence of three years.
“Without the tenacity of Dets. Miller and Blevins of the Preble County Sheriff's Office, this case would remain unindicted,” Votel added. “The detectives exhausted every possible lead in the case over a six-month period, before resolving to press the defendant about the parts of his story which did not match the physical evidence and which did not make sense. Their sound interviewing technique and persistence are why Gabriel Schaaf will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.”

If you start building, the loans will come.
At least that's how Gramor Development's new $14.8-million loan for the Vancouver Waterfront Development came about. Barry Cain, Gramor's president and owner, said his company actually started the project without closing on the loan with Banner Bank, because he was so confident the project would go forward.
“We were building these restaurant buildings a way before we closed on the loans,” Cain said. “But I felt comfortable that we'd get it settled out. Until you build buildings, you don't really have a project.”
Gramor and Banner Bank announced in mid-September that the parties had closed on the loan, which will support construction of the new Grant Street Pier restaurant buildings, located across Block 9 and Block 12 at the waterfront.
The 40,000-square-foot, two-building complex will house six marquee restaurants, including Wildfin American Grill, Ghost Runners Brewery, and Twig's Bistro and Martini Bar, all of which have already confirmed plans to occupy the site.
The first restaurants and stores are set to open by July 30, 2018, with the rest of Phase 1 of the waterfront development due for completion on Sept. 30 next year, Cain said.
The overall cost of Phase 1 of the $1.5-billion project will be about $250 million. It includes the development of the $35-million waterfront park and the 90-foot-long cable-stay Grant Street Pier, which will be suspended above the water.
“We've got a lot of things under construction,” Cain said. “Hopefully we'll also get the (Hotel Indigo) construction going in the next three to six months. Then we'll have six buildings under construction on the waterfront.”
Gramor recently closed the sale of Block 4, where the Hotel Indigo is set to go, to Kirkland Development. That company plans to develop the 32,339-square-foot block for the hotel, condos, restaurants and retail spots.
The eight-story hotel, part of InterContinental Hotels Group, will have 138 rooms and a skybar on the top floor.
Area businesses are also excited about the Waterfront Development drawing more people to downtown. Sunny Parsons, owner of Heathen Brewing and the company's Feral Public House at 1109 Washington St., said he's been making patio improvements to his site in anticipation of the growing traffic.
“I think the development is going to create a kind of Pearl District effect (like the one seen in Portland),” Parsons said. “We'll have people here that we aren't used to seeing in Vancouver. There will be high-tech business people, upscale visitors. The boardwalk is going to be beautiful. It's going to be very classy down there.”
As the waterfront becomes more upscale, downtown businesses will also likely have to look at cosmetic improvements to draw more traffic. But overall Parsons thinks that's going to be a good thing for Vancouver.
“I think the rising tide will raise all ships,” Parsons said. “I think this will be a good deal for everybody, except maybe for those trying to find parking. But overall I think it will be amazing.”
Banner Bank was attracted to Gramor's work on the project because it sees the potential for the development to become a thriving local landmark, said Damian Uecker, vice president and commercial real estate relationship manager for Banner Bank.
“In every community, a handful of unique properties become landmarks,” Uecker said. “We believe The Waterfront Vancouver project is bound to hold that moniker in Vancouver. We applaud Gramor's tremendous commitment to this transformational project and are pleased to have an opportunity to be a part of it.”
Cain said the new loan should also help draw more lenders to the project, both for Gramor and other partners.
Finding the first bank is always the hardest, he said.
“It's a special situation,” Cain said. “You have to have lenders willing to look outside of the box, that try to understand what you're doing and to believe in what you're doing. Banner Bank was really interested in doing this loan, and we're grateful to them. It will make it easier to get more banks to sign on in the future.”
Gramor is currently working on blocks 9, 12 and 6 in the project.
Block 9 is 15,000 square feet and can house two restaurants, one of which will be Wildfin American Grill, the Seattle seafood chain. That restaurant will take up about half of the space on Block 9.
Block 12 is more than 28,000 square feet and can house four restaurants, including Ghost Runners Brewery and Twig's Bistro and Martini Bar, which have both confirmed their spots. Block 6 will include office and retail space and has one confirmed restaurant tenant, MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company.
Gramor has worked with Banner Bank on projects in the past, and Cain said the bank has been a great business partner.
“Once we get this going, the whole of downtown Vancouver will be bustling,” Cain said. “Once these buildings finish and do well, more will come. And with this loan, we're officially underway.”

Since Oct. 1, this is the only month when rainfall has met or exceeded its average across the entire Sierra Nevada. It has rained 8 or more inches in the northern Sierra and San Joaquin river basins and more than 5 inches in the Tulare Lake basin since the beginning of the month, according to the Department of Water Resources.
Just an update: The driver of the car that plowed into the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people, driver James Fields, Jr., has been identified as one of the white supremacist demonstrators. I suspected as much. The Daily News has a photograph of him brandishing a “Vanguard America” shield before the terrorist incident. As the paper notes,
Southern Poverty Law Center spokeswoman Rebecca Sturtevant told the News that the logo — two white axes — is a variation of imagery used by the white supremacists and Fields' outfit is standard among the hate group's ranks. The Anti-Defamation League depicted Vanguard American [sic] as one focused on white identity, but noted that its members have “increasingly demonstrated a neo-Nazi ideology.” Indeed, Fields' Facebook page was peppered with similar alt-right and Nazi imagery — such as Hitler's baby photo; a tourist shot of the Reichstag in Berlin; and a cartoon of Pepe the Frog, the anthropomorphic frog hijacked by right-wing groups — before it was deactivated around 11:30 p.m. Saturday. Fields, of Maumee, Ohio, gave the page the title “Conscious Ovis Aries,” using the Latin word for sheep. There was also a picture of him posing with the car that authorities say caused so much mayhem in downtown Charlottesville.
The photo with the Daily News‘s caption:
His mug shot:
And, of course, the white supremacists and anti-Semites are praising Trump for his “it's everybody's fault” reaction, and his continuing failure to decry the bigotry that infused the Extreme Right's demonstration:
Wow, brutal graphic from Fox News pic.twitter.com/0KZZW2BBGd — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) August 13, 2017
Who was responsible for the violence? Clearly Fields appears to be guilty of murder (he's assumed innocent until convicted), but both Left and Right came to the demonstration spoiling for a fight. The white supremacists, however, had their own militia with assault rifles, which, thank Ceiling Cat, were never used. But according to the evening news last night, Leftist protestors also came with sticks, Mace, and other weapons, and after they were separated from the white supremacists, tried to find a way around the police cordons to go after their opponents. While I doubt that the number of attacks were exactly equal on both sides, clearly the Left—at least those who wanted violence or to “shut down” the supremacists, did engage in violence. Here, from Mediaite, is a video of a “counterprotestor” attacking a woman reporter for The Hill who was simply documenting the car crash. Yes, he punched someone, but it wasn't a Nazi.
From Mediaite:
One of the four men arrested for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia was reportedly a counter-protestor who punched a female reporter. Virginia State Police announced last night that 21-year-old Jacob L. Smith of Louisa, Virginia was charged with misdemeanor assault & battery. And now it is known what led to his arrest. The Hill reporter Taylor Lorenz was live-streaming the counter-protest on her phone when James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car into the crowd, that left one dead and 19 injured. While capturing the immediate aftermath of the attack, where she stood only several feet away, Smith approached Lorenz, punched her in the face, and shouted “Stop the f**king recording!” The shirtless counter-protestor can be seen walking into the shot just seconds before the phone was knocked out of her hand.
Left-wing violence will only hurt progressivism and help these racist goons. Nobody should go to a demonstration with a weapon, or with the desire to punch anyone or “shut down” a demonstration. We have recourse to peaceful protest and counterspeech, and that's the moral high ground. I reject those who call for punching white supremacists, or even getting them fired by reporting them to employers. After all, even if this speech is reprehensible, it's free speech and legal under the Constitution. Are we going to try to get every racist fired from their jobs? That is thought policing.
I was surprised to find several readers yesterday saying that the speech of the white supremacist/Nazi sympathizers/nativists should be banned, as some countries do. If you believe that, then you have to decide which speech constitutes hate speech and should be banned. If there's a slippery slope, that is one of them.
As John Stuart Mill argued eloquently in On Liberty, there's a good case to be made for allowing even vile speech to be promulgated, for banning it only drives it underground, while allowing it gives those who hear it a chance to understand it and formulate a response to the other side's arguments. There's a reason why, in 1977, the American Civil Liberties Union defended the right of the American Nazi Party to march in Skokie, Illinois, a Jewish community. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled, along with the Illinois Supreme Court, that the Nazis' display of hatred, including the swastika flag, did not constitute “fighting words”—a prohibited direct incitement of violence. The same is true of the demonstrators in Charlottesville, who basically did the same thing as the Nazis in Skokie.
In truth, I think the best response of the Left would have been to ignore the demonstrators completely. They represent only a small fraction of Americans, are widely reviled, and the counterdemonstrations gave the bigots the publicity they wanted. (Of course the media was there, but I'm not at all sure that an absence of counterdemonstrations would have been a bad thing.) And it would have helped curb the violence.
That violence was also partly due to the Charlottesville Police's policy of allowing demonstrators to come close to each other, almost guaranteeing a nasty confrontation. Perhaps, after the model of demonstrations at political conventions, the demonstrators should be confined to a well demarcated space well apart from those they are protesting. The advantage of this is that it prevents violence but still allows the media to cover the counter-demonstrations, so the opposing speech does get publicized. The disadvantage is that the demonstrators never see those who oppose them. I think the former trumps the latter, and in future cases—and there will be more—the police need to keep the bigots and the progressives far apart, with no chance to attack each other.
At any rate, now is not the time—in fact it's never the time—for the Left to start talking about curbing speech or physically hurting those we revile. It's telling that when the true test of our tolerance for free speech appears—the presence of white supremacists and Nazi sympathizers—many on the Left seem to fold and ask whether we might, after all, consider some censorship. That's a violation of everything that liberals have stood for, and of course comes with the problems of designating who's to be The Decider and what, exactly, constitutes “hate speech.” Let's avoid that debate and stick with the courts' consistent interpretation of what speech is allowed and what speech constitutes harassment or direct incitement to violence.
From the New York Times, here's a memorial to 32-year-old Heather Heyer, whom Fields murdered, and the other 19 victims of the car attack:

Goods that are never delivered, upfront fees and bogus invoices are among the scams most likely to fool bank customers, according to NatWest.
The bank has revealed that nearly 7,000 customers have become the victims of fraudsters since the start of 2016.
The lender, which under RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has been aiming to make itself a “safer, simpler bank”, says “goods not received” cases – when someone pays for items or services that are never delivered – were the most common scam.
These account for 2,073 cases seen by the bank – or about three in ten scams carried out against NatWest customers.
The lender said other hoaxes included “advance fee fraud”, where conmen ask customers for an advance or upfront payments for goods, services and/or financial gains that do not materialise.
There are also “spoof payment requests”, where people receive a bogus official request “purporting to be from someone senior in a company or a client, for payment or drawdown of funds”.
NatWest said business customers also continued to be defrauded for big sums via invoice fraud, when a firm receives an invoice that appears to be from a trusted trading partner but is actually fake.
Les Matheson, NatWest chief executive of personal and business banking, said: “We know scammers can be convincing and they work round the clock to persuade their victims to part with money.
“We have hundreds of people working 24/7 to detect and stop fraud, but it's very important that, as individuals and businesses, we know how to protect ourselves.”
These are the top five scams affecting NatWest customers
1. Goods not received - the customers pays for goods or services but does not receive them from the seller.
2. Advance fee fraud - Fraudsters ask for an advance or upfront payment for goods or services which fail to materialise.
3. Spoof payment requests - Fraudulent requests, possibly purporting to be from a senior figure in a company or a client, for payment or drawdown of funds.
4. Invoice fraud - An invoice appears to be from a trusted trading partner when it is not. The fraudster will say that their payment information has changed and the money should be paid into the new account.
5. Holiday scam - A holiday is booked, usually online, but it later turns out that the holiday does not exist.

KIGALI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Rwandan brewer Bralirwa 's first-half pre-tax profit more than tripled from last year, helped by prudent cost management, it said.
Profits at the brewer, controlled by Heineken, the world's second-largest beer maker, surged to 2.91 billion Rwandan francs ($3.53 million), from 929 million francs in the first half of 2016.
The firm said in a statement it had faced "a challenging operating environment" in the first half, but had managed to minimise the impact on earnings "through price ... management, as well as a strong cost focus."
Bralirwa, Rwanda's oldest brewery, was started in 1957 and is known for beers like Primus and Amstel, as well as a range of sodas produced under licence from The Coca-Cola company.
The firm said it expected some difficulty in the second half from "cost pressures and constrained consumer spending" and that this would likely depress earnings.
Earnings per share jumped to 2.03 francs for the period from 0.58 francs a year earlier. ($1 = 824.9700 Rwandan francs) (Reporting by Clement Uwiringiyimana; editing by Elias Biryabarema and Adrian Croft)
(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Charter Communications Inc said on Friday its quarterly profit surged due to a $9.3 billion benefit related to the recent changes in U.S. corporate tax laws.
Charter's net income rose to $9.55 billion, or $34.56 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $454 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose 3.2 percent to $10.60 billion, helped by strong growth in its residential services business that includes video, internet and voice services.

A mic-cut shortened Hannibal Buress' performance at Loyola University Chicago on Saturday night after the comedian cracked jokes about child molestation in the Catholic Church.
While performing at the Catholic university, the “Broad City” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” actor projected an email from Loyola on stage, which prohibited him from addressing sexual assault or cursing on stage, according to social media reports.
According to Consequence of Sound, Buress followed up by saying, “B— a— old people, I can project … Y'all f— kids, right?”
While the university's administration may not have approved of Buress' joke, many Loyola Chicago students took to Twitter in support of the comedian, criticizing the school for apparently cutting him off.
“Loyola just cut Hannibal's mic. This is ridiculous. We want Hannibal,” one user tweeted.
Another tweeter mocked Loyola with a faux quote: “We are a Catholic school, please no profanity or offensiveness,” followed by the “Y'all f— kids” soundbite from Buress' set.
Loyola: "we are a Catholic school, please no profanity or offensiveness" Hannibal: "y'all fuck kids, right?"@hannibalburess — Tai Chi Latte (@adamscahmics) March 18, 2018
Loyola University Chicago has not yet responded to Variety‘s request for comment.
Buress left the stage after the sound cut out for a 15-minute break before returning to deliver the remainder of his jokes, profanity- and scandal-free. Buress previously garnered media attention for addressing sexual assault in a standup routine from 2014, which commented on the allegations made by multiple women against Bill Cosby.
At the Television Critics Association press tour in 2016, Buress commented on the attention he received from resurfacing the Cosby allegations, saying, “I was calling a bunch of other comedians rapists and that was the only one people took seriously … That's just one joke people took and really ran with it.”

Many people keep dozens – or even hundreds – of pages open in their web browsers simultaneously, so it's no surprise that tab management tools are among the most popular third-party extensions. Groupy applies this idea to all your programs – and it works brilliantly.
Groupy, from Stardock Software, lets you organize programs in browser-style tabs – much like Microsoft's delayed Sets feature. It might sound like a recipe for chaos when you have multiple browser windows and documents open at once, but (as its name suggests), Groupy has a trick up its sleeve, letting you gather related tabs together in convenient collections.
Groupy offers an impressive range of customization options. You can choose how your tabs are positioned (either combined with the titlebar, or positioned above it), whether a close button should be displayed on all tabs or just the active one, whether to display the window icon on tabs (with customizable colors), and whether tabs should extend across the full width of the window.
Once you're happy with your setup, simply toggle Groupy on and you're ready to start making tabs.
Growing groups
To start creating a set of tabs, simply open two windows, grab one and drag it over the title bar of the other.
Rearranging tabs in Groupy is a simple matter of dragging and dropping, and to collect tabs in a group, simply drag one on top of another. In the unlikely event that you find yourself grouping tabs together accidentally when trying to move them, you can also set a condition that the Shift or Control key must be pressed, or that both mouse buttons must be held when tabs are moved.
Groupy won't duplicate the tabs from your web browser, which makes sense – you would probably want them all grouped together anyway. If you do want webpages in separate tabs within Groupy, simply drag the tab out of your browser to turn it into a new window, then drag it over the original window's title bar. It sounds confusing, but it's intuitive once you try it.
It's also possible to restrict the type of windows that can be grouped together, limiting groups to a particular program (ideal for keeping different document types apart), or preventing certain applications from being grouped. Also, while Sets is based around Edge, Groupy is browser-agnostic and lets you create tabs for any programs at all.
One of Groupy's best features is the ability to save custom groups of applications. If you always start your day by launching the same set of applications – web browser, word processor, email client and calendar, for example – this could be a real time-saver.
Developer Stardock Software offers a 30-day free trial of Groupy, after which you can decide whether it's worth the US$9.99 (about £7.50, AU$13.50) investment. If you only use web apps on your PC then Groupy will be surplus to requirements, but for everyone else it's well worth a look.

The entry of Reliance Jio, the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, into India's telecoms sector has set off a brutal price war among operators as they drastically cut prices to compete with Jio's bottomed out plans.
Compounding to the industry's woes, India's telecoms regulator had also cut international termination charges (ITC) - paid by global long-distance operators to local carriers - to 30 paise from 53 paise, effective from February.
“The telecom industry continues to witness below cost, artificially suppressed pricing,” Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel's managing director and chief executive for India and South Asia, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Profit slumped 77.8 percent to 829 million rupees ($12.49 million) in the quarter ended March 31, the company said, its lowest since the quarter ended June, 2003.
Revenue fell 10.5 percent to 196.34 billion rupees.
($1 = 66.3750 Indian rupees)

Happy Birthdayto America
Happy Birthday America. Today, you are 242 years old.
It has become a tradition at the Daily News to remind readers (and ourselves) of the meaning of Independence Day by actually pondering the words that birthed a nation.
And here they are, as approved by Congress on July 4, 1776:
"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes -- and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."
The original text of the Declaration of Independence concludes with a lengthy list of grievances against the British Empire and the King of England, as well as three paragraphs of summation and a list of signers. We have omitted these portions for the sake of brevity. The full Declaration can be viewed at http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html

PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog foresees no early end to winter.
Punxsutawney (puhnk-suh-TAW'-nee) Phil's handlers announced Friday the weather prognosticator saw his shadow.
Legend has it if the furry rodent casts a shadow on Feb. 2, Groundhog Day, expect six more weeks of winter-like weather.
Phil's prediction is decided ahead of time by the group on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill just outside of Punxsutawney. That's about 65 miles (about 100 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.
Spectators bundled up and bopped to music amid the camp and kitsch with the temperature around 11 degrees (minus-12 Celsius).
Records dating to 1887 show Phil predicting more winter 103 times while forecasting an early spring just 18 times. No records exist for the remaining years.

Former President George H.W. Bush was admitted to a Houston hospital Sunday after contracting an infection, according to a statement from his office Monday evening. The 41st president of the United States is 93 years old.
“President Bush was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital yesterday after contracting an infection that spread to his blood,” a statement from family spokesman Jim McGrath read. “He is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. We will issue additional updates as events warrant.”
His wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, was buried Saturday. Barbara died Tuesday at her Houston home. She was 92. The couple was married for 73 years.
Former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and their spouses attended the ceremony along with current first lady Melania Trump.
The elder Bush utilizes a wheelchair and an electric scooter for mobility after developing a form of Parkinson's disease, The Associated Press reports. He's needed hospital treatment several times in recent years for respiratory problems.
Mr. Bush spent two weeks in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia and chronic bronchitis — something his doctors say is a condition usually found in the elderly which can aggravate the symptoms of pneumonia.
In 2015, the AP writes that Mr. Bush was hospitalized in Maine after falling at home and breaking a bone in his neck — and in December 2014 for about a week for shortness of breath. His Christmas holiday in 2012 was spent in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.
Mr. Bush was born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts. He served as commander in chief from 1989 to 1993, served as a congressman, CIA director and Ronald Reagan's vice president.

Mr. Bush attended his wife's funeral wearing a pair of knitted socks decorated in blue, red and yellow books — a tribute to her legacy of promoting literacy. McGrath noted that Barbara had raised more than $100 million for the cause, Reuters reports.
During Friday's public viewing of Barbara's casket, Mr. Bush offered his hand to many of the nearly 2,500 people who walked through the church to pay their respects.

COLOMBO - World Cup-winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on Wednesday said corruption "goes right to the top" in Sri Lanka and accused the International Cricket Council of undermining the game by failing to tackle match-fixing.
Ranatunga, now a government minister, said cricket corruption in Sri Lanka went far beyond the claims made in an Al Jazeera documentary which aired on Sunday. Ranatunga said the allegations must be investigated, "but this must have been happening for a long time. "This is something that goes right to the top (in Sri Lanka). What they will catch is the small fish. As usual the bigger fish will get away," he said. The documentary alleged that a Sri Lankan player and groundsman were involved a pitch-tampering plot and that there was spot-fixing during Tests between India and England, and India against Australia.
"I am so disappointed with the ICC anti-corruption unit," Ranatunga said, referring to previous complaints against Sri Lanka Cricket, which is headed by politician and businessman Thilanga Sumathipala. The 54-year-old, who led Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning team, has in the past accused Sumathipala of involvement in gambling in violation of ICC rules. Sumathipala has denied the charge.
"If they can't see what is happening in Sri Lanka... they should not sit on this anti-corruption unit," Ranatunga told reporters. He said the Sri Lankans implicated in the Al Jazeera documentary could not change the outcome of a Test match unless they had backing from superiors. "They are small fish," Ranatunga said referring to the groundsman of the Galle stadium, Tharanga Indika, and a district coach, Tharindu Mendis. "They can't do it unless they have agreement with those right at the top."
Indika and Mendis have been suspended while the ICC investigates accusations made in Al-Jazeera's undercover report. Sri Lankan police have also started an inquiry. Asked if the Galle groundsman was in a position to tamper with the pitch, Ranatunga said: "There is a top guy involved. He should be held responsible. He should be suspended, not only the person who got (directly) involved."
Ranatunga said the global audience for cricket was declining because of corruption allegations. He blamed the ICC. "The ACU has been very poor. They have not used some of their powers and I think that is one reason why cricket has gone down very badly in the world in the last so many years. "They (the ICC) need to take a big step and take a lot of hard decisions," Ranatunga added. Ranatunga said last year, he raised suspicions that the 2011 World Cup final was tainted.
"The ICC did not investigate, Sri Lanka Cricket did not investigate and we allowed things to continue," he said, adding that he was still distressed by Sri Lanka's six-wicket defeat in the Mumbai final. Sri Lanka, batting first, scored 274-6 off 50 overs and appeared in a commanding position when Indian superstar Sachin Tendulkar was caught for 18. But India turned the game dramatically, thanks partly to poor fielding and bowling by Sri Lanka.
Local media raised suspicions of Sri Lankans throwing the match, but there was no formal call for an investigation until Ranatunga's outburst last year. Ranatunga said Sri Lanka's humiliating 3-2 loss to bottom-ranked Zimbabwe in five one-day matches on home soil last year should also be investigated.
In 2016, the ICC imposed a three-year ban on a Sri Lankan official, Jayananda Warnaweera, for failing to cooperate with an anti-corruption investigation. The former Test player, who was facing a two-year domestic ban over allegations of involvement in match-fixing, failed to attend interviews with ICC investigators. Sri Lankan players and umpires have been accused of match-fixing in the past, but Warnaweera is the highest ranking official to be sanctioned.
Every week of the NFL season tells a story. GIFs -- pronounced "gifs", "jifs" or "gee-oafs" -- can do the same thing. This week we'll focus exclusively on the Bills' overtime victory over the Colts in snow-blanketed Orchard Park. That's right, the Blizzard Bowl.
The CBS telecast opens with the crew in the booth sending it down to Steve Tasker, who deserves a lifetime achievement Emmy for his four hours of sideline work during what was a legit lake-effect snowstorm. Later in the telecast, play-by-play man Andrew Catalon threw it to Tasker with a, "Steve, you still alive down there?" I don't even think he was kidding.
This is pretty much as bad as it got. This is when it is most felt like the Colts' white helmet and uniform combo would present a serious disadvantage for the Bills, who opted for their garish "Color Rush" garb. The Colts even did a little trolling about it on Twitter. It's a given that people at New Era Field were experiencing something wild and unique. But those watching on television were also treated to a surreal experience.
The Bills will clinch top Ebenezer Scrooge status this holiday season if they don't throw their groundscrew a bone after this. This was an unprecedented circumstance acording to people who have been close to Bills football for decades. The storm hit one hour before kickoff and continued through four quarters and a full overtime period. The work for the crew simply never stopped.
Here's another surreal report from Tasker late in the third quarter: "The shovel crew is gassed. They're trying to run back and forth across the field, trying to keep the field clear between plays. They're taking a knee and sucking down Gatorade and everything. I've never seen anything like this game. It's taken a toll on everybody."
Seriously, if there isn't at least a beefy Best Buy gift card in the crew's stockings, the football gods should double down on these Bills postseason drought.
This is a funny punt. I don't imagine Rigoberto Sanchez got too much experience in these conditions at the University of Hawaii.
"The wide receiver did not get two feet in bounds before disappearing in a bottomless snow drift until April. The ruling on the field is an incomplete pass. Third down."
You know who was loving this game? NFL Films, that's who. Sabol Inc. gonna eat. The above replay comes from CBS, who did fine work given the challenges (true story: the telestrator froze). That view of Kelvin Benjamin's touchdown is quite beautiful, isn't it? Another reminder of how much high-definition television has enhanced the sports fan experience. You kids today don't even appreciate it! (loses balance on porch, falls, breaks hip)
If you've ever wondered what 5-foot-9, 250-pound fullback Mike Tolbert looks like when attempting to cut and accelerate in a foot of snow, wonder no more!
"We kept saying it was like we were on a beach [in the sand]," Bills wide receiver Deonte Thompson said after the game. "The snow was so high so every time we stepped in it we would sink so it was tough to run a route. This is going to be something I tell my grandkids about. ... It was a crazy day today."
Let's also give it up for Bills fans, who seemed to make the most of a difficult in-stadium fan experience. Something tells me Bills Mafia was a little more lubricated than usual by the second half. While we're here, how the hell did these fans get home after the game? Are they still there? Is this a National Guard situation? SAVE THE BILLS MAFIA!
There were three touchdowns scored in this game, which amounts to something of a Christmas miracle. The first two led to extra-point attempts, which gave us the high comedy of a bunch of men in tights furiously attempting to clear a landing spot for the poor kicker before the play clock expired. It was like a Double Dare challenge.
Before Adam Vinatieri attempted his game-tying PAT late in regulation, an angry official chased away a Colts water boy (man?) who was getting footsy with turf. No helping allowed, water man!
Vinatieri, of course, is the most famous snow kicker in NFL history, thanks to his heroics in the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoffs (yes, better known as The Tuck Game, Raiders fans). The old man added to his legacy with this funky extra point that hooked inside the upright like a Randy Johnson slider.
Vinatieri missed both his field-goal attempts, including one in the final seconds of the fourth quarter that would've given Indianapolis the win. We'll give him a pass, but someone still has to tell his kids Santa won't make it this year:
Kicking in a blizzard could cost Adam Vinatieri a $500,000 incentive. He needs to hit at least 90% of his field goals this season to get it. He was at 95.7% before the Buffalo game. He's now at 88%. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Joel Corry (@corryjoel) December 11, 2017
LeSean McCoy's touchdown run in overtime set off a joyful celebration in a game that, lest we forget, had huge implications for a Buffalo team attempting to qualify for the postseason for the first time in 18 years. Even if they miss out again, no one can take away their conquest in Blizzard Bowl I.
Never before has a snow angel been this well-earned. Flap your wings, my rugged celestial cosplayer. You deserve to fly.
Until next week.

London and Copenhagen-based fintech startup Pleo, which offers a card and app to manage company expenses, has closed an additional $3.25 million in funding. The round was led by European VC firm Creandum, with participation from pre-seed and seed investor Seedcamp, and previous backer Founders.
Launched officially in July 2016, Pleo consists of the Pleo MasterCard, a prepaid card that can be charged up and handed out to employees, either physically or virtually. This is then coupled with Pleo's backend system and app, making the card somewhat intelligent and able to categorise spending automatically as well as capture any receipts associated with each transaction.
Similar to Soldo's newly-launched business offering, each Pleo user can have different spending rights, such as ‘per transaction' or weekly/monthly limits, with these permissions controlled and monitored via the central Pleo company dashboard.
Transactions are updated in real time, too, and the prepaid element means no waiting to be reimbursed and less waiting for approval, which is traditionally a real pain-point for employees and companies alike. The platform is also able to export data to a company's accounting system.
Johan Brenner, General Partner at Creandum, who will be joining the Pleo board, says in a statement: “Dealing with expenses today involves too many manual processes and creates friction for businesses everywhere. With Pleo, it's now easy to buy things for work and seamlessly manage and control expenses. There are lots of expense apps out there but none that provides the ease of use and integrated solution. We just love strong teams and great products and are proud to partner up with Jeppe and Nicco”.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The new “heat not burn” smokeless cigarette devices are not as harmless as their manufacturer claims, The Guardian reports citing a new study.
iQOS – which stands for “I quit original smoking” – is made by Philip Morris International, best known as the manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes. PMI says its future is “smoke-free”, and it is investing in heated tobacco products, such as iQOS, and e-cigarettes, both of which it says are safer options.
iQOS devices are available in Armenia. They are battery-operated devices into which is inserted a “heat stick” containing a tobacco plug. The heat produces a vapour rather than harmful smoke.
The new research, published in the journal Tobacco Control, found that users speed up their “puff rate” in order to inhale more nicotine because the heat stick lasts for just six minutes, after which the device shuts off and needs to be recharged. That means they may potentially breathe in large amounts of vapour.
The device contains a plastic polymer film filter designed to cool the vapour. The study found that the heat was intense enough to melt the film even though it was not in direct contact with the heating element.
PMI said it welcomed independent testing of the product but disagreed with the findings. As the study had only just been published, the firm was still reviewing the results.

Aside from the five observation aircraft, officers on fisheries patrol flights will also report whale sightings, and a plane from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be looking to identify whales later this summer.
Gosselin said they hope to improve management methods for this year and coming years.
"The objective of the aerial surveillance is to provide estimates of abundance and presence of right whales in the shipping lanes and the fishing areas," he said.
"Also there's a science objective to have a more global understanding of the occurrence, distribution and abundance of right whales through the season on the east coast of Canada."
Six fishing areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were closed to several fisheries as of May 22, including snow crab, rock crab and lobster.
The department is enforcing a static closure zone in the Gulf of St. Lawrence along New Brunswick's northern coast until June 30.
DFO is also enforcing dynamic management closures, which will shut down fishing activities for a minimum of 15 days when there is the confirmed presence of North Atlantic right whales.
Fishermen have expressed concerns over the financial impact of the closures, and Gosselin said observers on the planes know the impact of their reports and how important it is to be accurate.
"That's why we want to make sure we've done the training properly and we want to make sure that we are detecting the animals," he said.
"That's why we are circling back to identify the right whale properly before we transmit the information to Transport Canada and the Fisheries managers to shut down fishing zones or reduce the speed in shipping lanes," he said.
A fitful season for Dodgers pitcher Julio Urias took a concerning turn this week, and now the left-hander is headed back to Los Angeles so team doctor Neal ElAttrache can examine his sore left shoulder.
The triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers placed Urias on the disabled list Wednesday. Urias mentioned to the medical staff that “he wasn't feeling right” a few days ago, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. The team shut him down from throwing. When his condition did not approve, Urias was scheduled for his appointment.
“It's a concern whenever you're talking about a pitcher's arm, especially the shoulder,” Roberts said. “But I think with Julio, I think we've gotten ahead of it. Hopefully it's just inflammation where time will allow it to dissipate. But when you're talking about the elbow or the shoulder, I think there's some pause.”
After an encouraging debut in 2016, in which he became the first teenager to pitch for the Dodgers since Fernando Valenzuela, Urias has been sidetracked often this season. He came to spring training believing he was competing for a spot in the starting rotation, but the team elected to delay his start to the season to limit his innings.
Upon his arrival in the majors in late April, Urias failed to throw strikes on a consistent basis. He walked 14 batters and struck out 11. Before the team optioned him back to the minors near the end of May, Urias owned a 5.40 earned-run average.
The team prioritized his development over his potential ability for the big league club, hoping Urias could clean up deficiencies in his delivery facing lower-quality competition.
Urias appeared to find traction during an outing on June 10. He struck out eight batters and walked one in 5 2/3 innings. But soon after, his shoulder became an issue.
“It really hasn't gotten a whole lot better,” Roberts said. “So we figured we'd go get a scan.”
Puig to appeal punishment
Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig received a one-game suspension for making an obscene gesture toward fans during Tuesday's game against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field.
Puig chose to appeal the suspension, and was in the lineup Wednesday. The punishment also included an undisclosed fine.
Puig flashed his two middle fingers toward fans behind the plate after hitting a home run. He said afterward that four people were heckling him before and after the at-bat. Puig expressed contrition for having “stooped to their level,” he said Tuesday night.
Roberts spoke with Puig before Wednesday's game.
“It was something that he wishes didn't happen,” Roberts said. “It was a reaction of emotion on his part. Bad judgment. I just made it clear that I want to talk about all our players in the context of what they do on the field, not off the field. He understood how I felt. It won't happen again.”

KARACHI - Father of Naqeebullah moved to the Sindh High Court challenging detention of Malir SSP Rao Anwar in Multan Lines in the Malir Cantonment which had been declared a sub-jail.
Former Malir SSP Rao was the prime suspect in a fake encounter and killed Naqeebullah three others.
Khan Muhammad stated in his petition that the Multan Lines was declared a sub-jail by the government without seeking an order from the court. He pleaded Rao should be treated as ordinary accused and should be sent to jail.
The suspended SSP and his 11 detained subordinates with around 15 absconding officers are accused of abducting Naqeebullah, with three other detainees by dubbing them militants in a staged encounter in Malir on Jan 13.
In his plea, Naqeebullah's father submitted that Rao Anwar was shifted to his house from jail illegally. The accused spent just few days hardly in jail, later, was shifted to his own house on verbal order of the provincial administration.
He added that the prosecution was not able to produce an official notification in the court about declaring the place of detention of suspended SSP Rao Anwar as sub jail, who reportedly faced threats to his life.
While, talking to the media after filing the petition, Khan Muhammad said that he will continue his struggle for justice. He said that the judiciary is the only hope of the poor people, therefore he knocked the door of the judiciary.
He's again accusing Rao Anwar for killing of son and said that the former SSP had killed many people in fake encounters.
Earlier, the South Waziristan's based, Khan Muhammad had filed a complained with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) seeking financial accountability of SSP Rao Anwar, wherein he stated that Anwar was involved in acquiring assets beyond his means and remained involved in the offence of money laundering as his travel record reveals that he made 74 trips to Dubai since 2012 during which he served as SSP Malir.
Khan added that how can a person with a salary of Rs113,772 can afford so many international trips.
Furthermore, it was also mentioned in an application that the suspended the SSP was involved in extorting protection money and running a number of rackets, including land grabbing, sand and gravel lifting for construction business, smuggling Iranian petrol, vice dens, narcotics and illegal water hydrants and requires a serious investigation.

I may not know you, but allow me to speculate. Maybe the “Bachelor in Paradise” controversy earlier this summer enraged you. Or maybe you closed your eyes and covered your ears and hoped it would go away. Maybe you felt a little queasy about the lack of information that was made public, the lawyering up, the accusations and speculation. Maybe you felt uncomfortable about the way the whole mess was not addressed on “The Bachelorette” and only used to tease and emotionally manipulate people into watching the premiere. Maybe you felt guilty about watching. Well, if the lead-up to this season of “Bachelor in Paradise” made you feel anything at all, you probably have a lot to say after the first episode, which did essentially nothing to address the situation that caused production to shut down. Ah, yes, a full two hours was spent on the events leading up to the event.
But, of course, we saw it coming. The first two episodes of “Bachelor in Paradise” are spread across consecutive nights — Monday and Tuesday. They can't just give it all away, you know? They've dragged it out this far, after all.
If, at this point, you're in need of a catch up at this point, here's what you should know: “Bachelor in Paradise” production was suspended in early June over “allegations of misconduct,” which, upon the completion of an internal investigation, were found to be invalid, and production resumed. In the meantime, speculation regarding what happened had gone absolutely nutso, and some of the key details about the event in question have still not been made public.
Anyway, the episode starts with a speech, courtesy of Chris Harrison, explaining that the show will address what happened. He taped the footage — which is interspersed throughout the episode for maximum hype — just before production resumed. He explains that two and a half days of filming took place before production temporarily stopped, and that is what will air during the premiere. Cut to an especially absurd credit sequence (quick aside … was Danielle M.'s CPR on the beach supposed to be a reference to her dead fiance???) and then the introductions begin.
We'll get to the coupling up and dates in a bit, but first, the DeMario and Corinne stuff. When production starts, DeMario is pushing a redemption arc after he was confronted on “The Bachelorette” by a woman who claimed to be his girlfriend, and he was promptly sent packing. He stars “Paradise” by trying to win over Raven, who is especially skeptical. “If you just owned it, I and everyone would respect you more,” she says. DeMario tells the camera that he won over Raven “in a minute or so.” Cut to Raven: “I would say DeMario is full of sh—.”
Then, Corinne. The show is very unsubtle in its decision to include in her introduction, this exchange: “Do you have a boyfriend?” Chris Harrison asks. “I don't,” she says. “So you're single,” he responds. This, as rumors and reports to the contrary spread during the time that production was shut down.

MINNEAPOLIS -- NBC will introduce some new wrinkles to its broadcast of Super Bowl LI between the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles.
Mark Lazarus, Chairman of NBC Broadcasting & Sports, said Saturday at the NFL's "1st and Future" technology event that his team will debut a new, higher angle of the contest for TV viewers.
"In terms of innovation, we strive to bring the broadcast to people in innovative ways," Lazarus said during a panel discussion. "You'll see a couple of new things from us tomorrow. You'll see what we're calling the 'High SkyCam' which is the second SkyCam, which gives sort of a video game look and feel to the game. We'll use it to show how plays develop. We'll use it to show some of the perspectives that different consumers have become used to playing things like Madden. It gives our producers and optionality to show the game in a unique format."
NBC tinkered with the video-game view this season in an effort to attract younger viewers to its Thursday Night Football broadcasts. The network utilized the SkyCam as the primary viewing angle of its Week 11 tilt between the Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers. Sunday's tilt won't take on that extreme approach but could give viewers a new and better look at how plays develop. No network has utilized two SkyCams for a Super Bowl in the past.
The dual SkyCam system isn't the only innovation NBC will roll out for its Super Bowl broadcast.
"We're debuting some 3D imaging that we've done," Lazarus said. "We've taken three players from each team, and we've traced them and done 3D imaging, some of what the medical field does in 3D imaging. And we'll be able to show players in a unique way throughout the game and something that's never been done here. ... Some of it will work, not all of it does, like in any innovation and technology, but the stuff that do we'll be able to implement off into the future."
The three players from each team are reportedly Nick Foles, Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham, Tom Brady, James Harrison and Danny Amendola.
Lazarus added that he expects about 165 million viewers for NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII.
"I think we are going to be joined by about 165 million," he said. "What's typically one of the biggest issues in our business is measurement and keeping track of people. Especially in games like the Super Bowl, we're underreported. So, we anticipate and think it's going to be around 165 million. Whether that's the number that gets out and reported, we think that's the real number."

People think that if you look this way, you can't be downtrodden. They have this stereotyped image -- and it's nice to challenge stereotypes. I've had my fair share of ups and downs.
A Hartlepool secondary school has been told it must improve after a Government watchdogs found failings in a host of areas.
A team of eight Ofsted inspectors visited English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College, in Catcote Road, on May 17 and 18.
Teachers do not challenge poorly presented and sloppy work consistently and some teachers' expectations of what pupils can do are too low Ofsted report
The document concludes that the institution, led by headteacher Stephen Hammond – which has 1,513 pupils – as a whole ‘requires improvement'.
This conclusion also applies to three individual inspection categories – overall effectiveness of leadership and management; and quality of teaching, learning and assessment.
Two areas were rated ‘good' – personal development, behaviour and welfare; and 16 to 19 study programmes.
Mr Hammond said the findings reflect higher standards of Ofsted and is confident of addressing the areas for improvement before their next inspection.
The report states: “This is a school that requires improvement. Leaders have not sustained the pupils' good rates of progress seen at the time of the last inspection.
“Standards fell sharply after that time and have yet to recover fully.
“Pupils' progress from their above-average starting points into school has not been good enough, particularly in science.
“Despite recent improvements, the quality of teaching has been too variable across and within subjects and classes over time.
“Consequently, not all pupils achieve as well as they should. Teachers do not challenge poorly presented and sloppy work consistently.
“Some teachers' expectations of what pupils can do are too low.”
It adds: “Support for pupils who require additional support for their special educational needs and/or disabilities is inconsistent, resulting in varying rates of progress over time.
“Until recently, absence and temporary exclusion rates for disadvantaged pupils have been too high.
“The headteacher's reports to directors contain insufficient information about the progress of disadvantaged pupils.”
However, the school did receive praise for areas including its Sixth Form and Catholic ethos.
The report reads: “Directors and governors embrace the headteacher's vision for improvement.
“Actions they are taking are making a positive difference but it is too soon to see their full impact.
”The sixth form is good. Improvements to the quality of provision are ensuring that current students are making good progress in their learning.
“Progress in art is excellent. The Catholic ethos lies at the heart of the school's work.
“It promotes pupils' personal qualities and their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development successfully.
“Pupils feel safe, are polite and usually behave well.
”Strong careers advice and guidance contribute to the high proportion of pupils moving on to their chosen destinations successfully.”
Academy ‘has right things in place', headteacher told.
The school's headteacher Stephen Hammond says the school will continue to improve.
Mr Hammond said: “The judgements reflect the very high standards expected under the most recent Ofsted inspection framework (September 2016) which places a much greater emphasis on the performance of disadvantaged pupils compared with all pupils nationally.
“I am very happy that the education of young people in our care should be subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny.”
Regarding pupils' progress between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4, Mr Hammond said: “We currently have a very strong team of teachers with subject leaders increasingly confident about the quality of teaching and learning in their departments.
“I strongly believe that we will continue to improve in this key performance measure and that this will be securely positive over the next couple of years.”
He said inconsistency of practice and standards within and between departments will be quickly addressed.
Mr Hammond added: “As the Lead Inspector said to me ‘The Academy has all the right things in place and the green shoots are beginning to appear'.”

Jim Carrey's Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump portraits
Because no one is safe from politicized rancor in 2018, conservatives hate Jim Carrey now. The actor/comedian drew Republican ire over the weekend when he posted an unflattering portrait of what is presumed to be White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The caption of the “cartoon,” as Carrey put it, doesn't actually mention Sanders by name, but it's not exactly cagey about whom the picture is meant to be. “This is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked,” Carrey wrote in the tweet. “Monstrous!”
Predictably, conservatives were quick to jump on the former Ace Venture, with many saying they would never again watch his films. Sanders' father, former presidential candidate and Fox News talk show host Mike Huckabee, took his own shot on Twitter. Linking to a Fox and Friends video asking if Carrey's picture and religious commentary had “gone too far,” Huckabee had a few choice labels for the comedian:
“Pathetic BULLY, sexist, hater, bigot & ‘Christaphobe' @jimcarrey attacks @PressSec for her faith; what would be hypocritical Hollywood reaction if he called someone a ‘so-called Muslim' or ‘so-called Jew?' #classlessCarrey”
We can't fault a father standing up for his daughter, but calling someone a sexist bully for drawing a caricature — an art based on exaggeration — feels like just the type of PC BS people like Huckabee are supposed to be admittedly against. Not to mention the fact that “Christaphobe” sounds like a word made up by bigots trying to hide behind fabricated hypocrisy.
Carrey hasn't seemed particularly phased by the uproar. In fact, on Monday, he tweeted out another political cartoon, this one depicting Donald Trump as the Wicked Witch of the West, a nice play on the POTUS' claim that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.”
Find Carrey's tweets, and Huckabee's response, below. Carrey's Twitter account has actually been filled almost exclusively with political cartoons as of late, and some are actually damn good; check his feed here.

4 best bits of winter driving advice
Posted: 1 pm ET
Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow and told us more winter was on the way and, as if on cue, wintry weather began blanketing much of the country, ranging from (more) heavy rains in the west to blizzard conditions in the northeast with more snow on the way.
Not everyone can declare a snow day and stay off the roads, so top fuel drag racing champion Doug Herbert has some advice if you need to get behind the wheel of your car. Herbert, whose 12- and 17-year-old sons were killed in a car crash in 2008, is the founder of the non-profit, teen-focused defensive driving program that goes by the acronym BRAKES (Be Responsible and Keep Everyone Safe).
RATE SEARCH: Time to replace your car? See what you can afford, using Bankrate's auto loan calculator.
Here are Herbert's best winter driving tips:
Watch for ice: Icy patches will develop first on bridges and overpasses, so pay special attention to those areas. Look out for what appear to be puddles or shiny spots, even when roads are otherwise dry. Don't cruise: A car's cruise control system can have a hard time on a slippery road and can add power incorrectly. That can result in losing control. Instead, slow down and deactivate all cruise control systems. Understand ABS: Remember that your car's anti-lock braking system (ABS) can be noisy when it is activated and operating normally and can cause the brake pedal to vibrate in a way that can seem unusual. Understand what your ABS feels like normally by testing it in a dry, empty parking lot, so you're not alarmed if it is activated during winter driving conditions. If you do feel the ABS activate, continue to push down on the brake pedal as you normally would, and look and steer in the direction you want to go. Plan for bad weather: When winter weather hits and you need to get out, be prepared. Make sure you have an emergency kit, as well as a snow shovel and something to provide traction if your car gets stuck, such as kitty litter.
Here are 20 must-haves in your car emergency kit.

Wednesday afternoon, a Kansas couple became parents to five Kansas siblings whose adoption request gained international attention.
Jeff and Toni Whaley of rural Douglas County officially adopted the so-called "Fab Five," ages 3 to 12, a little over a year after they saw a video online about the children.
The Whaleys applied for adoption soon after they saw the video, they said Wednesday, before a story by The Star on the children's hope to stay together went viral on social media.
The siblings are (from youngest to oldest): Olive, Landon, Layla, Preston and Bradley. The Whaleys have no other children, though they've served as foster parents the past several years.

"We feel blessed," Jeff Whaley said.
Featured in March 2017 in The Star's weekly "Family Wanted" feature, the siblings' story drew some 7 million online readers and thousands of offers to adopt from as far away as Ireland and New Zealand.
The unprecedented flood of inquiries on the state-contracted Adopt Kansas Kids website crashed the site the day after the children's story published.
The Kansas Department of Children and Family Services, which oversaw the children's placement, strove from the start to keep them together in their home state. They had been living in separate foster homes in central Kansas.
Until Wednesday's court proceeding, the state strictly guarded the siblings' background and even where they were living. Still, the few details about their story seemed to captivate: big brother Bradley was "the music lover"; middle child Layla "is already planning to save sick or injured animals when she grows up"; Layla "loves to be cuddled."
State officials later said interest in the Fab Five helped draw families to other children in need of adoption.
Johnson County District Judge Kathleen Sloan presided over the adoption ceremony. Earlier this year, Sloan legalized the adoption of four siblings, ages 11 to 17, to Eric and Phyllis Watson of Gardner.
"There is nothing better than an adoption, in part because you came into this courtroom happy and I get to let you leave happy," Sloan said.

We feel very blessed,” Jeff said. pic.twitter.com/FJiVTEsT0S — Conner Mitchell (@ConnerMitchell0) May 30, 2018 The 5 have lived with Jeff and Toni since the beginning of the school year.

They've been through some pain, but they've adjusted well to having some positive role models (in our family).” pic.twitter.com/4KfftUIVNk — Conner Mitchell (@ConnerMitchell0) May 30, 2018
Kansas City lawyer Gene Balloun provided pro-bono assistance to the Whaleys, as he has done for more than 1,000 other local adoption cases. His law firm, Shook Hardy & Bacon, administers the state-funded Kansas Foster Children Adoption and Scholarship Program, which provides college tuition grants to persons once in the foster-care system.
"When these five children reach college age, they'll qualify for the help," said Balloun, himself a foster parent to 29 children going back decades.
The five siblings have lived with the Whaleys since the beginning of the school year.
“They are very happy," Jeff Whaley said. "They've been through some pain, but they've adjusted well to having some positive role models (in our family).”
Nine-year-old Layla, the chattiest one, said: "It was really, really important that we stay together."
After the proceeding, she praised Judge Sloan.
"That was amazing," she said. "The judge was so nice."

Walt Disney Co.'s potential deal to acquire much of Rupert Murdoch's entertainment empire appears to be in the home stretch as the only other serious bidder, Comcast Corp., confirmed that it was no longer in the running.
Comcast last month expressed interest in buying some of the same 21st Century Fox assets that Disney wants to buy, including Fox's movie and television studio and international properties.
“When a set of assets like 21st Century FOX's becomes available, it's our responsibility to evaluate if there's a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said in a statement to various news organizations. “That's what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”
Disney first approached Rupert Murdoch several weeks ago to propose buying Fox's television and movie studio, 22 regional sports networks, a stake in Hulu and international television assets, but talks stalled. Comcast tried to engage Fox in negotiations during a lull in its talks with Disney, but Fox didn't seem interested in pursuing a deal, according to people close to the process.
Comcast never made a financial offer for the Fox assets, according a person close to the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Comcast -- one of the nation's largest Internet service and cable television providers — already owns NBCUniversal, the company owns NBC and Universal Pictures.
Wall Street analysts had speculated that it would have been difficult for Comcast to secure the necessary approvals from federal regulators to complete a Fox transaction. The U.S. Justice Department is trying to block a similar tie-up between AT&T and Time Warner Inc.
The Philadelphia-based cable giant has struggled to get deals approved before. The Justice Department in 2015 moved to oppose Comcast's proposed deal to buy another cable company, Time Warner Cable. Comcast withdrew its offer for Time Warner Cable in the face of the government's opposition. Charter Communications eventually bought Time Warner Cable.

Facebook's “Poke” feature has never really gone away, but now the social network is giving it a more prominent placement – and is even considering expanding the set of casual greeting options to include others, like a wink, wave, high-five or hug.
A number of people recently noticed the return of the Poke on Facebook's mobile app.
Though Facebook had never really discontinued the age-old feature, which serves as a quick way to get someone's attention on its network, it has now given the Poke a highly visible spot.
At the top of users' profiles on mobile, the Poke button sits next to a Message button, and right below your friend's name and photo.
The Poke is one of Facebook's oldest features. It existed at a time when the social network was still called Thefacebook, for example, and there wasn't as much to do on the site as there is today. The meaning of the Poke was never defined, as Facebook decided to leave it up to interpretation.
“When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose,” Facebook had explained in the past. “People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.”
Of course, many people took the Poke to be a form of virtual flirting while others saw it as more of a joke. Poke wars between friends ensued, as well.
Now it looks like Facebook wants to give the Poke another shot.
The new Poke button's placement also makes it easier accidental Pokes to occur, when you were aiming for the Message button instead, or just browsing through a user's profile.
For this reason, not everyone is thrilled with the new button, it seems:
The new Facebook app makes it too easy to poke people. That was supposed to be hard to get to so girls knew you were really thinking about them. — Dave M (@dmm117) December 3, 2017
Okay, but Facebook has now made it far too easy to accidentally ‘poke' someone. It's right on the top of their profile. I don't need that stress in my life. — Er[no room at the]inn Victoria🎄✨ (@erinn_victoria) December 2, 2017
Did you know you can still “poke” people on Facebook? I didn't. Until I ACCIDENTALLY POKED SOMEONE LAST NIGHT and they poked me back. 😑 — Alice Smith Avery (@alicees28) December 8, 2017
Because the feature is from an earlier era of Facebook history, the Poke is actually somewhat mysterious to some users who don't know what the feature does or why it's there. Others, who do remember the Poke, assumed it had been removed and has just now returned:
does anyone know what the “poke” button on facebook means? I just found out i had 288 pokes, some were from like 2012 but i poked all them back so whatever. — Hannah Evans (@hannah_cathryn_) December 8, 2017
This seems like a bad time for Facebook to bring back the "poke" feature. — Loueyville (@loueyville) December 7, 2017
So Facebook brought back the “poke” button — Marisa Lee Martin (@MarisaLeeMartin) December 7, 2017
I THINK THEY HAVE POKE BACK ON FACEBOOK 🤯 — SMIIRK (@smiirkmusic) December 7, 2017
Why did Facebook bring back the poke!? 👉 — Stephanie (@peaseymarie) December 7, 2017
But the Poke had never been shut off for good – it was just tucked away in the navigation. Now, it's sort of impossible to miss.
Facebook isn't done with the Poke yet, either.
The company has been testing a new series of greetings including hello, high-fiving, hugging, and winking, in addition to the Poke, The Next Web recently discovered.
These also sit at the top of users' profiles for those who have been added to the test group, and appear as bright, colorful buttons. (It had tested a “hello” button earlier this year, as well.)
Above: a demo of the new Greetings feature on Facebook
The idea with Greetings is to offer Facebook users more ways to reach out to friends, beyond posting to their profiles, commenting and direct messaging. With these more lightweight interactions, you can show a friend you're thinking about them with little effort on your part.
But Facebook will need to be careful with the launch of Pokes and Greetings. In the past, some women said the Facebook Poke often felt like a creepy flirting tool, for example. If the new Greetings buttons or the new Poke button are available to anyone on Facebook to access, and not just a user's friends, they could be abused as a way to pester someone online.
Not everyone has the test of the Greetings buttons or the new Poke button, we understand. Facebook would not confirm if or when it would make these features publicly available to all.
The trial of Douglas Garland has captivated Albertans. On Wednesday, the jury will begin its deliberations and as Sarah Kraus reports, some may need help after hearing graphic testimony for weeks.
When Elijah (Andrew Rannells) first came onto the scene in Season 1, he was Hannah's pseudo-nemesis ex-boyfriend. But the two went on to become best friends and roommates. He could still be cruel, like when he told Hannah she'd make a terrible mother, but his meanness was so obviously a product of his own fears and insecurities that it was somehow more excusable. At the end of the series, Elijah's career had taken off. He got a major part in White Men Can't Jump: The Musical despite botching part of his first audition. And the famous anchor (Corey Stoll) who dumped Elijah in a particularly heartless way came crawling back.
Ray, played by Alex Karpovsky, was either a delightfully odd bird or an insufferable know-it-all, depending on your perspective. During the final season, he had some rough moments. He lost one of his best friends, Hermie (Colin Quinn), and ended things with Marnie. (Finally.) But over six seasons, he also triumphed. He became a local politician, the successful proprietor of an anti-hipster coffee shop (thanks to Shoshanna) and he was the only character to get a romantic comedy-calibre happily ever after. When Shoshanna introduced Ray to her old boss, Abigail (Aidy Bryant), the two hit it off. They ended up traipsing around Brooklyn, interviewing people about gentrification and capped their day with an awkwardly adorable kiss on a carousel.
The final season of Girls kept us guessing. Would Hannah and Adam get back together? Would Elijah make it on Broadway? Now that the series finale has aired, we have our answers. Some outcomes were better than others. Here's a look at who wound up where, ranked from the best fate to the worst.
So Shosh (Zosia Mamet) was getting married. After mismatched pairings with Ray and Scott (Jason Ritter), Shoshanna finally found her other half — and at a cupcake vending machine, no less. In a way you could say she had everything she wanted, yet she still had an astonishing amount of bitterness. When Hannah accidentally crashed her engagement party, Shoshanna told her former best friends, not to mention her cousin, that the past six years had been a complete waste of time. Maybe that's a sign she has moved on from toxic relationships. But it was also kind of tragic.
Motherhood didn't turn out to be a walk in the park for Hannah (Lena Dunham) and that shouldn't have been a surprise. Throughout the series, she could barely take care of herself even though she was the only one she ever really cared about. So what would adding Grover to the mix mean? Apparently anger, frustration and some serious postpartum depression. But it wasn't all bleak for Hannah. Out of nowhere, like a gift from the gods, Hannah had gotten a good-paying job as a professor in a cute university town (even though she had zero qualifications for such a post). She ended up alone romantically. In the end, the only partner Hannah would accept was Marnie, but it was clear that her codependency might be running its course. In the final episode, Hannah seemed to realize that it was time to be a grown-up and, for once, she was at least attempting to play the part.
Adam Sackler
Could Adam (Adam Driver) ever be truly happy? He wasn't exactly a content kind of guy, always one minor altercation away from a total meltdown. One thing was clear from the movie he made about his time dating Hannah: he wasn't completely over her. But his attempt to woo her back and his offer to help her raise her child fell flat. He ended up back at home with Jessa, his consolation prize. Professionally, at least, he had done pretty well, scoring enough parts in Broadway plays and antidepressant commercials to bankroll his own low-budget movie.
Jessa Johansson
Jessa (Jemima Kirke) was one of the sadder characters, even if she was routinely selfish and awful. On the plus side, she managed to stay sober even when she knew her boyfriend was trying to win back his ex. But the gross hookup in the bar bathroom, the fact she dropped out of school and the knowledge that she wasn't Adam's first choice made her more tragic. At least she was starting to do some soul-searching, coming to terms with how nasty she could be.
Marnie Michaels
“I don't need to be happy,” Marnie (Allison Williams) said in the final episode and suddenly the character that viewers loved to hate earned some compassion. Here she was trying to almost single-handedly raise Hannah's son and, even though she was getting nothing but rage and ridicule from her best friend, Marnie didn't seem to mind. She had one of the more dramatic falls from grace. Divorced from Desi and jobless, she couldn't afford her apartment anymore, so she moved home with her mother before relocating to be with Hannah. But there was a silver lining: for the first time in a long time, she was putting someone else first. And, hey, there's always law school.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is awarding $18.9 million towards research that aims to accelerate the use of genome sequencing in clinical care. The new awards will generate innovative approaches and best practices to ensure that the effectiveness of genomic medicine can be applied to all individuals and groups, including diverse and underserved populations, and in healthcare settings that extend beyond academic medical centers.
The research is being funded as part of the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) Consortium. CSER2 builds upon the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) Consortium, initiated in 2010 and funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of NIH. The new grants will support the development of methods needed to integrate genome sequencing into the practice of medicine, improve the discovery and interpretation of genomic variants, and investigate the impact of genome sequencing on healthcare outcomes.
“CSER's initial goal was more exploratory in nature to see if we could, in fact, integrate genome sequencing into clinical care,” said Lucia Hindorff, Ph.D., M.P.H., a program director in NHGRI's Division of Genomic Medicine. “The exploratory focus allowed each site to develop its own approach. Working together, CSER investigators were effective in identifying common challenges and opportunities for advancing this integration.”
With this new round of funding, CSER2 investigators will continue the effort to generate evidence for the usefulness of genome sequencing in clinical care, but with a particular focus on diverse and underserved individuals. To that end, NHGRI and NCI have partnered with the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to improve processes for recruiting and retaining patients to participate in research from diverse racial and ethnic groups, as well as from currently understudied clinical healthcare settings where genomic medicine could potentially be put into practice.
“Engaging patient populations that are traditionally underrepresented in genomics research, coupled with the inclusion of broader types of healthcare settings, will enrich the data that result from CSER2,” said Regina Smith James, M.D., director of Clinical and Health Services Research at NIMHD.
In Fiscal Year 2017, CSER2 is awarding grants to six clinical sites and one coordinating center, with the awards planned for a total of four years. CSER2 will also continue to include collaborators such as those from the NHGRI Intramural ClinSeqÒ study. The clinical sites – all with a goal of recruiting at least 60 percent of participants from diverse or underserved settings – will include research that covers geographical areas from the racially diverse populations in Houston, to the underrepresented minority populations in Harlem and the Bronx in New York. Each project will address additional areas that will be common across CSER2 sites, such as the effectiveness of treatment decisions; patient and familial response to genomic testing; patient-provider-laboratory interactions that influence the use of genome sequencing; and integrating genomic, clinical and healthcare data to build a shared evidence base for clinical decision making.
With the help of the coordinating center, which assures the organization and logistical support to stimulate synergies among the six individual projects, CSER2 will continue to develop and enhance the evidence base required to bring genome sequencing to non-academic clinical settings, as well as to diverse patient groups.

Minister of State for Information, Broadcasting, National History and Literary Heritage Ms Marriyum Aurangzeb has vehemently condemned a suicide attack on a Pakistan Army unit in Swat that resulted in the martyrdom of 11 officials and injuries to 13 others.
Expressing deep grief and condolences with the bereaved families, she prayed for blessing of the departed souls and early recovery of the injured.
She said the Pakistan Army had offered unmatched sacrifices in the war against terrorism. Our martyrs are our pride and whole nation salutes them, she added. The minister said the valiant sons of the soil were writing the history of bravery with their bloods.
CAIRO - Egypt's army on Tuesday announced the release of 13 Egyptians kidnapped in eastern Libya, which has been plagued by chaos and security problems since 2011. Army spokesman Colonel Tamer al-Rifai said in a statement the 13 "were abducted by an armed criminal group in the Ajdabiya region". The statement said their liberation had been made possible by "coordination with the general command of the Libyan army", without elaborating. The Libyan National Army is loyal to Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the strongman in eastern Libya and a rival of Fayez al-Sarraj, leader of the Tripoli-based and internationally recognised national unity government.
As part of this year's Nobel Peace Prize Exhibition, Ban the Bomb, the Nobel Peace Center presents five personal artefacts left by victims of the 1945 nuclear bombs, showing for the first time in Northern Europe. These artefacts bear silent witness to the devastating impact of the nuclear bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the lives that were lost and forever changed.
The personal belongings are presented in the exhibition alongside a unique photo series by internationally acclaimed visual artist Sim Chi Yin about the current nuclear threat, and a tribute to Nobel Peace Prize winner ICAN and call to action to engage in the work against nuclear weapons.
“These artefacts left by victims of the 1945 atomic bombs bear silent, but strong, witness to the devastating impact on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and above all on the human beings that were living there. We are very grateful for the generous loan of the artefacts from the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and the Kyoto Museum for World Peace”, says Liv Tørres, Director at the Nobel Peace Center. “This is the first time that artefacts from Hiroshima and Nagasaki are presented in Norway and we hope that these personal and telling artefacts will move people's hearts and inspire debate on nuclear weapons.”
The artefacts include a bag, a hood, a lunch box, a rosary and a wrist watch.
The first artefacts are a school bag that contains an air raid hood that belonged to Yukitoshi Masuda, a 13-year-old boy who was working at a building demolition worksite in Hiroshima on the morning of August 6th, and went missing after the horrendous blast. His father searched for him in the city for a week, but never found his son. The only remains was Yukitoshi's bag that had been found and delivered to the family by a neighbor.
A lunch box belonging to another student, Yuso Ikuta, was found at the demolished site in Hiroshima where he was working together with 180 students from his school. Their bodies were in such condition that they were difficult to identify, or even burnt to ashes, but Yuso's mother identified his lunch box as it contained the burnt remains of the food his mother had made for him that fateful morning.
A rosary will also be displayed that was found in the ruins of a house 500m from the hypocenter of the Nagasaki nuclear bomb explosion. The rosary is a reminder of the thriving Catholic community that resided in the city before the nuclear bomb destruction.
The last object is a glaring reminder of how quickly life can change in a minute. It is a wrist watchthat was found in the ruins of a house only 600 meters from the epicenter of the explosion. It stopped at 11:02 am, the exact time that the nuclear bomb exploded over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
“These objects touch every part of your being. They show us that the destruction of the nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki first and foremost hit individuals, like Yukitoshi and Yuso. Each object tells a unique story and is a strong reminder of the horror of nuclear weapons.”, says Liv Astrid Sverdrup, Director of exhibitions at the Nobel Peace Center.

A Ford Explorer SUV that the auto company repaired for a return to service with the Austin police department has again been pulled off the street because exhaust containing carbon monoxide was seeping into it. Ford was also investigating why many non-police consumers have also complained to the automaker and the government about exhaust fumes — which contain odorless, colorless carbon monoxide as well as sulfur and other chemicals — in their vehicles. A 2016 Ford Explorer is shown. (Photo: Ford)
Correction: An earlier version of this article quoted the Austin police chief saying a repaired Ford SUV flunked a carbon monoxide test. He later contradicted that previous statement. This story has been updated to reflect this change.
Austin, Texas — The Austin police chief says a Ford Explorer SUV that the auto company repaired for a return to service with his department actually doesn't appear to have had exhaust containing carbon monoxide seeping into it — despite his saying earlier that it did.
Interim Police Chief Brian Manley said Friday that during a test of three SUVs repaired by Ford Motor Company, one tested positive for carbon monoxide.
But Manley told The Austin American-Statesman hours later that additional testing revealed alarms may have activated for some other reason.
He says: “We do not believe this issue is a Ford issue or related to the repairs they have done.”
Ford responded to Manley's original comments by saying the methods it used to address Austin's carbon monoxide problem “have worked well.”
The story was first reported by The Austin American-Statesman. A police department spokeswoman subsequently confirmed the chief's comments for The Associated Press.
Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt initially said Friday in an emailed statement that, “Ford was not provided with information on the levels of CO detected but we are ready to inspect any vehicle.”
She also said the automaker has “been happy to collaborate with” Austin police on repairs and added: “The methods and parts we've utilized to repair Austin's vehicles have worked well to address the concern.”
Austin police pulled nearly 400 Explorers off patrol in July because of carbon monoxide concerns. Police departments across the country use Explorers and several also took them out of service.
Ford has previously blamed the issue on non-factory outfitters that drill holes into police SUVs to install extra equipment like lights and radios.
But Ford was also investigating why many non-police consumers have also complained to the automaker and the government about exhaust fumes — which contain odorless, colorless carbon monoxide as well as sulfur and other chemicals — in their vehicles.

MIAMI (AP)  A Florida bank robbery suspect led police on a wild chase Friday as he carjacked two vehicles at gunpoint, leaped into the Miami River and finally died in a hail of bullets after vowing not to be arrested easily, authorities said.
It began about 7 a.m. when FBI agents and Miami-Dade police officers went to the man's home north of the city to serve a warrant linked to the Sept. 29 robbery of a Wells Fargo bank branch, Justin Fleck, the FBI acting assistant special agent in charge, said at a news conference.
The suspect, identified by police as Ernesto Padron, 52, instead grabbed a handgun and fled on foot, eventually carjacking a brown BMW, authorities said. With officers in pursuit, Padron drove erratically through city streets and then ditched the BMW for a Mazda sport utility vehicle, which he also carjacked by waving a gun in the female driver's face.
That driver, Minerva Castellano, told local news outlets she was on her way to work at the Veterans Administration Hospital when Padron put a gun to her face and told her to get out.

"He said 'Get the f--- out of the car right now or I will shoot you'. I'm thinking, I wasn't really scared at the moment because I'm thinking it's an undercover cop because I saw cops all over the place. I thought he was an undercover cop that needed my car. It took me a while to get out, I had to unstrap the seatbelt. Luckily, I had my purse with me and I ran out," she said.
Police said Padron eventually bailed out of Castellano's SUV and jumped into the Miami River. Officers from various departments  some armed with assault rifles  engaged him in a standoff under a bridge, trying to convince him to surrender, according to police.
Video footage showed the bald man bobbing in neck-deep water and clinging to a ledge under the bridge, frequently pointing at officers and shaking his head.
Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez told reporters Padron made threatening comments toward law enforcement, saying he "will not go down easy."
"Our hostage negotiators did begin to communicate with the individual, who was still armed at the time," Perez added.
The standoff included some officers in police boats.
Authorities said officers attempted to take Padron into custody about 9:30 a.m., but he refused to drop his weapon and was shot and killed. Police said as many as nine officers from two departments fired their weapons.
No officers were injured. The man died at the scene.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.

Rickie Fowler is tied for the lead with fellow American Bryson DeChambeau at the Pheonix Open.
Rickie Fowler took a share of the lead into the weekend in the Phoenix Open but he knows from experience the party is just getting started.
Fowler was tied with Bryson DeChambeau, with each shooting his second straight five-under 66 on Friday.
Australian PGA Championship winner Cameron Smith fired a four-under par 67 to follow up his opening round 69.
He is in a tie for 19th to be the best-placed Australian, four shots clear of Aaron Baddeley who has carded rounds of 72 and 68.
Fowler has had a lot of success at TPC Scottsdale without winning.
He finished a shot behind Hunter Mahan in 2010, lost to Hideki Matsuyama on the fourth extra hole in 2016 and tied for fourth last year.
Daniel Berger and former Arizona State player Chez Reavie were a stroke back.
The festive tournament drew a Friday-record crowd of 191,400 fans, bringing the week total to 439,088.
The third-round mark of 204,906 set last year is expected to be shattered on Saturday, and the week record of 655,434 from last year could fall with a day to spare.
Reader Tony Eales from Oz sent some camouflaged arthropods. These aren't all that hard to see, as they were specially photographed to show the beast, but the photos do underscore the wonders of natural selection. His notes are indented:
Camouflage. A series of the cryptic to the near invisible.
First is a geometrid moth caterpillar. I was very lucky to see it on the bark of this native caper tree (Capparis mitchellii):
Next is the nymph of the world's largest leaf-hopper Ledromorpha planirostris. These are very common on the bark of blue-gum trees but because of how they are flat and cryptically coloured they are often missed. Almost worthy of a spot-the! [JAC: this is a hard one!]
Next is a type of Crab Spider (Thomisidae) Stephanopis sp. These spiders have such good patterning and hairs and knobs to break up their outline they sometimes make your eyes swim looking at them on bark and trying to make out where the spider ends and the bark begins.
I was lucky to see this caterpillar for the White Banded Plane (Phaedyma sheperdi) out on a green leaf or I would have over-looked it. As it was I thought it was a weird chrysalis but it was just the way the caterpillar holds itself.
This one is amazing:
Last is one of my favourites, the Wrap Around Spider (Dolophones conifera). The way they perfectly wrap around small twigs and just look like a small bump is extraordinary. The only way I've ever found them is as they flee from their orb-web as I approach because once they're on a twig they're pretty much invisible.

An airline is demanding UK airports limit the amount passengers can drink before boarding flights.
Ryanair has called on UK airports to take necessary measures to prevent excessive alcohol consumption, in the wake of increased disruptive behaviour from passengers travelling from British airports.
It comes after reports this morning that the number of passengers arrested for drunken behaviour on flights or at UK airports increased by 50% in the last year.
In recent years there have been a number of incidents from North East airports involving drunken passengers, including Jet2 banning six passengers from its flights after a drunken incident on a plane travelling from Newcastle to Tenerife.
The Civil Aviation Authority has reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016, with most “involving alcohol”.
Ryanair today urged the airports to take more responsibility for the safety issue by:
:: Banning the sale of all alcohol in bars and restaurants before 10am.
:: Introducing the mandatory use of boarding cards when purchasing alcoholic drinks in bars and restaurants (in the same way a boarding card is needed for airport purchases) and limiting the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two
:: Controlling the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants to passengers during flight delays by limiting the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two
Ryanair says it has already taken a number of measures to prevent disruptive behaviour on its UK flights, and customers are not permitted to consume their own duty-free purchases on board
Customers flying from Glasgow Prestwick and Manchester to Alicante and Ibiza are no longer permitted to bring duty-free alcohol on board the aircraft, and those who have purchased duty-free alcohol will be asked to put it into the hold or leave their purchases behind.
Kenny Jacobs of Ryanai said: "“It's completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences. This is a particular problem during flight delays when airports apply no limit to the sale of alcohol in airside bars and restaurants.
"This is an issue which the airports must now address and we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed.
He added: "As the largest airline in Europe, Ryanair's number one priority is the safety of our customers, crew and aircraft and we operate strict guidelines for the carriage of customers who are disruptive or appear to be under the influence of alcohol.
"Given that all our flights are short-haul, very little alcohol is actually sold on board, so it's incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.”
Montreal's health authority says 11 people have now died from complications related to the hot and humid weather.

Meanwhile, the ambulance service that serves a large swath of the Montreal area is calling on people to refrain from calling unless it is a real emergency.
Urgences-Santé says it has been inundated by the volume of calls since a heat wave enveloping Eastern and Central Canada settled in for an extended stay over the weekend.
The ambulance corporation says it has received 1,200 calls per day in Montreal and nearby Laval over the past four days, which is 30 per cent more than on usual busy days.

President Mamnoon Hussain Monday expressed concern over the reported Indian incursions into the Chinese territory and said that Pakistan fully supports the stance of China on the issue.
The president, while talking to Chinese Vice President Wang Yang at the President House, appreciated China for its adept handling of the issue and reiterated that Pakistan stands by China on the issues of Tibet, Sinkiang and South China Sea, a statement from the President House reads.
President Hussain said that Pakistan would also continue to work along with China for eliminating terrorism. He hailed the role of China in bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan and hoped that it would bring positive results and the issue would be resolved at the earliest.
Both the leaders discussed the whole range of their bilateral affairs, with a particular focus on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and expressed the resolve to ensure its early completion as the project is vital to the regional peace, security, stability and prosperity.
The president said that Pakistan desired to resolve all issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, with India through dialogue.
He said that Pakistan was looking forward to the visit of the Chinese premier to Pakistan soon.
He thanked the Chinese vice premier for participating in the Pakistan's 70th Independence Day anniversary celebrations and said it was reflective of their strong bonds and friendship. He said that the two countries had stood by each other through thick and thin and their ties would continue to strengthen in the days ahead.
Chinese vice premier Wang Yang said that Pakistan China friendship was higher than the political considerations. He said Pakistan had played a positive role in countering terrorism. He assured his country's complete cooperation in this regard.
He underlined the need for stronger Pakistan China economic cooperation and said China would increase imports from Pakistan for a better balance in trade.
He said the ties between the two countries were exemplary and would further strengthen in the days ahead. The meeting was also attended by delegations from the either sides.
The Hamilton Police Service confirms a change in the status of Const. Craig Ruthowsky.
After almost six years of drawing his salary from the public purse, while suspended, the 44-year-old is now suspended without pay.

A statement issued by the police service says the change is effective May 30, and it follows a Toronto judge's sentencing of Ruthowsky on Tuesday after he was convicted cocaine trafficking, taking bribes from drug dealers, breach of trust and obstruction of justice.
The disgraced officer has been sentenced to 12 and a half years in a federal jail.
The Hamilton Police Service confirms it will now move forward with Police Service Act charges and will be seeking Ruthowsky's dismissal.
The service has been obliged to keep paying Ruthowsky since 2012 while he was under suspension. That obligation ended Tuesday when he received his prison sentence.

It would be a mistake to assume that the USC scandal was simply a matter of leaders at one university going rogue. In fact, it would be dangerous to think that. The departure of university President C.L. Max Nikias satisfies the call for accountability over accusations involving two USC doctors, but it does not begin to resolve a deeper affliction at the nation's colleges and universities: the unending pressure to raise the institutions' rankings and bring in more money.
The various college rankings are typically based heavily on fairly empty criteria. US News and World Report, which produces the best known and most closely watched rankings, heavily counts a school's reputation among other institutions' faculty and officials. And no matter how extraneous and silly we might find them, the rankings are inextricably linked to fundraising. Raising the rankings means happier alumni and more applicants; it means drawing more star professors, which in turn means more grant money, higher rankings, more applicants. It's part of why colleges send ridiculous numbers of marketing mailers to high school juniors and seniors. A higher number of applicants means a lower acceptance rate, which for some reason is considered a positive sign of a school's reputation.
Inevitably, reputation and money are at war with integrity. Things are going to go wrong at campuses, as they tend to do at large organizations. But being straightforward about a college scandal could mean sacrificing reputation, which means sacrificing rankings and applications and – you get it. That's a big part of why colleges were routinely under-reporting cases of sexual assault and brushing accusations aside. As long as they could be kept under wraps, they couldn't harm a school's reputation.
Last week we took down the big chinaball tree that has shaded our back courtyard for many, many years.
It was way past its prime and diseased, was dropping branches regularly, and had spread thick but brittle limbs threateningly over the roof of our house and a neighbor's garage. We worried about it becoming laden with ice during cold snaps like the one just past and crashing down.
It was time for it to go, but it will be missed. There's a bit of history tied to chinaball (also called chinaberry) trees in south Louisiana, and possibly to this particular chinaball, or Lilas parasol, as the Cajuns called the trees.
The “lilas” comes from the lilac colored flowers like the ones that perfumed our entire neighborhood each spring. Unfortunately, the pretty little flowers turned into pulpy chinaballs that were excellent ammunition for slingshots and just right for popguns made from hollow elderberry stems, but that created an unholy mess for whoever had to clean beneath the tree. We're not talking just a few little chinaballs; we're talking thousands that seemed to drop in waves so that there was always another mess to clean up.
These chinaballs have no practical value except to propagate more trees, usually in flower beds. The balls are inedible by people or animals, but as Lauren Post explained in his book about life on the southwest Louisiana prairies ("Cajun Sketches," LSU Press, 1962), left to their own devices, the berries will ferment and robins that come to south Louisiana for the winter get drunk eating them. According to Post, “They become such drunkards that the Acadians speak of people getting ‘drunk as robins.'”
The “parasol” part is in the name because each tree forms “a perfect umbrella and [provides] fine shade for the people as well as their animals.”
Out on the treeless prairies, Post wrote, “Barren indeed was the sight of the sharecropper's cabin without these trees, and pitiable were his children and also his livestock unless there were trees about. … For deepness of shade, no southern tree is the equal of the chinaberry.”
That “parasol” had another important value. Because there were no trees on the prairies, there was no firewood for cooking or heating. But chinaball trees grow fast. People on the prairie planted a grove of trees around the house and topped a certain number of the trees each year for the wood they needed. The trees would replace the limbs fast enough that they would be ready for another trim in just three years. With proper rotation, a fair-sized grove would provide all the wood any family needed.
Lots of people planted them, Post tells the story of a girl who was traveling by stagecoach to visit a friend who lived between Carencro and Duson.
She was told to get off the stage at the house “with all the chinaberries around it.” To her confusion when she made the trip, she saw chinaberries surrounding almost every house for the entire 10 miles.
We suspect that our tree may have been the scion of a firewood tree that grew next to the kitchen of our old house. It is near where we think the kitchen stood in the days when they were separate from the main residence because of fear of fires.
Post lamented that “windstorms have blown down many of the old trees,” that others, like ours, “have rotted from within,” and that they are not being replaced because they are no longer needed (and are pretty messy).
Nowadays we use other fuels to cook and heat with, stay in air-conditioned houses for shade, and wouldn't know how to begin to make a popgun (presuming we could find a good stalk of elderberry, which is also disappearing).
The losses of those things are obvious and sobering, but we may also be losing a big, overlooked opportunity.
Can you imagine the lightning speed in which the video of a bunch of drunk robins would spread across the world on social media?

* Energy & materials stocks gain most on stronger commodities and oil prices
* NZ shares rise slightly on materials and industrials
By Aditya Soni
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Australian shares ticked up on Friday as energy and materials stocks firmed on higher oil and iron ore prices.
The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.3 percent or 20.80 points to 6,110.90 by 0113 GMT. The benchmark added 0.9 percent on Thursday and was on track to gain 1 percent for the week.
Energy stocks gained the most on Friday, with the energy index climbing to its highest in more than two weeks. Oil rose on Thursday after a survey showed OPEC's commitment to its supply cuts remains in effect, even as U.S. production boomed.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd rose 1.6 percent, while rival Santos Ltd reached its highest more than a week.
Material stocks gained on strengthening iron ore prices which were up 1.6 percent.
Commodity prices were helped by a weakening in the U.S. dollar , which was on track for a weekly fall as investors focused on renewed economic strength in the eurozone.
BHP, Australia's biggest company by market cap, rose 0.6 percent, pushing the index up, while rival Rio Tinto Ltd climbed 0.2 percent.
Meanwhile, shares of James Hardie Industries PLC, rose 5.6 percent to a record high and were among the top percentage gainers on the benchmark.
James Hardie, the world's No. 1 maker of fibre cement building panels, posted a 32.9 percent rise in third-quarter adjusted net operating profit on Friday.
Financials rose as well, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia firming to a near 2-1/2-week high, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd hit its highest in more than 10 weeks.
Conversely, real estate stocks and industrials fell, capping the gains on the index.
“The ongoing sell-off in global bond markets is affecting their (real estate and industrials stocks) performance,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.
“Property stocks are sensitive to interest rate changes, the continuing sell-off and increase in long-term interest rates is really weighing on the real estate and utilities sector as well.”
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached a high of 2.797 percent early on Friday, probing its highest levels since April 2014.
Property company Goodman Group Pty Ltd fell 1.7 percent, while Transurban Group declined 1.5 percent and was the biggest drag on the index.
On the other hand, New Zealand shares ticked up, helped by a rise in materials and industrials. The benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.1 percent or 5.39 points to 8,389.260, on track to add 1 percent on a weekly basis.
Fletcher Building Ltd, the country's biggest construction company, firmed 1.3 percent to a 15-week high, while Air New Zealand Ltd climbed 2 percent. (Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Chandini Monnappa; Editing by Eric Meijer)

LOS ANGELES-US television network ABC has canceled the hit working-class comedy "Roseanne," after its star Roseanne Barr aimed a racist tweet at a former advisor to Barack Obama.
The 65-year-old sitcom actress - a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump who has used Twitter to voice far-right and conspiracy theorist views - took aim at the aide, Valerie Jarrett, in a post that read: "Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj."
After a barrage of criticism on social media, Barr apologized to Jarrett, who is part black, and to "all Americans" for what she called a "joke."
"I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me - my joke was in bad taste," she tweeted. "I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter."
Her belated mea culpa was not enough for ABC, which said it was pulling the plug on Barr's show over the "abhorrent, repugnant" tweet, which was "inconsistent with our values."
Likewise, Barr's talent agency ICM said its teams were "greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet."
"Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client," the agency said in a statement.
Despite vowing to quit the social media platform, Barr embarked on a spree late Tuesday night, retweeting people who defended her against allegations of racism while saying of Jarrett: "I thought she was Saudi."
She also retweeted a photo purporting to quote Jarrett, who was born in Iran to American parents, that she was seeking "to help change America to be a more Islamic country." The quote was found to be false by fact-checking site Snopes.
"Roseanne" was rebooted in March after a gap of 21 years with Barr's character recast as a Trump supporter.
The show had been renewed for an 11th season after scoring huge ratings and generally positive reviews for its season-10 opener - including from the president who appreciated the new pro-Trump perspective.
"There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing," said Bob Iger, the head of ABC's parent company Disney, in a tweet posted moments after ABC pulled the plug.
Reacting to the network's decision, Jarrett herself said she hoped it would trigger a broader discussion on racism in America. "I'm fine - I'm worried about the people out there don't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense," Jarrett said on MSNBC. "I think we have to turn this into a teaching moment," she said. "Roseanne" offered a rare depiction of working-class life on US television, but it also spotlighted Trump supporters, who have been largely ignored by Hollywood.
Barr revealed that Trump had called personally to congratulate her on the show's success.
But as of Tuesday night, the president, who is a prolific tweeter, remained silent on the affair, while his spokeswoman batted away reporters' questions.
"The President is focused on North Korea," Sarah Sanders said on Air Force One.
"He's focused on trade deals. And he's focused on rebuilding our military, the economy. And that's what he's spending his time on; not responding to other things."
Born on November 3, 1952, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Barr started out as a stand-up comedian before starring in "Roseanne," which made her an overnight star.
Viewers warmed to her depiction of a wise-cracking, sarcastic working-class mother and she was rewarded with three nominations for Emmys - television's equivalent of the Oscars - winning in 1993.
She has also starred in several films, wrote three memoirs and won a second Emmy for "The Roseanne Show," a talk show which ran from 1998 to 2000.
But her various private life exploits have garnered just as much attention as her career achievements - including three marriages, all ending in divorce, and an abortive attempt to get into politics.
Barr ran for president with the Green Party and the Peace and Freedom Party in 2012, and voted for Obama before becoming a vocal Trump supporter, saying she wanted him to "shake up" the status quo.
Her various controversies over the years have included a 2009 photo shoot for satirical Jewish magazine Heeb, in which she dressed up as Hitler baking gingerbread cookies. She is Jewish.
In March, Barr tweeted out a conspiracy theory falsely accusing David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida, of giving a Nazi salute at a march.
The backlash to her latest tweet was swift, with public figures from actors Rosie O'Donnell and Don Cheadle to CNN analyst April Ryan calling out Barr, while comedian Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer on "Roseanne," announced before the cancellation that she would not be returning to the show in any case.
"We welcome the swift and appropriate action taken by ABC and hope it sends a message that the promotion of hatred and bigotry will not be accepted by our nation's entertainment industry," said Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Selkirk RCMP are hoping the public will help find a missing teen.
They said Sherrie Silken Garson, 17, left her home at around 2:30 p.m. Saturday to walk the dog and did not return.
Garson has gone missing before. In February, she failed to return home after an appointment in Winnipeg.

Garson is described as 5'8” with brown eyes and dark brown shoulder length hair.
She was last seen wearing a black and white-coloured hoodie, with matching track pants and black shoes.
RCMP are asking anyone with information to call the Selkirk RCMP at 204-482-1222.
A golf course in Windward Oahu says it's lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because of flooding dating back to last year.
Ed Kagayama, a managing partner at Olomana Golf Links, says the flooding on the golf course is caused by an overflowing Waimanalo stream, which is maintained by the military.
This past weekend, much of the course was underwater, which according to Kagayama, is something that shouldn't be happening. “There is a flow issue that we are trying to rectify and work with our military neighbors down stream.”
The golf course hosts multiple high school golf teams, and has golf development center run by long time pro Casey Nakama. Nakama has been playing and teaching at Olomana for decades, and says he's never seen it this bad. “We have had big rains before I've seen it flooded before but the water would clear out a lot faster and the golf course would be up and running in about three days.”
Because of multiple massive flooding events since Tropical Storm Darby, the owners say they've had to let some employees go. Kagayama adds along with the financial toll, the flooding has hurt their reputation. “We have cancellations all the time and even our future business is affected because they can't count on us to be open.”
A date has been set for the nearby stream to be dredged, but in the meantime the ownership of the course is working with the military in hopes to get back the revenue lost by closing down the entire course or parts of the course for months at a time. “We have filed some claims. We have been in correspondence with them and trading a lot of information about our situation about what occurred and the financial damages that we've had. That is an ongoing process. How long that's going to take I have no clue.”
In the meantime, the course is still open for business. Nakama says he's hoping for the course and the business to bounce back, “This is like my home and it's sad to see it like this, but we'll get through it.”
The dredging of the stream is set to begin in April, with the project lasting until September.
About 2,500 feet of the Waimanalo stream will be cleared out.
TORONTO – The Toronto Raptors led the NBA this season in comeback victories, but nobody has an explanation for the team's slow starts.
“You ever have an old (Buick) Regal?” DeMar DeRozan said. “You've got to start it up and sit there for a while before you pull off and you go on a little road trip.
“But once you get going, your car feels like a 2016 Lexus or something. I think that's just kind of our problem. I don't know. It's something that we have to be better with.”
Trailing 1-0 to Milwaukee in their best-of-seven opening-round playoff series, the Raptors will look to hit the ground running when they host the Bucks in what DeRozan called a must-win Game 2 on Tuesday.
(DeRozan never owned a Regal. “Hell no,” he laughed, when queried. “But I knew people who did.”)
COMMENTARY: The Raptors are destined for a short playoff run this year
Slow starts was a theme of Monday's post-practice session with the media. Whether it's rebounding from a loss or rallying from a slow start, the Raptors have traditionally been good when playing from behind.
“That's our biggest mystery,” said Toronto coach Dwane Casey, who turned 60 on Monday. “I've always said it's a hard way to live.
“I like it because it means we do have fight, but let's start that fight in the first quarter. We've had it in stretches but we've lived by being down and coming back. (But) it's taxing. It's hard on your body. It's not a great way to live, to be always fighting back, scratching, coming back.”
Casey said the team has studied its first-quarter conundrum. The Raptors have looked at the stats, the rotations, the match-ups, the various groups of players on the court.
“We've done everything and there is no consistent statistic or number or group,” Casey said. “It's just kind of been our DNA. Slow starts and hard finishes.”

Casey compared it to his days as an assistant in Dallas, where Josh Howard was one of the Mavericks' best first-quarter players and Dirk Nowitzki was a notoriously slow starter.
“Some guys it takes a little longer to get their bones going and bodies moving,” he said. “It's fortunate and unfortunate.
“It's fortunate that we do have the grit and the grime to fight back, but sometimes it jumps up and bites you in the behind.”
DeRozan, who led Toronto with 27 points – 12 more points than he'd ever scored in an opening game of the first round – said the Raptors need to play with a sense of urgency they didn't show in Saturday's stunning 97-83 loss.
“It's something that we can't feel our way into,” DeRozan said. “We can't wait for a team to hit us, whatever it may be.
“We've got to have an automatic start and get out as soon as that ball goes up.”
Serge Ibaka, who was acquired by the Raptors in a deal with Orlando at February's trade deadline, has seen the tendency for slow starts in the two months he's been in Toronto. He also has no answer.

“Honestly, I don't know why because what I saw from guys, every time before the game, everybody is ready, everybody is motivated,” said Ibaka. “Like even today, people are here earlier, working hard to get ready for tomorrow and then when it comes to the game, this kind of things happen.
“Even for myself, sometimes I ask myself why.”
Ibaka, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds in Game 1, sat out Monday's practice with a sprained ankle suffered Saturday night. But he said he should be good to go Tuesday.
DeRozan was also asked about his back-court mate Kyle Lowry, who had just four points on Saturday. Lowry responded the next morning by saying he'll have to be more aggressive and “force more shots” come Game 2.
“It's just him figuring it out,” DeRozan said. “One thing, Kyle's mind works at 1,000 miles per hour.
“Once he settles down, he's going to figure it out. . . when to make the right pass, when to take the shot, when to be aggressive. Whether it's in spurts, being aggressive scoring, or whether it's in spurts getting everybody involved, he's going to mellow down, calm down, and get that part of it together.”
The series shifts to Milwaukee for Game 3 on Thursday and Game 4 on Saturday.

Information gathered by The Botswana Gazette suggests that former President of Business Botswana (BB) Lekwalo Mosienyane has left the organization with financial problems, decline in membership and low enthusiasm.
According to a 2016 audited financial report which was presented by BB Treasurer Butler Phirie at last week's AGM, the organization is not doing well as it has challenges which call for major introspection. BB was also advised to strengthen membership recruitment and retention as well as improve its visibility. During the same AGM Mosienyane was handing the presidency to Gobusamang Keebine.
“The Confederation (BB) incurred a net deficit of P332 217 (2015: P2 242 818) during the year ended 2016 and as of the date, the Confederation current liabilities exceeded its current asset by P1 546 339 (2015: P1 282 255). In addition, the Confederation has been experiencing financial difficulties and has not been able to settle its obligations when they fall due,” said the audit report.
According to the audit report, management has not provided plans for the turnaround of the Confederation and this situation indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern and therefore may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Sources in the organization say Keebine has a burden of recruiting new membership which was lost during Mosienyane's tenure. Keebine is also allegedly inheriting a demotivated staff. It is alleged that two staff directors were fired and were reinstated after lobbying by the council. Sources allege that Mosienyane did not see eye to eye with former CEO Dr Racious Moatshe who left the organization recently after being suspended for allegations of sexual harassment. “He was pushed and the allegations were unfounded,” said a source.
Giving credence to some of the claims is the latest resignation of Vice President North Palalani Moitlhobogi who left BB because “Council as a collective has not steered the organization in a new direction as expected by membership.”
Moitlhobogi said he resigned due to issues like failure to carry out the private sector development strategy, something he blamed on the apex model and covering regional chambers as a case point of where only a few people in the Council were truly interested in the matter and consequently and owing to them being in the minority, very little has been done. He said the end result is that the organization is failing to grow and attract new members or bring back members as they cannot see positive changes. Moithobogi was referring to the transition of Botswana Confederation of Commerce Industry and Manpower (BOCCIM) to Business Botswana. He affirmed audit report findings which found that there is weakness in recruitment of new membership.
Moitlhobogi also pointed to the poor attendance which resulted in stagnation of decision making. He accused the council of being biased to only representation of Gaborone businesses and there is barely a mention of other areas in council meetings.
The former BB vice president was also not amused at the organization's handling of the Selibe Phikwe economic meltdown when BCL mine was closed. He said BB Council members showed little interest in the matter saying as an example they did not give priority to a report prepared at their behest by consultants. Moitlhobogi said the report could have given government another an alternative to closing the mine. “Unfortunately, at a meeting where the report was tabled, there was no quorum and when the matter was raised subsequent to that, it was shot down. This has confirmed the long-held view that council members seem to be more interested in issues that affect their businesses and less about the economy,” said Moitlhobogi.
Former BB president Mosienyane however told this publication in an interview that he left the organization in a good condition. “I am very confident…the transition of BOCCIM to Businesses Botswana was a huge achievement. It is not easy to move an organization from one form to another. Even the EU and the business community lauded our transition. During my tenure Business Botswana became the implementing agency for the Private Sector Development Programme (PSDP),” he said.
He also lauded BB's ability to boost the competitiveness of the SMMEs and restructuring of the organization into an Apex Body. Mosienyane said the apex exercise entails building of capacity to meet emerging challenges.
Mosienyane said with the introduction of the new constitution which affiliates BB to associates as opposed to members, there has been a confusion. He said that is why some do not pay subscription because there was a memo which circulated stating that the fee should only be taken from members. This means that some members withheld their subscription while some associations are still yet to align with the new constitution. Mosienyane said the new arrangement caters for SMMEs and the clause that involves those small businesses is yet to be implemented.
Commenting on the financial situation he left the organization in, Mosienyane said it was not that bad as there was great improvement compared to last year where the situation was worse. He said the failure to collect subscription fees might be the reason why they were making losses.
On Moatshe, the former president dismissed allegations that he pushed him out- saying their relationship was cordial and even during the sexual harassment allegations. He said no one resigned during his tenure.
Regarding Moitlhobogi's resignation, Mosienyane said the former vice president was mostly not happy about the Phikwe situation as he stated in his resignation letter. The former BB boss however did not want to comment further on Moitlhobogi's resignation.

Netflix has released the first trailer for the upcoming comedy series Friends from College. The show revolves around a group of friends from Harvard who are facing down their forties and having trouble navigating old friendships, romantic relationships, and growing older. Keegan-Michael Key and Cobie Smulders lead the ensemble, and the series hails from creator Nicholas Stoller, the director behind thoughtful romantic comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Five-Year Engagement.
Stoller directed all eight episodes of this first season, and while this trailer is funny and engaging, that's the real draw for me here. His breakout film Forgetting Sarah Marshall is still one of the best romantic comedies in recent memory, and he's shown with movies like Neighbors and Get Him to the Greek that he has a knack for directing sharply funny comedy. A hallmark of Stoller's work is a strong emotional core, and I'm curious to see that translated to the interwoven relationships of these characters here. Stoller co-wrote all of the episodes with his wife, Francesca Delblanco, who also serves as an executive producer, and the two drew from their own experiences at Harvard and personal lives for inspiration.
Check out the Friends from College trailer below, followed by some images and a poster. The series also stars Annie Parisse, Fred Savage, Nat Faxon, Jae Suh Park, and Billy Eichner. All eight episodes will be available globally on Netflix on July 14th.
United have taken two points from their first two games, 1-1 draws with AFC Wimbledon and Rochdale as well as advancing to the second round of the Carabao Cup after a penalty shoot-out win over Notts County.
Although Scunthorpe would have liked victories, the upside is that the Iron suffered defeats to Dale and the Dons in the corresponding fixtures last season.
Alexander would have liked victories but he is looking to build on the performances so far, hinting that he will stick with the 4-4-2 formation he has used in the last one and a half games.
“I am content with the start but not overly happy,” he said. “But there are signs of improvement.
“We experimented with the line-up and this is the start of how we want to go on. We want to really settle the players down and work from this point.
“I know we can improve from now on. I have been delighted with the players so far but we have got to strive to improve each week.”
Alexander was happy with the response of his players on Saturday after their exertions of their extra time win over County, which earned a second-round tie at Championship side Middlesbrough.
Having the 120 minutes ahead of a tough trip to Rochdale was not the ideal preparation for the trip to Spotland.
But Alexander believes the 1-1 draw against Dale shows that his team is heading in the right direction.
“I was delighted with the response of the players on Saturday because it was always going to be a test after Tuesday.
“We knew we would be up against it but it shows we've got real conscientious players that want to win games.”
Defenceman Jeff Petry scored two goals as the Montreal Canadiens ended a three-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday afternoon.
Logan Shaw, Joe Morrow and David Schlemko also scored for the Canadiens (21-25-6), who will play host to the Ottawa Senators on Sunday afternoon.
Corey Perry and Rikard Rakell scored for Anaheim (25-18-10), which was coming off an overtime loss in Ottawa on Thursday night.
The Ducks outshot Montreal 45-29, but Antti Niemi, starting in place of Carey Price, made several brilliant stops to pick up his second win in a row since his last start on Jan. 19 against Washington.

Canadiens forward Jonathan Drouin left the game early in the second period Saturday afternoon after being hit by a slapshot from teammate Karl Alzner.
The Ducks led 9-0 in shots just under six minutes into the game, but the Canadiens then scored three times on seven attempts to chase starter Ryan Miller at 10:13 in favour of Reto Berra, who was called up on Friday to replace the injured John Gibson.
Shaw, who was claimed on waivers from Anaheim on Jan. 15, scored his first as a Canadien at 6:16 when he banged in a Byron Froese pass from the edge of the crease. Morrow added one on a power play on a one-timer of Victor Mete's pass from the right point at 8:17.

Perry put Anaheim on the board during a two-man advantage at 8:32 as he beat Niemi from the edge of the crease and Rakell followed in to score on Nick Ritchie's rebound at 12:15.
Petry picked the top corner on a power play at 15:46 of the third.

Tory vows to ‘stamp out' gun violence, July 3
Why is Mayor Tory resorting to a double-down strategy of increased police activity to deal with the recent spate of shootings in Toronto? Didn't the Toronto police just complete a major seizure of guns and anti-street gang raids?
Perhaps he has he not read the 2015 survey that concludes officers have a “fuzzy sense” of “what culturally responsive policing involves.”
Would it not be wiser to offer more diversity awareness and cultural outreach to police?
There would be a better return on investment if more enrichment resources were directed towards at-risk youth and young offenders. We need to police smarter, not harder.

SHANGHAI - Chinese army officers have a new enemy in their sights - a mobile phone battle game believed so addictive to young soldiers that it may slow them down in real-life combat. Smartphone smash-hit “King of Glory” is so popular in China that its maker and internet giant Tencent last month began limiting daily playing times to “ensure children's healthy development”. Now the Chinese army is taking aim at the multiplayer online battle game. “There is certainly a security risk that can't be overlooked,” the People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper warned gravely. “The game requires constant attention but a soldier's job is full of uncertainty. Once a soldier is cut off from the game for an urgent mission, he could be absent-minded during the operation if his mind remains on the game.” The newspaper said officers had become worried after noticing that almost all the soldiers in one dormitory were playing the game over a weekend. The state newspaper did concede that up to a point the game offered respite during leisure time and there are no immediate plans to ban it from barracks.
A daycare provider that wanted to opt in to the province's new child care fee reduction program, is unsure of what to do next after her application was rejected.
Marianne Whitaker says she had already given parents the discount based on getting the money back from the government once she was accepted.
“April 1st I gave all my parents discounts,” Whitaker said. “But I never in a million years thought that they would reject anyone.”

She said she was shocked when she received an email that said her application had been denied because she had increased her rates.
Whitaker increased her fees by two per cent to $895 for toddlers, and up four-and-a-half per cent to $1,150 a month for infants.

But if child care providers opt-in to the program, they must agree not to raise fees for the rest of the year.
“They said if you disagree with this decision please email us. So again it's another email, you cannot speak to anybody regarding decision making,” she said.
The B.C. government introduced a child care strategy in February's budget as a way to reduce child care fees for parents by April.

Whitaker submitted her application ahead of the original March deadline, and said she followed the information she was given including a discount to parents at the beginning of the month.
To date, more than 1,500 providers have applied, 1,100 of those providers have been approved while 57 have been rejected.

“I think things are going great,” said the minister responsible for the program Katrina Chen. “A lot of parents are benefiting from this plan and we have a majority of providers who have opted in,” she said.
Chen said the goal was to give parents a break.
“We are only one month in and there are already 22,000 families that are benefiting from this program and then there's more to come.”
She said there are about 10,000 spaces that are still being processed.
Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics plans to play in Game 2 of a first-round NBA playoff series against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night before heading to Washington state to be with his family and help complete funeral arrangements for his sister, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Monday.
Thomas attended the team's film session and short walk-through but did not speak with reporters. Stevens said that after services for Thomas' sister, the star guard intends to rejoin the team Friday for Game 3 at Chicago. The coach added that all plans are subject to change depending on how Thomas feels.
Chyna Thomas died early Saturday in a one-car accident outside Tacoma, Wash. No funeral date is set, and Stevens said the Celtics organization hopes to attend.
The Celtics lost Game 1 of the seven-game series 106-102 on Sunday.
“I think the biggest thing is they really care about each other,” Stevens said of his players. “It's really tough when he's sitting there and some of his family is back in Seattle. But I think the next extension of your family is who you're around every day, and your team. They care about one another and they support one another. That's what you hope you have in a team.”
Etc.
Josh Jackson will make himself available for the NBA draft after one of the best freshman seasons in Kansas history. The 6-foot-8 swingman, who is considered a certain lottery pick, was the Big 12 newcomer of the year after averaging 16.3 points and 7.4 rebounds. He helped the Jayhawks to a 31-5 record and a 13th consecutive regular-season Big 12 title before a loss to Oregon in an NCAA tournament regional final.

Protecting medical devices from ever-shifting cybersecurity threats requires an all-out, lifecycle approach that begins with early product development and extends throughout the product's lifespan.
Today, we're pleased to announce that industry now has advice from FDA across this product continuum with the release of a final guidance on the postmarket management of medical device cybersecurity. It joins an earlier final guidance on medical device premarket cybersecurity issued in October 2014.
To understand why such guidance is so important for patients, caregivers and the medical device community, we need to take a step back and look at how cybersecurity fits into the medical device ecosystem.
In today's world of medical devices that are connected to a hospital's network or even a patient's own Internet service at home, we see significant technological advances in patient care and, at the same time, an increase in the risk of cybersecurity breaches that could affect a device's performance and functionality.
The best way to combat these threats is for manufacturers to consider cybersecurity throughout the total product lifecycle of a device. In other words, manufacturers should build in cybersecurity controls when they design and develop the device to assure proper device performance in the face of cyber threats, and then they should continuously monitor and address cybersecurity concerns once the device is on the market and being used by patients.
Today's postmarket guidance recognizes today's reality – cybersecurity threats are real, ever-present, and continuously changing. In fact, hospital networks experience constant attempts of intrusion and attack, which can pose a threat to patient safety. And as hackers become more sophisticated, these cybersecurity risks will evolve.
With this guidance, we now have an outline of steps the FDA recommends manufacturers take to remain vigilant and continually address the cybersecurity risks of marketed medical devices. Central to these recommendations is FDA's belief that medical device manufacturers should implement a structured and comprehensive program to manage cybersecurity risks. This means manufacturers should, among other things:
Have a way to monitor and detect cybersecurity vulnerabilities in their devices
Understand, assess and detect the level of risk a vulnerability poses to patient safety
Establish a process for working with cybersecurity researchers and other stakeholders to receive information about potential vulnerabilities (known as a “coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy”)
Deploy mitigations (e.g., software patches) to address cybersecurity issues early, before they can be exploited and cause harm
This approach enables manufacturers to focus on continuous quality improvement, which is essential to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices at all stages in the device's lifecycle.
In addition, it is paramount for manufacturers and stakeholders across the entire ecosystem to consider applying the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) core principles for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity: to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. It is only through application of these guiding principles, executed alongside best practices such as coordinated vulnerability disclosure, that will allow us all to navigate this uncharted territory of evolving risks to device security.
This is clearly not the end of what FDA will do to address cybersecurity. We will continue to work with all medical device cybersecurity stakeholders to monitor, identify and address threats, and intend to adjust our guidance or issue new guidance, as needed.
Digital connections power great innovation—and medical device cybersecurity must keep pace with that innovation. The same innovations and features that improve health care can increase cybersecurity risks. This is why we need all stakeholders in the medical device ecosystem to collaborate to simultaneously address innovation and cybersecurity. We've made great strides but we know that cybersecurity threats are capable of evolving at the same pace as innovation, and therefore, more work must be done.

ST. LOUIS – A prosecutor's agreement to dismiss a felony charge against Missouri's governor came after a promise to resign. It has many people asking whether this case was all about politics.
Two lines in the Stipulation for Dismissal appear to stand out.
Line 5 states, “The Circuit Attorney hereby dismisses the (computer tampering case). …The Circuit Attorney further stipulates that, upon receipt of the defendant's resignation from office by the Secretary of State of Missouri, the Court may dismiss (the computer tampering case) ...”
Defense attorney Jim Martin said this about whether that means this was political.
“We've been pretty clear of our viewpoints of every aspect of this case and our opinions haven't changed,” he said.
St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner took the offense during her news conference.
“The consequences Mr. Greitens suffered he brought upon himself by his actions, his decisions, his ambition and his pursuit for power,” she said. “There was no coordinated effort by anyone to target him based on his politics.”
Defense counselor Martin confirmed the defense approached prosecutors about the deal but denied the computer tampering case was the driving force in the governor's resignation.
“Once the (resignation) decision was made, we made every effort we could to clean up every aspect of the matters that were involved in the governor,” Martin said.
It's also important to note line 6 in the agreement. It says, in part, “Defendant, after advice of counsel and in consideration of the stipulations herein, releases the Circuit Attorney of the City of St. Louis and all members of her office and consultants of her office from any civil liability (in both cases).”
This could refer to perjury allegations aimed at a private investigator hired by prosecutors, as well as allegations the circuit attorney sat silently during the lies.
The deal to release all civil liability will not impact the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department's criminal perjury investigation.
Also, Wednesday's dismissal has no impact on the felony privacy invasion investigation now in the hands of a special prosecutor. We'll know soon what happens with that case because the statute of limitations expires June 11.
Last November, news broke of the advent of Amazon Tickets, the juggernaut online marketplace company's bid to topple Ticketmaster as “the world's premier destination for purchasing tickets.” They've since found success in Britain, having outsold Ticketmaster for particular events, and now a new report from Reuters asserts that Amazon is looking to move into US markets.
According to Reuters' sources, the Seattle-based Amazon “sees the US ticketing market as ripe for attack.” As venue owners and sports leagues seek out more distributors to help to slag sales, consumers are increasingly fed up with the high ticket fees associated with the Live Nation-owned Ticketmaster. There's also the chance for sports organizations, musicians, and even theater companies to increase merchandising sales if fans can get tickets and merch in the same place.
Reuters also reports that Amazon sought a partnership with Ticketmaster, but that “conversations have stalled over who would control customer data.” They're also investigating other avenues, having approached “at least one league about selling tickets on the secondary market,” and are also offering “to write checks worth millions of dollars to sponsor certain venues.”
Ticketmaster has long had a stranglehold on ticketing in the US, but its steep fees and poor customer service record aren't the kind of things that engender strong brand loyalty. Should Amazon come stateside, they probably wouldn't have to do much to scoop up a large portion of Ticketmaster's base.
Below, revisit our recent documentary, Sold Out!: Inside America's Ticketing Landscape.

Forget the allure of being cool. Stay in school and you just might get to see the Jack White shred your campus for free.
That's what went down today at Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, DC. The Third Man Records rocker himself made a surprise appearance in between his two sold out shows at local venue The Anthem. Accompanied by backing musicians, White performed outdoors in the school's atrium.
White and his band started out playing on a makeshift stage (the steps of an amphitheater-like seating area). He eventually encouraged his young onlookers to come up and join him during a stomping rendition of The White Stripes classic “Seven Nation Army”. If you thought White was intense live, add in a crowd teeming with thrashing, impassioned, hormone-raging teens. And to think, when I was younger all I got was this lousy cafeteria ice cream cup.
According to WTOP, the performance lasted 45 minutes and took place during the school's lunch period beginning at 11:45 a.m. “They knew we have this big atrium space, and they thought that that might be an appropriate place for him to set up and do a pop-up show,” explained the school's Principal Kimberly Martin. To maintain the surprise, only Martin and another school administrator were aware of the performance prior to it take below.

The Game of Thrones episode “Eastwatch” was very much a table-setting installment, featuring lots of intriguing conversations that are likely laying the groundwork for major payoffs to come. But while dragons, the Night King, and whatever the hell Littlefinger is up to took center stage, it was actually a scene between Gilly and Sam that could have the biggest repercussions in episodes to come.
In a scene late in the episode, in which Sam is continuing his transcribing busy work assigned to him by the Maesters, Gilly is practicing her reading skills and stumbles across the following information recorded by an older Maester:
“Meynard says here that he issued an annulment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time, in a secret ceremony in Dorne.”
Rhaegar here is Rhaegar Targaryen, a name that has come up a lot in Game of Thrones, but is somewhat confusing to non-book readers as he's never been seen in the show. Rhaegar was the brother of Daenerys Targaryen and he was married to Elia Martell, sister of dear departed Oberyn—that guy who got his face smashed in by The Mountain.
Rhaegar, son of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen (the one who liked to burn people with wildfire), had a pretty massive crush on Lyanna Stark, sister of our dearly departed Ned Stark. But Lyanna was betrothed to Stark ally Robert Baratheon at the time, and the legend in Westeros goes that Rhaegar kidnapped, raped, and left Lyanna for dead. This led to Robert killing Rhaegar with a big hammer and wiping out the Targaryen line after Jamie Lannister murdered Aerys, which in turn led to Robert Baratheon ascending the Iron Throne via “Robert's Rebellion.” But in truth, Rhaegar didn't kidnap Lynanna—they ran off together, wildly in love.
We learned at the end of Season 6 that during Robert's Rebellion, a young Ned Stark happened upon Lyanna in a tower protected by Rhaegar's greatest knights. She was dying from childbirth—the child she had with Rhaegar—and asked Ned to promise to raise the child as his own bastard. That child is now Jon Snow, King of the North.
So we knew that Jon Snow wasn't Ned Stark's bastard, but was instead the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, which could have given him some kind of claim to the Iron Throne. But now, thanks to Gilly's discovery, we know that not only did Rhaegar and Lyanna run off together—they were legally married.
This means that Jon Snow was born as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne at the time, and given that Daenerys, sister of Rhaegar, is using her name to claim the Iron Throne, we've got a pretty interesting pickle here. It appears that Game of Thrones is planting the seeds for this discovery, as evidenced by Jon Snow petting Drogon at the beginning of “Eastwatch”—the Targaryen blood that so quickly bonded Daenerys with the dragons also courses through Jon's veins. Moreover, as the son of both a Targaryen and a Stark, he'll have rightful claim from both the South and the North of Westeros.
The grandmother of a North Carolina teen who was shot eight times by a police officer early Saturday recently broke her silence amid her wait for answers and a state investigation.
“He's fighting for his life. He's fighting for his life,” Wanda Bethea, grandmother of 18-year-old Dezmond Bethea, said about the teen being shot in Laurinburg to local news outlet WPDE. “And as far as the investigation, we can't say anything, like. The SBI (State Bureau of Investigation). It could take a week. It could take a month. It could take whatever. You know, we're still waiting to hear from there. I understand it's going to take some time for this to take place.”
Police responded to a call around 2 a.m. Saturday about shots being fired at an intersection in Laurinburg, Police Chief Darwin Williams confirmed. One officer was involved in the shooting, Williams said, declining to speak on the specific incident details. The officer and teen's names were also not released as well as information on whether the teen was unarmed.

An Emergency Medical Services director, however, shed some light on what happened during the shooting.
“There were two different calls. Whether they were related or not I can't say for certain, but they were both transported from the same area at about the same time,” Roylin Hammond, EMS director at Scotland Memorial Hospital in Laurinburg, said to Laurinburg Exchange, another local news outlet. “The calls came in at a little after 2 a.m. and another around 2:30 [a.m.].”
The first individual was taken from a food mart parking lot, and a second person with multiple gunshot wounds was transported to the hospital, according to Hammond.
The teen, who is a Scotland High School senior, suffered 17 wounds and underwent an eight-hour surgery, Bethea said. Her road to making a full recovery will involve more surgeries.
The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) is investigating the officer-involved shooting. The Scotland County NAACP in also involved in the matter, the Laurinburg Exchange said.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Two radio journalists have been killed in the Dominican Republic after gunmen opened fire during a news bulletin which was being broadcast on Facebook Live, The Guardian reports.
Luís Manuel Medina, the presenter of the news programme Milenio Caliente – or Hot Millennium – was killed while on air on Tuesday morning, February 15. Producer and director Leo Martínez was shot dead in an adjacent office at the radio station FM 103.5.
Gunfire could be heard during the Facebook Live video, along with a woman yelling “Shots! Shots! Shots!” before the transmission abruptly cuts off.
The station secretary Dayaba Garcia was also injured in the attack and taken to hospital where she needed emergency surgery.
Police said the shooting occurred in San Pedro de Macorís, a small city 45 miles east of the capital, Santo Domingo. The radio station is located within a shopping mall.
Three men have been arrested, but none has been charged. Police say they do not yet have a motive.
Medina was also the official announcer of the Estrellas Orientales baseball team.
Milenio Caliente is a popular local radio programme recognised for its lively political analysis and social campaigns.
In recent weeks, Medina had repeatedly condemned pollution in Laguna Mallen, a protected lake in San Pedro.
Olivo de Leon, from the College of Journalism who knew both men, said the attack was unprecedented in the country's history. “For gunmen to open fire in a media outlet like this is unprecedented.
“The authorities must investigate to determine not just the killers but also the intellectual authors so that we know why they were murdered. Impunity in this case will generate fear among journalists, making them scared to speak out and do their jobs. The government must guarantee freedom of expression,” De Leon told the Guardian in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo.
While murders are rare, harassment and intimidation of journalists reporting on organised crime and corruption is fairly common in the Dominican Republic.
In recent years, reporters who spoke out against a controversial 2013 court ruling which stripped Dominicans of Haitian descent of their citizenship have received death threats and suffered vicious online harassment campaigns.
The last journalist to be killed in the country was Blas Olivo who was shot dead in April 2015. Police said Olvio, press director of the Dominican Agribusiness Association, was the victim of a bungled robbery, even though neither his car nor phone were stolen. The case remains ongoing.

JOHANNESBURG-(MaraviPost)-There is one question about Major 1 I keep being asked quite often.
How does he work, especially balancing ministry and business work? Well, let me answer with a story.
He has been in U.S for the past, say 10 days, on a business trip. Big business. I was expecting his return this Saturday morning. To my surprise, he called me Friday morning around 11 hours and said: “Hey, I am in town. Touched down at 9 hours.”
I thought that he was calling just to alert me that he is back. You and I would agree that after a 16 hour flight, you expect a jet lag, and you expect some hours of restful sleep.
Not Prophet Bushiri.
Arrange that meeting at my hotel in Rustenberg, he instructed. It's a business meeting with some gentlemen from Nigeria who arrived some days ago and been waiting for his arrival.
“I will be home for two hours and then head for the meeting,” he said.
Now, he stays in Joburg and the venue for the meeting, his hotel, is in Rustenberg, an hour or so drive.
I started off with the visitors at 12:58 hours and, by 14:30 hours, I was in Rustenberg. We found him there already, inspecting the expansion works happening at the hotel.
He welcomed us and took us to the boardroom. We started the meeting around 15:30 hours. Fruitful meeting and then his personal assistant alerted me that he has another meeting with some investors. The time, then, was 18:20 hours.
I alerted him quickly because I knew there was a church service tonight he was supposed to minister.
We moved into another meeting around 19:15 hours. It took us about two hours. Another great and fruitful meeting.
After that, he told all of us to have supper as he retired to solitude to prepare for the service. That meant an hour of prayer, seeking God's presence and direction.
After one and half hours, he returned. We had, almost, another hour of Bible Study as part of his relaxation.
The started off for an hour journey to Pretoria. I thought he will, in the first place, branch home and relax. I was, again, wrong. We cruised straight to church for a Candlelight all night service.
The service ended, today, at around 4 hours. I mean 4 am. I got home at 5:30 hours only to be welcomed by a call from him.
“I know you got home safe. I wish you a nice rest. I am praying for your protection in the name of Jesus,” he said.
Then he sent a text. Don't forget we have another meeting at 12 midday, it read. “Be at the office by 11:30 hours”.
So when you ask me: How does he work? I am sure this story can help answer you.
Let me rest.
They were first brought to British Columbia from Hong Kong to help celebrate Expo ‘86. Now a unique fleet of teak dragon boats is getting a second lease on life to help mark another major event: Canada's 150th birthday.
The nine boats were left to deteriorate under a Vancouver bridge but have been brought back to life in Salmon Arm, B.C.
It all started when Ted Crouch with the Shuswap Association for Rowing and Paddling replied to a for-sale ad for the boats around two years ago. At that point, the vessels were in rough shape and no longer seaworthy.
“They had a lot of cracks, a lot of breaks, a lot of paint peeling,” recalled Crouch.
The boats were originally brought to Vancouver for Expo '86, but after around two decades of use, they were decommissioned and put into storage under the Burrard Bridge. The wooden boats were shelved because they had become taxing for the volunteer-run Chinese Cultural Centre Dragon Boat Association to maintain, while fibreglass boats were becoming more popular.
READ MORE: ‘Ice Dragon boat' race held on Ottawa's frozen Rideau Canal
The Chinese Cultural Centre Dragon Boat Association, which owned the boats, ended up donating the vessels to the restoration project. In exchange, they will get one of the restored boats back.
“They had one individual who offered to buy them but said that he would cut them up and use them for furniture. They didn't want that. Our offer was to bring them back to the community where I thought we would be able to gather enough individuals to restore the boats and put them back for use,” said Crouch.
READ MORE: Edmonton Dragon Boat Festival closes with special race
That's exactly what they've done. Under the tutelage of a retired log-home builder with experience restoring wooden boats, a crew of people taking part in a government work experience program have put in about 1,200 hours into the restoration of each boat.
Wing Wong with the Chinese Cultural Centre Dragon Boat Association is impressed with the results.
“The dragon boats have been restored to better than new,” said Wong.
“It's incredible.”
However, there is still more work to do. Restoration work is continuing on three of the boats from Hong Kong, as well as a fleet of Taiwanese dragon boats.
The plan is to show many of the restored boats at a wooden dragon-boat festival this summer celebrating another milestone: Canada's 150th anniversary.
As a young lad growing up obsessed with the Indiana Jones films (the three good ones), I assumed the world was just brimming with undiscovered treasures and deadly tribesmen speaking in the long-forgotten tongues of the Old Ones. While there might only be a hint of truth left to the latter (there are undiscovered peoples and languages in some parts of the world), archaeologists are still sometimes able to uncover true mysteries of the past from time to time.
This week, historians working with a collection of antiques and curios in London's Lincoln's Cathedral came across a mysterious object in their collections that they are still struggling to explain. The object is a “Clock Jack” – a decorative human figure which can be seen adorning some old clocks. What's odd about this clock jack, however, is the fact that it is accompanied by a sketch of it attached to a clock – a sketch covered in what appear to be strange, cryptic symbols which elude attempts to decipher them.
The Clock Jack is an amazing discovery, allowing us, the future generation, a glimpse into a different time. There was an air of mystery around the Clock Jack when we first discovered it – there was no identification and no one had any idea what it was.
That's how the Lincoln Cathedral's collections and engagement officer Fern Dawson described the discovery of this curious object. The Clock Jack is a wooden knight standing about three feet tall whose features have been rubbed off and obscured over time. It's believed the knight is around 400 years old, but little is known for sure about the figure. A few old sketches were found in the online archives in Oxford's Bodleian Library which reference a clock in the Lincoln Cathedral and feature knights, those it's unknown if these are of the same clock for which the knight was carved.
In one of these sketches, a series of mysterious symbols is scrawled across the top just above the images of the clock. Researchers believe they are a form of shorthand, but have no idea what they might mean – if anything. Sometimes doodles are just doodles. Other times, though, those doodles point you to where the treasure is and tell you how to spell the real name of God. Could this Clock Jack be hiding something?

WWE News: 5-Time United States Champion returning to RAW after SummerSlam
When is The Face That Runs the Place coming back to the Flagship program?
@SGCWrestling by Simon Cotton News 14 Aug 2017, 07:17 IST
RAW is about to get the biggest names in all of pro wrestling!
What's the Story?
John Cena has been billed as a free agent since the 4th of July edition of SmackDown and fans have been wondering when he will make his appearance on the flagship show.
The official Twitter account of the Barclays Center may have ended the mystery surrounding Cena's return to Raw by advertising his appearance on the Monday Night Raw after SummerSlam.
We're 10 days away from @WWE Monday Night RAW. Don't miss Free Agent @JohnCena live here in Brooklyn on 8/21! #WWEBrooklyn pic.twitter.com/d4dMrsT5eW — Barclays Center (@barclayscenter) August 11, 2017
In case you didn't know...
Prior to his return to the WWE, Cena was being advertised as a free agent who would wrestle on both Raw and SmackDown.
Upon his return to SmackDown, he confirmed his status as a free agent who could appear on both shows, but primarily appeared on SmackDown television and house shows.
In the weeks leading up to SummerSlam, Cena was advertised for more Raw dates while the last advertisement for Cena's appearance on SmackDown was the August 15, 2017, edition of SmackDown; the Go-Home show for SummerSlam.
The Heart of the Matter
Cena's free agent status made some fans believe that the Face That Runs the Place would be appearing on both shows throughout the coming weeks.
However, Cena's advertised appearance on the August 21, 2017, edition of Raw could be a sign that the WWE creative team see more use for him in a fresher environment.
SmackDown's roster is full of wrestlers who Cena has feuded with before, so moving Cena to Raw may be done to ensure that he has fresh feuds to work with.
Cena staying on Raw would free him up to have confrontations with bigger stars like Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, Finn Bálor, Samoa Joe, and others.
What's next?
Cena is advertised to have a match with Samoa Joe at an upcoming house show, so that could be his first program when he returns to Monday Night Raw.
As far as his feud with Mr Money in the Bank Baron Corbin goes, the fact that Cena is more than likely leaving SmackDown and the tendency of WWE to book MITB winners weak leaves a sense of unpredictability surrounding their upcoming SummerSlam match.
Author's take
SummerSlam seems like the last time Cena will be referred to as a SmackDown superstar. Whether this will have an impact on Raw's viewership remains to be seen.

INDIANAPOLIS -- Colin Kaepernick isn't coming to rescue the Indianapolis Colts. The same can be said about any other free-agent quarterback at the moment. The Colts feel confident that Andrew Luck will be back at some point, but there's also a chance he may not be playing in the first couple of weeks of the regular season.
The Colts are sticking with Scott Tolzien as their starter, and evidently they're fine with that despite his performance so far in training camp and in Sunday's 24-10 preseason loss to the Detroit Lions.
"I thought he did OK," coach Chuck Pagano said about Tolzien's play in three series Sunday. "I think collectively as a unit, we've obviously got to be better and we have a long way to go. ... We'll look at their play and evaluate it and we keep moving on."
Scott Tolzien's play in Sunday's preseason loss to the Steelers did not inspire confidence in the Colts backup. Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports
If there's one thing general manager Chris Ballard has shown that's different from the previous regime, it's that he has patience. He constantly looks at the big picture instead of having shortsighted vision. That's why Ballard and the Colts aren't deviating from their plans in Luck's return. They're willing to take any lumps that come along the way until their franchise quarterback is fully healthy from his right shoulder surgery seven months ago.
You can never shut the door on the Colts adding another quarterback, but the time to do so is running out because that player would have to get up to speed with the offense, learn all the different languages used with the offense and get familiar with his teammates, all within a few weeks. That's why it's understandable the Colts have decided to stay put at quarterback at the moment.
Is Indianapolis good enough to win without Luck?
"I think we are," owner Jim Irsay said. "Obviously after coming off a tough preseason game like [Sunday] you can make a lot of comments and say, 'How can that be?' and 'Where are you going to be?' We think we can win. We believe we can win going into every game. Do we think we can have a better chance of winning with Andrew? Yes, that's certainly the case."

Scott Tolzien is not Andrew Luck. Everybody knows that. What Tolzien has to do is keep the offense afloat for the time being. What he can't do, though, is be inconsistent, and unfortunately that's happened way too often.
Tolzien played only 11 snaps where the offense gained a total of 21 yards. They picked up just one first down on the three series.
"It was sloppy, for sure," Tolzien said. "We've got to clean it up. We've got to get better. It's early, but that's not an excuse."
Injuries to guard Joe Haeg (burner) and center Ryan Kelly (foot) left the Colts without starters on the offensive line. Receivers Donte Moncrief (shoulder) and Phillip Dorsett (hamstring) and veteran running back Frank Gore not playing left the Colts and Tolzien without their full cupboard of offensive players.
"It's supposed to be hard," Tolzien said. "There's supposed to be obstacles and you've got to learn from your mistakes."
