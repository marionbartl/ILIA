The prospect of spending a Saturday at Ikea is so innately disquieting, it's amazing it hasn't become the setting for a horror story before now. Horrorstör is a new horror novel by Grady Helix that doesn't just use the big box Swedish furniture superstores as inspiration for a haunted house story, but visually resembles Ikea catalog as well.
Published by Quirk Books and available this month, Horrorstör takes place an Ikea-like store called Orsk that boasts hilarious, Ikea-style taglines like, “Got a question? Orsk me anything.” At an Orsk store in Cleveland, Ohio, five employees team up to spend a dusk-to-dawn shift inside the store to find out why furniture keeps on being destroyed overnight. Instead of a vandal, what they discover instead is a haunting, and “horror that defy imagination.”
The cover of Horrorstör was designed by Christine Ferrara, who sized and packaged it to look identically to an Ikea furniture catalog, who teamed up with various Etsy artists to create dollhouse furniture pastiches of various Ikea items for use on the cover.
Inside, illustrator Mike Rogalski fills Horrorstör with simple line drawings of mock-Ikea items, each of which comes with a horrifyingly morbid description, such as this one for the imaginary Bodavest chair:
Boasting several advantages over traditional forms of restraint, BODAVEST confines the penitent and opposed the agitated movement of blood toward the brain, forcing the subject into a state of total immobility, conducive to self-reflection and free of stressful outside stimuli. Available in light oak and medium birch.
“Coming up with the furniture in Horrorstör was like eating candy,” author Grady Hendrix told Boing Boing. “Some of the pieces were things I want to own, like the Frånjk, which is basically my ideal dining room table. Others, like the Tossur treadmill desk, were things I wanted to make fun of. And all the “augmented” furniture that serves a correctional purpose—the Jodlöpp, the Ingalutt, the Kraanjk—are based on real devices used in 19th-century prisons.”
Asked about their inspiration for the setting of Horrorstör, author Hendrix said that it was the result of a conversation with their editor about the horribleness of Ikea-like stores–a conversation that eventually took on its own life.
“The fact that stores like Orsk are full of endless aisles of bathroom displays, fully equipped kitchens, and fake bedrooms makes them feel like the mutant offspring of a house and a labyrinth,” they explained. “Add to that the idea that these stores don't want shoppers to think of them as stores but as “third spaces” (not work, not home, but someplace else), where you can spend hours relaxing, sitting on the furniture, eating in the cafe, and just generally hanging out. Roll that all together and you've got the perfect setting for a haunted house.”
Boston, MA – A taxi driver plowed over pedestrians at Logan Airport cab stand on Monday afternoon. 10 people are reportedly injured.
CBS Boston reports:
Sources tell WBZ-TV chief investigative reporter Cheryl Fiandaca that a 57-year-old Cambridge taxi driver lost control of their taxi and drove up onto a break area where many cab drivers were standing on break.
The driver is cooperating with investigators, sources said. At this point, police do not believe the crash was intentional.
Other taxi drivers at the scene described the cab shooting forward at a high rate of speed.
Police are not releasing the driver's identity at this time.
The injuries range from serious to minor, police said.
The cab pool is closed while the cause of the crash is still under investigation, according to Massachusetts State Police.

Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerEx-GOP lawmaker joins marijuana trade group Crowley, Shuster moving to K Street On unilateral executive action, Mitch McConnell was right — in 2014 MORE (R-Ohio) on Wednesday said they don't support calls from members of their party to impeach President Obama.
Asked about former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's comments that Obama should be impeached over the influx of child migrants illegally crossing the border, Boehner said, “I disagree.”

Then asked about members of the House GOP who have also urged for impeachment, Boehner repeated, “I disagree.”
Palin called for Obama's impeachment on Tuesday in an op-ed for Breitbart News.
“The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE can no longer be ignored,” they wrote. “If after all this he's not impeachable, then no one is.”
A number of House Republicans have also called for Obama's impeachment, including Reps. Lou Barletta (Pa.), Kerry Bentivolio (Mich.), Paul Broun (Ga.), Michael Burgess (Texas), Blake Farenthold (Texas), Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and Louie Gohmert (Texas).
But many Republicans are wary of the calls, worried they could hand Democrats a compelling issue that might help the party retain its majority in the Senate during a tough election year.
The impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton backfired badly on the GOP in 1998, when Democrats against odds picked up seats in the House.
The House is expected to vote later this month on a lawsuit against Obama for their use of executive actions. Boehner said at the weekly House GOP press conference that they were considering including Obama's action on immigration in the House GOP lawsuit.
Palin mocked the lawsuit in an interview Monday on Fox News.
“You don't bring a lawsuit to a gunfight. There is no place for lawyers on the frontline. Where are the front lines in America? They are our borders,” they said.
The news came out this week that the top nine NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team owners have gotten together and formed what they call the R.T.A. — Race Team Alliance. This is uncharted territory to a certain extent in our sport. Probably the biggest question on my mind right now is how will NASCAR, our sanctioning body, react?
I've read a couple NASCAR quotes since the release of the news of the formation. Basically what I hear NASCAR saying is they knew about it while at the same time the sport really doesn't need it because NASCAR's position is they listen to everybody and everybody has a voice in our sport.
This isn't a first, per say, in our sport. Something like this has been tried a couple times way back in the day. I find it interesting that in this 2014 version, the owners use the word "alliance" instead of the word "union" which was used a few decades ago by others.
Article continues below ...
I don't care whether it's our sport, any other professional sport or just an everyday business, but when you see a group of folks comes together and unite under a common banner, it's going to make the folks at the top who are on the other side of the fence a little nervous.
Obviously, these are very smart, successful business people that have formed this alliance. I would hope and expect they will walk a little softly and not upset the apple cart too much. It hasn't really worked well in other sports, and I sure would hate to see it mess ours up because of it.
For me personally, I have mixed emotions about this right now. While I can easily see the "pluses," I can just as easily see the "minuses" of it. I want to see if this group has a commitment to the fans and the sport, as it stands today, to be behind it and support it instead of it just being all about them. So initially, I think that is my biggest concern.
It's an interesting dynamic because all these owners are competitors to each other. Let's face it, I want to beat you and you want to beat me. I want to show your sponsor that I am a better investment for their sponsorship dollars, and vice versa. So what you are seeing somewhat is a mixture of oil and water.
It always sounds good to say you are united for the common goal, but face the reality: 43 teams scratch and claw against each other every week at the track and there is always just one winner. So that's why I say I am reluctant and concerned about this. What looks good on the surface doesn't end up looking so good behind closed doors. I just hope and pray they don't lose sight of what is important here and that is the race fans.
If they are truly coming together to try to come up with a plan to be able for all teams to save money across the board and further the sport, well, then I think it is a great thing. How they approach things and what their real agenda is becomes the most important thing to watch, in my mind.
Google's Project Zero team had to deal with waves of criticism in the last few months, after their security program revealed critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X that were unpatched by their parent companies.
The bugs were uncovered after the 90-day disclosure policy of the project, but neither Microsoft nor Apple managed to patch the flaw before details of the vulnerabilities went public as part of Google's program.
As a result, the Mountain View-based search giant has decided to update the disclosure policy of Project Zero in a way that would help software developers get “a second chance” to patch their software by providing them with more time to do it under certain circumstances.
In an announcement released by the Google Security team, the company reveals that out of the 154 security bugs found so far, a total of 85 percent were fixed during the 90-day timeframe, while the others were “typically fixed very quickly after that.”
Grace period
Google's Project Zero will now offer a grace period of 14 days if the vendor requires it. Basically, a company has to contact Google directly and ask for a 14-day grace period in order to be able to patch a certain security flaw before full details are made public.
“Public disclosure of an unpatched issue now only occurs if a deadline will be significantly missed (2 weeks+),” Google says.
At the same time, Google explains that if the deadline is set to expire on a weekend or US holiday, the disclosure won't be made until the next business day, which is usually Monday. Again, vendors have more time to fix the flaw and patch the found vulnerability.
And last but not least, Google is also making sure that each vulnerability will come with a CVE that would help “uniquely identify vulnerabilities,” as the company says in the announcement.
As usual, Google points out that based on extreme circumstances, the deadline can be pushed back or forward, so basically, it all comes down to how well tech companies communicate to each other to handle the bug fixing and disclosure.
Needless to say, Google guarantees that its own products, including Chrome and Android, are subject to the same policy, so disclosures would be made under the same rules.
A Hamilton judge who wore a "Make America Great Again" hat in court the morning after Donald Trump's U.S. election win last November has been suspended for 30 days.
Judge Bernd Zabel appeared before a disciplinary hearing last month, and said they did not support the American president, but was simply trying to make people laugh when they wore the baseball cap with the phrase Trump used during their campaign.
"Justice Zabel is reprimanded for their breach of the standards of judicial conduct," reads the decision from the Ontario Judicial Council.
The decision also said Zabel is suspended for 30 days without pay. They have not been hearing cases since December.
The suspension is the most serious sanction that the Ontario Judicial Council can impose, short of dismissing the judge.
After news broke that Zabel wore the hat in court on Nov. 9, 2016, the council received 81 complaints about their conduct. According to the decision, the most common theme throughout them was that the veteran judge's conduct "represented an unacceptable expression of partisan political views by a judge."
If they had worn a Justin Trudeau hat, I think reaction would have been just as strong. - Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch
"Most complainants indicate a heightened concern as they perceive many of the things Trump said during their campaign to indicate misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and anti-Muslim attitudes," the decision reads. "The complainants state that Justice Zabel has associated themselves with those views by their conduct and that women and members of various vulnerable groups would reasonably fear that they would not be treated fairly and impartially by Justice Zabel."
'Strongly divergent policies'
The decision also touched on the tumultuous political climate in the United States, and noted that the 2016 election campaign was "highly partisan and bitter."
"The candidates advocated strongly divergent policies. Many of Trump's positions were provocative and controversial. If adopted, their policies on matters such as free trade, climate change, immigration, and national security would affect the daily lives of many Canadians," the decision reads.

"His views attracted wide attention in Canada and many Canadians expressed their strong disagreement with their policies. It was often stated that Trump's policies were contrary to Canada's interests and contrary to 13 basic Canadian values.
"Many Canadians found their views on women, racialized minorities, and other vulnerable groups to be highly offensive. For a judge to appear to endorse Trump's views would be perceived by the public to be an expression of opinion on issues of profound importance to Canadians."
Zabel appeared before a disciplinary hearing in Toronto last month, and apologized for wearing the hat.
"The man depicted in those complaints is not me," Zabel said. "I'm not a racist, I'm not a bigot, I'm not a misogynist."
An unblemished 27-year record, until now
On top of the complaints, the council also received 63 letters of support about Zabel from their judicial colleagues, members of the bar, court staff and members of the public. Zabel has been a judge for 27 years, and has never been the subject of any Ontario Judicial Council hearings.
"Justice Zabel is praised for their hard work, professionalism, integrity, and for being helpful to other judges and to counsel," the decision reads.
Duff Conacher, a law and political science professor at the University of Ottawa and co-founder of the advocacy group Democracy Watch, said that Zabel's penalty feels appropriate, given their decades of service without complaints or appearance of bias.
"Though I would like to see them suspended for longer," Conacher said. "Our system of government is based on having independent judges. It is fundamental to our democracy.
"But I don't think that it justified firing."
Many on social media have complained that the outcry surrounding the baseball cap incident would not have been as extreme had Zabel worn a hat aligned with a different political stripe — but Conacher says they don't buy that argument.
"If they had worn a Justin Trudeau hat, I think reaction would have been just as strong."

It would be weird to do Winner vs Winner and Looser vs Looser. That means it is better to go straight to the final of the looser bracket (Round 1) than winning the winner bracket (Round 1). Players from looser bracket are supposed to be weaker than players from winner bracket.

That doesn't help...
I know it's GSL format, I just don't know if Suppy vs MC is first up (even though they both won their groups) along with HerO vs Naama or if it's Suppy vs HerO or Namma and MC vs Other. I just took a stab in the dark.

Bugs collected on rooftop for 18 years reveal climate change effects
Climate A volunteer registration of insects for 18 consecutive years on the roof of the Natural History Museum of Denmark has revealed local insect community turnover due to climate change. The research suggests a pattern of specialised species being more sensitive to climate change.
1543 different species of moths and beetles and more than 250.000 individuals have been registered on a single urban rooftop in Copenhagen over 18 years of monitoring. That corresponds to 42 % of all the species of moths in Denmark and 12 % of the beetles. More interestingly, the insect community has changed significantly during that period. The results are published today in the Journal of Animal Ecology led by researchers from the Center for GeoGenetics and the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate at the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen.
“As temperature increases we see a corresponding change in the insect community, specifically for the resource specialists – the insects that feed on only one species of plant. Earlier studies have confirmed that specialist species also respond rapidly to destruction of their habitats, so we are dealing with a very sensitive group of animals” says one of the lead authors postdoc Philip Francis Thomsen from the Center for GeoGenetics.
Specialized insects such as the acorn weevil (Curculio glandium) seem to be the most sensitive to climate change in Europe, the study shows. Download Credit: Klaus Bek Nielsen
The nut weevil Curculio nucum is an example of a resource specialist, feeding only on hazel. It lives further north in Europe than its close relative the acorn weevil Curculio glandium, which feeds only on acorns. While the nut weevil was only registered in the first half of the study, the acorn weevil only appeared in the last part of the study, suggesting that specialist species are moving northwards in Europe.
Using the entire dataset, the study was able to confirm this trend and highlights the increased pressure on the most northern species, which may be ‘squeezed out' of their range in the long term.
“We are likely to lose some specialist species as they retreat north, but more new specialist species will arrive from the south. This trend is theoretically expected but extremely rare to confirm with observations across this many species. Insects are often over-looked and under prioritised for long term studies” says the other lead author Peter Søgaard Jørgensen, PhD from the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate.
Monitoring programs are not prioritised
It was two employees from the Natural History Museum of Denmark with extensive entomological expertise, Ole Karsholt and Jan Pedersen, who collected and identified all the insects. The monitoring took place every week from 1992 to 2009 through spring, summer and autumn using a light trap at the roof of the museum at 17.5 meters height. What started out as a hobby based on scientific curiosity, ended up in an extensive faunal and climate change study.
“Long-term monitoring, even without a pre-defined purpose, can be of incredible value when trying to understand and predict biodiversity in a changing world. Species monitoring is under prioritised in Denmark and primarily driven by personal interest from committed enthusiasts. Without those individuals we would basically be in the dark about the majority of species in Denmark. The same is probably true for many other European countries. We hope this study can push nature monitoring back onto the political agenda” says Philip Francis Thomsen.
Volunteers register species new to Denmark

Seven species of moths and two species of beetles were registered for the first time in Denmark by Karsholt and Pedersen, including the multicolored Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis), which has since spread to most of the country and is now considered invasive. Also species living in habitats at least 10 km away were registered as well as some migrating moths from countries south of Denmark.
“Some insects are very mobile and only eat as larvae. It is therefore not unusual to find them further from their habitats as adults. However, it is an impressive diversity of species registered. Even though the study is limited to one site, there is no reason to believe that the trend we see here would be different at other sites” says Peter Søgaard Jørgensen.
Less than half a degree Celsius has consequences
For each group of species, the scientists calculated an index for the temperature related change across their entire habitat range in Europe for the study period. The specialist moth species experienced an increase of 0.14 °C between 1993 and 2008 and the specialist beetle species 0.42 °C between 1995 and 2008.
“The results confirm that climate change is impacting biodiversity right now. It is not something that will happen far into the future or only if we reach a two degree temperature increase” says Peter Søgaard Jørgensen.

Image caption In some cases circumcisions are being carried out by people with no medical qualifications
A doctor under investigation by the General Medical Council after circumcising a child says they are resigning from the NHS.
Dr Muhamad Siddiqui, a hospital surgeon, had conditions imposed on their GMC registration after a complaint by the parents of the toddler.
The doctor, who carried out the procedure at the child's home, denies all the allegations.
Dr Siddiqui operated their own mobile circumcision service outside the NHS.
The GMC investigation was launched after a complaint by Kelly Braiha and their husband Ghali, from Littlehampton in West Sussex.
They claim their 23-month-old son Najem was left traumatised and suffered an infection because Dr Siddiqui, who works at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, did not take hygienic precautions.
Image caption Najem Braiha's parents claim they were left traumatised after a circumcision operation
Mrs Braiha says they believe home circumcisions should now be banned.
Dr Siddiqui is also accused of failing to obtain indemnity insurance for their private work and of carrying out regulated procedures without the necessary Care Quality Commission registration.
They deny all the allegations against him.
After an initial investigation by the GMC, the case has been referred to a fitness-to-practise hearing.
In the meantime, the GMC issued an interim order banning Dr Siddiqui from carrying out circumcisions anywhere other than in a hospital or clinical setting.
Regulatory loopholes
But when researchers from the BBC Radio 5live Investigates programme contacted them this week, days after the interim order came into force, they said they would be happy to carry out a circumcision at a private address in Southampton.
After the arrangements for the procedure were agreed, the programme contacted Dr Siddiqui again and told them the call had been made by a researcher posing as the father of a boy they wanted circumcised.
Dr Siddiqui said they wanted to continue performing home circumcisions but they were in the process of resigning from their NHS job and surrendering their GMC registration.
This would mean they would not be able to practise as a doctor but because of regulatory loopholes they would be able to carry on performing circumcisions privately.
Asked why they had agreed to carry out a home circumcision when there was a GMC order preventing them from doing so, they said they would not have carried out the procedure until their resignation had been formalised.
Dr Siddiqui said: 'I don't agree with the limitations the GMC has imposed on me. I don't want to be at odds with the GMC."
Healthcare workers have to be registered with the CQC if they want to perform home circumcisions but Dr Siddiqui felt they did not have to be.
Those who have no formal medical training, however, are not required to be registered with any of the regulators.
5live Investigates has also spoken to consultants who have told the programme they are concerned about the number of children they are seeing with medical complications after some home circumcisions.
They are now calling for tighter controls.
'Children have died'
Consultant surgeon Feilim Murphy, secretary of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists, said: "The biggest issue is there are a number of children who are circumcised by people who are not experienced and don't understand what is required, and there can be significant complications with that."
They said this could include bleeding, which is particularly dangerous for babies, pain, damage to the penis and loss of the top of the penis.
They added: "Unfortunately children have died in the last number of years in Britain and Ireland from circumcision-related complications.
"It does make sense that everybody should register, that everybody should be on the same playing field.
"It makes sense for the child it makes sense for the family it makes sense for everyone."
5live Investigates is broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live at 11am on Sunday, November 17.
Keanu Reeves has spoken to Collider about the story of action sequel John Wick 2 and revealed that the film could go in front of cameras as soon as this month.
SEE ALSO: John Wick getting a first-person shooter VR game
John Wick was a surprise hit for Lionsgate earlier this year, scooping an impressive $78m at the worldwide box office from a budget of only $20m. A sequel was soon greenlit and Reeves has said that the film could be shot this month by director Chad Stahelski.
They also spoke about the narrative arc of the film, which looks set to explore the dark recesses of the central character's past life as a brutal assassin. “I think we have a really good premise, and it's an organic premise,” they said. “It's basically — to me there's John Wick and then there's John. You know, John is the married guy whose wife just died, and that five years of their life, then there's John Wick, who's the mythical assassin. In this, John Wick's past comes and infiltrates John's life and John Wick, in a way, has to fight for John.”
Later in the interview, Reeves teased further depth being added to the criminal underworld of assassins at the centre of John Wick, including the Hotel Continental.
“Chad and the writer, Derek Kolstad, they've really listened to what people have enjoyed about the work and how they speak about it,” they said. “So there's definitely that influence of the other world, the Continental world, the look, the feel, what it is about the movie, what made people like it; is definitely being paid attention to and the world opens up in this chapter.”
A year-long investigation by the Wisconsin-based Center for Media and Democracy has revealed a severe dearth of public information about how federal and state taxes are being spent to fuel the charter school industry in the U.S.
"Unlike truly public schools that have to account for prospective and past spending in public budgets provided to democratically elected school boards, charter spending of tax monies is too often a black hole."
—Center for Media and Democracy
According to the report released Wednesday—Charter School Black Hole (pdf)—no one even knew how much the federal government had spent on its program designed to boost the charter sector until CMD started poking around. Now, after filing close to 50 open records requests and reviewing more than two decades of federal authorizations and appropriations, the national watchdog group has calculated that sum to be a whopping $3.7 billion.
Furthermore, how those billions were spent was equally difficult to discern.
"What is even more troubling is how difficult it is to find essential information on how some charters have spent federal and state tax dollars, even as governments continue to increase funding for charters while slashing funds for traditional public schools," reads the report. "Unlike truly public schools that have to account for prospective and past spending in public budgets provided to democratically elected school boards, charter spending of tax monies is too often a black hole."
The study attributes this lack of accountability "to the way the charter industry has been built by proponents, favoring 'flexibility' over rules."
"That flexibility has allowed an epidemic of fraud, waste, and mismanagement that would not be tolerated in public schools," CMD states, noting that charters "are often policed—if they are really policed at all—by charter proponents, both within government agencies and within private entities tasked with oversight."
In fact, that oversight is so spotty that CMD's investigation turned up dozens of "ghost" schools, where federal grants were awarded to charters that never even opened.

"The bottom-line is taxpayers know far too little about how much their federal tax dollars are being used to fund charters," said CMD executive director Lisa Graves on Wednesday, "and there is far too little information provided by states about how tax monies are being spent by charters or by for-profit firms they are tied to."
Noting that "neither the federal government nor the states require charters to publish that information on their websites and neither the federal nor state governments we examined publish that information themselves," Graves continued: "Even aside from serious questions about academic performance by charters—especially online charters—the lack of real accountability remains a real problem for kids and families, as more and more people and corporations have sought to get a piece of the pie, a revenue stream from taxpayer money, to operate or assist charters."
Among the report's most damning findings:
In 2011 and 2012, $3.7 million in federal taxpayer money was awarded to 25 Michigan "ghost" schools that never even opened to students.
In California, more than $4.7 million in federal taxpayer money was handed out to create charter schools that subsequently closed within a few years.
In Ohio, out of the 88 schools created by planning and implementation grants under the federal "Charter School Program" (CSP) for state education agencies between 2008 and 2013, at least 15 closed within a few years; a further seven schools never even opened. These charters received more than $4 million in federal taxpayer money.
And despite that track record, the report reveals, Ohio landed the biggest one-year grant "by far" in the 2015 competition for federal funding—$32.6 million—thanks in part to a glowing endorsement from the National Association of Charter School Authorizers (NACSA), which CMD notes had previously referred to the charter system in Ohio as "broken."
This supports the report's assertion that "[i]n the current structure, the U.S. Department of Education hears only from proponents of the charter school grant application and in this closed loop—unsurprisingly—it approves money to a state like Ohio based on formal submissions that praise it, in spite of numerous failures."
After providing detailed assessments of the flow of charter money in 12 states (California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, New York, Utah, Washington, and Indiana, plus the District of Columbia), CMD makes five recommendations that encourage transparency at both the federal and state levels and at every stage in the charter-funding process.
"In sum, securing information from the states about how charter spending and how they have handled charter oversight has proven to be a difficult process filled with substantial obstruction of efforts to get key facts," the report concludes. "Perhaps the reluctance to provide information is understandable—although not acceptable—given what the evidence shows about widespread failure of critical oversight over how Americans' tax dollars are being spent by charter schools."
Donald Trump says if he'd been president, Osama bin Laden would have been taken out before the World Trade Center towers fell to hijacked planes commandeered by their followers. Trump's bold remarks at a Cleveland charter school, where they unveiled a $20 billion school-choice proposal to send every child living in poverty to the K-12 school of their choice, came three days short of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
CLEVELAND � Donald Trump says if he�d been president, Osama bin Laden would have been taken out before the World Trade Center towers fell to hijacked planes commandeered by their followers.
Trump�s bold remarks at a Cleveland charter school, where they unveiled a $20 billion school-choice proposal to send every child living in poverty to the K-12 school of their choice, came three days short of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
�I would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught a long time ago before they were ultimately caught, prior to the downing of the World Trade Center,� Trump said to a crowd of about 150 people at a charter school.
Trump made their remarks after railing against the service of Democrat Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, saying they and President Barack Obama helped give birth to the Islamic State and its breed of terrorism.
President George W. Bush, a Republican, was in office when hijacked planes slammed into the New York landmarks and the Pentagon and another crashed in rural Pennsylvania after passengers intervened.
Previously, President Bill Clinton had gone after bin Laden�s forces with a missile attack but failed. The Bush administration never succeeded in tracking down the terrorist leader. They were killed on Obama�s watch by Navy SEALS on May 2, 2011, at their hiding spot in Pakistan.
Education, particularly for children living in poverty in inner cities, was Trump�
Trump blamed Clinton for diplomacy and policies that destabilized the Middle East: �She made us less safe than ever before. They put the entire country at risk.�
They blasted Clinton for their State Department email scandal and the Clinton Foundation�s fundraising practices.
�It�s all about the hidden criminal enterprise,� they said. �As part of a criminal coverup.�
Trump continued to steadfastly claim � in total opposition to documentation to the contrary � that they opposed the Iraq war when the U.S. launched the attack, which Clinton voted to support while in the U.S. Senate.
They quoted from an Esquire magazine article after the war was begun in which they expressed doubts about the war and its goals.
�I just wanted to set the record straight,� Trump said. �The media is so dishonest, so terribly dishonest.�
Trump also introduced a new proposal to rescue children in poverty from schools they described as held hostage to mediocrity by bureaucrats and teachers unions.
�Every child will be placed on the ladder to success, and I define that as a great education and a great job,� they said.
They spoke of breaking up the �government-run education monopoly,� beginning by reallocating $20 billion in existing federal funds � they didn�t say from where � to allow children in poverty to attend any public, private, charter or religious school their parents choose.
�The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic children in failing public schools,� the candidate said as they spoke at a largely black school in an African-American neighborhood on Cleveland�s east side.
Ohio permits parents to enroll their children in any privately operated charter school, which are funded by tax dollars, and offers scholarships to permit children attending low-performing public schools to attend other schools. Trump praised Ohio for its school-choice programs.
Trump also spoke of crime-ridden cities such as Chicago and Baltimore and said inner-city residents will have safe streets on which to walk to school with their children.
The New York business person also called for a greater expansion of merit pay to successful teachers to replace �the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers.�
Trump received only polite applause form a half-black, half-white crowd in the cafeteria of the school, which received a �D� on its state-issued report card in the latest evaluation. School officials say students have made good progress and are turning the corner to achievement.
Mary Rice, a former board member of the school, welcomed Trump�s focus on school choice as a �very auspicious program,� but they said it will take a nation � not just a president � to ensure all children receive a quality education.  They are not a Trump supporter.
In a statement, Ohio Federation of Teachers President Melissa Cropper called Trump a �snake-oil salesperson.�
�If Trump wants to discuss real solutions � like how we can hold charters to high standards and ensure they�re serving our kids, how we can reinvest in our neighborhood schools, and how we can return the joy of teaching and learning to our classrooms � I�m ready and willing to have that conversation. But the last thing we need is another billionaire who thinks they know more about education than the people who spend every day working to give our kids a fair shot,� they said.

Football Leaps To No. 24 Ranking In Sports Network Top-25 Poll
PHILADELPHIA -- After winning only one game in 2013, the University at Albany football program has turned over a new leaf, opening the 2014 season with three consecutive victories and earning a No. 24 ranking in The Sports Network Top-25 Poll.
UAlbany was last ranked in 2012 when the Great Danes sat at No. 20 in the media poll and No. 18 in the Coaches Poll with a 7-1 overall record, earning the program's highest Division I rating in history. The Danes entered The Sports Network Top-25 in in Week 8 at No 24, and then topped out at No. 20 the following week before falling out of the ranks.
UAlbany is 3-0 for the first time since 2001 and is one of 11 FCS teams still with an undefeated record. Overcoming Holy Cross (14-13), Central Connecticut State (19-0), and Rhode Island (37-20), UAlbany ranks first in the CAA and third in FCS for scoring defense (11.0), as well as first in conference and fourth in FCS for rushing defense (72.3). The Great Danes also rank first in the nation for turnover margin (2.67), gaining nine turnovers this season, while losing only one. In addition, UAlbany is tied for fourth in FCS for fumble recoveries, recovering seven, while losing none.
The Danes' most recent win over URI marked the program's first CAA victory, as well as Head Coach Greg Gattuso's 100th career win. Gattuso, in their first season at the helm and 13th overall as a head coach, is the winningest active coach at the FCS level with .758 winning percentage.
A national panel of sports information and media relations directors, broadcasters, writers and other dignitaries select The Sports Network Top 25. In the voting, a first-place vote is worth 25 points, a second-place vote 24 points, all the way down to one point for a 25th-place vote.
Up next, UAlbany steps out of conference play, hosting Columbia on Sept. 27 at 6:00 p.m. at Bob Ford Field.
Rioting and family refusal highlight burial of Hamas terrorist, after they 'brought honor to family' by murdering baby and 22-year-old.
The mother of Abdelrahman Shaludi, the Hamas terrorist who last Wednesday murdered three-month-old Chaya Zisel Braun hy''d and 22-year-old Karen Mosquera hy''d with their car in Jerusalem, is a "martyr" according to their mother.
Shaludi's family raised a ruckus after police limited the number of attendees at the terrorist's Sunday night funeral at the feet of the Temple Mount to 20, and had the burial be held late at night.
The steps were taken to avoid violent Arab rioting, which occurred before the funeral in any case, as Arab residents of the Shiloach (Silwan in Arabic) neighborhood where Shaludi hails from clashed with police outside the dead terrorist's home, as the family then refused to begin the funeral.
In the end, the family and the police agreed to let the funeral take place with a reduced number of participants, and the funeral of the Hamas terrorist was held in the Israeli capital without additional attacks on law enforcement forces.
During the funeral, Shaludi's mother said they were proud of their son who gave honor to the family when they became a "shahid" (martyr), adding repeatedly "praise to Allah."
The praise and lionization of the terrorist echoes statements by Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction, which pledged "loyalty" to Shaludi, and PA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat who justified the murders Shaludi committed. Likewise, a senior aid to Abbas was quick to praise the terrorist murder of the three-month-old, calling the terrorist a "hero."
The Almagor terror victims' organization had protested returning the body of the terrorist, who was shot as they tried to flee the Ammunition Hill light rail station where they plowed their car into a group of pedestrians.
The group pointed out that there are two fallen IDF soldiers, Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul hy"d, whose bodies are still being held by Hamas after the last operation, and being used to negotiate the release of hundreds of terrorists.
Meir Indor and Dr. Aryeh Bacharah, heads of Almagor, argued that Israel should have placed a condition on the return of Shaludi's body, demanding that the bodies of its fallen soldiers be returned in exchange for the body of the Hamas terrorist.
Back in 2001, Goldman Sachs' Jim O'Neill coined the term BRICs to describe the key fast growing developing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. But a dozen years later, is the focus on the BRICs misplaced? Indeed, is the group “broken,” as Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma has suggested?
“Although the world can expect more breakout nations to emerge from the bottom income tier, at the top and the middle, the new global economic order will probably look more like the old one than most observers predict,” Sharma wrote earlier this year. “The rest may continue to rise, but they will rise more slowly and unevenly than many experts are anticipating. And precious few will ever reach the income levels of the developed world.”
Each day this week, beginning with Russia, a leading analyst will assess the prospects of a BRIC nation and weigh in on whether it still deserves its place in a group of economic high flyers.
By William Pomeranz, Special to CNN
Editor's note: William Pomeranz is deputy director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. The views expressed are their own.
Created by bankers as a catchy acronym to entice foreign investors, the BRICS – first Brazil, Russia, India, China and then South Africa – have subsequently morphed into a loose association of countries with an emerging global view. The group now gathers annually to discuss its common aspirations, yet it still has few underlying structures.
In light of its origins and inchoate organization, the BRICS could be accused of being a Potemkin village – all show and no substance. Russia, of course, invented the Potemkin village and knows how to exploit its practical – and symbolic – uses. As a result, Russia highly values its BRICS membership and wants to deepen its cooperation even as the economic dynamism behind the original concept has begun to run out of steam.
To the extent that the BRICS have a common core, it unites a group of emerging market countries that had no input in drafting the rules of global commerce. Russia lacks the economic clout to revisit these conventions, so it needs its fellow BRICS members to change the rules of the game – or at least create alternative institutions that get around these rules.
Russia has used its influence to push the BRICS in the latter direction, in the process giving some shape to this amorphous association. In particular, the BRICS have called for the creation of a development bank that would aid emerging market countries in times of economic crisis as well as fund major infrastructure projects. The BRICS also want to establish its own credit rating agency, thereby breaking the monopoly that the western agencies possess in evaluating potential projects.
But the BRICS provide Russia with geopolitical cover, as well. Putin's foreign policy is based on one overriding principle: national sovereignty. No country or international organization has the right to interfere in another nation's internal affairs, a viewpoint largely shared among the BRICS countries.
The BRICS approach also coincides nicely with Russia's vision of a multipolar world and further holds out the prospect of increased multilateral trade between its members. So from Russia's perspective, the BRICS remain a highly valuable concept that has already produced some tangible results.
Russia's problem, as it were, is that it believes in the BRICS too much, and wants to give this still nascent grouping of nations a more defined institutional structure. On the eve of the March 2013 meeting of BRICS leaders in Durban, President Putin talked of transforming the BRICS from a dialogue forum to a “full-scale strategic cooperation mechanism that will allow us to look for solutions to key issues of global politics together.”
Any attempt at a more integrated union, however, could negatively impact the organization's long-term prospects. Commentators have long highlighted not only what unites the BRICS but also what divides it: entrenched historical animosities, distinct political systems, unequal economic resources, etc.
Russia has always been the odd-man out of the BRICS, with a more traditional economy based on raw materials extraction as opposed to economic innovation, high-tech manufacturing, or the provision of services. Russia's current economic troubles will invariably renew the debate as to whether Russia even belongs in the emerging market category – and the BRICS – at all.
All the BRICS countries face major economic headwinds that could in and of itself doom the enterprise. China remains the key player; its status as the second largest economy in the world makes its relevant, with or without the BRICS, and it could walk away from the project at any time.
Brazil, India, and South Africa could, for their part, survive the breakup of the BRICS as well, especially since they already have an organization (the IBSA Dialogue Forum) to fall back on. Russia is not so fortunate. Indeed, its other major international trade initiative – the Eurasian Union – may soon come crashing down if Ukraine signs its association agreement with the European Union. So, in many ways, Russia is more invested in the BRICS than its fellow members.
The global economy may well be moving to a post-BRICS world, with a declining interest amongst investors in emerging markets. But even if that is the case, it is probably too early write off the BRICS. At this stage, the BRICS has ceased to be just a collection of disparate countries at various stages of economic development but has evolved into something more tangible. It specifically provides Russia with an important platform that supports the country's broader geostrategic interests.
The ties that bind the BRICS, however, remain tenuous at best. If Russia pushes further integration too hard, the BRICS could easily unravel, and Russia would have nothing to replace it with.
Now we know where Kanye West gets their style inspiration from (and it's not their wife, Kim Kardashian).
A photo posted on imgur this week showed a side-by-side comparison of the rapper in a camel coat next to a pic of "Seinfeld's" Elaine Benes a.k.a Julia Louis-Dreyfus wearing almost the exact same coat!
This isn't the first time Kanye has been a fashion copy-cat. The "All of the Lights" singer has a penchant for colour-coordinating their outfits with Kim, like the time they both wore white tees, jeans and dark oversized coats or the time they both wore satin lapels just days before their wedding.
Kanye even coordinated the camel coat to match the Vogue cover girl's strapless dress when they were spending some downtime in Paris.
So, who do you think looks better in the coat: Kanye or Julia Louis-Dreyfus?
A US mother and father have had child services take two of their children away from them after a series of YouTube videos were posted online depicting them emotionally and physically abusing their kids.
The couple became YouTube stars on account of their pranks, which would see them blame or deceive their children into thinking they had done something wrong or that something serious would happen to them.
They did it under the YouTube channel DaddyOFive, which has more than 760,000 subscribers - but last month a series of videos emerged showing them carrying out pranks that have been labelled cruel and unfunny.
Some depicted the couple insulting, swearing and yelling at their kids for things they didn't do as they cried hysterically, while another showed the father violently pushing their youngest son, Cody, into a bookshelf.
“As a practical matter, what has happened over the last several decades is that the party that's in charge of the General Assembly has been able to come up with plans favorable to it and then pass those in through the General Assembly,” they said.
Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly employ specialists to help them come up with a redistricting plan that is favorable to their party, Joyce said.
This has consistently led to voting maps that heavily favor one party or the other and reduce competition at the ballot box. Since 1992, nearly half of all legislative races have had only one candidate on the ballot and only one in 10 of last year's legislative races were competitive, according to a press release from Common Cause.
North Carolina's legislative districts were found to be unconstitutionally gerrymandered on the basis of race in a July 2016 ruling in federal court.
The new bill would require nonpartisan legislative staff to follow strict guidelines when drawing voting districts without input from legislators. The finished maps would then be sent to the full legislature for an up or down vote.
Joyce said some voters in the state are interested in less partisan redistricting. According to a January survey by Public Policy Polling, 59 percent of North Carolina voters support drawing district lines in a nonpartisan fashion, while only 15 percent are opposed to it.
“I think that there is a sense in the state that it would be good to do something,” Joyce said.
Similar proposals have been introduced in the past without success. One was approved by the N.C. House with bipartisan support in 2011 but did not receive a vote in the N.C. Senate. It was reintroduced in 2013 and 2015, but the bill was stalled in committee both times.
Rep. David Lewis, R-Harnett, said in an email that the people drawing the districts will have political leanings to some extent.
“Acknowledging political considerations are involved in inherently political undertakings is simply being honest with all involved,” they said in the email.
Lewis said the new bill would not completely alleviate conflict about redistricting.
“I will also note that non-partisan redistricting does not eliminate the lawsuits (that) will arise by those wishing a different outcome to the redistricting process and because of differing interpretations of the laws,” Lewis said.
Joyce said the bill will have to go through a long process to be signed into law, facing numerous committees and potential for amendments.
“Whatever redistricting bill might eventually pass — if one does — might or might not closely resemble what you and I have just been looking at,” they said. “If something passed that was just like what the bill that has been introduced does, it would significantly change the process.”

It's almost here, the day that gift card retailers and flower sellers dream of every year, hoping that love in the air will sell enough roses to buy that new car they always wanted. Valentine's Day is coming, giving couples a chance to buy each other gifts and show extra romance, while those that are single bemoan the fact it's even an occasion — there's no escape.
Nintendo, for its part, is using the occasion to persuade particularly generous couples to lavish new gaming machines upon each other, with the official Nintendo UK store launching a "Love Nintendo" campaign, advertising a variety of systems of the pink and white varieties. The main deals, 'For Him' and 'For Her' are below.
Though Nintendo has tweeted referring to "offers", the Luigi system is still its original price of £179.99 — it is exclusive to the Nintendo UK store outside of Japan, however. The pink 3DS XL is £199.99 and comes with a copy of Animal Crossing: New Leaf and also a CD with music from the game.
Not mind-blowing offers, but more a reminder of the store's various 3DS models and options for UK gamers. Are any of you, wherever you are in the world, lavishing such a pricey gift on your loved one this Valentine's Day?
A Texas woman was arrested after they claimed their boyfriend was threatening their life on social media — but was actually writing those threatening posts herself, according to police.
Lisa Garcia, 22, was arrested Thursday after cops said they falsely accused their boyfriend, Brandon Berrott, 23, of threatening her, leading police to toss them in jail multiple times, KTRK reported.
Garcia claimed their boyfriend “threatened their life” on social media and through text messages, the Baytown Police Department told Fox News.
POLICE: TEEN ADMITS TO MOLESTING 50 CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA
Garcia allegedly set up accounts on Instagram pretending to be Berrott, according to the Houston Chronicle. Garcia also sent threatening messages to themselves and Berrott's other girlfriend and reported them to the police department and the Harris County Sheriff's Office, investigators said.
Berrott reportedly has children with Garcia and the other woman.
Berrott was charged with eight different crimes, according to Fox 26. The charges were filed within 10 days in October, and they were jailed at least three times for Garcia's threats, the Chronicle reported. It also cost them their job, prosecutors said.
As Berrott was cooperating with police, Garcia was making threats to themselves under their name, according to KTRK. Investigators reportedly found that it wasn't possible for Berrott to have sent one of the threats because they were in custody at the time.
“He didn't do any of this. They were charged with eight criminal cases and is innocent of all of them,” prosecutor Britni Cooper told the Chronicle. “I'm horrified, actually, and can't imagine what this guy went through. It's a nightmare.”
COURT THROWS OUT LAWSUIT OVER TEACHER MOM, 38, JAILED FOR UP TO 30 YEARS FOR SEX AFFAIRS WITH 3 TEEN BOYS
Berrott's defense attorney, Carl Moore, said they have “never felt so confident that my client was innocent,” and believes Garcia did this because of a custody battle between the two regarding their child.
“She wanted them to revoke their parental rights, and they said, ‘No, I want to be in my child's life,'“ Moore said. “When you read the messages, I believe you could tell that they were written by a female that was scorned.”
They told KHOU that they blame the police department “as much as anyone for continuing to accept these charges without doing the proper investigation.”
During the course of the investigation, Garcia claimed Berrott's mother, an employee of Harris County, bribed a state district judge to allow their son to make bail.
Garcia was taken into custody Thursday on charges of retaliation and online impersonation. Bond was set at $10,000.
With everyone talking about Born of the Gods, I've decided to take things in a different direction this week. Recently I've been helping a friend learn the Legacy format, and during that process I've run across a few things that I believe would be helpful to a lot of players who are either just learning the format or want to get better at Legacy.
Besides a lot of the format staples being extremely expensive, the biggest hurdle for breaking into the Legacy format is the vast card pool and the myriad of decks that you can face. While having a conversation with my friend about the different decks that are available, I stumbled across a line of questioning that mainly had to do with deck recognition based off of turn 1 plays. This is very important because proper deck identification can help us determine what role we have to take in the game, how quickly we have to implement our game plan based on that role, and how we sequence our early turn plays.
Legacy as a format has an extremely low "fundamental turn," which is at its core the turn that you will kill your opponent. There are decks that can kill on the first turn, which means picking up on key information to try to identify your opponent's deck is very important and can be the difference between winning and losing, especially if we're playing a deck with cards like and where making decisions on which cards to keep or get rid of will play a huge part in our game plan and success.
If we sit down and think about the number of "viable" decks in Legacy, it's quite a large list. We also have to take into account that as an Eternal format a lot of people will always play the same Legacy deck whether it's considered viable or not. Let's see just how big this list is (in no particular order).
RUG Delver
BUG Delver
U/W/R Delver
U/R Delver
Miracles
Reanimator
Sneak and Show
Omni-Tell
Death and Taxes
Imperial Painter
U/W Stoneblade
Esper Deathblade
Lands
Jund Depths
Elves
Ad Nauseam Tendrils
The Epic Storm
Jund
Dredge
Manaless Dredge
Oops All Spells
Belcher
Goblins
Burn
U/B Tezzeret
BUG Control
Shardless BUG
That is a lot of decks, and I'm sure I missed some!
The last few are considered "fringe" decks, but they are definitely decks that you have to be aware of.
The exercise that I tried with my friend was an interesting one, and it goes a lot deeper than I thought since there are so many different options based on what our opponent does on turn 1. Here is the first scenario I presented my friend with.
"Your opponent is on the play and drops , sacrifices for , and casts . What deck are they playing?"
They paused for a few minutes and answered, "U/W/R Delver."
This was correct, but when I asked them why they came to that particular conclusion, all they could muster was that they saw those cards in my deck and on my registration sheet since I was playing U/W/R Delver that weekend.
When we look at it a bit deeper, we can see why this is the proper conclusion.
What decks play both and ?
RUG Delver, U/W/R Delver, U/R Delver, Omni-Tell, Sneak and Show, ANT, and TES are decks that play both of those cards. That's a lot of decks! How can we narrow it down to just one?
is the answer.
Omni-Tell, Sneak and Show, U/R Delver, and ANT all play basic s in their deck, which cannot find. We can conclude that because of this it's very unlikely that we're playing against any of these decks. This is very important since these are the types of decks that can kill on turn 1 or 2.
RUG Delver plays and ; however, cannot find , which means they definitely don't play it.
It's possible that the opponent is on Miracles since it does play and . But most Miracles lists have been foregoing , so until we see something that points in that direction I would keep Miracles in mind but not focus on it, not to mention that they would probably get a anyway to not expose their to .
This all leaves us with U/W/R Delver, which was correctly identified, but there was a lot more thinking that went along with it. This exercise led me to come up with some more that are very beneficial in helping learn what deck we can put our opponent on based on their turn 1 play.
What could our opponent be on if they lead with , "go?"
This one is pretty interesting because the decks that could possibly start like this are completely different and punish us from different angles.
The decks that play are RUG Delver, Burn, Goblins, Jund, Jund Depths, and Lands.
Many people have been caught by a surprise out of RUG Delver with , "go." The real clue for this matchup will come on turn 2 since all of the other decks besides RUG Delver are extremely proactive and want to be using their fetch lands as soon as they can because they all lack .
Thankfully there aren't any decks that play that we have to worry about killing us on turn 1 or 2, so we can take our time to make sure we get good information. Playing around is very important, so a simple fetch land and pass from us isn't all that bad.
Burn and Goblins are rarely going to just pass on turn 1 after playing a fetch land, whereas Jund, Jund Depths, and Lands are certainly capable of making this line of play but will rarely pass on turn 2 without doing something that will let us in on what they're playing.
In this situation, I like playing it safe and either playing an actual dual land and a spell if we're casting something that is one mana or just simply playing a fetch land and passing.
What could our opponent be on if they lead with , fetch for basic , and cast ?
The big clue here is basic being fetched. This opening leads me to think that they are on Omni-Tell, Sneak and Show, ANT, Reanimator, , or possibly Miracles, but remember that most Miracles lists aren't running .
All of these decks have the capability to kill very early, so we have to make decisions based on what we think they are playing quickly.
This is exactly what happened in one of my feature matches at the SCG Legacy Open in Baltimore when I was on Reanimator. I won the roll and played a fetch land and passed. They dropped a , fetched for basic , and cast . I instantly put them on Omni-Tell and used my to find instead of the standard and promptly won the game after I used on Iona. They could have been on Sneak and Show or the mirror, but I find that most people aren't going to play around if they are on a combo deck with duals in it and will usually just fetch their duals. Even if they aren't on Omni-Tell, getting "Miss Super Booty" Iona into play on turn 2 naming blue against the other decks is still pretty good and should be enough to win.
What can we put our opponent on if they lead with , fetch for , and cast ?
Not Modern, that's for sure.
This is an interesting one because is in quite a few decks so we have to narrow down what shell it's in to help us identify what's important in the matchup.
Decks that have in it are Jund, Esper Deathblade, Elves, BUG Delver, and both BUG Control and Shardless BUG, which are a bit more fringe but definite possibilities.
Neither Jund nor Elves plays , so we can rule out both of those decks (unless Ross Merriam has decided to try to change Elves around without consulting Chris Andersen).
That leaves us with Esper Deathblade, BUG Delver, BUG Control, or Shardless BUG. In order to narrow it down even further, we need to look at the fetch land that searched out the .
! Jinkeys gang, it's a clue!
Based on a finding the , we can conclude that we are more than likely looking at Esper Deathblade. The reason for this is that BUG Delver, BUG Control, and Shardless BUG all play and is unable to search out a . Now, it's possible that they're playing zero and maxed out on and . But that's highly unlikely, and even still they would be playing , , and before choosing .
On the same note with , what are the options if our opponent leads with for ?
The same decks all play , and we can narrow down further to the same decks with along with the . But the fetch land is the key here. is unable to find , which lets us rule out Esper Deathblade and put our opponent on some sort of BUG deck, be it Shardless, Delver, or Control.
What are our options if our opponent leads with , finds , and casts ?
Here we have the same , but rather than being cast off , we have . This lets us narrow the decks down to . . . all of the decks that have in it.
That wasn't very helpful.
The key is to look at the fetch land yet again. lets us narrow it even further to Elves or Jund. None of the BUG decks or Esper Deathblade will be playing , so we can rule those out.
We can even go one step further and try to rule out Elves. Most Elves decks don't play any black spells in their maindeck, so finding a so early doesn't really have any benefit and just exposes them to . More than likely they would get a basic . If they were trying to bait , they would likely get a since they don't even have any abilities in the maindeck that would use the white mana whereas will benefit from the black mana generated by the later in the game. All of this leads me to believe that my opponent is on Jund and to sculpt my early turns accordingly.
There are also a lot of turn 1 plays that immediately give away what we're up against, but we still have to be able to identify them properly. usually indicates Merfolk, Death and Taxes, or some other tribal strategy.
is another land that can tell us what we're up against, and what they do with the land will solidify if it's TES or Dredge. Don't forget that if we lose the die roll and they put us on the play then it's probably Manaless Dredge.
There are a whole slew of decks that are viable in Legacy, and by learning what they are and how you can identify them, we can greatly increase our chances of winning our Legacy matches. The format is full of powerful cards and strategies, and what we do in the first few turns is paramount to our success.
I hope that these exercises will help anyone who is looking to get into the Legacy format but is intimidated by the sheer number of decks that are available. Feel free to post in the comments any interesting turn 1 plays that could be helpful for someone trying to understand the format that I may have missed here. I'm still working with my friend to get them up to speed, so there's a good chance I write more about the things that I'm learning from teaching them since I feel like there are a lot of people who want to play Legacy but haven't dived in yet because of feeling intimidated.
I will be in Nashville this weekend battling some Born of the Gods Standard and Legacy. I'm pretty torn on what I'm going to play in Standard, but there's a good chance that I'll be jamming again for the Legacy portion.
How did the Homeshake project first manifest?
When I went to Montreal I shed my previous pseudonyms. I've never wanted to make music under my own name for whatever reason, so I picked a new fake name for myself, with the idea that I wouldn't aim for anything in particular with it. I was working on a few different things under a few different names, and I think that's stupid. So I just combined everything under a new name and moved on.
It definitely has a focus.
It does at the moment, but I was thinking the other day, Fresh Air feels like the third part of a trilogy. You make a big splash, then it slows down a little, and [Fresh Air] is it being still. Homeshake isn't done, though. I've still got a bunch of stuff lined up for the next thing. I'm always writing, but it will be different than the last three. It's too early to tell, though. I've got a few instrumentals that I'm working on.
I'd like to do an ambient relaxation tape, but I don't really know how I'd do it. Maybe just turn all my synths on and let them go crazy [laughs]. I have produced some beats for a friend of mine, Young Braised from Vancouver, but I'm not sure when he's going to release it. I sent them beats over the span of the year, then they came to Montreal and we finished recording in my bare living room in the apartment I'd just moved into after getting bed bugs. Do not get bed bugs, do everything in your power not to get bedbugs.
Who are some of your influences, production-wise?
J Dilla, they changed the way I thought about music when Donuts finally found me. It changed my perception of what a song is: how long it needs to be, and just the way they used samples and made it like they were actually playing them. Pretty amazing.
Some of the musicians you've cited as inspirations — Prince, D'Angelo, Curtis Mayfield — have delved into explicitly political work. Your Twitter account is almost exclusively activism, but do you have any plans to bring that into your music?
I can't really see myself writing political lyrics or protest songs, at least right now. I think it takes something really special to be able to pull that off. It's something I'm in awe of, like in D'Angelo's Black Messiah album, or Anohni's Hopelessness. Just these stunning, literal protest songs, I don't know if I can do that, but I am in favor of using music as a political tool, like the charity single I put out with Alex Calder. I was really happy about that. We're working on another one, and I'll keep doing stuff like that.
I'm pretty shy talking about political stuff in conversations. There's definitely an anxiety that comes with speaking up about politics while being a white dude and looking like all of the actual terrorists, but I don't think it's acceptable to shy away. It's irresponsible not to use your privilege to try and elicit some kind of positive change. You need to figure out how to be the best version of yourself to make change of yourself. But it doesn't happen on the spot. Hopefully on my deathbed I'll be like ‘good job.'
A lot of kids don't like what I share on Twitter, and get mad at me. But that's great because I don't want people who don't think these are important things to listen to my music, really. When Alex and I posted about our charity on Instagram, someone commented something like “Nobody cares about your politics, bro, just play your tunes.” I looked at their profile and he's like a Breitbart editor or something. If you're a white supremacist, I don't want you here. I don't want you listening to my music if you can't feel empathy or get some kind of good vibes from it.
Your music is, sonically, about as far away from the chaos of the outside world as you can get. It's like a window from it.
I try to make simple music. Not too much going on in it, calm. It's therapeutic for me, making it, and a reflection of how I feel when I'm making it, which is the best.
Are you listening to any new musicians?
A couple of songs on that new Migos record, Mac's new album really speaks to me as well… Dedekind Cut, that new Lorenzo Senni EP, Persona is real good....
I keep forgetting to listen to that because it's not on the streaming platform I use.
Ah, you're a streaming man.
Yeah, what are your thoughts on it?
My main problem with those services is that you can listen to anything you want for free, but with ads inserted into it. If you have free Spotify or something, there are ads inside my record. That makes me sick, honestly. I don't want to be advertising anything. If you're using it for free I'd rather you just ripped a copy of the album for free so no one else makes money off of it. But I don't have a problem with someone listening to my album on Spotify, so long as you're just hearing it, that's all that matters.
Obviously, there's the fact that they're underpaying the artist, people getting 1/100th of a cent for a play. Is that even money? It devalues the art having all this music under one umbrella that you can listen to at anytime. Suddenly you have access to every song in the world? Maybe it seems like those songs don't matter as much anymore. But that could just be a problem music has in the digital age. It's similar to all the news that's out there, this overwhelming abundance of information. That's why we'll turn into androids or whatever eventually, right? [laughs]
One of the most pernicious effects of Jim Crow is that it won't go away. Before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, racist Democrats used the Jim Crow laws to secure their political base by preventing blacks from voting and generally participating in the economic life of the nation. After 1964, progressive Democrats used the Civil Rights Act and affirmative action as a means of wedding blacks to the Democrat party as a reliable voting bloc despite the demonstrable harm done to the social fabric of the nation and of black communities. Now, 50 years after the de jure end of segregation, we are still fighting that battle.
Yesterday, the US Supreme Court heard the case of Fisher versus University of Texas at Austin. The case is really quite simple. The plaintiff, a young woman named Abigail Fisher, was denied admission to UTA in favor of less academically qualified students because they had insufficient melanin. The university argues that “diversity” makes for a better educational experience and that more is good.
Diversity, it must be noted, is nothing more than a code word. The scions of middle-class and upper-middle-class black families, and these are the overwhelming beneficiaries of race-based college admissions programs, bring experiences nearly identical to kids from middle-class and upper-middle-class in terms of experiences. They lived in decent neighborhoods. They went to decent schools. They had parents who were involved in their education. The only difference is skin color or their surname. A university that was really committed to “diversity” would look to admit white kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, and there plenty of them out there, as well as black or Hispanic kids.
The UTA case is very important because, by law, the upper 10% of every high school graduating class gets automatic admission. This accounts for 75% of the incoming first-year student class. Ms. Fisher fell outside that cut line and was competing for one the remaining spaces.
Advocates for a race-based spoils system had a hard day. There are five justices who have consistently opposed racial discrimination in college admissions. In this particular case, Anthony Kennedy's personal fetish for fairness will probably cut against the university.
During the course of the arguments, Justice Scalia made this statement:
In a remark that drew muted gasps in the courtroom, Justice Antonin Scalia said that minority students with inferior academic credentials may be better off at “a less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well.” “I don't think it stands to reason that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible,” they added.
This should be unremarkable. UTA is considered to be one of the “public Ivies,” that is, a public university with an academic reputation on par with any of the left wing hot houses Ivy League private universities. As the top 10 of Texas high school students make up 75% of each class, it stands to reason that the university should choose the very best candidates from among other applicants, because among them will be highly qualified foreign and out-of-state students. Choosing black kids simply because they are black, if they have a mediocre academic record, might make white university administrators feel good about themselves but it is a grave disservice to a student who may not be able to compete.
Predictably, the left pounced.
Justice Scalia Suggests Blacks Belong at “Slower” Colleges
Scalia: Affirmative Action Sends Blacks To Schools Too Advanced For Them
Justice Scalia: minority students may be better off going to ‘lesser schools'
Dishonesty, of course, is its own reward in progressive media.
But there was racism readily apparent in the arguments and the source was Ruth Bader Ginsberg:
But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the top-10 program was itself problematic. “It seems to me that it is so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is race,” they said. “It's totally dependent upon having racially segregated neighborhoods, racially segregated schools, and it operates as a disincentive for a minority student to step out of that segregated community and attempt to get an integrated education.”
This is simply stunning in its paternalism and a shocking revelation.
Let's unpack this. They think the only way a black kid can break into the top 10% of a high school graduating class is if they live in a predominantly black neighborhood and go to a predominantly black school. I say black because no one will ever make that argument about Asian kids. And they also believe that black kids can't even make the cut into the remaining seats at UTA without it being awarded to them based on skin color. And somehow, a kid that gets into that top 10 percent position in one of Ginsburg's “racially segregated school” somehow doesn't get one of them thar “integrated education[s].”
This is what racism looks like. It doesn't wear a hood an burn a cross anymore. It wears black robes, votes Democrat, sits on a bench and declares that blacks are simply inferior and without the federal government they would be well and truly rogered.
It creeps up on you as you sit at your desk. You yawn, scan the web, check Facebook but still the ennui lingers. At some point almost every day we feel bored, at least for a little while. We've all experienced that feeling of listlessness, but what is boredom? Is it not having something exciting to do? Is it being unable to pay attention to what you're doing?
One team of Canadian researchers was apparently interested enough in boredom to find out.
“Intuitively, it is pretty clear that boredom is a common human experience and little research has been done to bear out that fact,” says John Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Toronto.
Eastwood and their colleagues observed that people believe boredom relates to their environment: We think if a lecture or a conversation is boring, we can simply change topics to avoid the dullness.
“We attribute [boredom] with problems in the environment rather than the problems with ourselves,” explains co-researcher Mark Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience and applied cognitive science at the University of Guelph and co-author of the book, “The Winner's Brain.”
But boredom might have more to do with us than uninspired surroundings.
Eastwood and Fenske reviewed descriptions of boredom from existentialist philosophy, psychology and literature and also conducted a study with subjects, where they described how they feel when experiencing ennui. The researchers then crafted a definition encompassing the overlapping ideas from the literature and study. Boredom occurs when we have trouble paying attention to internal and external stimuli needed to enjoy an activity, we realize we struggle to pay attention, and we blame the environment for our lack of enjoyment.
“Our approach is to link [boredom] to attention,” says Fenske. “The fact that we're able to talk about boredom in terms of attention [means] we've already changed the focus.”
Framing ennui in terms of attention is significant because psychologists know how treat attention problems, meaning experts can help people experiencing chronic boredom.
Fenske and Eastwood agree that most people think of boredom as trivial and commonplace, perhaps it's why researchers haven't studied it. But boredom can be a sign of more serious problems.
“Boredom can have some horrible effects and we see it associated with pathological states. [There's a] strong association with depression and boredom and traumatic brain injury and boredom,” notes Fenske. They add that drug and alcohol abuse counselors know that patients relapse when faced with boredom.
“I think that you can think about it in two ways … boredom is related to addiction, gambling, eating problems … or you can think of chronic, protracted boredom as a problem in its own right,” Eastwood says.
While friends often tease the researchers about their boring research, the two believe their findings provide new areas of study.
“I have no data to support this, but I speculate that people might experience a lot of boredom in modern times because we are experiencing intense entertainment. We're used to being passively entertained and that constant stimulation puts us at risk for [more] boredom in the future,” Eastwood says.
The paper, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” appeared in Perspectives on Psychological Science.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey called Hillary Clinton's decision to use a private email server at the State Department and its subsequent implementation “extremely careless.”
“Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or their colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence they were extremely careless in their handling of highly classified information.”
Earlier in the press conference, Comey stated that the investigation had discovered 110 emails across 52 email chains that were classified at the time of sending.

A new report released today has revealed the scale of ISP traffic management practices that result in restrictions to the open Internet. The EU report, which covers 381 ISPs serving in excess of 340 million subscribers, reveals that 21% of fixed-line broadband users across Europe are affected by ISPs restricting P2P traffic, rising to 36% in the mobile market.
Hundreds of ISPs all over the world limit and restrict BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer traffic on their networks, and Europe is no exception. A new EU report sheds light on how common these practices are.
The report was initiated in 2011 following requests from the European Commission addressed to BEREC, the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications. The aim was to gather information relating to the net neutrality debate, specifically regarding actions taken by ISPs to hinder, throttle, block or degrade Internet traffic.
A questionnaire was sent to out to ISPs across Europe and in the end responses from a total of 381 ISPs were considered, 266 ‘fixed line' ISPs (140 million subscribers) and 115 mobile operators (200 million subscribers).
Among other things they were asked about their traffic management practices in respect of a range of objectives including preserving quality of service, contractual agreements with customers, network security, and other measures required by legal order.
Perhaps unsurprisingly the most frequently reported restrictions outside simple contractual data-capping concerned the blocking and/or throttling of peer-to-peer and VoIP traffic. A total of 49 fixed-line ISPs reported interfering with P2P, as did 41 mobile operators.
While the restrictions affect at least 20% of all subscribers, the report notes that the impact on end users can vary. Some ISPs restrict all of their users, some just a percentage. Others restrict traffic during certain times of the day, while some have contractual restrictions that are not necessarily enforced technically.
Overall, in the fixed-line broadband market at least 21% of users are affected by P2P restrictions, either technically or by clauses in their contracts. In the mobile market that figure is 36%. When it comes to VoIP related restrictions, at least 21% of the mobile market faces restrictions with the possibility of an additional 18% depending on conditions.
The findings of the study will be used in the ongoing Open Internet debate in Europe. Earlier this year the Netherlands was the first country to sign Net Neutrality principles into law, which would restrict the use of P2P-throttling by ISPs. In the European Parliament the Greens are proposing to guarantee Net Neutrality in the rest of Europe too.

EasyDNS Tries To Balance Bogus Requests To Take Down Legit Foreign Online Pharmacies Against Truly Rogue Pharmacies
from the not-an-easy-balance dept
So in one case we have people allegedly pirating Honey Boo Boo reruns and on the other we have people dying. We don't know where exactly, but the line goes somewhere in between there.
We have always done summary takedowns on net abuse issues, spam, botnets, malware etc. It seems reasonable that a threat to public health or safety that has been credibly vetted fits in the same bucket.
As a private company we feel within our rights to set limits and boundaries on what kinds of business risk we are willing to take on and under what circumstances. Would we tell the US State Department to go to hell if they wanted us to take down ZeroHedge? Absolutely. Do we want to risk criminally indicted by the FDA because of unregulated drug imports? Not so much.
We've written a few times about domain registrar/hosting company EasyDNS , which has been pretty vocal about how law enforcement and industry groups have recently started targeting registrars and hosting comapnies as "the soft underbelly" for censorship and coercive control. While we've covered this issue frequently as it relates to things like copyright, the real ground zero for this may be around online pharmacies. The online pharmacy space is a bit complicated -- because there are really a few different kinds. There are US-based accredited/approved pharmacies, there are overseas accredited/approved online pharmacies... and then there are flat-out rogue pharmacies dealing in illegally obtained or counterfeit medicines. Obviously the last one is in a different category altogether from the first two, but US drug companies like to conflate legal foreign online pharmacies with the rogue ones.For years, there have been fights over the issue of "gray market" and "re-imported" drugs. The most common case involves Canadian pharmacies, which are perfectly legitimate, selling into the US, but at prices much cheaper than the drug companies would like (undercutting the prices charged by American pharmacies). Fake and dangerous drugs from rogue pharmacies are a real (if relatively small) problem. Legitimate foreign pharmacies selling into the US at cheaper prices are a made up problem by US drug companies. But those US drug companies like to take the "small" problem, and blame it on any non-US pharmacy in an attempt to block out the competition. This has been going on for years , but has ramped up recently.We've written about how the big drug companies recently got control over the .pharmacy domain, and the indications are that they're planning to use it to block out legitimate foreign pharmacies by arguing that only online pharmacies with a .pharmacy domain are "legit" and then banning legitimate foreign pharmacies from getting the domain. Earlier this year, we also wrote about the lobbying group, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, telling registrars that if they complain about a site , it must be taken down.Mixed in with all of this is the somewhat questionable setup of an operation called "LegitScript," which is an organization that claims to verify which pharmacies are legit. The history of "LegitScript" is, involving a former White House official who specifically worked to block legitimate Canadian pharmacies from sending drugs to the US, and who then immediately went off to form LegitScript as a competitor to PharmacyChecker -- a similar service that verifies online pharmaciesCanadian pharmacies. Oh, and the "immediately" in the last sentence may be inaccurate as the guy, John Horton, appears to have registered the domain for LegitScript while they were still a federal government employee... Either way, the US pharma industry has worked hard to make LegitScript the standard while pushing back on PharmacyChecker.Back to EasyDNS: the company has been fighting off these demands to shut down sites repeatedly, saying that it will only do so with a court order. After getting into a fight with the US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over demands to take down a bunch of domains, EasyDNS finally agreed to take down a site , after being provided with evidence that it was truly a rogue pharmacy, and someone had died from taking drugs ordered from that site. Because of this EasyDNS has adjusted its policy, saying that if you are selling drugs, you have to prove to EasyDNS that you have a license to do so, or be approved byLegitScriptPharmacyChecker (meaning that it will allow legitimate foreign pharmacies to exist). EasyDNS is still standing up to bogus requests (including new ones from the City of London Police) to take down websites, but is being more proactive when an online pharmacy has no signs of being legitimate.While some people complained about EasyDNS's new policy, the company's CEO Mark Jeftovic explained it as follows (after referencing the latest copyright takedown demand from the City of London Police):He also notes, as we did, how FedEx was recently indicted over deliveries from questionable online pharmacies, and notes that it's only a matter of time until criminal charges are filed against a registrar or hosting company as well.These are not easy decisions for anyone -- though, I have to imagine that truly "rogue" pharmacies are increasingly moving to the darknet and underground markets anyway. However, while some may disagree, there does seem to be a reasonable argument for why a registrar like EasyDNS decides it really doesn't want to be involved with clearly rogue pharmacies.

The Russian Consulate in Brazil has denied media reports that one of its diplomats, a 60-year-old Brazilian national, used their jiu-jitsu skills to subdue a robber and dramatically shoot them point blank using the attacker's own gun in the middle of the street in Rio de Janeiro.
“Information circulating in the Brazilian press about the alleged shooting ... of a Brazilian national by a Russian diplomat during an armed robbery does not reflect reality,” Consul General of the Russian Federation in Rio de Janeiro, Vladimir Tokmakov told TASS.

All Russian diplomats and security guards of the diplomatic mission are well and “had nothing to do” with the incident described in media reports, the Council General added.
At the same time, Tokmakov said that they cannot “rule out” that whoever was involved in the reported incident could have introduced themselves as a member of diplomatic staff.
Russian diplomat drags robber into their car and shoots them dead near #Rio2016https://t.co/XPv3UjiuUQ — Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) August 4, 2016
Earlier, several media outlets reported that a 60-year-old vice-consul in Rio de Janeiro, Marcos Cesar Feres Braga, was dramatically shot dead in an armed robbery near Rio's Olympic Park on Thursday morning.

The incident reportedly happened as the alleged diplomat was stuck in traffic at the Avenida das Americas in Barra da Tijuca and a mugger approached the car by motorbike.
The perpetrator allegedly broke the car window to gain access to the driver, demanding they hand over their watch. Using, what some media reported to be jiu-jitsu skills, the impostor diplomat allegedly grabbed the robber and pulled them into their BMW X6. In a tussle that followed, the impersonator got a hold of the attacker's gun and shot them dead.
The body of the assailant, identified as Leonardo Lopes Batista, was displayed for hours on the road as the investigation continued. The unpleasant tableau was seen by numerous Olympic delegations as they arrived at Rio's Olympic Park ahead of the Summer 2016 Olympic Games which begin Friday.
Update: The Giants official statement is as follows: "He was expressing their personal view, and that is not the view of the Giants organization."
EAST RUTHERFORD — The Giants have replaced Charles Way, their director of player development, with a former receiver quite familiar to the fan base.
David Tyree, owner of the famous Super Bowl helmet catch, will hit the ground running this week and do their best to fill the big shoes left behind by Way, who took a job in the NFL's league office earlier this month.
“I'm overwhelmed with joy,” Tyree said in a statement released by the team. “I guess you could say it's a second homecoming. I'm grateful to have an experience with Charles Way, seeing their growth, their maturity as a professional. It even, to some degree, has impacted my life personally as a professional. Then having this opportunity to fill those shoes, I'm just grateful for the foundation that's been laid, I'm grateful to be an example and hopefully represent this great organization in the same light and continue the great atmosphere and tradition of a wonderful organization with a premier culture. I'm just thrilled to get in here and serve these players.”
Tyree had spent the past two seasons working in player development at the league office.
But as familiar as Tyree is with fans for their catch, they are more recently known for some controversial remarks about gay marriage. Tyree, who was interviewed by National Organization for Marriage, a faith-based anti-gay marriage group, had this to say back in 2011:
"This will be the beginning of our country sliding toward ... it's a strong word, but anarchy."
Tyree went as far as to say he'd trade their famous catch for an end to gay marriage, which also made waves back in 2011.
They come to a position of player guidance during the first season where an openly gay player is on an NFL roster, a move by Michael Sam that will undoubtedly change the landscape for years to come. Will Tyree's viewpoints have an impact on that? How will Giants players supportive of Sam view the move?
There are plenty of questions to be raised here given the high profile Tyree has been given within the organization.

If China really is trying to drive down its currency in any meaningful way to gain trade advantage, the world faces an extremely dangerous moment.
Such desperate behaviour would send a deflationary shock through a global economy already reeling from near recession earlier this year, and would risk a repeat of East Asia's currency crisis in 1998 on a larger planetary scale.
China's fixed investment reached $5 trillion last year, matching the whole of Europe and North America combined. This is the root cause of chronic overcapacity worldwide, from shipping, to steel, chemicals and solar panels.
A Chinese devaluation would export yet more of this excess supply to the rest of us. It is one thing to do this when global trade is expanding: it amounts to beggar-thy-neighbour currency warfare to do so in a zero-sum world with no growth at all in shipping volumes this year.
It is little wonder that the first whiff of this mercantilist threat has set off an August storm, ripping through global bourses. The Bloomberg commodity index has crashed to a 13-year low.
Europe and America have failed to build up adequate safety buffers against a fresh wave of imported deflation. Core prices are rising at a rate of barely 1pc on both sides of the Atlantic, a full six years into a mature economic cycle.
One dreads to think what would happen if we tip into a global downturn in these circumstances, with interest rates still at zero, quantitative easing played out, and aggregate debt levels 30 percentage points of GDP higher than in 2008.
"The world economy is sailing across the ocean without any lifeboats to use in case of emergency," said Stephen King from HSBC in a haunting report in May.
Whether or not Beijing sees matters in this light, it knows that the US Congress would react very badly to any sign of currency warfare by a country that racked up a record trade surplus of $137bn in second quarter, an annual pace above 5pc of GDP. Only deficit states can plausibly justify resorting to this game.
Senators Schumer, Casey, Grassley, and Graham have all lined up to accuse Beijing of currency manipulation, a term that implies retaliatory sanctions under US trade law.
Any political restraint that Congress might once have felt is being eroded fast by evidence of Chinese airstrips and artillery on disputed reefs in the South China Sea, just off the Philippines.
It is too early to know for sure whether China has in fact made a conscious decision to devalue. Bo Zhuang from Trusted Sources said there is a "tug-of-war" within the Communist Party.
All the central bank (PBOC) has done so far is to switch from a dollar peg to a managed float. This is a step closer towards a free market exchange, and has been welcomed by the US Treasury and the International Monetary Fund.
The immediate effect was a 1.84pc fall in the yuan against the dollar on Tuesday, breathlessly described as the biggest one-day move since 1994. The PBOC said it was a merely "one-off" technical adjustment.
If so, one might also assume that the PBOC would defend the new line at 6.32 to drive home the point. What is faintly alarming is that the central bank failed to do so, letting the currency slide a further 1.6pc on Wednesday before reacting.
The PBOC put out a soothing statement, insisting that "currently there is no basis for persistent depreciation" of the yuan and that the economy is in any case picking up. So take your pick: conspiracy or cock-up.
The proof will now be in the pudding. The PBOC has $3.65 trillion reserves to prevent any further devaluation for the time being. If it does not do so, we may legitimately suspect that the State Council is in charge and has opted for covert currency warfare.
Personally, I doubt that this is the start of a long slippery slide. The risks are too high. Chinese companies have borrowed huge sums in US dollars on off-shore markets to circumvent lending curbs at home, and these are typically the weakest firms shut off from China's banking system.
Hans Redeker from Morgan Stanley says short-term dollar liabilities reached $1.3 trillion earlier this year. "This is 9.5pc of Chinese GDP. When short-term foreign debt reaches this level in emerging markets it is a perfect indicator of coming stress. It is exactly what we saw in the Asian crisis in the 1990s," they said.
Devaluation would risk setting off serious capital flight, far beyond the sort of outflows seen so far - with estimates varying from $400bn to $800bn over the last five quarters.
This could spin out of control easily if markets suspect that Beijing is itself fanning the flames. While the PBOC could counter outflows by running down reserves - as it is already doing to a degree, at a pace of $15bn a month - such a policy entails automatic monetary tightening and might make matters worse.
The slowdown in China is not yet serious enough to justify such a risk. True, the trade-weighted exchange rate has soared 22pc since mid-2012, the result of being strapped to a rocketing dollar at the wrong moment. The yuan is up 60pc against the Japanese yen.
This loss of competitiveness has been painful - and is getting worse as the shrinking supply of migrant labour from the countryside pushes up wages - but it was not the chief cause of the crunch in the first half of the year.
The economy hit a brick wall because monetary and fiscal policy were too tight. The authorities failed to act as falling inflation pushed one-year borrowing costs in real terms from zero in 2011 to 5pc by the end of 2014.
They also failed to anticipate a “fiscal cliff” earlier this year as official revenue from land sales collapsed, and local governments were prohibited from bank borrowing -- understandably perhaps given debts of $5 trillion, on some estimates.
The calibrated deleveraging by premier Li Keqiang simply went too far. They have since reversed course.
The local government bond market is finally off the ground, issuing $205bn of new debt between May and July. This is serious fiscal stimulus.
Nomura says monetary policy is now as loose as in the depths of the post-Lehman crisis. Its 'growth surprise index' for China touched bottom in May and is now signalling a “strong rebound”.
Capital Economics said bank loans jumped to 15.5pc in June, the fastest pace since 2012. "There are already signs that policy easing is gaining traction," it said.
It is worth remembering that the authorities are no longer targeting headline growth. Their lode star these days is employment, a far more relevant gauge for the survival of the Communist regime.
On this score, there is no great drama. The economy generated 7.2m extra jobs in the first half half of 2015, well ahead of the 10m annual target.
Few dispute that China is in trouble. Credit has been stretched to the limit and beyond. The jump in debt from 120pc to 260pc of GDP in seven years is unprecedented in any major economy in modern times.
For sheer intensity of credit excess, it is twice the level of Japan's Nikkei bubble in the late 1980s, and I doubt that it will end any better.
At least Japan was already rich when it let rip. China faces much the same demographic crisis before it crosses the development threshold.
It is in any case wrestling with an impossible contradiction: aspiring to hi-tech growth on the economic cutting edge, yet under top-down Communist party control and spreading repression.
That way lies the middle income trap, the curse of all authoritarian regimes that fail to reform in time.
Yet this is a story for the next fifteen years. The Communist Party has not yet run out of stimulus and is clearly deploying the state banking system to engineer yet another mini-cycle right now.
One day China will pull the lever and nothing will happen. We are not there yet.
Hyun Soo Kim signed with the Orioles before last season on a two-year deal. They struggled mightily in spring training and because of the nature of their contract, the major league team was forced to roster him. After just 17 plate appearances in April, they became a decent semi-regular in the lineup. The left-handed hitter got on the strong side of a platoon with Joey Rickard or Nolan Reimold being the other half.
They became a decent fantasy option in daily transaction leagues by posting a .329/.410/.454 in until July 10th when they went on the DL with a hamstring injury. After the injury, they hit only .275/.353/.386. The second half numbers are decent numbers, but not as good as before the injury.
With the new StatCast data, I examined it to determine if there was a drop in Kim's exit velocity around the time of the injury. Using a 10-day rolling average, the available data may not look like it but the rolling average generally stays around 7 mph of the overall average. Additionally, there was no huge pattern change around the time of the injury.
The problem is that StatCast is not able to collect all the available data as documented at FanGraphs and The Hardball Times. The missing data is normal weak groundballs or high infield popups. I am not going to regurgitate the reasons and the exact details from the previous articles but I am going to take a step forward in accounting for the missing data.
For those who don't care about the exact details on the correction procedure, go ahead and skipped to the next paragraph. Hello to the nerds who stayed around. To fill in the missing data, I found the average value for all detected batted balls types (e.g. line drives, groundballs, etc) fielded by each position on the field. If data is missing for a play, I just inserted the average value from the known plays. The procedure I used is actually fairly simple and could be improved later. I feel though having the average exit velocity for a popup to the 2nd baseman is better than no value at all.
Kim put 255 balls in play with 41 of them not having an association exit velocity. I inserted the historic average value into the missing values and here is a graph with the corrected and uncorrected data.
The change is quite drastic with a 5 mph difference between the two reported values. Kim really struggled coming back from the hamstring injury with the missing values bringing down their batted ball average by almost 10 mph.
Here is a graph showing the batted balls with StatCast values and those which were inserted into the missing values.
The difference can be seen with all the missing values being plays with average exit velocities under 80 mph.
The difference with just this one player is enough for me to suspect the average velocities given for any player, pitcher or hitter (more on this later). StatCast seems fine in detecting the eye-opening power but is missing the light contact. Missing the light contact is even more important when determining if pitchers can limit hard contact since not even close to all the weak contact is being accounted for.
Getting back to Kim, some of their second half struggles could be related to returning from the DL too soon. Eventually, they started making decent contact until the last half month when their production tanked.
As for Kim's 2017 projection, I am not as bullish on their power as Steamer (14 HR), speed (5 SB), and playing time (490 PA). The rest of the stats lineup in my opinion. I will go with the following projection.
.282 AVG, .352 OBP, 400 PA, 50 Runs, 44 RBI, 10 HR, 2 SB

Mr. Pane, who acknowledged their past legal problems, said on Saturday that they had no bearing on their work as an employee for Bio-Recovery. The revelations were first reported by BuzzFeed. Though Mr. Pane is listed as the operator of the company on Environmental Protection Agency records, they said they had no ownership stake in the company and that their role included technical and public relations responsibilities.
Mr. Pane said they changed the spelling of their surname to Pain, but the E.P.A. records and court papers filed by Mr. Cuomo's office related to the fraud charges use only Pane. Officials with Comptroller Scott M. Stringer's office said on Saturday that because the cleanup contract for Dr. Spencer's apartment was handled on an emergency basis, the city's request was reviewed only preliminarily before the work began. The comptroller's office gave prior approval for the cleanup work, for up to $500,000, and was aware that Bio-Recovery would do the work. Eric Sumberg, a spokesperson for the comptroller's office, said in a statement on Saturday: “This office has no tolerance for corruption. When we receive this contract for registration we will take all steps necessary to ensure that this vendor has the integrity to do business with the city.”
A spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, Phil Walzak, said that city health officials inspected Dr. Spencer's apartment after the cleanup and reviewed the company's waste disposal practices. They said that all work was found to have been safely completed.
Messages left at Bio-Recovery on Saturday were not returned.
Though Bio-Recovery has done about 10 jobs for the city in the last six years, Mr. Walzak said, its work has been limited enough that it reported only basic business information to the city. Mr. Pane's name is not in the city's vetting system, Mr. Walzak said.
They wrote in an email that “Bio-Recovery has not received any further work from the city as we review this situation.”
There have been just five convictions for hate crime in Ireland in the last three decades, new figures show.
Ireland has one piece of hate crime legislation, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. The Act makes it an offence to create or distribute racist, homophobic or other discriminatory materials. Offenders face a maximum of two years in prison and a fine of €10,000.
According to documents released by the Courts Service under the Freedom of Information Act, there have been 44 prosecutions under the Act since 2000, of which five resulted in convictions.
The Courts Service said figures from before 2000 are not available. However, the Department of Justice said in 2000 that no convictions had been recorded before that date.
Fianna Fáil has introduced a Private Members' Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas. The Department of Justice has indicated it is also considering a reform of legislation.
Anti-discrimination campaigners say the figures show the current legislation is not fit for purpose and that much broader hate-crime legislation is required at a time when racist incidents are on the rise.
Anti-Muslim incidents
A recent survey by the Immigrant Council of Ireland said there were 240 reports of racist incidents in 2015, an 11 per cent rise from the previous year. About 40 per cent of these incidents were against Muslims.
Since 2000, only two people have been imprisoned under the 1989 legislation, one for a month in 2012 and one for four months in 2014. One person received a fine and two others were sworn to keep the peace.
Of the 44 cases, 22 were struck out or dismissed by the court and seven were withdrawn by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The new figures show the current law is “not fit for purpose”, said Shane O'Curry of the European Network against Racism Ireland.“This view is shared by several international monitoring bodies. What we need in not incitement to hatred legislation, but actual hate-crime legislation.”
Mr O'Curry said new laws are needed to stiffen the penalties for racially motivated criminal acts, threats and vandalism, and to send a message to minorities “that we've got your backs”.
Currently, racially motivated attacks and vandalism are mostly prosecuted as ordinary assaults or acts of criminal damage, although judges can take racist motivations into account when sentencing.
Risk to minorities
“Hate-crime legislation sends a signal to society that this behaviour is not acceptable. It's a way of mitigating the very real risk minorities feel when they go into public spaces,” Mr O'Curry said.
The difficulties in enforcing the law were highlighted in a 2011 case where Patrick Kissane, of Knockasartnett, Killarney, was charged with inciting hatred by creating an anti-Traveller Facebook page.
It featured posts suggesting that Traveller babies should be used as “shark bait” as well as at feeding times in the zoo. Another phrase suggested Travellers could be used for testing new drugs for viruses. Two members of the Traveller community in Kerry made a formal complaint to gardaí.
However the case was dismissed by a District Court judge who ruled there was reasonable doubt there was an intent to incite hatred towards Travellers. Judge James O'Connor noted that while the comments made on Facebook were “obnoxious and revolting”, they were a once-off and Mr Kissane had issued an apology.
For relief workers in Nepal after the massive earthquake on April 25, one of the challenges is just knowing where to go: Most roads and buildings don't exist on a map. But that's a situation that's changing, hour by hour, as thousands of volunteers around the world build a detailed digital atlas of the earthquake zone as part of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT).
Volunteers use aerial images from satellites to mark open spaces where helicopters or planes might land with supplies, highlight streets between towns and villages, and outline buildings that aid groups can use to guess where victims might be. Using OpenStreetMap technology–known as the “Wikipedia of maps”–they build continuously updated maps that can be used online or downloaded into navigation devices.
72 hours after, thousands of amateurs have mapped something like 30,000 buildings.
Just two hours after the earthquake hit, the organization's coordinators in the U.S. were getting emails from a partner group in Nepal, Kathmandu Living Lab. “They laid out districts and villages that needed mapping because they were getting all of these reports of awful damage and casualties,” says Blake Girardot, activation coordinator of HOT and vice president of the organization's board.
Thanks to some foresight, the group had already worked on maps of most of the capital city. “Half of our mission is response to crises like this, so when something awful happens we can jump on it and start giving them data they need,” says Girardot. “But the other half of the equation is preparing for these disasters. It's not a mystery where vulnerable places are. In places with earthquakes, floods, drought, or political conflict, we can start identifying those places ahead of time and start doing mapping before the crisis happens.”
Since Nepal was identified as a vulnerable location by the World Bank and other organizations, HOT began mapping Nepal a few years ago, and helped set up Kathmandu Living Lab to work on the project locally. The group is working quickly to map out the remaining areas of the disaster zone.
“Seventy two hours after this happened, thousands of people who are amateurs at this or brand new to it have mapped something like 30,000 100,000 buildings,” says Girardot.
The group is looking for more volunteers. It's possible to learn what to do–and start helping–in less than an hour. “If you can use a computer and mouse, after 45 minutes, you can really be contributing data that's literally saving lives,” they say.
Florida is where circus people from all over the country go to spend the winter. And, watching the primary results from that state come in tonight, I'm struck that it also seems to be the place where the GOP's famous Big Tent has finally turned into a three-ring circus in its own right.
It's an apt metaphor. The genius of the conservative emergence during the 1970s was in the way it reached out to three large, deeply discontented tribes, and brought them all together under Lee Atwater's "big tent" -- which quickly turned into a red-striped big top full of the most bizarre acts anyone had ever seen. In its 20-year heyday, the whole dazzling circus was a blur of non-stop noise and glitter bouncing and glinting across three rings, three different shows -- and three sets of supporters each contributing something essential to the success of the Greatest Show in Politics.
In Ring Number One, there were the economic conservatives. Mostly business owners, some from Wall Street, others from Main Street, they were all about low taxes, free markets, and liberating themselves from any kind of government oversight or regulation. Their daring bull-and-bear act brought in the money, the media, the connections, and the organizational skill.
In Ring Number Two, there were the social conservatives -- not just evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, but also conservative Catholics and Jews...and, oh, yes, how can we possibly forget the Mormons? This group -- let's call them the klown kollege -- brought the energy and passion, giving the whole thing the spirit of a holy crusade. They could make you laugh. They could make you cry. And when they opened the trunks of those tiny cars, they could turn out foot soldiers by the millions -- and voters by the tens of millions.
And in Ring Number Three were the security and defense conservatives -- the minions of the military-industrial complex. They were daredevils and acrobats, with big cannons and high-divers and brave flying men who worked without a rope. They brought a certain manly swagger, a virility that dazzled the other two groups and appealed to their deep need for dominance and control. And, through long experience in Washington, they knew more than anybody about how to defy gravity and make government do triple backflips on their command.
You've gotta hand it to the GOP for being able to keep these three acts playing the same big tent for 30 long years. It wasn't easy to keep them all together in the same close canvas quarters without hissy fights breaking out, fur and blood flying, tusks and whips and claws shredding new exits through which one or another could flee. Even worse: keeping this motley show on the road required that the party twist itself around into a truly preposterous assortment of logical and philosophical contortions. Just a short list of the headliners will give you some idea:
-- Get the government off our backs (the core demand of economic cons) -- except, of course, to micro-legislate every detail of life, death, birth, sex, love, and marriage (a non-negotiable for social cons).
-- Dismantle government and cut taxes to nothing (the economic cons again) versus "strong defense" (a code phrase for: we'll fund whatever the security/military conservatives can possibly dream up, plus some stuff they haven't even thought of yet).
-- Restore a culture of "personal responsibility" (social and smaller-business economic conservatives) versus corporate welfare and the elimination of every mechanism of oversight or accountability (which was was the whole reason the military and large-business cons were in the game in the first place).
That's a game everyone in the cheap seats can play, too (see you in the comments -- and don't forget the popcorn!). But, amid all the twisted logic, there were a few straight and sturdy poles that held the roof up -- things they all agreed on, and gave them the incentive to keep the act together.
For example: all three groups had their own reasons for wanting to expand the empire and establish American dominance around the world. The economic cons wanted globalization: bigger markets and cheap labor. The social cons wanted government backing for their holy mandate to spread the Good News to every corner of the earth. And the military cons wanted an empire that would justify their continued bloated existence, forever and ever, amen.
In all three, this shared desire for global conquest was accompanied by a fundamental contempt for those about to be conquered -- an assurance of superiority that expressed itself an extreme level of racism, sexism, and religious bigotry that they didn't always try quite hard enough to conceal.
They were also bound together by various degrees of distrust of democracy. Economic cons despised government constraints, regulations, and taxes. Leave us alone, they barked in their fast-talking carney come-on patter-- and we'll take care of everything government does, and do more of it, and do it better. Social cons recognized democracy as a competing ideology -- the latest incarnation of every devil they'd fought since the Enlightenment dawned. Military cons were, ironically, some of democracy's biggest cheerleaders -- well, except for all this lefty/Commie/peacenik/Islamofascist agitators calling their budgets into question and naively insisting that they still had civil liberties during wartime. The only thing to do with such traitors is to lock 'em up -- and fortunately, this group held the keys to the tiger cages out back behind the tent, and the power to disappear those they deemed insufficiently respectful of their prowess.
Mostly, they were bound together by an authoritarian streak wider than than the stretched-out butt of Karl Rove's favorite sharkskin suit -- a desperate sense of insecurity that drove their grasping hands to seek control over anything, everything, everyone, within reach, out of reach, until they ran the whole world. Only when every nation and market is under American control, every church is Christian, every street corner has a video camera, and every citizen is safely under the surveillance of a watchful authority checking their behavior, can they, and the rest of the country, be completely safe. Until then, those hands will keep grasping. Because, in the end, the cause that binds them together most strongly is the promise that someday, they'll pacify their tormented personal demons by finally, at long last, being In Total Control Of It All.
Over time, some weird alliances formed. The corporate and military-industrial cons played a lot of golf and joined each other's boards. The religious cons embraced the free market as the Bible's ordained economic order; and they also fell in love with the military and started buying up Warrior Jesus Action Figures. The military cons began to make it clear that getting right with God was at least as important as combat experience for anyone who hoped to be promoted. In a few quiet corners of the Big Tent, at least, things got pretty cozy.
Still, the tensions never went entirely away -- and you have to pity the poor Republican presidential candidates who aspired to be the ringleader in charge of this three-ring circus. You couldn't make it to the White House with just one or two of these acts under the whip; you had to get all three lined up and ready to perform at your command. Furthermore, that thin handful of shared beliefs that held the roof up -- imperialism, racism, antipathy to democracy, militarism, and authoritarianism -- was absolutely unacceptable to the vast majority of Americans; so you couldn't put any of that rigging out there where the voters might chance to see it.
So you learned to talk in code, and to distract and dazzle with fine lies and bright lights and shadow; and to master the fine art of "message discipline." The common ground a candidate could stand on was so very small: one tiny tip in one direction or another, and you'd risk saying something stupid that would alienate one of the other two groups. So you stuck to the short list of topics you could safely discuss in public -- low taxes, limited government, personal responsibility, and strong defense -- while tossing a few winks on the sly to the religionists and the racists. Talking about anything else in more detail was likely to start a brawl. Addressing any specific issues, unless you could draw a direct link to one of the few allowed talking points, was a quick way to find yourself on the curly end of the hook.
It was a hell of a juggling act, and a lot of smart candidates fell into obscurity because they simply couldn't keep the action going. A few of them simply refused to step out there and try. In fact, in the end, only Reagan and the two Bushes could pull it all together into a show the paying customers would pony up to see.
Which brings us to 2008. Looking at the last men standing, it's obvious that the GOP's Big Top has grown dangerously shabby -- and may be on the verge of falling into total disarray. The three remaining primary candidates have each won over exactly one of the three core constituencies, leaving the party with three separate one-ring circuses, each with its own ringleader. And each one of the three candidates is absolutely despised by one of the other groups; and not much liked by the other.
The economic cons have Mitt, whom the military cons don't really know, and the religions ones openly revile. The religious cons have Huck, whom the military has no reason to trust; and whose overt populism gives the economic cons a bad case of the vapors. The security cons have McCain, whom the economic cons mistrust deeply, and who won't even try to convince the religious cons that he's one of their own.
Somehow, between now and August, the Republicans are going to have to choose one candidate to stand in the center ring. The three-way split is so strong that it's quite possible that it will only end in a very contentious brokered convention. And the odds are good that, even then, whoever ends up with the job will have only half-hearted support at best from the other two factions. In fact, whoever wins, it seems possible that at least one of the remaining acts will strike the set and sit this tour out entirely.
They're already packing up. It's common knowledge among political strategists on both sides that the GOP is pulling back its energies to the local and state levels for this election, hoping to regroup and re-emerge in 2012. (Apparently, Howard Dean's 50-state strategy -- which has revolutionized Democratic organizing this year -- has left them under-organized at this level; part of their job will be to develop something that can compete with it.) But putting the act back together in four years may not be as easy as assembling national voter files, training up a new generation of candidates, and building a big new tent in the hopes that they will come. Agendas on all three sides are changing. New ideas and priorities are emerging. Bad blood is being spilled.
If the split between these three factions is left to widen -- and especially if it only ends in a viciously-fought brokered convention -- it could make it very hard for anyone to put it all back together as a single coherent traveling show for a very long time.
After all, the three-ring circus itself has fallen out of fashion -- blown back into history by a stylish, young, energetic new upstart called Cirque du Soleil, which reinvented the entire art form for the first time in over a century. And, in our fondest hopes, perhaps that's what we're hoping the Democrats will become: one big ring, filled with dozens of unexpected acts that explode with creativity, diversity, compassion, and imagination, constantly challenging and re-defining our ideas of what's humanly possible....and doing it all without a net, without a hitch, and without much in the way of a ringmaster at all.
If you would like to see the illustrated version of Mark Haddon's collection of short stories, The Pier Falls, step away from the Add-to-Basket button and head to your local bookshop. If you still have one, that is. Talking at the Cheltenham Literary festival about their book, which came out in May, Haddon said: “Much as we love Amazon, we like bookshops much more, don't we? So we did an edition that is only available in physical, bricks-and-mortar bookshops. It was a way of saying: go and buy from a bookshop. Go into a real bookshop and buy it off some real people.” Amazon, they added, is “a merciless commercial engine. Also because of the way it treats its staff. The way it treats its competitors.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Haddon offers an illustrated version of their book in bricks-and-mortar bookshops.
Haddon isn't the only author to push back against Amazon. Waterstones, with its power as a chain, often has exclusive deals that give readers extra content. It sold an exclusive hardback edition of John Le Carré's The Night Manager, with an afterword by the author; Helen Macdonald and Joanne Harris both wrote extra chapters for their respective books H is for Hawk and Peaches for Monsieur le Curé; and Ian Rankin's latest Rebus novel gave Waterstones buyers an extra character study. On a more Haddon-esque crusade is the children's writer and illustrator Allan Ahlberg, who refused a Book Trust lifetime achievement award because it was sponsored by Amazon. They called the company “immoral”, particularly its history of tax avoidance, writing in a letter to The Bookseller magazine: “Tax, fairly applied to us all, is a good thing. It pays for schools, hospitals – libraries!”
The dilemma for most authors, says Marie Moser, who runs The Edinburgh Bookshop, “is that so many consumers click to order, without thinking about the implications of taxation and, if an author said they were never dealing with Amazon again, they'd be in big trouble.” Haddon's stance, says Moser, “is a very generous gesture”. Can exclusive content offered by well-known authors help physical bookshops survive? “I would like to think it would. It makes people think: ‘I should go to my bookshop and get it.' We cannot compete on price [with Amazon] and nor do I want to play that silly game, therefore I think it has got to be a good idea. Even the fact they are talking very publicly about the importance of local bookshops is a great thing.”
Metropolitan police say officer is in stable condition after shooting in Hackney, with one man arrested at the scene
A police officer is in hospital in stable condition after being shot during an anti-gang operation in east London, Scotland Yard said.
Shots were fired as the Metropolitan police's specialist firearms unit SCO19 carried out an operation at 12.45pm in Scriven Street, Hackney. A 31-year-old man was arrested at the scene after police raided a terrace house in Phoenix Close.
The officer was apparently shot as they chased the gunman during the armed raid. Pictures from the scene which the Guardian chose not to publish show the officer with a bloody bandage on their back below their left shoulder.
Met Commander Duncan Ball said officers were seeking to recover a weapon and detain those in possession of it, when the officer was shot.
“During the operation, a firearm was discharged, wounding a male detective constable,” said Ball. “He was treated at the scene and taken to an east London hospital where I am pleased to confirm they are now in a stable condition. At this early stage it has been established the officer received a gunshot wound through the shoulder during the operation - and an investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”

“We were called to a police incident near Haggerston Road in Haggerston,” a London ambulance service spokesperson said. “We sent a number of resources to the scene including an incident officer and London's air ambulance.
“We treated one patient who was taken as a priority to hospital by air.”
A resident of Loanda Close, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said they witnessed the shooter clamber across rooftops away from police.
“I was in my living room watching TV when I saw a load of armed officers outside my house,” they said. “A black man appeared in the window opposite. They ordered them to remain inside but they threw something out the window.
“The next thing I know I see them running over the rooftops. I then heard a loud bang. A single bang coming from Scriven Street.
“I now know an officer was shot and it was gang crime related. It's left me feeling really frightened.” Other residents said they believed the suspect had only recently moved into the area.
A significant cordon was put up around Scriven Court, Scriven Street, Clarissa Street and Loanda Close, while several officers and police vehicles remain at the scene.
Ibrahim Payton, who owns Bay's fish and chip shop opposite the scene of the shooting and witnessed the aftermath, said: “I heard the gunshot. It was so loud and I knew straight away it was a gunshot.
“I looked out the window and saw two men lying in the street with police officers around them. One was white, one was black.
“There are so many police officers. They were holding the black guy to the ground, while it looked like they were trying to treat the white guy. I've been here for three years and I've not seen anything like it.”

Kaner Korbay, who owns nearby dry cleaners Bree-Zee, said: “There was a raid on a house in Scriven Street, they tried to get away and the police were chasing them.
“One of them shot the police officer. Right in the middle of the street, the centre of Haggerston Road.
“I heard the noise of the gun, two rounds I think. Within 30 seconds the police were everywhere, blocking the road. I saw the police officer getting treated with their shirt off. I think they were shot on their shoulder, they were covering their shoulder with bandages. I saw one of the guys in handcuffs next to the wall.”
They added: “There were undercover officers and police officers with guns running around everywhere. They were armed with machine guns.”
Nilesh Kalawadia, who owns Friends newsagents nearby, said: “I thought it was fireworks, I just heard the bang, and saw lots of disruption outside. There were lots of police standing outside – 50 or 60.”
Steve White, chairperson of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “So soon after the tragic death of an officer on Merseyside, this incident once again reminds us of the dangers faced by officers policing in 2015.”
A pilot taking selfies in the cockpit likely contributed to the crash of a small plane that killed them and their passenger last year near Denver, federal accident investigators concluded in a new report.
The National Transportation Safety Board released their full probable cause report about the May 31, 2014 crash and said that the evidence from the scene, including a GoPro camera with videos from recent flights, shows that the distraction of the pilot could have caused the crash.
This comes two months after the Federal Aviation Administration fielded questions over the safety of pilots taking pictures mid-flight after photos started flooding Instagram from the cockpits of private and commercial flights.

Man Helps 'Brave' Girl Who Survived Plane Crash
The NTSB report about the Colorado crash describes the two-seat Cessna 150 taking off just after midnight on May 31, 2014, crashing about four minutes later. Family members identified the pilot as Amritpal Singh, 29.
Singh's family told ABC affiliate KMGH-TV that the other victim was a musician in town for a concert at a local high school, and that Singh was giving airplane rides to some of the people in town for the concert.
National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they found a GoPro camera near the wreckage. Though the GoPro did not record the crash itself, the report says the “recordings revealed that the pilot and various passengers were taking self-photographs with their cell phones and, during the night flight, using the camera's flash function during the takeoff roll, initial climb, and flight in the traffic pattern.”
The NTSB report said investigators did not find anything wrong with the airplane itself, and say the evidence suggests the plane was not going fast enough to maintain lift before spinning out of control and crashing.
The report includes descriptions of seven videos recorded on the GoPro that was found near the wreckage and, even though they are believed to have been filmed in flights leading up to the crash but not that specific flight itself, the investigators believe the pilot could have been taking similar liberties in the air.
"Based on the evidence of cell phone use during low-altitude maneuvering, including the flight immediately before the accident flight, it is likely that cell phone use during the accident flight distracted the pilot and contributed to the development of spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control,” the NTSB said.
The federal regulations surrounding cockpit photo use differs at various points throughout the flight.
"FAA regulations prohibit commercial pilots from using a personal wireless communications device or laptop computer for personal use while at their duty station on the flight deck while the aircraft is being operated," the agency said in a statement to ABC News when debates over Instagram photos started in December.
The FAA spokesperson went on to clarify that pilots are allowed to use cameras during the flight but not camera devices on cell phones.
With the September G-20 meeting set to begin any moment in Hangzhou, China, a periodic, toothless event which is noting more than an opportunity for world leaders to take photos such as this one (they picked the happiest photo of the batch)...
... the draft communique has already been leaked, in other words the determination of the summit has been made before it even took place.
Of course, the big news of this weekend's G-20 event was neither the summit, nor the communique, but the unprecedented and prearranged snub by China targeting president Obama, who after an unexpected show of solidarity on Saturday over the global effort to address climate change, was humiliated by China when Obama arrived at Hangzhou Xiaoshan airport, when as reported earlier, first the receiving China delegation made sure there was no staircase for Obama to exit the plane and descend on the red carpet; the president of the world's most powerful nation was thus forced to use an emergency exit for their final arrival in China as commander in chief.
Then, around the time Obama was exiting through the emergency staircase, a Chinese official attempted to block national security adviser Susan Rice and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes after they lifted a blue rope holding back press and walked to the other side of it, closer to Obama. A member of the Chinese delegation began shouting at White House staff, demanding the pool leave the arrival scene. A White House official said Obama was our president and Air Force One was our plane and that the press was not going to move from the designated area. The Chinese official angrily responded "This is our country. This is our airport."
The scandals continued later, with members of the Chinese and US delegations coming close to throwing punches at each other: as we previously reported, two Chinese officials - one working to assist the American delegation - had to be physically separated after trying to hit each other outside an event.
As the WSJ adds, "the Chinese barred Mr. Obama from including their traveling press contingent in their motorcade. The hosts also have refused a White House request for a joint press conference with Mr. Xi, and they plan to block Mr. Obama's solo press briefing from airing live on Chinese television."
In short, the fate of G-20 meeting was fixed: no matter what was decided, it would forever be remembered as the event where China snubbed the US president in an unprecedented fashion one final time.
Incidentally, for those wondering why the meeting took place in Hangzho, a city which Chinese authorities literally had to empty out, instead of Beijing, the answer comes from the Twitter account of Beijing Air:
Which is ironic, because as the WSJ also reported earlier, "President Obama and their Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping stood with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to announce the U.S. and China's formal adoption of the international climate change agreement reached in Paris in December 2015. They also detailed a road map to achieving emissions reductions in commercial aircraft and for phasing out hydrofluorocarbons." Which is completely meaningless, as none of the provisions of the Paris Treaty are enforceable, and Beijing has zero intentions of actually following through with the toothless treaty.
In any case, thanks to Bloomberg, according to the leaked draft G-20 communique, global leaders "should make full use of a range of policy options, including fiscal as well as monetary measures, to revive economic growth that still falls short of desired levels."
In other words, even more global debt, even more liquidity injections by central banks, even higher asset prices, even more social discontent, nationalistic passions and populism.
Among the other G-20 (pre)decisions in the communique draft seen by Bloomberg:
Financial market volatility poses downside risks to growth: draft communique
Fiscal strategies equally important as monetary ones: draft communique
Excess volatility, disorderly moves in foreign exchange markets hurt stability: draft
G-20 recognizes excess steel capacity as global issue: draft
Subsidies can contribute to global excess capacity: draft
UK votes to leave EU adds to global economic uncertainty: draft
Terrorism a serious challenge to international security: draft
And so on, and so forth, as yet another meeting of the world's "best and brightest" leaders leads to absolutely no new ideas how to fix a problem that was caused by debt than just creating even more debt, meaning that the red line shown below is about to truly take off.
We know how it all ends; the only thing we are curious about is if the Chinese will force an already humiliated Obama to fly commercial in their final return to the US... coach class.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Gov. Jerry Brown has signed legislation that reduces the penalty for intentionally exposing some to HIV in California.
The legislation signed Friday is part of an attempt by Democratic lawmakers to reverse the tough policies enacted during the AIDS scare of the 1980s and '90s.
Under those policies, intentionally exposing someone to HIV was a felony. SB239 reduces the crime to a misdemeanor, treating HIV like other communicable diseases.
Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco says the harsher penalties discouraged people from getting tested for HIV and stigmatized those who have it.
Critics say the bill would endanger people.
Lawmakers last year approved legislation allowing people with HIV to receive transplants from HIV-positive donors, reversing a ban imposed amid widespread fear about the disease.
The bill was among several pieces of legislation Gov. Brown signed into law on Friday. Brown also vetoed several bills, including ones on cannabis edibles and a smoking ban on state beaches and parks, CBS Sacramento reports.
The signs on some of Toronto's best-known streets are getting a makeover, but the names they bear aren't new — in fact, they're thousands of years old.
It's a movement begun at the height of the Idle No More movement in 2013 by artists and activists Hayden King and Susan Blight through a project called Ogimaa Mikana. As part of an effort to reclaim Toronto's Indigenous history, the two made stickers with Indigenous translations of Toronto street names, plastering them over the English signs.
​ "Official" signs went up today at Dupont/Spadina, Davenport/Spadina, Dupont/ Davenport. Or, Ishpadinaa & Gete-Onigaming. Go check them out! —@Hayden_King Now, three years later, "official" signs are cropping up across the city, with four of Toronto's major streets now bearing signs with their Anishinaabe names.
A new sign for Davenport Street bears its Anishnaabe name. (Craig Chivers)
The signs officially went up Friday as part of a joint initiative by Ogimaa Mikana and the Dupont by the Castle Business Improvement Area (BIA).
Stuart Grant, chair of the BIA, told CBC News the group was inspired to bring the signs to their area after seeing the hand-made ones by Ogimaa Mikana online. After taking the idea to the city, Grant says, the group started work on the signs' designs.
"These were the names thousands of years ago when the First Nations people were here," Grant told CBC News.
"By doing this, it shows that the First Nations people are still here. We're still on their land. We share it but we're still on their land," Grant said.
On its website, Ogimaa Mikana says it hopes "to restore Anishinaabemowin place-names to the streets, avenues, roads, paths and trails of Gichi Kiiwenging (Toronto)."
The group hopes the signs will expand throughout the city, "transforming a landscape that often obscures or makes invisible the presence of Indigenous peoples."

EVERETT — More than $20,000 belonging to Snohomish County Public Utility District ratepayers has turned up missing from a safe kept at the utility's Paine Field-based operations center.
The theft occurred in late 2010, according to a fraud investigation report state auditors released Tuesday.
“What's interesting about this case is nobody could figure out who did it,” said Mindy Chambers, a state auditor's office spokesperson.
Neither the PUD nor the Everett Police Department could determine who pilfered the cash. Their review included examining security videos and checking records for electronic access to the building, as well as searching the safe for evidence.
The $21,000 constituted the district's emergency fund. It is tapped to provide cash advances to line crews so they can buy meals during major storms. Roughly 150 workers are eligible for the cash advances.
The safe was under an employee's desk in an office cubicle. That gave many employees, contractors and others access to the area. Still, only three workers had the safe combination, officials said. There was no direct video surveillance of the area around the safe.
More than 400 people work at the operations center.
“This is kind of a unique situation,” Chambers said. “It's a lot of money in an unsecured safe.”
Since the theft, the PUD has made changes to avoid a similar loss in the future.
The utility bought a new safe with an electronic keypad. That allows them to change the combination as needed. Only two people at the PUD will be told the combination.
The PUD also has moved the safe to a senior manager's office, which is locked when he's gone. Employees must use identification badges to get access to the area.
The stolen money was kept in $20 bills in a metal box within the safe, PUD assistant general manager of finance Glenn McPherson said.
The safe also contained credit cards, which were not taken, McPherson said.
The theft was discovered Nov. 16, 2010 as a storm approached. McPherson said there was a lengthy internal investigation to try to determine who took the money.
“They looked at unusual access requests to try to see if we could isolate an individual,” they said.
Investigators found employees had legitimate reasons that could be documented when they entered the building in off hours, they said.
Insurance didn't cover the lost money.
“It was below our deductible,” McPherson said.
The PUD also received a clean audit for its day-to-day operations in a separate report released Thursday.
Apple's iOS 10 has been available on most recent iPhone and iPad models since September 13. We've been using it since then, and...it's fine. It's perfectly good. It's better than iOS 9.
But it could be even better.
The software update -- and its most recent 10.1 upgrade -- brings a heap of glittering new software features to Apple's mobile devices: incredibly interactive messaging, a lock screen that acts more like a control hub, and some cool payment capabilities, like pressing your thumb on the phone to buy goods on your Mac. There's also that sweet Portrait mode that adds an artistically blurred bokeh effect for the iPhone 7 Plus. For the most part, the new iOS delivers. But as we've lived with iOS 10 over the past few weeks, we've found that some promising features aren't fully baked, and others we thought we'd love to wind up as more fluff than substance.

Several new additions are also cumbersome, like responding to texts from the lock screen, swiping through three Control Center pages to see all settings, and dismissing now-larger notifications (which hang around and are easy to accidentally open).
But the software's biggest problems are fundamental: Pressure-sensitive 3D Touch on compatible iPhones pops up for some apps but not others and menus open slowly. Plus Siri still falls behind Google Now (and the newer Google Assistant) in how well it gathers and displays most information -- and how well it understands you in the first place.
And for iPads, the new features are super-subtle. It's disappointing that Apple hasn't added any major iPad difference-makers this year, unlike last year's fantastic upgrades like Split View in iOS 9.

So should you upgrade to iOS 10? Short answer: yes, if you have a supported iPhone or iPad. Voicemail transcription -- if your carrier supports it -- and new Messages features are worth the upgrade. The raise-to-wake screen (available on 6S models and later) is also helpful for checking quick messages. You're also setting yourself up for more benefits down the road, provided more hooked-in, third-party Siri-compatible apps and iMessage apps arrive.
Meanwhile, if you have a Mac running the new macOS Sierra software update, you'll be able to use iCloud to bridge both devices for things like copying and pasting text, and sharing documents and desktop files. But we do hope Apple smooths out iOS 10's rougher edges as the company keeps delivering updates -- from 10.2 and beyond.

What we like: The best new features in iOS 10
iMessage upgrades: The upgrade to Apple's built-in messaging app gives you a ton of fun new ways to express yourself with other iOS 10 users. Stickers and new flashy animations (lasers!) borrow liberally from Facebook Messenger -- they're fun but hardly necessary. They do get addictive, though, and the total sticker package avalanche gives Messages a more social-app feel. But the apps are the promising part: you can already make payments via Square Pay or add a ton of other features like restaurant reservations or movie showtimes.
The new Home app: If you have any HomeKit-compatible home products, iOS 10 finally offers the tools to access your products and create easy-access controls and settings -- from any screen. The only problem is, you need HomeKit-compatible products.
Raise-to-wake: On iPhone 6S and later models, lift the phone to jostle the screen to lifelong enough to see if what messages await. It's a natural gesture that gives your thumb a break, and makes the iPhone a more glanceable tool. It's just a shame that the widgets on the lock screen don't have 3D Touch or work more like mini-apps. Learn how to use the lock screen here.
Apple Pay on a Mac using your phone's TouchID: Now you can use your iPhone's TouchID home button to complete Apple Pay payments on a Mac if you have macOS Sierra. (Of course, if you're planning on getting a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, that model's built-in Touch ID fingerprint sensor means you won't need your iPhone at all.) When you need it, it's pretty helpful. It doesn't work for the Mac App Store, though, weirdly enough. Here's how to use Apple Pay in Safari.
Collaborating on a note or a project, or working between devices: Collaborative tools in iWork and in Notes make sharing a whole lot easier, even with Mac users. Add into this the ability to copy and paste from iOS into macOS Sierra directly from each machine, and there's a lot more seamlessness between devices in work situations.
Voicemail transcription: Visual voicemail has been around for a long time in Android, and it's welcome here too. Your Voicemail tab in the phone app now includes a full transcription when you tap a message, which means you may not have to give it a listen. Just note that it's not always 100 percent accurate, and it only works on compatible wireless carriers.
Hide unwanted stock apps, or other things: You won't delete them entirely, but you'll rid your screen of the cluttering icons of previously undeletable Apple apps. Here's how. (But keep in mind, you still can't remove some.)
Improvements to Photos include better library-scanning, and Memories: If you use Apple's iCloud Photo Library to sync and store your photos, the new Photos app adds some helpful tools. The whole collection gets scanned on-device and photos are better sorted by faces and places. There's also a "Memories" feature that creates automatic slideshows based on themes. It's a little random (why "On This Day: November 3, 2014," Apple?) but the results are great, although similar to what Google and Facebook do.
Portrait mode for iPhone 7 Plus is awesome, and better than Pixel's version: If you have one of Apple's newest iPhone 7 Plus models, you're obviously upgrading to the latest version of iOS 10.1 or later anyway. But that new Portrait mode, which creates a depth-of-field effect for photos, is so good that pictures end up looking like they were shot on a high-end camera. It's not perfect, and the effect has a lot of limitations (it uses a more zoomed-in telephoto lens, and requires certain lighting and distance from the subject), but when it works it's special.
An Irish woman who is a suspect in the brutal double murder of two north Dublin men has been arrested in South Africa in relation to an alleged hostage situation.
An Irish woman who is a suspect in the brutal double murder of two north Dublin men has been arrested in South Africa in relation to an alleged hostage situation.
Gardai want to question the woman and another man about the gun murders of best pals Eoin O'Connor (33) and Anthony Keegan (32) whose bodies were found on an island on Lough Sheelin, Co Meath, on May 26 last year, a month after they were reported missing.
The female suspect was arrested by police yesterday afternoon for the alleged possession of a dangerous weapon.
Threatened
Inchicup Island, Lough Sheelan, Co Cavan, where gardai have discovered human remains
It is believed the woman became involved in an apparent hostage situation during which a hotel manager was tied up in their home and viciously threatened.
The Herald understands their visa to be in South Africa has expired and they may have to leave on the back of this.
The South African man is also wanted for questioning in relation to the double murder. It is suspected the two men were abducted and murdered after making their way to Cavan.
There is no formal extradition agreement between Ireland and South Africa, but it is understood gardai have made huge progress in the double murder case.

Sources say gardai believe the man and woman became caught up in a "diabolical plot" by a north Dublin gang to have the best pals murdered following a criminal dispute.
Gang
It is understood that the man became involved in the murder to wipe out a relatively minor drugs debt that they owed to the feared Dublin gang.
Post-mortem results showed that both O' Connor and Keegan were shot in the back of the head "execution style" after they were lured to their grim fate and at least two people were involved in the shooting, with others helping to dispose of the bodies.
An unsuspecting fisherman alerted gardai to the badly-decomposed bodies of the two Coolock men on the afternoon of May 26 last after they noticed a terrible smell coming from an island in Lough Sheelin.
The bodies were tied together and found covered over with tarpaulin.
Arrested
Two men, one from Lithuania and the other of African descent, were arrested in Cavan town in June of last year, while a man aged in their 50s was arrested in Co Meath last December. However, there have been no arrests since then.
Garda investigations are continuing.

Steve Dobkin and son contemplate tenants' rights on a Park Slope stoop. (Courtesy Private Jake Dobkin Collection)
Do you have a question about New York's complex and sometimes terrifying housing laws? Native New Yorker columnist Jake Dobkin has been receiving a lot of these questions lately, and he's decided to kick some of them over to their dad, longtime NYC tenants' lawyer and housing activist Steve Dobkin. If you have a question, email us and we will pick the most interesting ones to pass along to him.
This question comes from a Greenpoint resident who is worried about losing their stabilized apartment.
Dear Counselor Dobkin,
We live in a rent-stabilized walkup (3rd floor) in Greenpoint. Our landlords live on the bottom floor. They are elderly and will someday pass and their grown sons have have no interest in taking over the building when that happens. We are the only rent-stabilized unit and all of the others are rent-controlled.
We want to stay here as long as possible. We're transplants from 12 years ago, but now lifers. Whenever this building changes hands, how feasible is it that all of the current tenants would be safe from getting thrown out? What can we do to protect our rights to stay? I have unfounded fears of wealthy investment-bots finding all kinds of loopholes to get tenants out of buildings. This landgrab is just too much.
Thank you,
Stumbly-on-the-Stairs in Greenpooint
Dear Stumbly-on-the-Stairs in Greenpoint,
As the tenant of a rent stabilized apartment, your status will not be affected by the mere sale of the building. However, there are potential scenarios that a new purchaser may employ which could lead to eviction proceedings. First there is the “owner use” gambit, in which the new owner transfers title to the building to himself, rather than the usual limited liability company (“LLC”), and claims that they or they intend to use your apartment for their own primary residence or that of family members. If you are correct that all of the other tenants are protected by rent control, a system which makes it practically impossible to evict tenants on these grounds, you may be a sitting duck for an “owner use” proceeding. You'll need a lawyer.
A possible basis for the owner to seek the eviction of all of the rent regulated tenants would be a “demolition” of the building. Under the Rent Stabilization Code, an owner need not prove that it intends to knock down the building—only that it has obtained approved plans and the necessary funds to gut the interior of the building, with the exception of structural supports for the exterior walls, so that someone could stand in the cellar and look up to the sky.
The presence of rent controlled tenants subjects the building to the Sound Housing Act, making a demolition case much tougher and time consuming. The owner would also have to prove that they or they can't make a profit on the building and intends to create additional units.
More likely, the new owner will resort to garden variety harassment, including, but not limited to: short term rentals of neighboring apartments to crazed young stoners; replacement of the central heating system with short circuiting electrical units; demolition of vacated apartments designed to generate the ultimate noise, dust and debris, as well as higher rents; frequent interruptions of essential services; un-kept appointments for repairs; veiled threats by building personnel; offers of bupkis to move out quickly; and not depositing rent payments, and then commencing a frivolous nonpayment proceeding when management knows the tenant will be out of town.
Unfortunately, the Housing Court and the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (“DHCR”), which both have jurisdiction over tenant initiated harassment proceedings, and the correction of violations, lack the resources, and, too frequently, the inclination, to impose serious penalties on owners, and they often get away with murder.
The bottom line is that it's an uphill struggle to protect and defend your rights as a tenant. But it can be done, and it's being done in buildings around the city. Success requires group action though a tenants' association, and affiliation with larger groups, such as the Met Council on Housing. Elected officials can sometimes be helpful in pressuring agencies such as DHCR, the Department of Buildings (“DOB”) and the Department of Housing Preservation & Development (“DHPD”) to step up enforcement measures. Demonstrations and press coverage also play a role. It takes a lot of work and coordination to fight the greedy hoards of Gen-X land grabbers. Don't sit and cry—Organize!

This time last year, the talk of the town was whether Gold Coast's Gary Ablett Jr would retake the number one crown from the new kid on the block, Nat Fyfe. Just 12 months on, the same question emerges, but with Fyfe the challenger.
Ablett's fall from the top tier of talent was all but confirmed in the 2016 offseason. Already struggling to regain full fitness following their 2014 shoulder injury, which has limited them to 20 games over the past two seasons, Ablett requested a trade from the Suns to their former club Geelong.
Their request was denied, but in the new AFL paradigm, denied merely means delayed.
Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share
More recently, they were left out of a new-look Gold Coast leadership group after handing the captaincy over at the end of last season. The players vote on this group. They decided Ablett was no longer required. For a player whose leadership has been questioned throughout their tenure up north, the actions of the playing group speak volumes.
It's harsh, but entering their seventh year as the Suns' high-profile initial recruit, Ablett has become just another player. The return of the king turned out to be a flop.
Return of the King, Part 2
For Fremantle's Nat Fyfe, the stakes are significantly higher. Their 2017 season looms as large as any individual in the game.
The 2015 Brownlow medallist played four and a half games in 2016, with a recurrence of their fractured left fibula – surgically repaired after a stress fracture gave way to a break in 2015's preliminary final – leading to a long layoff.
In their absence, their team floundered. Fremantle's 2016 season lurched from dither to disaster. A 17-win campaign (albeit one that was more in keeping with 15 wins) gave way to four-win season, with the Dockers avoiding the wooden spoon by a game as some percentage. It was the worst sophomore season for a reigning minor premier in VFL/AFL history.
Having Fyfe would have helped Fremantle, but they were not the difference between a 12-win finals campaign and a four-win shitshow.

So, like the Suns, the Dockers have retooled, delisting some veterans who still had petrol in their tanks, and replacing them with bit parts from teams across the competition.
Out of interest, all four of Fremantle's new additions (Joel Hamling, Bradley Hill, Shane Kersten and Cam McCarthy) fall into a demographic that suits Fyfe's career arc. More on that as the pre-season progresses.
He's back now, ready to play a central role in reviving the Fremantle Dockers. But for Fyfe himself, it is set to be a busy year.
First and foremost, Fyfe needs to get back to being Fyfe. Pre-injury, between Round 1 and Round 17 of 2015, the eventual Brownlow medallist averaged 30 disposals, 18 contested possessions and 8.5 clearances per game. Those numbers translated into a lazy 31 Brownlow votes.
From then (Round 20 and 21 and then in Fremantle's two 2015 finals, and Rounds 1 through 4.5), their counting stats have fallen from those stratospheric heights to something more earthly: 24 touches, 15 contested possessions and seven clearances.
They look in remarkable nick. Seriously, it's nigh-on comical. But that counts for nought if their surgically repaired leg fails their 90-plus kilogram frame once again.
Second, 2017 is a contract year for Fremantle's No.7. But it is no ordinary contract year: Fyfe is a restricted free agent.  They are arguably the biggest player to hit free agency since the mechanism was introduced in 2012, and there has already been a flurry of takes on their future.
Fyfe signed what is technically their fourth contract in 2014 (having been drafted in 2009, signing a one-year extension thereafter, and signing a third deal in 2011). At the time, they were beginning to flourish, averaging 27 disposals and a goal a game in a Fremantle team that was at its apex. They obviously went to another level in 2015, and could have been expected to maintain their excellent play thereafter. Theirs is a prized signature.

Right now, you'd be foolish to think he's leaving. Fyfe is a West Australian, the clear Fremantle alpha male, and the Dockers will have planned every single decision around Fyfe's 2017 contract year meticulously. They will fill every cell in the heritage-listed Fremantle Prison with $100 notes and give Fyfe the master key. A seven-year deal, carrying them through to the end of the 2025 season? Don't be shocked.
Equally, Fyfe may prefer a more short-term deal to take them through to unrestricted free agency in the 2019 off-season. That would give Fremantle enough time to show they're on the right path, and mean Fyfe retains their optionality should that not materialise.
Regardless, until they sign on the figurative dotted line, Fyfe's contract status will be a story. We will keep close tabs on it throughout the year, as we did during Patrick Dangerfield's pre-agency season.
Speaking of which, the third item on Fyfe's 2017 to-do list is their looming battle with Patrick Dangerfield for the title of the Best Player in the AFL.
We can all agree that these are the two best players in the game, right? Everyone has a different take on the top ten – as The Roar's AFL stable will show in a few week's time with our annual top 50 – but sitting atop the pyramid are these two colossuses. Fyfe and Dangerfield are the best.
Batman versus Superman, but with footballs
There are few superlatives left to describe Dangerfield's 2016 season. They put their new team on their back and carried them to the second-last game of the year, with their power running (both into and out of packs) and penetrating kick adding a new string to the Cats' bow.
A record 35-vote performance in the Brownlow medal, there is nothing else Dangerfield could have done to improve their team on the field.

Dangerfield wrested the Best Player Championship Belt from Fyfe. That was through no fault of Fyfe, they aren't around to defend it. But what if they had been? Would a hypothetical 2016 Nat Fyfe have produced a better season than 2016 Dangerfield? There's no way of knowing.
But there is a way to at least partially compare the two, using a couple of tools I've bought up previously. Remember the DangerZone and the Nat Fyfe Quadrant?
Let's see where both parties' seasons fall on each other's specially-designed matrices to measure their unique football attributes.
First, the DangerZone.
Dangerfield is on their own planet in this chart, which compares clearances and metres gained for the top 30 players in each respective category. As we discussed last year, there are three groups on this chart: the metres gained guys, the clearance guys, and the bit-of-everything guys (which is the smallest group). Dangerfield is the only player who gathered a tonne of clearances and gained a bucket load of metres for their team in 2016.
Fyfe's 2015 season, which saw them average 8.7 clearances and 395 metres gained per game, puts them in the clearance monster category – albeit with a forward drive that would place them around the middle of this sample. In this respect, Fyfe's 2015 season was an amped up version of an inside animal.
How about Dangerfield's 2016 season on the 2015 Nat Fyfe Quadrant?

There were 21 players who met the above average in contested marks/above average in clearances mark in 2015, but no one came close to Fyfe's dominance of the ground and the air. Fyfe finished seventh in contested marks per game, on 1.8, with six hulking key forwards ahead of him. Early in that year, Fyfe was leading all comers, averaging more than 2.5 aerial contest wins a game – as a midfielder.
One of those players was Dangerfield, who won 7.1 clearances and 1.3 contested marks per game in their final year with the Adelaide Crows. They were the only player in the league to get close to Fyfe, but they were still around 50 per cent below the Brownlow medallist's mark.
In summary, they're both freakishly good in their own way. Although both clear leaders in their particular, unique ways of doing business, both Dangerfield and Fyfe are among the closest avatars for each other. Both enter the 2017 AFL season in their respective primes, Dangerfield in their 26-year-old season and Fyfe their 25-year-old season.
Can Fyfe retake their crown?
It has been 87 weeks since both Dangerfield and Fyfe graced the same football field. The Saturday night encounter between Adelaide and Fremantle was a dreary affair, with sopping rain sprinkling over the field for the full 120 minutes.
Fremantle were 8-0 and flying atop the ladder, where Adelaide were a game ahead of 0.500 in sixth place. It was a close finish in the end, and a tense scrap for the entirety. But that is not what made this game memorable.
Dangerfield and Fyfe were direct opponents for 78 minutes of the game, according to Champion Data. For 60 per cent of the game, the two best players in the league threw down. It was a genuine Superman vs Batman-style battle, with both champions free to power their teams.
In the aftermath, it was clear some kind of glorious game of chicken had emerged.

“We acknowledged Dangerfield was getting a fair bit and we thought we'll just let it sit,” said Fremantle coach Ross Lyon.
“Call me a weirdo, but I think we have to protect the look of the game,” the late Phil Walsh conveyed. “I want to win, but I also think the fans want to see those great battles.”
It was a battle, but in the same way that you might face off one-on-one in laser tag. Yeah, you're shooting, but the hits you're taking don't stop you from firing right back. It was the stuff of video games.
Dangerfield had 39 touches to Fyfe's 40. Dangerfield gained 582 metres to Fyfe's 958. Dangerfield won 29 contested possessions to Fyfe's 26, and nine clearances to Fyfe's 14. Both took three contested marks – a football miracle given the conditions – and kicked a goal.
The winner in the eyes of the umpires was Fyfe, who took the three Brownlow votes over Dangerfield's two. Personally I agree, Fyfe's game was more influential overall, particularly in the conditions which meant forward progress was the goal. Really, everyone in the AFL diaspora won.
We haven't seen the return leg yet. The Crows and Dockers didn't play again in 2015, and Fyfe missed Fremantle's lone hit-out against the Cats in 2016 due to injury. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long: Fremantle host Geelong on Sunday, March 26, as the after-dinner mint to a delectable Round 1 football feast.
Fingers crossed, the Dockers and Cats play once more in 2017, in Round 14. They will be two opportunities for Fyfe to catch their nemesis.
As much as we should all be excited to watch the high-flying Fyfe return to the field, we should be excited to see whether Dangerfield can back up their remarkable 2017.

Dangerfield's Brownlow win was the largest single-season vote accumulation in the history of the medal. Their 32 disposals (second in the league), 16 contested possessions (fourth), 620 metres gained (first), 6.8 clearances (fourth) combined to create a historically legendary individual season. Dangerfield's marks for disposals, metres gained and clearances were all career highs, as were their mark, goal assist and score involvement tallies.
Dangerfield would have wrested the title from Fyfe regardless of the number of games Fremantle's centrepiece was fit for last season.
But can they back it up? One would expect them to come back to the pack, even just a little, given the extraordinary nature of their 2016. Geelong will still be thereabouts the top four, but the extent to which they can return to the top two may well hinge on another superhuman season from their superstar.
In many ways, Dangerfield will decide who wears the Best Player Championship Belt.
At their respective bests, Dangerfield and Fyfe are as close to match winners as you can hope to see in a game where there are 36 players on the field at a time. The former will beat you to a pulp with acceleration and front-on power, where the latter will gladly burst out of a congested pack with the ball enveloped in their extra-terrestrial paws. Dangerfield's straight-line speed belies a player with their build, as do Fyfe's aerial abilities.
Both in their primes, Dangerfield and Fyfe will have outstanding seasons. I am an outed Fyfe obsessive, and I can see them returning to better than their best from 2015.
Sorry Paddy, your reign atop the league will prove a short one.
Undercover at the Tar Sands: What It's Really Like Working for Big Oil
An anonymous worker reveals conditions at ground zero for Canada's controversial pipelines
from Rolling Stone
Editor's Note: In recent months, many climate activists have focused their efforts on Canada's tar sands and the companies set on extracting fossil fuels from them. With the debate raging louder than ever, Rolling Stone is in contact with one of the workers helping to build a pipeline to bring oil from the tar sands to the U.S. Read on for that anonymous correspondent's second dispatch from one of the world's most controversial jobs.
On its surface, Fort McMurray, Alberta, looks like any other small Canadian city, with rows of new houses, condo developments and a Wal-Mart. Recycling bins line the streets, and residents schlep cloth bags to the store because the community banned plastic bags. But there's one big difference between Fort Mac and other towns: This is ground zero for Canada's controversial tar sands operations. Like tens of thousands of others, I saw green in the tar-like bitumen-drenched sand, and I came here to cash in. (I'm writing anonymously to protect my colleagues, my friends and myself.)
Read Our Undercover Correspondent's First Dispatch from the Tar Sands
The majority of oil-related work happens north of town. Follow Highway 63 for about 20 minutes and you'll see a sprawling series of smoke stacks at the Syncrude Canada Ltd. processing facility. You can smell the oil in the air, and smog hangs across the otherwise crisp northern horizon. Drive further, and things get even worse. Koch Carbon's giant pile of petroleum coke in Detroit is nothing compared to what the oil companies have up here. Shell, Imperial Oil, Exxon, Encana, Husky, BP, Suncor Energy, CNR, Southern Pacific and Petro-Canada all have a stake in this game, and there's an estimated 170 billion barrels of crude on the line.
Thousands of employees are put up in temporary housing settlements. The big “camps” have gyms and rec rooms with pool and ping pong tables; a few even have ice rinks, yoga classes and movie theaters. For the most part, though, it's all insulated aluminum-sided trailers with private sleeping quarters and communal bathrooms.
The camps serving Shell's Albian Sands project and Imperial Oil's Kearl worksite are among the biggest. Shell's complex – two camps collectively known as “the Village” – is home to about 2,500 employees. Meanwhile, Imperial Oil's Wapasu camp houses more than 7,300. It even has its own airstrip to accommodate workers as they fly in and out on chartered 747s.
Wapasu is a dry camp, meaning absolutely no alcohol is allowed. Employees are bussed in and out of the fenced, guarded compound for work, and aren't allowed to leave or have visitors during off-hours. Meanwhile, all rooms are subject to search. There's nothing like coming home from a long day's work, only to find a note stating drug-sniffing dogs searched your room while you were away. Some jokingly refer to Wapasu as “Wapatraz.” Over at the Village, things aren't quite as harsh. There's even a bar onsite – but it closes early, and you're not allowed to have more than two drinks per night.
Living in a camp means you get free room and board, including three substantial meals a day. But if you're not careful, the isolation and boredom can wear on you. Many of us get stuck paying inflated prices for cigarettes or smuggled-in drugs and alcohol. There are stories of late-night card games where guys bet – and lose – entire paychecks just for a rush.
Back in Fort McMurray, most of us out-of-towners stay in hotels or overpriced apartments. We're all given a generous union-approved stipend to pay for lodging (and a nice per diem to cover restaurant meals), so if you play your cards right, you can pocket a nice chunk of change. Living out of a hotel room gets old fast, but it beats the hell out of staying in a camp.
Driving is incredibly and dangerous in the tar sands, and Highway 63 is known locally as “the Highway of Death.” Fatalities are common, with one death every 1.3 months, on average. There is no bypass around the city, so all the heavy equipment heading to the tar sands has to roll right through Fort McMurray. Logging trucks look small and harmless compared to the massive rigs hauling satellite-sized machinery and components. The biggest load to ever grace the Canadian highway system – an 859-ton module that was bigger than two Olympic swimming pools – passed through earlier this year.
Most of us drive $8-a-gallon gas-guzzling 4x4s, but most of us also have company gas cards, so fuel economy isn't much of a concern. There's always a line-up at the Tim Horton's drive-through, where it can take 30 minutes to get a goddamn coffee. When our crew gathers for our daily meeting, almost everyone leaves their truck running.
One of my coworkers saw me turn off the ignition on a particularly brisk February morning. “Did you just turn off your truck?!” they asked in disbelief. “What are you, some sort of environmentalist?”
I didn't know what to say. I once considered myself somewhat of an environmentalist – I recycle, use energy-efficient light bulbs, and have a compost back home. But here I am, in Fort McMurray, working for Big Oil. I guess I've sort of sold out. What can I say? Even environmentalists have bills to pay.

The Columbus Crew had been quiet on their broadcast partnerships this year. This has been normal in recent years as the team and their broadcasters have announced deals in the weeks leading up to the season. The Crew and 'Fox Sports Ohio announced their deal in Feburary 2012, within 30 days of opening day. The lack of movement specifically isn't a concern.
A blog post by Adam Jardy this week did give Crew fans a reason for heartburn. The deal with Fox Sports Ohio (FSO) has ended and the team is looking to either extend the deal with FSO or make a change and sign a contact with the nascent Time Warner Cable Sports Network (TWCSN). A partnership with TWCSN would be a significant change in the reach. Crew games would only be available to Time Warner customers.
Time Warner Cable reports that 48% of cable subscribers in Ohio are Time Warner customers. That's a significant subscriber base, but it doesn't compare to the near 100% of cable systems that carry FSO. Over half of all Ohioans wouldn't get the Crew games on TV if the Crew were to partner with Time Warner.
The Crew wouldn't be the first MLS team to switch to TWCSC. The Los Angeles Galaxy signed a lucrative deal with Time Warner in 2011 for $55 million over 10 years. F.C. Dallas moved to TWCSC. The production quality improved greatly and the team also ensured non Time Warner customers could watch by allowing Direct Kick access in non-Time Warner Cable service areas. MLS Live was also made available in the Dallas market. The current Fox Sports Ohio deal places a blackout on MLS Live and Direct Kick broadcasts in the state of Ohio.
The team is in a solid position with two broadcasters pursuing rights to games and reports indicate that the Crew will have a deal in place by the opening game on March 9th at D.C. United. The decision is a weighty one. Working out a deal with FSO would continue to give the Crew a broad TV footprint in the state. TWCSC wouldn't be able to provide that level of coverage, but they have a history of being flexible in allowing other viewing methods.
The Crew's decision is ultimatly between trying to expand the audience or catering to existing fans.

Dateline, Washington D.C.: The Drug Enforcement Administration, pressed by Congress for answers about its treatment of Andrew Chong, has no answers to give.
I wrote about Andrew Chong before. He's the young man the DEA arrested in San Diego when they caught them smoking dope at a friend's house during a raid. DEA agents handcuffed him, locked them into a room, and left them there five days without food or water. They drank their own urine, eventually attempted suicide, and was close to death when they were discovered. They suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, not surprisingly. DEA agents claimed that they were left there through an oversight and that nobody could hear them shouting for help. An investigation determined that you could very clearly hear someone shouting for help from that room.
The consequences? Four written reprimands, a five-day suspension, and a seven-day suspension.
If I seize someone, handcuff them, lock them in a room, and leave them to die, I will suffer severe consequences. I will lose my job, especially if I acted while performing my duties. I will go to jail. I will suffer catastrophic personal financial losses. My name will be broadcast far and wide.
That's the difference between me and a federal employee.
The DEA agents who arrested Andrew Chong for smoking dope and left them to die got reprimands or suspensions that were shorter than my last tension headache. You and I — the taxpayers — paid Andrew Chong the $4.1 million settlement they secured; the agents did not. They are not named in any of the articles about the incident. They will not go to jail. They will not lose their jobs.
Free of significant consequence, they will continue to exercise their armed authority to inflict consequences on other people who break the law.
Dateline, Texas:
In 2013, Judge Susan Criss presided over the trial of Alisha Marie Drake, who stood accused of the horrific crime of videotaping the rape of a 14-month-old child. During jury selection, a Jehovah's Witness in the jury pool told Judge Criss that they would not view child pornography and that their religion did not allow them to judge others (an issue familiar to anyone who has ever encountered a Jehovah's Witness in a jury pool). Judge Criss berated the juror and belittled their religious beliefs:
So if it grosses you out, then you can take it out on the person in punishment because it can't possibly gross you out more than it grossed out that child. So that's what my God tells me.
Eventually Judge Criss ordered the prospective juror arrested:
Juror No. 48: Your Honor, I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I believe that Jehovah God is a Supreme Judge and it is not in my place to judge anyone else or to have, for that matter, for them to be – – The Court: All right. I understand that. We have Jehovah's Witnesses all the time. But you know what? If you get picked on this jury, you get picked on this jury, and Jehovah can visit you in the jail. Juror No. 48: Okay. Then – – The Court: Have a seat, sir. Juror No. 48: I guess they have to visit me. The Court: All right. Arrest him. Take them into custody. Take them into custody right now. I'm not playing. See you later.
Judge Criss later explained to the thoroughly cowed jury pool that their experience as a sex crimes prosecutor — which they related in detail — taught them it was difficult to find willing jurors in sex crimes cases, and that they would not be excusing people. "And I'm not playing, and I don't care if anybody likes it or not."
Yesterday the Court of Appeals overturned the conviction. Even though Drake's appointed attorney did not bother to object to Judge Criss' actions, the court found that their comments about the case improperly conveyed their opinion of Drake's guilt, and that their arrest of the prospective juror deprived Drake of an impartial jury by intimidating jurors from confessing possible biases.
But the public opinion by the Court of Appeals did not name Judge Susan Criss. That's a matter of tradition and professional courtesy. You'd have to figure out their name by Googling the case, or by getting it from court records or from someone who knows.
Susan Criss is now in private practice, although they enjoy a public life commenting on their past cases. Criss is defiant about their actions in the Drake case. They won't face any State Bar proceeding. They won't face any consequences at all for their conduct.
These stories are not the exception. They are the rule. The rule is this: citizens generally face consequences for breaking the law and violating the rights of others, but those with the power to administer those laws and impose those consequences rarely face any themselves.
That's the justice system.

As the streaming wars continue, it looks as if Spotify may be blackballing new releases that received exclusive release windows on other streaming services. Frank Ocean's "Blonde" album, which just appeared on Spotify, appears to have been buried on the streamer, despite being one of the most popular and highly anticipated new discs this year.
Several weeks ago, the New York Times and Bloomberg both reported that Spotify planned to implement a policy that essentially amounted to blackballing releases that had been given exclusively to other music streamers, such as Apple Music and Tidal, first.
The Times cited multiple unnamed music industry executives who confided that Spotify, "had told them that it had instituted a policy that music that had benefited from such deals on other services would not receive the same level of promotion once it arrived on Spotify; such music may not be as prominently featured or included in as many playlists."
In response to the reports, Spotify vehemently denied that it was planning to retaliate against material that had first been released on other streamers exclusively. However, if the company's treatment of Frank Ocean's new "Blonde" album is any example, it looks as if the company is doing just that.
Despite the fact that the album became available on Spotify this past weekend, it was almost impossible to find any indication of such. The album was not listed on Spotify's 500 top album releases, or even its list of the top 500 new hip hop album releases.
The album was also not placed or featured at all on the streamer's dedicated hip hop page, let alone the front Spotify splash page. In addition, not one song from Ocean's collection appeared on Spotify's 60 track "New Music Friday" playlist.
Anecdotal reports by hip hop listeners further revealed that songs from "Blonde" are not appearing on their recommended lists despite the fact that they are listening to artists with similar musical styles.
With Ocean's album being one of the hottest and most highly anticipated releases of the year, it seems clear that there was some sort of concerted attempt to deemphasize their appearance on Spotify.
The streamer has also made no secret of its distaste for the concept of exclusives in general recently, when Spotify executive Troy Carter stated that they are "bad for artists, bad for consumers and bad for the whole industry."
While the company has not yet formally commented on the reasons why Frank Ocean's "Blonde" album appears to have been buried, it looks as if the streamer is now sending a loud and clear warning to artists and labels who agree to such deals with rival streamers Apple Music and Tidal.

I love projectors. Let me say that up front. I've used a projector as my only "TV" for over 15 years. In terms of picture size for the dollar, they can't be beat.
But even the best of these light cannons lags behind the latest display technologies commonplace in TVs. We're only just starting to see reasonably affordable 4K projectors, for example, which is doubly frustrating since projectors are the one place where you could really see that extra resolution. A couple of projectors are capable of wide color gamut (WCG), but even those don't get as wide as many TVs. And with current technology, high dynamic range (I mean real HDR) is basically impossible.
Meanwhile, TV technology keeps advancing. Both OLED and LCD TVs offer all of those technologies at increasingly affordable prices, and LCDs in particular are getting even bigger for less money -- impinging on projector territory. Unfortunately the image quality drawbacks of LED-backlit LCD TVs aren't going away any time soon (or probably ever), and OLED TVs larger than 65 inches remain incredibly expensive.
New technology to the rescue. Display heavyweights Samsung and Sony are both working on tech that uses the light-emitting diodes directly, without having to shine them through a layer of liquid crystals. The best part is that both are designed for truly massive, wall-size pictures. Neither will be available in the home anytime soon, but the potential is substantial.
Let's take a look.
Introducing Samsung Cinema Screen and Sony CLEDIS
Samsung
Samsung recently announced the Cinema Screen, quite simply an array of millions of individual LEDs spread across something the size of a movie theater screen. Individual modules allow for different screen sizes. It's an interesting idea. Samsung claims potential peak brightness of 147 footlamberts (approx 503 nits). That's low for a modern HDR-capable TV, but 10 times the normal movie screen brightness of 14ftL.
Because it can turn each LED off individually, a Cinema Screen can produce absolute black and an infinite contrast ratio (just like OLED). Film can't even really do that, and digital projectors definitely can't. Not within a single scene, anyway.
Sony
Sony showed something similar at InfoCom in 2016 called CLEDIS, or Crystal LED Integrated Structure. It's a larger version of its Crystal LED prototype from 2012. Sony says it's intended for digital signage, not specifically a movie theater, but that might just be because the company already makes cinema projectors. The technology is similar to the Cinema Screen, with individual modules working together to form a single seamless screen. Sony claims 1,000 nits of brightness, similar to many HDR TVs. There's also wide color gamut and a 120 Hz refresh rate.
With the current design, you need at least a 110-inch diagonal screen for 1080p, and a 220-inch screen for 4K. Meanwhile the one Sony brought to CES 2017 (below) measured 32 feet wide by 9 feet high.
Now playing: Watch this: Sony's CLEDIS. The video wall you want, but can't afford
Coming soon to a theater near you?
Samsung
Two aspects of these new wall-size display technologies point toward eventual adoption in the cinema. One is the butts-in-seats aspect. The goal of any theater is to make money, and the main way they do that is by selling tickets. Every advancement in the theater -- sound, color, Dolby Surround, 3D, everything -- has been to coax people watching movies at home to visit the theater. If you can get those experiences from your TV, you're less likely to go to the local multiplex.
Right now many TVs have superior picture quality to most cinema projectors. Direct-view LED screens like Cinema Screen and CLEDIS offer brighter images, better color, better contrast and HDR, bringing huge-screen cinema image quality to a similar level as the smaller TV in your home.
The other aspect is money. Making a profit often also means reducing cost. If Samsung can convince movie theaters that the long-term ownership costs of an LED display costs less than a projector and screen, it's an easy(ish) sell. For one thing, you'd need even fewer employees, the maintenance costs are likely lower, and it's possible these screens could require less energy to run.
So, potentially, this is win-win. We get even better visuals in the theater, the theater owners lower their costs.
Sony
In the home?
Right now both these technologies are experimental, and aimed for cinema or industrial use. Adapting them for the home wouldn't be a stretch. Sony already showed a demo of such a technology with the asupervisorstioned Crystal TV prototype.
There are two major hurdles for creating a, say, 100-inch version of CLEDIS/CrystalTV/Cinema Screen. The first is heat. This isn't an aspect most people usually think about, but LEDs create heat, and a lot of LEDs create a lot of heat. I mean just look at the fans on the back of the CLEDIS module (right).
Sony
To create a Home Cinema Screen, you'd need over 8 million LEDs (technically 25 million in an RGB arrangement). That's a lot, and they'd need to be pretty close together. The 110-inch mentioned before is only HD. The LEDs would have to be four times denser for 4K. That's even harder to keep cool.
The bigger issue is cost. That's a lot of LEDs. In a cinema, where the cost of any display will be amortized over many years, and via a steady flow of tickets, spending tens of thousands isn't unreasonable. If the numbers make sense, regarding energy use and lack of lamp replacements and so on, it could save them money.
Not so much at home. Even if a home version cost, say, $10,000, the number sold would be so low that it's unlikely either company would invest in the R&D to make it work. Note that after 5+ years Sony never did anything with its Crystal LED TV. Or more precisely, it became this huge and hugely expensive video wall. Maybe after a few generations of price dropping and the heat/power consumption numbers starting to make sense on a smaller scale. But that would be many, many years away.
Still, it would be pretty awesome, though. A wall-size TV with the picture quality of the best 4K TVs? Sign me up.

A History of Rock ‘n' Roll in 100 Riffs
Once this was the most glorious building of Romania but since 1990 it's been abandoned and slowly but surely falling apart. The building is now listed as a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Romania.
I usually don't share location-specific information regarding the whereabouts of the building I've visited, but this is such a well-known historical place that I've made an exception. This allows me to also share some of the history and facts of the city it's located in, which is rather interesting.
The casino is built in Constanța (formerly known as Tomis), Romania. The name of the city comes from the half-sister of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Constanța is the oldest Romanian city that's been continuously inhabited, and was founded around 600 before Christ. It is located at the coast of the Black Sea and is the largest city in the region.
The city itself has nearly 300,000 citizens and attracts a lot of tourists during the Summer because of the large beaches and the fact that it's one of the warmest cities in the country.
The casino used to be the eye catcher of the city, which is the largest port on the Black Sea coast and also one of the largest ports in Europe. The pedestrian area around the casino is a popular destination for couples and families because of its romantic and friendly atmosphere. A similar building has been constructed in Monte Carlo, Monaco, because of competition.
The casino is a 24/7 well guarded place and entering is nearly impossible without legal permission.
But even though it's so well guarded, the indecisive attitude of the local authorities has caused the casino to fall into disrepair. The last major repairs took place in 1988. We talked to one of the guards the night before our appointment and they felt sad and angry because authorities seem to simply not care about renovating the building. Nobody understands it.
The Art Nouveau building with its stunning 18th century Baroque accents was commissioned by the Romanian King Carol I, designed by Daniel Renard and Petre Antonescu, and first opened to the public in 1910. It was erected with money from the public.
The original plan was to pay homage to Romania's artistic traditions, but while the building was in progress, it turned into an Art Nouveau palace for the Belle Epoque.
Many wealthy travelers enjoyed their time playing games and dancing in the jewel of the city. The restaurant right across from the casino, which has actually been renovated and given another purpose (I believe it's an aquarium now), was the place to enjoy dinner. The city still offers some of the best restaurants in the country nowadays.
The iconic building survived two World Wars. During the 1914 visit of the Russian Imperial Family, the casino was host to a royal gala. Despite diplomatic negotiations, Grand Duchess Olga refused the proposed marriage to Prince Carol of Romania and the Russians sailed away. Olga was later killed by the Russians along with the rest of their family.
During the second World War the building was used as a hospital. Under the post-war communist regime it even operated as a restaurant. But maintaining the structure quickly became too expensive and in 1990 the building was closed… It has been closed ever since.
Rumor goes the government has set aside 9.5 million Euros for renovations, but they were scheduled to start in 2015 and nothing has happened yet. The latest investor who leased the building in 2007 cancelled the concession contract.
So far, no new investors have shown interest in the casino.
Right after setting foot inside the building, a pigeon fell from the railing at my feet, dead. Cats that were inside quickly ran to the pigeon, dragged it into a corner, and ate it. I was shocked and surprised.
The amount of pigeon and cat feces was insanely high. It immediately hit my lungs having impact on my breathing and also causing a headache. Next to the feces there were also a lot of leftovers from food that were probably left there by visitors of the casino in the past years. I did not expect the place to be in this bad shape at all.
Other than that Romania struck me as a very friendly and helpful country. Everyone we spoke to tried to speak English to communicate, traffic was okay, the food in the Greek restaurant (Nikos) was lovely, and the service from the rental car company near the airport was perfect.
I would like to share a few other pictures I made while exploring the casino. You can find them below.

There is a lot of buzz about U.S. rebalancing policy, but at the end of the day it is not a massive policy change from the U.S. perspective and neither is it one from the perspective of U.S. allies and partners, old and emerging ones, in the region. The increase of a U.S. military presence has been rather symbolic so far (e.g. deployment of U.S. Marines in Australia or new radar and reconnaissance drones in Japan). The U.S. interest in developing closer economic ties and removing existing barriers is not that new either. Negotiations (at times quite controversial) between the U.S. on the one side and Japan, Korea, or Taiwan on the other, regarding removal of trade barriers have been going for years and all these economies plus China are already major trade partners to the U.S. The relatively new element of the U.S. economic engagement is the intent to use the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), formerly an organization consisting of rather small economies from both sides of Asia-Pacific, as a vehicle for moving towards a massive free trade zone.
What is new in this respect is the changed dynamic that came along with China's rise as economic and military power holder. U.S. rebalancing is to a large extent a reaction to this development as well as the acknowledgment of the increasing prominence of the whole region. However, in terms of capabilities it stands on long-present U.S. security and economic commitments in the region. Thus, rebalancing is about strengthening existing and developing emerging alliances and partnerships and as such it is to a large degree a reaction to demands of regional stakeholders who are worried about recent Beijing's posturing in South and East China Seas.
The case of the complex web of relations among the U.S., Japan and Taiwan is a good example of the flexible approach of the U.S. rebalancing policy, combining official defence ties with Japan, unofficial partnership with Taiwan, and the convergence of interests in Taiwan-Japan relations. If we were looking for arguments as to why the U.S.-Japan-Taiwan triangle is a relationship to follow closely, the 3rd Taiwan-U.S.-Japan Trilateral Security Dialogue forum (hereafter trilateral forum or forum), held in Taipei on 15 October, provided more than a handful of ideas. The event was organised by the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, the Tokyo Foundation and Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
At this forum, the Taiwan side, as organizer, expressed interest in furthering the relationship between Taiwan, the U.S. and Japan. One of the broader issues discussed during forum was the TPP, and the U.S. and Japan's interest in Taiwan's participation. Kurt Campbell, an architect of US President Barack Obama's rebalancing policy and strong supporter of enduring U.S. commitment to Taiwan, stressed that Taiwan should have political ambition in diversifying its economy and join the TPP, bringing up Vietnam as a country that took the steps to liberalise its economy in just a year and a half. Campbell's comment is in line with the stance of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who expressed their support for Taiwan's entry into the TPP during their meeting with Taiwan's former Vice President Vincent Siew on the sidelines of the APEC economic leaders' summit in the early October.
Naturally, controversial issues were not absent when Taiwan's representative Timothy Yang reiterated that the Diaoyutai/Senkaku islands are (ROC) Chinese territory during the forum, claiming that the disputed islands are an “inherent part of the sovereign territory of the Republic of China”. However, this statement should not be taken at face value. While both sides of Taiwan's political arena insist that the islands belong to Taiwan (for different reasons), the real issue is not about actual sovereignty as much as it is about the exercise of fishing rights. In this respect, Tokyo and Taipei reached a fisheries agreement last April in in an extraordinary exercise of pragmatism on both sides. Current Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's role in reaching out to Taiwan and concluding long-stalled talks was instrumental. Yang's statement is thus mere lip service to Taipei's claim and does not represent major problem in developing bilateral cooperation. After all, Yang was pretty clear when they expressed that the Taiwan-Japan fisheries agreement “serves as a good example of the spirit of the initiative, with Taipei and Tokyo entertaining the possibility of expanding the pact to other areas of mutual concern”. According to Yoshiyuki Ogasawara, an expert on Taiwanese politics at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, the fishing agreement is not merely a fishing pact but a first step towards stabilizing the East China Sea. In this sense, the agreement is fully in line with U.S. efforts and Taipei and Tokyo demonstrated that both sides can make a direct contribution to regional stability. This has not been unnoticed by the U.S. participants at the trilateral forum. Dan Burton, a former member of the US House of Representatives, praised Taiwan for trying to resolve the fishing rights issues with Japan “in a very responsible way” despite the ongoing territorial tensions over the islands.
The proverbial elephant in the room is Taiwan's extensive economic interdependence with China. Beijing is Taiwan's largest trading partner and its bilateral trade has expanded more than tenfold since 2000 and intensified further after the enactment of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), a quasi-FTA. During their meeting with participants from the trilateral forum, President Ma admitted that maintaining good relations with the U.S., Japan and China at the same time “has been the biggest challenge”. Randy Schriver, Former Deputy Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs under the Bush Administration, also acknowledged that Taiwan may be in a difficult position with “its most important economic partner, China, and its most important security partner, the U.S.–Japan alliance” at times when support for eventual independence in Taiwan is increasing. Praise for the improvement of cross-Strait relations is the standard mantra for addressing efforts of Ma's policy towards the PRC and it was not different during the forum when the “Cross-strait rapprochement” was applauded by Kurt Campbell. However, the current state of affairs between Taiwan and China should not be taken for granted. Ma Ying-jeou could not proceed with elevating economic dialogue with Beijing to political level because of the extreme sensitivity of the issue and massive preference among Taiwan's population for the status quo. As Xi Jinping's recent remarks indicate, China's patience with Taiwan's stalling on the political talks issue may be over rather sooner than later. Since no leader in Taipei will have a mandate to pursue political talks (which equal talks about re-unification in the PRC's thinking), Taiwan would be better off to reach out to the U.S. and Japan. The trilateral forum that is co-organized by Taiwan's foreign ministry is a demonstration of the increasing awareness thereof.
In the case of U.S.-Japan-Taiwan ties, it is converging interests, apart from official ties demonstrated by the U.S.-Japan defence treaty of 1960, which represent strong foundations for the development of trilateral partnership. Irrespective of Japan's policy on ‘One China', Taiwan under the control of the PRC would be a security nightmare for Tokyo, particularly when tensions between Japan and China are high due to Beijing's pressure over the sovereignty of the Diaoyutai/Senkakus and the East China Sea in general. In a stark contrast to relations between China and Japan (and Korea and Japan), relations between Japan and Taiwan are generally in very good shape, enabled by extraordinary people-to-people relations. Taiwan's citizens' individual donations made Taiwan the top donor to Japan after the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami in 2011. This has been returned on many occasions by Japanese citizens' expressions of sympathy through donations or support during sports events.
The development and strengthening of Japan-Taiwan relations is beneficial to the U.S.' rebalancing efforts as one element is increasing capabilities of the regional partners, so they would not have to rely solely on the presence of U.S. forces. The U.S.-Japan link in the trilateral partnership is easier to examine because of the existence of formal diplomatic relations and a bilateral defence treaty. Japan-Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan relations benefit and at the same time suffer from the intentional (strategic) ambiguity that is a necessary component due to the peculiar political status of Taiwan. It benefits because it enables a certain degree of creativity in the absence of formal agreements, it suffers because of the lack of demonstration of the partnership to third parties, namely the PRC. Thus, one shall not expect much clarity in the trilateral dialogue but that does not mean there is not great room for cooperation and convergence of strategic interests.

The argument about LIS programs and jobs is old. Older than Luke Perry when they played a 16-year-old on “90210” (and that reference shows how old I am, but whatever). There are not enough jobs. Or more accurately, there is only a finite number of jobs and everyone who graduates will not be able to get one. Is this because library programs are graduating too many people with LIS degrees? Is this because there are too many graduates coming out with no solid work experience who are being passed over? Is it because older librarians or archivists are being “greedy”? Maybe a bit of everything? Maybe none of those things. Who knows? Who cares? I like to deal in reality. People need to eat. They need to live. I think everyone deserves the opportunity to make that happen in a job with living wages. Everyone. Including the person who last served you lunch at a restaurant, or the person who picks up the trash outside your house or the person who asked you for spare change outside of the subway. I won't talk about librarians/archivists and jobs without talking about everyone else and jobs. But anyway, you got a degree. You want to have a library or archives job. You are frustrated because it does not seem to be happening. You really want it, though. You really love the profession. You really love books and working with old pieces of paper and obsolete media. You love going to conferences. You're handy with cat GIFs and Python and you've memorized all the episodes of “Doctor Who” in addition to Dewey Decimal categories. You got a book tattoo, for heaven's sake. All of those things are wonderful. But no one cares.
You still need to eat. So what did getting an MLS do? If you went to a good program, it taught you a few skills and some theory. The skills should be concrete and easily categorized. You likely learned how to put together a rudimentary website or encode a finding aid (technology), you learned about information literacy (reference/critical analysis/research), and you probably did hella presentations and wrote hella papers (communications skills). Ideally you did some reading so you understand theories behind use of controlled vocabulary or copyright and privacy. Hopefully you got some hands-on training, too. I'm not touching the volunteer vs. paid argument in this essay, suffice to say that I run a *paid* internship program, but I digress.
Now think about jobs in which those skills could be applied outside of libraries or archives. Then apply for some of those jobs until you get one. That's it. Use what you have and try to live. There are bigger things happening outside of the LIS school/jobs conundrum (which itself is simply a manifestation of our economy's larger sickness), like a scaling back of voter rights laws, climate change-related weather, 1984-type surveillance on our phones and ack, the Kardashians are everywhere. The new rules of our economy dictate survival. We're all just out here trying to survive. And unless you're willing to actively rise up, fight or die against the republic tomorrow and demand living wages and jobs for all, you're complicit in and need to work within this paradigm. Simple. Survival.
You want a job in libraries, go for it. Be hungry like Eminem on their first album. Don't stop trying. But in the meantime, use those LIS skills to get something that will put a roof over your head. What you will likely find in the meantime is that the job you took is going to give you added skills that could help you get a job in the librarianship or archives. You had to take shifts at Starbucks? They offer healthcare and in the meantime, you are honing critical people skills that are clutch for reference or managerial work (because really, you think people are going to be less demanding when they want a venti latte vs. when they're looking for a book that they can't remember anything about except that it has a blue cover). Working in an office with documents and paperwork? You're learning key things about organization and metadata. You're volunteering at a historical society and sleeping in your parents' basement? Learn how to fix some shit. Spackle a wall for your parents. Learn how to take apart a carburetor (put it back together right though!). You can plug in useful skills anywhere.
So at this point, you're like “But, yo, I *am* really great and I have done all that personal improvement stuff!” And you point me to your online CV or portfolio which is several pages long and full of unicorn buzzwords. And I would respond: Yo, I know a bunch of really dope people who have had trouble finding library or archives work. This is not easy for anyone. I've absolutely been rejected for jobs too, and I'm self-aware enough to say that I bombed quite a few interviews. I looked great on paper but there were times that it didn't translate in person. Or I made a ridiculous gaffe during the interview. Because I'm human and stuff. Maybe you look great on paper but you're fucking up IRL. (*shrug*) It happens. Maybe there was an internal hire or some other political factor. Or maybe someone else was, believe or not, better than you. Maybe you had tart interview breath. Maybe the people doing the interview were discriminating against you for who you are (LGBTQ, older/younger, person of color, differently abled, mentally ill, poor, showing religious affiliation — in which case, fuck everyone on that search committee). You could “maybe” yourself to death, or you could start preparing that next resume.
The one thing I will add here is my personal, cultural context. I am an African-American woman who is edging closer to 40. I have been a working professional for 15 years and I'm an 80s baby, so I saw the end of the era where people worked at the same place for 30 years and the beginning of the “these jobs ain't loyal” era. My parents, who are Boomers, were also of the desegregation era, so in their schools and workplaces, they were frequently the very first black people to ever be in a place. Why does this matter? Context is everything. Because of their experiences in school and the workforce of having to work two and three times harder to overcome the lasting effects of discrimination and racism in society, they instilled the same work ethic into me and my sisters. My relationship to work is that it has not ever just been enough to be “great” in my job. I have to be outstanding. I have to be that unicorn. And generally speaking, always with a smile, lest I am considered “angry” or “hard to work with.” My experience does not negate someone else's — just giving a little background as to my thought process. I'm not perfect by any measure. I fail, I make mistakes regularly. But this is the mindset that was drilled into me from birth. At no point in time did my parents tell me that I would get anything out of it. They never said that if I did those things I would be guaranteed a job that I wanted, or any job at all, for that matter. I think they just hoped that it would stop me from ever being shot by police during a minor traffic stop or having to ask for money outside of the subway. I'm not unsympathetic or blind to the ways in which certain constructs make it hard for everyone to access the LIS field equally. I have to live with them every day. But with my background, my mind says if you have a master's degree, you have some skills that will allow you to eat doing something, but maybe you can't see what that something is yet. Is is libraries? Maybe not.
Turner network truTV has renewed eight of its shows in addition to greenlighting five more and putting four into development, the network announced during their upfront presentation in New York on Friday.
New seasons of “Impractical Jokers,” “Jon Glaser Loves Gear,” “The Carbonaro Effect,” “Hack My Life,” and “Comedy Knockout” will be joined in the 2017-2018 season by new shows including “Laff Mobb's Laff Tracks,” “At Home with Amy Sedaris,” and “Bobcat Goldthwait's Misfits & Monsters,” among others. The network's development pipeline includes projects from Molly Austin and Shamikah Martinez, Liza Treyger, The Kloons, and Rose Schlossberg.
truTV underwent an extensive rebranding that began in October 2014. In late 2016, the network unveiled a new tag line – Funny because its tru – highlighting its commitment to both scripted and unscripted comedy.
“Three years ago, when we announced our plan to totally reinvent truTV as a comedy network, people thought we were nuts and it would never work – but at least they were nice about it,” said Chris Linn, president of truTV. “Now, when we look at the quality and diversity in our programming slate and the talent we're bringing to our network – not to mention the strong momentum and high engagement we're building among our fans – we are incredibly proud of the work that's been done and how far we've come in a short time. Not only have we completely changed the programming slate, but truTV has evolved into a distinct brand that appeals not only to a higher level of talent, but also to more premium audiences and advertisers.”

The author of a plan to legalize the use of marijuana for a limited number of medical disorders said Friday that after more than a year victory is near.
Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, said that if the Senate passes their House Bill 1 as approved by a committee late Thursday, they will likely ask their House colleagues to accept those changes and send the bill to Gov. Nathan Deal's desk.
HB 1 was approved by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and must still go through the Senate Rules Committee before reaching the Senate floor.
Peake said they want to see the “final version after amendments and everything reading as expected.”
If that final version maintains the compromise worked out Thursday, they said, they expect to ask the House to agree.
“That's my plan and hope,” they said.
The Senate panel kept most of Peake's proposal in tact. Instead of their plan to allow suffers of nine disorders to use medical cannabis, the Senate limits it to just eight, deleting fibromyalgia. The Senate bill also puts minor restrictions on the type and quality of the cannabis oil that would be allowed.
Story highlights 'Star Trek: Discovery' executive producer Bryan Fuller spilled secrets about the new show on Wednesday
They say the casting will "absolutely" continue the series tradition of diversity
(CNN) On the same day CBS went on the defensive about the lack of diversity on its fall schedule, "Star Trek: Discovery" executive producer Bryan Fuller made clear that their new series will not have that problem.
Fuller announced Wednesday that the new show will feature a female lead character and honor the franchise's history of inclusion.
"'Star Trek' started with a wonderful expression of diversity in its cast. You had a Russian with a black woman and an Asian man amongst a Vulcan, which is a different kind of diversity," Fuller told reporters at a panel for the show at the Television Critics Association press tour. "We're absolutely continuing that tradition."
Fuller also said the new series will "absolutely" have a gay character.
This summer, "Star Trek: Beyond" revealed John Cho's Sulu to be the first openly gay character in the franchise's history.

(Reuters) - New York state's attorney general is probing whether three major Internet providers could be shortchanging consumers by charging them for faster broadband speeds and failing to deliver the speeds being advertised, according to documents seen by Reuters.
A photo illustration shows a USB device being plugged into a laptop computer in Berlin July 31, 2014. REUTERS/Thomas Peter
The letters, sent on Friday to executives at Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, ask each company to provide copies of all disclosures they have made to customers, as well as copies of any testing they may have done of their Internet speeds.
“New Yorkers deserve the Internet speeds they pay for. But, it turns out, many of us may be paying for one thing, and getting another,” Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.
In statements, spokespersons for the three companies expressed confidence in the speeds of their Internet services.
“We're confident that we provide our customers the speeds and services we promise them and look forward to working with the AG to resolve this matter,” Time Warner Cable spokesperson Bobby Amirshahi said.
Cablevision spokesperson Charlie Schueler said the company's Optimum Online service “consistently surpasses advertised broadband speeds, including in FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and internal tests. We are happy to provide any necessary performance information to the Attorney General as we do to our customers.”
A Verizon spokesperson said the company would cooperate with Schneiderman's office. “Verizon is confident in the robust and reliable Internet speeds it delivers to subscribers,” the spokesperson said.
The attorney general's investigation is particularly focused on so-called interconnection arrangements, or contractual deals that Internet service providers strike with other networks for the mutual exchange of data.
In the letters, Schneiderman's office says it is concerned that customers paying a premium for higher speeds may be experiencing a disruption in their service due to technical problems and business disputes over interconnection agreements.
A 2014 study by the Measurement Lab Consortium, or M-Lab, found that customers' Internet service tended to suffer at points where their broadband providers connected with long-haul Internet traffic carriers, including Cogent Communications Group Inc (CCOI.O).
“Internet service provider interconnection has a substantial impact on consumer Internet performance - sometimes a severely negative impact,” the study said, adding that business relationships rather than technical issues were often at the root of the problem.
A spokesperson for the attorney general's office said the 2014 study's findings, coupled with consumer complaints and internal analysis, prompted the inquiry into Internet speeds.
Some of the letters also raise questions about speeds delivered by Time Warner Cable and Cablevision to consumers over “the last mile,” a term that refers to the point where a telecommunication chain reaches a retail consumer's devices.
A former Wisconsin attorney general and a Milwaukee county supervisor who was subpoenaed by the John Doe prosecutor are both wondering why Scott Walker wasn't charged with violating the state's public records law while they were Milwaukee county executive.
The recently released 27,000 pages of documents from the first John Doe investigation provided enough evidence to bring such a charge, they say.
John Weishan, a Democrat and a critic of Walker on the Milwaukee County board, submitted an open records request for the computer communications in the county executive's office back in the spring of 2010. Weishan suspected at the time that Walker or members of their staff were doing campaign work on the public dime, which turned out to be the case.
But Weishan received only four vacuous pages back in response to their request, along with a bill for $2,800 and the accusation from Walker's staff that the supervisor was engaged in a "fishing expedition."
Today, Weishan says, they feel vindicated. The document dump "proves that everything I thought was going on at the time did take place," they say.
The documents show Walker regularly communicating on a private e-mail system during work hours both on campaign business and county business.
Cindy Archer, Walker's deputy, told another staffer about the secret communication network: "Consider yourself now in the 'inner circle.' :) I use this private account quite a bit to communicate with SKW." Those are Walker's initials.
In another e-mail, Walker asked Archer to "get me all the facts" to counter an attack by their Republican primary challenger.
Weishan points a finger directly at Walker.
"It's clear from the e-mails that not only did Scott Walker know but they were the head cheerleader in orchestrating keeping this secret and conducting business outside the realm of the public," Weishan says. "He actively engaged in business to defraud the public."
Weishan says that's a felony, and they add that "submitting a false response to an open records request is also a felony."
Weishan says the prosecutors asked for all the documents relating to their open records request, which they handed over to them. John Chisholm, the district attorney leading the investigation, along with assistant DA Bruce Landgraf, then interviewed them about this.
Weishan says they don't want to criticize Chisholm, but they add: "This is one of the few cases where it's extremely crystal clear that Walker not only conspired to break the open records law, but they did break the open records law."
That law states that "all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those officers and employees who represent them."
It adds that "an essential function of a representative government and an integral part of the routine duties of officers and employees whose responsibility it is to provide such information." This "shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of complete public access."
According to a "compliance outline" written by current Wisconsin attorney General JB Van Hollen, a Republican, public records include "e-mail sent or received on an authority's computer system" and "personal e-mail sent by officers or employees of the authority," as well as "e-mail conducting government business sent or received on the personal e-mail account of an authority's officer or employee."
It is a felony to violate this law. "Whoever with intent to injure or defraud destroys, damages, removes or conceals any public record is guilty of a Class H felony," the Wisconsin statutes say. And the penalty for a Class H felony is "a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 6 years, or both." Former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager, a Democrat, also believes there was sufficient evidence to indict Walker. They say the documents show two kinds of illegal activities: "One that are political, done on state time to coordinate campaign. And two, you've got these documents that should be public record, and clearly they did this to avoid public records laws."
The fact that Walker knew that campaign work was "being done on public time," says Lautenschlager, "coupled with the fact that they were on this secret system, is enough to show intent."
A lot can change in a couple years. In April 2014, Good Beer Hunting founder Michael Kiser was in New York to speak at an event. They and I took the opportunity to go on one of Joshua M. Bernstein's always-fun homebrew tours. The theme of this particular tour was homebrewers who had recently “gone pro” and opened a brewery. It was on the tour that I first met Rob Kolb and Anthony Accardi. The pair had just opened Transmitter Brewing in Long Island City at the edge of the Newtown Creek. They set up shop right below the Pulaski Bridge, which loomed above and cast a long shadow over their new digs. The two were old friends, ex-bike racers, and avid homebrewers before they went into business together.
Now, with just a couple years under their belt, and the New York City brew scene continuing its expansion, they've also expanded, upping their production and sending their Belgian-inspired farmhouse beers all over the city. Almost two years to the day from our homebrew tour introduction, I sat down with Kolb and Accardi to see how things are progressing.
Bitcoin Breaking News Brief R3 Seeks $200 Million In Funding
The innovation firm R3 CEV is a consortium focused on “empowering the next generation of global financial services technology.” According to the Financial News publication, the New York-based company has just announced its looking to raise $200 million USD from the some of the 42 banks involved with the group.

R3 Is Looking For It's Banking Buddies To Invest
Financial News reports that discussions are just beginning and the group's developers led by David Rutter have already been simulating the firms proof-of-concept. Back in April, the company revealed some info on its protocol Corda which they've been testing for the past six months. R3's chief technology officer Richard Gendal Brown details in a recent blog post that Corda isn't like your typical blockchain. The work has been researched and catered to at R3's development lab and products produced will not be owned by investors.
Distributed ledger technology has offered the world a new look at finance and can change the environment with a multitude of new technology use cases. Legacy institutions who are working with R3 include JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and more. At R3's Collaborative Lab, Tim Grant, stated back in March:
“This is the first time many ledgers have been run in parallel by many institutions in a rigorous, scientific way,”
According to the Financial News publication, a source said that one proposed idea on the table to raise money is a ten-year stake in the company and its operations. R3's development lab was described by David Rutter in an interview with American Banker's Robert Barba. Rutter explained the lab is under supervision and financial institutions are allowed to participate. Rutter states:
“It brings a technical discipline to make sure the experiments are run in a controlled fashion. We are taking a thoughtful approach to choosing our use cases in part because we are not venture-backed. We don't have to spin up some use case and promote how we are going to make billions of dollars in a short period of time. So, build the foundation first, then have a lab where very smart people come in and test proof of concepts. From there, we pick what we build to commercialize it.”
The difference between Corda and your average blockchain is the prototype is designed with industry standards and regulatory processes in mind. There is no native currency and CTO Richard Gendal Brown has established publicly on the R3 blog the Corda protocol is “not a blockchain.” If the company raises the $200 million, it will surely help push this new framework to global institutions. As the Financial Times states the conversation of funding has just begun but the firm is looking for backing from its banking constituents. With the blockchain fervor spreading across the finance world they just might get it.
R3 Is Not the Only Firm Trying to Sell This Technology
However, the R3 consortium has lots of competitors nipping at the blockchain phenomenon. On April 6th, a successful test of blockchain technology and smart contracts were used to manage post-trade lifecycle events for credit default swaps. The test was run by blockchain-based companies Axoni, and Markit amongst some legacy institutions. The banks who backed the working group included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan. So R3 has stiff competition in the privatized digital ledger field with the same financial institutions shopping the fintech market. Alongside these companies, there are others looking to offer enterprise blockchain solutions. Businesses like Chain, Gem, and projects such as Hyperledger are most likely also sweet talking and showcasing product to the same investors.

Whether you run a custom ROM or have a device from Samsung or LG that supports it, you might have the ability to enable a battery percentage monitor in your notification bar. Since the beginning, this feature wasn't built directly into Android for users to enable, but now with Kit Kat and the Nexus 5 out, it appears Google has finally built it in. The only issue so far is that some minor tweaking is needed to enable the feature.
If you have a Nexus 5, and are comfortable using adb, then all you need to do is type a single command and reboot your device. From there, you will see a white-on-white percentage on top of your battery. The issue with this is that you won't be able to see the percentage unless your battery is 50% drained or more to see it. This fact leads us to believe that this is why Google “hid” the feature for now. But still, it's a nice feature for people who like to have a numerical value placed on their battery life in the notification bar.
Here is what your battery will look like with the percentage enabled.
A developer on XDA has bundled the simple adb code into an installable APK, so messing with a computer is rendered unnecessary. Simply install the app, hit “Enable,” and then reboot. Again, keep in mind that the percentage text is white, so if you have a full battery or anything about 50%, it's pretty useless.
If you have a Nexus 5, go for it.

Fight Across Feudal Japan In Multiplayer Samurai Game Hanako
By Chris Priestman . January 28, 2015 . 4:28pm
Hanako – Soul of the Samurai drops you into 16th century feudal Japan as a samurai in order to fight across four different multiplayer campaigns.
There are also four classes to choose from, including the blade wielding Kenshi and Naginata Samurai, the Samurai Archer, and the deceptive Ninja. Obviously, whichever class you choose affects your play style, and you'll want to try to complement your skills with the classes that your fellow players pick. It helps that you can customize your samurai in their look and skills as you play through the game.
While the four campaigns have different objectives and strategies for you to try out, the overall goal is to either preserve the peace and honor of the Emperor, or to go rogue and focus your efforts in bringing chaos and death to Japan. You do this by choosing to side on the Hanako or Yamai side.
It seems that the campaigns consist of multiple game modes. One of which is a Battle Mode. This is a 16v16 team deathmatch, essentially. Teams have tickets that are spent with every respawn, and so the team that runs out of tickets first is the loser. Modes like this take place across large maps that should allow each class an equal chance against each other.
If you want to see the game in action then the livestreamed demo above gives a decent insight. However, do bear in mind that all of the footage is pre-alpha and so it will improve over time.
Any more information about Hanako that you want may be found on its website.
Kristyn Housman grabbed the end of a sampling auger, a steel tube that two colleagues had just drilled into a moss-covered hummock in a peat bog, and poked through a damp, fibrous plug of partly decomposed peat. Peat has been building up for centuries in this bog, where the spongy moss is interspersed with black spruces and, on a late spring morning, the air is teeming with mosquitoes. The sample, taken from a metre down, is at least several hundred years old, said Housman, a graduate researcher at McMaster University.
Warming temperatures can dry out northern peatlands, increasing the risk of fires that release thousands of years of stored carbon into the atmosphere. ( ED OU / The New York Times )
“There's literally tons of carbon here,” they said, looking around the bog, which covers several acres off a muddy oil-company road amid the vast flatness of northern Alberta. In discussions of how nature regulates carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, forests receive most of the attention for their ability to absorb and store carbon. But peatlands play an important role, too. There are an estimated 4.1 million square kilometres of peatlands, or about 3 per cent of the Earth's land surface, mostly in northern latitudes in Canada, Alaska, Europe and Russia.

Peat is made up of sphagnum and other mosses, which hold a large amount of water and contain compounds that inhibit decomposition. The peat slowly builds up over centuries because the annual growth exceeds the decay. A relatively small amount of peat is mined to burn as fuel, to improve backyard gardens or to add smokiness to Scotch. But most of it stays where it is, and because it accumulates carbon over such a long time, it contains more carbon than is in all the world's trees and plants, and nearly as much as the atmosphere does. Like forests, peatlands are threatened by climate change. Warming temperatures can dry out bogs, making them more susceptible to fires, and to deeper, more intense burning. A peat fire, which can smoulder like a cigarette for months, can release a lot of carbon. “It's carbon that has accumulated over several thousands of years,” said Mike Waddington, a McMaster professor who has been researching peat in Alberta and elsewhere for more than two decades. “If it were to be released, the global CO2 concentration would be much higher.” The world has already had vast releases of carbon from peat, in Indonesia. Last year, bogs that had been drained for agriculture, and were drier because of El Nino-related warmth, burned for months, creating a haze visible from space and causing widespread health problems. At their peak in September and October, the fires released more carbon per day than was emitted by the European Union.
While few people foresee that level of disaster in northern peatlands, concern about fires is growing. A major worry is that as climate change and other disturbances affect peatlands, the intensity of fires will increase, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere. “They take thousands of years to develop,” said Merritt Turetsky, a peat researcher at the University of Guelph. “And in five minutes, a wildfire can blow through that area and release 500 to 600 years of peat accumulation and change it forever.”

The enormous spring wildfire that destroyed much of Fort McMurray burned bogs as well as trees. In June, the trees were no longer on fire outside the town, but crews were overturning peat with backhoes in an effort to extinguish smouldering hot spots. In a large wildfire in May 2011 that burned in and around the town of Slave Lake, some peat continued to burn through the winter, until spring rains and melting snow finally extinguished it. Peat is generally resistant to burning, because sphagnum moss, which is dominant in a healthy bog, holds a lot of water. “If you have a large amount of this moss in a peatland, you aren't going to get a very severe fire,” Waddington said. Typically only the top few inches of the peat will burn. Warming, however, alters the system. Drier peat allows more oxygen to get to the roots of trees and other vegetation. This causes them to grow bigger, which means they use more water, further drying the peat. As trees grow, they also provide more shade, which favours the growth of other mosses that, because they hold less moisture than sphagnum, are less fire resistant. When the bog does catch fire, it may be more severe, with the combustion spreading deeper into the peat. Other disturbances, like draining bogs to grow trees or to produce oil and gas, can also make a fire more severe. Waddington and others are doing research on how to restore bogs that have been drained, to reduce the risk of carbon loss through fires. Normally a bog recovers slowly after a wildfire, with certain mosses and other vegetation taking over in stages until sphagnum mosses dominate. At the bog where Housman and their colleagues took samples, a section was deliberately burned last year. It is showing signs of recovery, with clumps of singed sphagnum moss already producing small shoots of regrowth. But an intense fire, or a combination of other factors, can delay or even halt recovery. That is the case at a small bog south of Red Earth Creek that researchers have nicknamed “Scorcho” because it was severely burned in the 2011 Slave Lake fire. As much as 1.2 metres of peat was consumed in some parts of the bog. “All that peat, combusted and gone,” said Sophie Wilkinson, a McMaster doctoral student. Five years later, the bog is showing few signs of returning to its old self. “It is definitely on the brink,” Wilkinson said. “There's little to no sphagnum recovery, which is very worrying, because if it's going to return to a carbon-accumulating system, which is what you would hope, really, it needs to get that sphagnum back.” Scorcho may ultimately turn into something other than a bog — drier land with leafy trees like birches and aspens replacing the black spruces, with little to no moss and, as a result, less carbon storage. The bog is laced with instruments to measure the water table, the evaporation of water from vegetation and other characteristics, but researchers are still uncertain why it is not recovering. What is clear is that recovery from a fire is a delicate process, one that global warming will complicate. “Climate change will determine the severity and frequency of burns the bog has to be resilient to,” Housman said. Referring to Scorcho, Wilkinson said: “Like, if this was to burn again? Who knows, really, what's going to happen.”

A Winnipeg woman who snapped photos of two city workers sleeping by their mowers is upset taxpayers could be paying for their midday nap.
Darlene Beaumont took the photos last week in Green Valley Bay Park, in the East Kildonan neighbourhood. They said their boyfriend first saw them snoozing just after 11:30 a.m., and when they checked an hour later, they saw them still dozing.
"I just thought like, what are they even doing back here when the grass was already cut four days prior?" they said.
So they took the photos.
It wasn't until 1:30 p.m. that Beaumont saw them starting to get up.
"I'm paying, our city taxes are paying for this — and this is what they're doing. It's not fair for us to pay for this," Beaumont said. "And the grass didn't even look like it was cut after they were even here."
Another Winnipegger, Stephanie Carson, also said they saw the workers sleeping.
"It was weird that they were just sleeping, and it looked like they were trying to hide themselves by the trees and the fence," said Carson.
Brennon Peters, who lives nearby, also spotted them. They aren't impressed.
"There's a lot of people looking for jobs that are willing to work, and they're not getting the jobs, and there's people like that just sitting there doing nothing," said Peters.
A city spokesperson told CBC News, "We are not able to accommodate an interview," but confirmed city staff were involved.
"Although these incidents are rare, we take these matters very seriously and are taking appropriate action," the spokesperson said. "We cannot discuss personnel matters publicly."
Union president Mike Davidson of CUPE Local 500 says they are waiting to hear the results of the investigation but said 99 per cent of CUPE workers do their jobs well every day without any issues.
IDF soldiers raided a gun-making workshop in the West Bank early Monday morning, which the army described as one of the largest weapons factories ever found there.
The workshop was located in the underground basement of a residential building in the city of Hebron.
IDF forces confiscated 15 lathes for producing guns, dozens of Carl Gustav-style guns, parts of M-16 rifles and large quantities of ammunition, according to an IDF colonel who took part in the raid.

The owner of the factory and their son were arrested by the IDF.
In the past year, Israeli security forces have shut down 40 gun-making workshops, which manufactured guns such as those used in the Sarona Market shooting attack in Tel Aviv in June, and which have become ubiquitous throughout the West Bank during the recent terror wave.
Israeli security forces have also confiscated over 420 guns during this time, according to an IDF spokesperson.
Since a nearly year-long wave of terrorist attacks began in October 2015, Israeli security forces have carried out nightly arrests of Palestinians in the West Bank possessing weapons and involved in gun manufacturing and smuggling.
While many of the hundreds of weapons captured were army issue, others were improvised weapons built in illegal gun making workshops. Their street value is significantly less than higher quality guns such as a M-16 rifle, making them easier to acquire.

We are the planet's greatest diggers and miners. For tens of thousands of years humans have chipped away beneath the soils of this vast rocky planet, plundering its hard surface for tools, building materials and sparkling jewels. The question is what's driven our hunger to churn up more and more of our planet's rocks and sediments and spread it around the surface, and does it matter?
We're not the only species to recognise the value in strong, inert materials – chimps use stone tools and Neanderthals mined flint in Europe – but we're the only creatures to have delved further to reach the metals and other minerals within. Whole civilizations have been based on this – some metals became so important that they defined cultural periods, the Iron Age and the Bronze Age, for example. Empires extended across the seas in search of precious metals, gems and fuels. The Romans invaded Britain for its metals, using hydraulic mining to harvest gold from deep within the rocks. Spain's wealth 400 years ago is largely attributable to silver scraped from the hills of Potosi in Bolivia.
Some of this unearthed treasure, such as iron, was created billions of years ago inside a star; others, such as coal, were more recently formed from living forests that were buried in bogs and compressed by sediments some 300 million years ago. Some of these mined materials, like iron, are common in the Earth's crust, some are rare, but none of these are replaceable or renewable within a thousands-of-years timeframe.
The industrial revolution, which made Britain the powerhouse of the world, catalysed a sharp increase in the volume of mining. Steam power, fuelled by coal, rapidly increased our capacity to delve for materials (including coal), as well as transporting and processing it. In 1700, more than 80% of the world's coal was mined in Britain. Over the 18th and 19th centuries, as technologies improved, speculators explored new territory across Africa, Australia and the United States, looking for gold and other high-value metals and gems.
But it is over the past 60 years that we've witnessed a truly global revolution in the scale of our mining and extractions. We now move more than three times as much sediment and rocky materials than all the world's rivers, glaciers, wind and rain combined, according to sedimentary geologist James Syvitski of Instaar, University of Colorado, Boulder.
“Every year, rivers move about 13 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of sediment. To put that in perspective, 1 GT [gigatonne] is equivalent to 2 Great Walls of China,” Syvitski says. “We already mine around 9 GT of coal each year – by 2030, it will be 13 GT of coal. And we produce 13 GT of aggregate, 2 GT of iron ore each year….”
We are sculpting the Earth's surface and taking material away at rates not seen before in geological time, says Syvitski. “There are millions of holes and burrows through the rock – kilometres long – from our drilling expeditions,” they say. We've left 568,000 mines abandoned in the US alone, and many millions more throughout the world.
Unchartered wealth
We are even plundering some of the most inhospitable places on the planet, such as the freezing Arctic Ocean, the burning Atacama Desert and the deepest Atlantic, to reach oil and gas, diamonds and copper, uranium and rare metals that were unknown decades earlier but are now an indispensable part of the conveniences of modern life.
New “finds” promise untold wealth to the territories they lie beneath – and to the speculating companies that dig and drill – so nations from Uganda to Brazil are eagerly pursuing all explorations. The world has already seen some of the poorest nations dramatically rise to prosperity after substantial finds. Saudi Arabia, for example, is now one of the wealthiest nations after vast oil and gas wells were drilled, and Botswana has rapidly risen from poverty to a functioning, economically healthy democracy after diamonds were discovered.
However, such wealth has not come without its problems. Mining is a dirty, dangerous business. The world watched in horror as dozens of miners were trapped for months below ground in Chile in 2010. They were rescued, but a few months later workers in a New Zealand mine were less fortunate. These incidents occurred in some of the world's best-run mines operated by the biggest companies: every year, thousands of small-time miners, many operating in illegal shafts under terrible conditions, perish without publicity. In China alone, around 50 miners die each week.
Mines are often plunged into land owned by poor local people with few rights, who have received little or no profit or compensation for their polluted fields, air, waterways or wildlands. Nigeria's Niger Delta is a ruined slick of oil spills and leaks, which continues to poison the health of some of the world's poorest people, infiltrates their drinking water and farmland, and kills fish. The ongoing environmental catastrophe there shows no signs of abating while one of the world's richest oil companies pollutes with near-impunity and the poor continue to illegally tap the pipes, spilling and spreading the noxious liquid. Across the globe, from the Amazon to the Gulf of Mexico, oil formed from the burial, millions of years ago, of algae and plankton has been spilt and spread around the terrestrial surface with ecologically devastating consequences.
Running out
Coal and oil are not the only buried pollutants we're bringing to the surface. Mining involves huge amounts of energy – obtained from burning fossil fuels – and water, often in places where both are scarce, which increases environmental pressure, and producing greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. And the methods used to separate out desired metals from the rest of the rock are often poisonous – whole river systems have been contaminated with mercury from gold panning, for example.
In our haste to reach the buried materials, we have resculpted the landscape, carving the tops from mountains, boring and shattering the ground with fracking, creating new mountains of slag and rock, even making artificial islands where none have existed before. The palm-shaped island off the coast of Dubai was formed from some 400 million tonnes of geological material, says Simon Price of the British Geological Survey, who studied it. "All the materials we use to build our modern world – our cities of glass and concrete and steel – are made from geological ingredients that are mined and put together in unnatural combinations," Price says.
Our hunger to reshape the planet with Earth-moving machinery is inching us closer and closer to a troubling end-point: we are depleting some resources to the extent that they are in danger of running out, or at least becoming economically unviable to extract, and our mining is moving into ever-more environmentally fragile areas.
In the next column, I'll be asking whether it's time to slow our planetary plundering, and I'll be looking at what happened in the last 60 years to produce such an escalation in our lust for Earthly materials.
On Wednesday 21 November, you can hear my conversation with Simon Price and others, as we discuss the changes humans are making to the planet in the Anthropocene, on Frontiers, BBC Radio 4 at 2100 GMT.

Lofty predictions for sizable hedge fund industry support for the Donald Trump presidential campaign have fallen short, as public filings indicated a relatively modest showing from that group for July.
Filings made with the Federal Election Commission suggest that the Trump effort took in little more than $2 million in hedge fund money last month — and that the bulk of it came largely from a single donor, Renaissance Technologies co-chief Robert Mercer.
Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign donations and spending, said that while the absolute amounts of money hedge funds are giving to Trump may appear low, the trend for them is positive. "We can see that it has gone from a pittance — a mere thousand of dollars — to millions, but it's impossible for us to say at this point what the final figure is for July," said Krumholz. "It's possible we'll see, if not a sea change, then a big leap forward for Trump."
Spokespeople for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
The pro-Trump Great America PAC, the pro-Hillary Clinton Priorities USA PAC and other monthly filers were supposed to log their latest fundraising and spending records no later than midnight on Sunday morning. [However, even by Monday afternoon, the picture remained incomplete: other important filers, including the Trump Victory PAC, are on a quarterly schedule, and because some entities may have made paper filings not yet updated online, additional details have yet to surface.]
In an interview with Fortune a few weeks ago, Anthony Scaramucci, the fund-of-funds manager who is also an outspoken Trump supporter, predicted that some 20 percent of the estimated $70 million the Trump campaign had taken in in July was from hedge funds — a haul that would have amounted to about $14 million.
Scaramucci themselves recently donated $100,000 to the PAC Trump Victory and at least an additional $90,200 to the Republican National Committee, as well as to the Trump campaign and Paul Ryan's congressional campaign, among other entities, according to FEC records. They don't appear to have given additional donations in July, and declined to elaborate on their comments to Fortune.
But the participation of other hedge fund executives has been muted.
Bridgeport man reports gun stolen, cited for illegal magazine
NORWALK — A Bridgeport man found themselves in hot water after reporting a gun with an illegal high capacity magazine had been stolen from their vehicle.
On Sunday, Edward Reeves, 41, of Bishop Avenue, contacted police to report that while inside a bar on Ely Avenue they believed that a handgun they had left inside their locked car had been stolen.
Detectives responded and observed that there had been no evidence of the car having been broken into.
Later that day, Reeves reportedly found the gun in their refrigerator at home and contacted police to report that they had located it.
They were asked to bring the gun to police headquarters when it was determined that the gun had a 16 bullet capacity magazine. Current law allows for no more than a magazine capacity of 10.
Reeves was cited by police for being in violation of the high-capacity magazine law.
More than 400 miners for Armstrong Coal in Ohio County, Kentucky, will be out of a job. The company issued a WARN notice, stating it plans to close all of its mines in Kentucky. This closure will affect 427 miners in the region.
In November, Armstrong filed for bankruptcy protection and agreed to transfer all assets to a “newly created entity” that will be jointly owned by Knight Hawk Holdings and some of Armstrong's creditors. The transaction is expected to close in February of 2018.
Beginning on February 14th, Armstrong expects to permanently lay off all of its employees at all of its facilities in Kentucky.
Those facilities include:
– Lewis Creek Surface Mine, 3212 KY 85E, Centertown Kentucky
– Midway Preparation Plant, 1720 M2, Centertown Kentucky
– Armstrong Prep & Dock, 660 A12 Road, Centertown Kentucky
– Parkway Preparation Plant, 2800 River Haul Road, Central City Kentucky
– Kronos Underground Mine, 175 Matanzas Road, Centertown Kentucky
– Armstrong Madisonville Office, 405 Brown Road, Madisonville
– Armstrong Training Center, 1550 Grove Road, Centertown Kentucky
Since the company's assets are anticipated to be acquired by another entity, that entity will determine whether the facilities listed above will be closed, or whether operations will continue in the same capacity, diminished manner, or in another manner after said transaction.
The layoffs are expected to be complete no later than February 28, 2018.
Armstrong Coal operates five coal mines in Ohio and Muhlenberg counties.

This interior panel from the famous Gundestrup cauldron appears to show a line of seven mail-clad, shield and spear-wielding Celtic warriors advancing in a line from right to left towards a giant warrior who appears to be holding the body of another small warrior over a vessel of some sort. A dog or wolf appears to jump up at their feet. Proceeding from the giant along the upper row, are a line of four finely-arrayed horsemen with elite crested helmets, passing from left to right. Preceding them is a snake. The footsoldiers of the bottom row are followed by three carnyx (boar-headed celtic war-horn) players, whose horns reach up to face the cavalry riding back towards them, and the snake 'flies' above the horn chanters. Separating the rows of footmen and cavlry is a branch from which sprouts foliage or flowers. The metalwork around this is textured, suggesting an aura, a river or a footpath. The 'spears' of the footmen seem to connect with the trunk of the branch.
Symbolism interpreted:
The silver Gundestrup cauldron was probably a ritual deposit in water, pledged to the gods, as it was discovered in pieces in a Danish bog in 1891. Such deposits were an archaeological feature of Europe's 'Atlantic Bronze Age' which were influential upon the Celtic Iron Age cultures of north and central Europe. The organised style of the warriors, their mail suits and war trumpets seem date the cauldron between the 3rdC BCE and the 1stC CE during which time there were broad military and cultural interactions between Celtic tribes of Gaul and those of south and central Europe, explaining the artistic styles (and that of the armour) depicted on the cauldron: In fact, some design elements on the cauldron are so similar to those on objects found in the 'Letnica Hoard' (Bulgaria) to suggest a Gallo-Thracian origin for at least some of the panels. The cauldron shows aspects of both military and spiritual ideas of the afterlife which commentators typically associate with Celtic Iron Age culture.
Our 'warrior' panel shows some key features of a warfare-oriented view of reincarnation:
The footsoldiers:
These are 'ordinary' footsoldiers kitted uniformly for war with shields, spears and chainmail vests. There are seven armed men and three carnyx players. The last of the armed men carries no shield, and may be a youth, as they stand below the topmost 'sprout' of the tree-like design above their heads. They are clearly marching into battle, towards the dog/wolf and the giant figure with their cauldron, who appears to be placing one in or pulling one out of the cauldron. The soldiers are marching in the direction of the roots of the asupervisorstioned tree design. Interestingly, it can be seen that their chainmail hauberks finish at the knee, below which they appear to wear hose and rawhide sandals on their feet, similar to those still in use in Ireland and the Isle of Man into the 19thC.
The giant warrior and their 'cauldron':
The giant warrior's cauldron or vessel appears to be a metaphor for some kind of rebirth promised to the valiant footsoldiers, as proceeding from it in the opposite direction to them are a line of mounted knights with fabulous helmets. The womb-like metaphor for the cauldron as a symbol for rebirth is found in the 'Second Branch' of the medieval Welsh epic tales known as Mabinogion in which the giant, Brân, owns a cauldron which revives the dead. In the case of the Gundestrup cauldron, two things appear to be emerging from this giant's cauldron – glorified warriors and a tree. This has echoes of the Yggdrasil tree mentioned in the 12thC Icelandic accounts of Scandinavian pagan legends: at the base of Yggdrasil were a number of wells from which the lives and fates of men flowed. At the base of the tree, gnawing animals and serpents were found: aspects of the ancient empirical idea of regeneration through putrefaction: these are also represented on the Gundestrup cauldron by the snake and the dog. The message of the panel is that the masculine god of the Otherworld (here portrayed also as a warrior, therefore a 'colleague) promises regeneration to those who glorify themselves in battle, and the new existence may have greater glory, represented by:
The four knights:
Proceeding from the apparent god and their cauldron are four mounted men (knights), remarkable for their elaborate crested helmets. The horses and more beautiful helmets mark them out as part of the warrior elite, and the implication of their appearance in the panel is that valiant footsoldiers might become so great – either through death or attainment. It is notable that there are only four knights, compared to the eight warriors going towards the cauldron (including the man held by the 'god'). Assuming that all of the soldiers on the lower row were looking forward to death in battle, then the panel suggests only four of these seem to have achieved a more glorious reincarnation! This again links to the Norse accounts of beliefs about death of warriors in battle which suggest that only half of the slain went with Odinn to Valhöll. Another interesting concordance.
So what of the other four warriors – what might the panel say about these? We are left with two interesting possibilities:
The first is represented by the animals in the image: first of these are the cavalrymen's horses, which would bring the number of sentient beings up to eight in the top row. The other is the ravenous dog or wolf, who like the crows and carrion birds depicted elsewhere on the cauldron would be features of any battlefield. The folklore of hosts of the restless dead remaining in Atlantic Europe after the Iron Age seems to have relevance here: the Sluagh Sidhe of the Gaelic world, and the 'Wild Hunt' of the Germanic world in particular. It may be that the souls of the unglorified were believed to have been incarnated in the form of the animals who haunt battlefields and the margins of human habitation: the corvidae (crows), vultures, wolves, dogs and foxes. By consuming the flesh of the glorious and providing good deeds in the form of omens and warnings, they might find themselves given a better incarnation in the next life, as well as speeding the recovery of the battlefield etc.
The second possibility of reincarnation is represented by the tree – the ancient metaphor for human generations: 'root, branch and seed'. The panel's design with the tree apparently growing from it suggests the dead are fertilising the regrowth of future generations, perhaps implying the reincarnation of less worthy footsoldiers as humans, ready for another 'go' at attaining greater glory. My feeling, based on the residual folklore and traditions of Europe, is that the truth probably lies somewhere between these two suggestions. The transmigration of souls (described by Roman authors as a central tenet of Gallic/Celtic faith) might lead to a number of outcomes, based variously upon the achievements of individuals in this life: a glorious afterlife, reincarnation as a human, or even a cavalryman's horse, or as a restless ravening creature who plays an important role in the regeneration processes of nature, and who might offer auguries to the living. The calls of ravens and crows, the flight-patterns of birds and the calls and shouts of canines and horses, were all recorded as potential sources of augury in ancient Europe until at least the middle ages.
The snake and the Carnyxes:
The snake has been a symbol of reincarnation for a very long time, based upon their continuous unblinking stare, their shedding their skins, their love of chthonic lairs from which they emerge into daylight, and from their ancient philosophical (morphological) classification along with worms, larvae and maggots as part of natural putrefaction and regenerative processes of nature. The snake is also notable for the visceral, terrifying/transfixing ability it has over its prey, bringing us here to discuss the Carnyx, above which the snake is positioned in the panel. The was the war-trumpet par-excellence of the Celts, whose terrifying cacophonic honking seemed designed to evoke the enraged squeals and bellows of an attacking boar, stag or bull, augmenting the terrifying transfixing effect of soldiers' war-cries upon an enemy. The horn was apparently a potent weapon in itself, designed – like the gaze of the snake – to sap the morale of the enemy.
Summary:
This panel appears to show imagery promising soldiers reincarnation in battle. Their deaths are being 'inverted' into a renewed, more glorious life, and the cauldron and tree act as a central metaphor of regrowth from the well of life, with the dog and snake representing the earthly and allegorical forms of this natural process.
Work requirements coming to Medicaid?
WORK REQUIREMENTS COMING TO MEDICAID? — CMS is developing guidance on how states could use waivers for work requirements in Medicaid, a proposal that would represent a major philosophical shift for the 52-year-old entitlement, POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan reports.
The guidance is expected to be outlined in a letter to state Medicaid directors, individuals with knowledge of the forthcoming proposal tell Rachana. Several GOP states have asked to link Medicaid benefits with employment or other job-related activities — but their requests have languished with federal officials.
Story Continued Below
— Trump's top health officials have said they want work requirements. CMS administrator Seema Verma and others have previously defended the policy, saying that it's necessary as Medicaid has expanded. For instance, the program now covers millions of low-income adults who aren't disabled and primarily don't have dependent children.
— But support from Verma and others hasn't yet translated into action. At least seven states — Kentucky, Indiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Maine, Wisconsin and Kansas — have either already asked the Trump administration to approve Medicaid waivers that include work requirements or will submit proposals shortly.
— A fight is looming. There are still outstanding questions about CMS' forthcoming framework, Rachana tells PULSE, like the types of exemptions that might apply even when a state receives approval.
One outcome is virtually inevitable: lawsuits. Democrats and left-leaning consumer advocate groups have fiercely protested tying Medicaid benefits to employment, arguing that it would set back the program's goal of providing health coverage to low-income Americans.
CMS is readying guidance on how state Medicaid programs can add work requirements. | Getty

PAUL RYAN: REPEAL OF ACA MANDATE 'BEING DISCUSSED' AS PART OF TAX PLAN — The House speaker said on "Fox News Sunday" that there's an "active conversation" about how to improve the tax plan, which could include repealing the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.
"That's one of the things that's being discussed," Ryan said. "That's among the ideas that a lot of members are suggesting that we could add to this bill to make it even better." See 39-second video clip.
— CBO to weigh in. The budget office's updated score of repealing the individual mandate, which Ways and Means chairperson Kevin Brady said they have requested, could come as soon as today. In the last analysis CBO found that repealing the mandate would save more than $400 billion over a decade — which could help Republicans pay for their tax plan — but also leave 15 million more Americans without health insurance. President Donald Trump has pushed for including a mandate repeal in the bill, but Brady and others have said they worry it will make it even harder to get a tax bill through the Senate.
— Ryan also says more entitlement reform is coming. "I wish the ObamaCare bill would have passed, which would have been good fiscal responsibility, entitlement reform legislation," Ryan lamented, noting that their chamber moved a bill that died in the Senate. "We're just going to keep going at entitlement reform all the way down the road."
ADVOCATES LOOK TO MAKE OPIOIDS A TOP ISSUE IN THE 2018 MIDTERMS — Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy is working with advocacy groups and former Surgeons General Vivek Murthy and David Satcher on an effort to hold current lawmakers accountable, POLITICO's Brianna Ehley reports.
— The advocates' plan: To create a legislative scorecard that would hold lawmakers accountable on their response to the opioid crisis ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Kennedy told Brianna he'll meet with various groups to come up with metrics to measure lawmakers' commitment to fighting the epidemic, including voting records and who's donating to their campaigns.
Kennedy said they also want to examine how to score agency secretaries' efforts to carry out the recommendations made by the president's opioid commission, on which they serve.
"We need to hold them to their words," Kennedy said.
… The opioid epidemic was a key issue in several 2016 congressional races. Advocates are hoping to keep the momentum going into the next election cycle.
THIS IS MONDAY PULSE — Where we were reminded, yet again, that we live in two Americas when it comes to health care and the ACA. According to a WaPo/ABC News poll posted Sunday, 64 percent of Republicans think Trump is trying to make the federal health law "work as well as it can," while 80 percent of Democrats say that the president is "trying to make it fail." And overall, 59 percent of Republicans think the president has done a "good" or "excellent" job improving the health system.
Which America do you reside in? Feel free to share the view. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.

OHIO: WHY A LIBERAL ACTIVIST IS TEAMING WITH GOP STRATEGISTS ON DRUG PRICES — Voters in the Buckeye State on Tuesday will decide the most expensive ballot referendum that Ohio has ever seen. If approved, Issue 2 would require that state agencies purchase prescription drugs at prices no higher than those paid by the VA, which typically gets the lowest prices on medicines in the country.
The effort is backed by Michael Weinstein — a progressive activist and head of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation who tried and failed to get a virtually identical measure passed in California last year. But Weinstein has a new set of allies in Ohio: seasoned Republican operatives. And the unusual bedfellows say they're pushing on a public health issue that transcends politics and has prompted bipartisan frustration, POLITICO's Sarah Karlin-Smith writes. More for Pros.
INSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING
HHS launches $10 million teen pregnancy prevention effort. The agency on Friday said it's starting a new initiative, through a partnership with Mathematica Policy Research and RTI International, to try and reduce teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.
But the timing is notable, Pro's Paul Demko notes: The Trump administration cut off more than $200 million for teen pregnancy prevention grants earlier this year. More for Pros.
Why HHS says it canceled $200 million in teen pregnancy prevention grants: The investment didn't pay off. "The very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs stands in stark contrast to the promised results, jeopardizing the youth who were served, while also proving to be a poor use of more than $800 million in taxpayer dollars," an HHS spokesperson told Paul.
For instance, HHS said that only four of 37 programs showed "sustained and positive impacts." Meanwhile, the agency said that about three-quarters of the programs "were found to have negative or no impact on the behavior of the teens … [such as] an increased likelihood of beginning to have sex, increased likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex, and an increased likelihood of becoming pregnant."
AROUND THE NATION
STATE WEEK: States continue scrambling to keep CHIP afloat. With Congress failing to reauthorize the program more than 35 days ago, and the legislation to extend funding caught up in a partisan fight, states are making contingency plans to keep their programs running as they wait on Capitol Hill to approve new funding.
For instance, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey last week outlined their backup plan to keep roughly 23,000 children covered. Minnesota and Utah also have received additional funding from CMS. More for Pros.
Connecticut: How CHIP delay is putting health centers at risk. Your PULSE correspondent spent part of their trip to New Haven last week trying to understand if and how the delay in funding CHIP is having real-world consequences. According to Suzanne Lagarde — a doctor who runs Fair Haven Community Health Center, one of the city's two federally qualified health centers — the CHIP funding fight is already messing with their financial situation.
"Fair Haven was denied a loan application several months ago, due in large part to the uncertainty of funding," Lagarde told PULSE. And "if this funding isn't renewed... we would have to undertake major layoffs and program cuts."
Texas: Authorities release undocumented girl detained in hospital. The 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was released on Friday to their family, according to a statement from Rep. Joaquin Castro.
The girl, Rosa Maria Hernandez, has been at the center of a growing storm about immigration authorities stepping up enforcement actions in sensitive locations. The child was stopped on their way to a medical procedure in late October, followed to a Corpus Christi hospital, and post-discharge was placed in a shelter for unaccompanied minors in San Antonio — even though their parents and grandfather, who is a legal U.S. resident, live in Laredo. Hernandez has lived in the United States since they were three months old.
… "Moving forward, we must address the Trump Administration's callous actions," Castro said in a statement. "The United States should not be a place where children seeking life-sustaining medical care are at risk of apprehension."
NAMES IN THE NEWS
Joe Swedish reportedly leaving Anthem. Swedish is planning to step down, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday night, to be replaced by Gail Boudreaux.
Swedish's departure would come in the wake of a failed merger between Anthem, the nation's second-largest carrier, and Cigna; the two carriers are now suing each other. Boudreaux is the previous CEO of the biggest U.S. health insurer, the insurance arm of UnitedHealthGroup.
James Mathews appointed the new executive director at MedPAC. Mathews replaced longtime executive director Mark Miller, who on Friday announced they were leaving the commission after 15 years to work for the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.
Association for Accessible Medicines staffs up. AAM is adding Brett Michelin and Ashlie Van Meter as director and senior director of its state government affairs team, respectively. Michelin previously served as a VP at the California Medical Association and a top aide in the California State Senate. Van Meter had been at Quest Diagnostics as director of state and regulatory affairs and was previously at Allergan before that.
Mark Nagy elected chairperson of the National Pharmaceutical Council's board. Nagy — vice president for global patient outcomes and real world evidence at Eli Lilly — previously was vice chair of the board. NPC's board of directors also added other members to its executive committee, including naming Rich Bagger — a Celgene executive who also worked on the Trump transition — as the new vice chair.

It's no secret that baseball – and fantasy baseball, for that matter – is a numbers game. We continuously discuss batting averages, slugging percentages and strikeout rates, and the sabermetric community has inundated us with acronyms like xFIP, BABIP and ISO that take the numbers game to a whole new level. Maybe we acknowledge a tweak we see in a player's mechanics, but it all comes down to the hardcore figures in the end.
But what if it's not just about the numbers? What if your fantasy baseball success rides on a leap of faith? Maybe a player's track record and past numbers tell one story, but everything you're seeing right now tells another. So goes the life of a Yasiel Puig owner.
If you want to start with the numbers, yes, the past three years have been a colossal disappointment. They burst onto the scene in 2013 with that power/speed combo fantasy owners salivate over, and when the 2014 season was nearing, many had them pegged as a second-round, must-have talent. Some folks even took them at the tail end of the first. They were 2014's version of Trea Turner.
But not only did Puig fail to live up to the hype, but their off-the-field issues – the bat flips, the questions about their work ethic – took on a much greater focus than their on-the field performance. They clashed with their manager, Don Mattingly, and when the Dodgers made the change to Dave Roberts, there was more talk about how Roberts would handle Puig's attitude than there was about adjustments the enigmatic outfielder needed to make at the plate. The first half of 2016 picked up right where 2015 left off, and Puig remained one of the least desirable outfielders to own for fantasy baseball purposes. They were the real-life Ebby Calvin “Nuke” LaLoosh with their million-dollar talent and five-cent head.
But this year, we're seeing a different Yasiel Puig. They opened the season strong and after a brief, four-game slump (4-for-22), he's back raking and putting that million-dollar talent back on display. They hit safely in five straight games, flashed both power and speed and is currently batting .304 with four home runs, 11 RBI and two stolen bases. We're talking about the change in their batting stance where he's showing their back more to the pitcher and generating more power with their hip rotation and quick hands, while also noting their improved patience at the plate, as evidenced by their overall swing rates and resistance to chasing pitches outside the zone. Surprisingly, there hasn't been one single mention of them showing up late for practice or their behavior at a club the night before.
Because of their reputation, though, people's belief in their improved work on the field is lessened by the concern over them falling back into their bad habits. As a fantasy owner, it becomes very difficult to trust a player like that, regardless of their current production. And that's where the leap of faith must come in.
You've seen the results in the numbers. Now you have to eliminate the behavior concerns. The only way to do that is to cast aside your preconceived notions and take the player at face value.
It helps if you've had your own personal experiences with growing up. Think back to what you were like in your early 20s and imagine yourself running around a city the likes of which you've never seen before. Now throw in tens of thousands of people cheering your name and being handed millions of dollars (and, in Puig's case, the culture shock of coming from Cuba). It's all a bit overwhelming, don't you think?
But here we are now four years removed from that first season. No one is cheering your name, the media is criticizing your every move and while you still have your millions, enjoying it has become increasingly difficult. Things like that tend to make a person grow.
Puig saw a bit of resurgence during the second half of last season and spent the entire offseason working on their mechanics. They spent hours tweaking their batting stance and brought back the skills that made them such a dynamic player when they first arrived. We know the skill set is there, and we've seen some pretty solid early-season returns on their newfound work ethic. Now fantasy owners need to take that leap of faith. We need to give Puig the benefit of the doubt. Could they fall back into their old habits? Sure. But if they don't and you've dismissed the changes out of fear, you'll be missing out on what could be a spectacular breakout campaign.
NYC Pest Complaints

NEW YORK (AP) -- New York is losing the rat race.
Citizen complaints about pests to the 311 hotline plus online reports went from 22,300 in fiscal year 2012 to 24,586 the next year, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said Sunday.
"Rats are a daily, stomach-turning insult to New Yorkers -- whether they're scurrying over people's feet on the sidewalks, invading homes where children sleep or swarming through restaurants," Stringer said.
Stringer said an audit conducted by their office found that the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene isn't managing its pest control program effectively. The audit said health inspectors didn't always follow their own protocols, and in 160 cases, no field inspection was conducted.
"Without a vigilant and timely response by the city to citizen complaints, this problem will come back to bite us again and again," they said.
The health department issued a statement saying the agency "strongly disagrees" with the audit and is taking a proactive response to exterminating pests in the city.
"We believe the auditors reached incorrect conclusions because they focused only on complaints while ignoring the fact that complaint response is a small part of the department's overall approach to discovering where rats are present, notifying owners about how to respond, and carrying out targeted efforts to exterminate and prevent rats from re-emerging," the department said.
Auditors found that in 24 percent of the cases examined, the agency did not check out complaints within its own 10-day target, Stringer said. In addition, action was stopped prematurely on some complaints before the required number of inspection attempts, according to the audit. And in fiscal year 2013, there was no indication that assessments were conducted in 44 percent of 386 instances where inspectors requested cleanup services.
The comptroller also reported that the department failed to notify some property owners about city orders to eliminate rodent conditions, increasing the risk that rat infestations could spread through a neighborhood.
The comptroller's office recommends that the health department identify complaints that have been pending a long time, ensure complaints are not closed after only one failed attempt to gain access to a site, and make sure problems in the field have been dealt with efficiently and completely.
When I announced that I would be traveling through some areas of the southeast this summer, [Slade] from Freeside Atlanta emailed me to set up a stop at their hackerspace. I am very happy they did too, because this place was really cool. [Steven Sutton] agreed to walk us through the facility and did a great job of being the tour guide.
Freeside Hackerspace is a 5,500 square foot facility that feels like it just goes on and on. We were greeted with a nice clean work area up front that had 3d printers, collaborative spaces, electronics workstations, a classroom, and project storage. As we moved further back, we found the bar and lounge area complete with kegerator, giant cnc cut pterodactyl, projection system, and several comfy looking sofas.
After we passed through a pair of doors labelled “workshop”, we were greeted with an area more suited to manufacturing filled with lathes, workbenches, all the power tools you could imagine, and even two auto bays. If you have a project in mind, they've got the space and tools to make it happen.
I'm still in South Carolina, and would love to visit some more hackerspaces if they fall into our path. If you know of one that is along our route back. let me know. We're currently in Hilton Head South carolina, but our trip back will take us to Beufort SC. Then, we'll pass through Franklin NC,Chattanooga TN, Nashville TN, and Paducha KY before we finally head home.
(Newser) – Bristol Palin just learned the hard way that darkness can lurk in Internet comment threads. It seems Palin's post criticizing President Obama's gay-marriage stance upset more than a few people, and they let them know it in no uncertain terms. In a new blog post, spotted by the New York Daily News, Palin re-posts some of the worst comments, saying that "the only word that really sums them up is 'bullying.'"
"bristol: kill yourself you fat f--k," reads one comment. "you are offensively stupid," reads another, "you're an argument for abortion. your child would be better off without you to 'guide' it through life." Still another tells them that "You all, including your son, deserve a slow, painful, and miserable death." Palin is appalled. "Around Hollywood there are lots of … great initiatives to try to encourage more kindness in the world," they write. "Then why do I get so many messages telling me I should die?"

August 18, 2011 Hunting Stories
Bucket List: Defined as a list of things you want to do before you die, or rather before you “kick the bucket”. Every hunter has one, a list of places they want to explore or hunt before that day finally comes and they're called to meet their maker. This is a list of places that I hope to one day go and find game. I hope you enjoy it!
Alaska
The largest state in the U.S. is often a “bucket list” location for hunters, American or not. Just the name makes outdoorsmen (and women) drool at the possibility of setting foot in field, conjures up dreams of float trips to chase large grizzly bears or drop camps to pursue giant moose over the land area of 586,412 square miles or roughly one-fifth the size of lower 48 states.
Alaska is one of the last truly wild places in this nation and a land that will leave most people breathless. Flights to Anchorage are affordable and the state offers many opportunities to pursue their 10 big game species, as well as some of the best fishing experiences in the world.
Hunters can expect to pursue:
Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas), which is the largest moose species in the world and is the most hunted animal in the state. Full-grown males, bulls, stand over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh between 1,200 to 1,600 pounds. Adult females, cows, are somewhat smaller in height and can weigh 800 to 1,300 lbs. Between 6,000 and 8,000 moose will be taken each year by hunters.
Brown Bears (Ursus arctos), which is the largest member of the bear family. It is estimated 30,000 brown bears call Alaska home. They tend to be solitary creatures, except when gathering at food sources. A large male will typically weigh between 500 and 900 pounds, but have been seen weighing as much as 1,400 pounds. Females are about half the size of their male counterparts. Bear hunting is open in the spring and fall in some places, but only in the fall in others. In any season it is illegal to kill cubs or females with cubs.
Roosevelt Elk (Cervus canadensis), which is the largest member of the elk family…anyone else sees a pattern here? The largest state boasts three of the largest game species. Similar to Texas, I guess everything is bigger in Alaska too. Bull elk can weigh around 1300 pounds, while cows come in around 800.
Sitka Black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), a relative of the mule deer, and a native to Alaska, this black-tail is smaller than those found in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Bucks (males) will typically weigh around 120 pounds, though 200 pound bucks have been taken. A full grown doe will usually weigh close to 80 pounds.
Plains Bison (Bison bison bison) are smaller of the bison species. Because of the limited number of these creatures, hunting tags are very hard to come by. It is estimated 15,000 people apply each year, and somewhere around 100 tags are issued. Statewide only around 92 bison are harvested each year. A bull will stand about 6 feet at the shoulder, can be up to 10 feet long and weigh close to a ton. A female is likely to weigh around 1,200 pounds.
Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) roam through various parts of Alaska. It is estimated 950,000 of these animals are spread between Alaska and Canada's Yukon Territory. Mature bulls will weigh around 350 pounds, while females will be between 175-220 pounds. Unlike most members of the deer family, both sexes of caribou can and will grow antlers. Male's antlers tend to be quite large, while females tend to be much smaller in size and weight.
Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) are some of the most difficult animals to hunt in the state. They tend to stay in rugged alpine areas and the challenge of finding them is only for the heartiest of hunters. A male, or ram, will usually weigh around 300 pounds, while an ewe, female, will be around 140 pounds.
Black bear (Ursus americanus) are found throughout the state. While not as large, pursued or feared as their larger cousin, the grizzly, black bears can still provide a challenge for hunters. Adult males will stand around 30 inches at the shoulder and are likely to weigh around 350 pounds.
Musk oxen (Ovibos moschatus) are usually found in the Northern part of Alaska. They are hearty creatures, well adapted to cold conditions. Similar to the bison, tags are very hard to draw. A male will stand about 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh around 700 pounds. Both sexes have horns, but males horns tend to be heavier and larger.
Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) are another species that enjoys making hunting them tough. They spend much of their time at or near tree line, in alpine meadows or surrounded by rocky cliffs. Billies (males) and nannies (females) both grow horns and look very similar. A male will typically be around 260 pounds, while a female will be around 180.
As you can see, Alaska offers a lot of species, making it well deserving of a spot on the bucket list hunter's guide. But the state also has a lot of area to cover, so hunting is sure to be hard. The state website points this out by saying “Big game densities are generally much lower than you are probably used to in more southern states. Many big game species here make long movements between seasonal ranges. The key to successful big game hunting in Alaska is in doing your homework to determine both the best areas and times to hunt the species you are seeking.”(http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.species)
Don't worry though, if you aren't inclined to hunt big game but are more likely to be pursuing species of the waterfowl variety, Alaska has you covered as well! According to the state website, “Alaska's marine and freshwater wetlands produce a fall flight of about 12 million ducks and over one million geese to all four North American flyways and neighboring countries… waterfowl hunters in Alaska can expect to harvest close to 70,000 ducks and 7,000 geese per hunting season.”
Tanzania
Who out there hasn't dreamed of taming the wild world of Africa? Tanzania is considered one of the premier safari destinations in the world, with numerous wildlife regions and game reserves open for hunting, including Selous, which is the largest Game Reserve in the world. Dangerous game abounds throughout Tanzania and that alone is sure to get the adrenaline pumping and be a draw to many hunters.
Hunters can expect to pursue:
African Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) – These massive African bovines are highly dangerous, very tough and are known to attack hunters when injured. Cape buffalo are known as “widowmakers” and can account for over 200 deaths a year. Males typically weigh 500-900kg (roughly 1000 to 2000 pounds) sport giant horns and they are known to be very strong. They are classified as a member of the “Big Five Game family” meaning they are known as one of the five most dangerous animals to hunt.
Lion (Panthera leo) , the tallest of all felines and the second heaviest behind the tiger. Large males can weigh around 550 pounds. Lions aren't known to hunt or eat humans except in rare cases, but make no mistake, they are well deserving of their dangerous game animal label. Recent Tanzania hunting regulations bar the taking of a lion younger than six years old.
Crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) – Males usually grow between 11 and 16 feet, but a mature crocodile may be 18 feet. Typical weight for a male is between 500 and 1600 pounds. Crocodiles are dangerous game and great hunters that blend easily with their environment and attack before you can retaliate. Hunting them means you have to stay alert and on your feet at all times because one mistake could be your last. Due to over hunting and poaching, population numbers were depleted, so Recent legislation has made it tougher to hunt crocodiles, but they can hunt in certain areas.
So if a sense of adventure is calling you, and the desire to test wills with some serious dangerous game is a must, Tanzania could be the place for you. Breathtaking beauty and game species that can eat you are certainly something everyone should try to experience at some time! If dangerous game isn't your thing, the country also offers hunting for Kudu, Cape Eland, Waterbuck, Wildebeest, Giraffe, Zebra, Oryx, Duiker, Impala, and Baboon among others.
South Africa
South Africa holds a special place in the hearts of many hunters who dream of luxurious hunts while roaming the wild lands of Kruger National Park, as well as some 150 other parks and reserves available for hunting. Over 6,000 international hunters visit the 250,000 acres of open land to hunt some of the world's best trophy animals.
Hunters can expect to pursue:
Leopards (Panthera pardus pardus) are found throughout Africa. They are largely hunted for their hides and are a threatened species in some areas because of poaching and irresponsible hunting of females. A male will typically weigh around 130 pounds, with a maximum weight of 200 pounds. To help raise population numbers, many African nations are only allowing males to be taken.
Elephants (Loxodonta africana africana) are found throughout 37 African countries. Hunting them in Kruger became legal again in 2008, as the park elephant population has become overcrowded. Males will typically be around 10 feet tall and can weigh as much as 26,000 pounds and both males and females can grow tusks.
Another beautiful African location that will test your courage, inspire adventure and allow you to hunt some of the world's most dangerous game. Again, if dangerous game isn't your thing, South Africa offers 30 different varieties of antelope and a total of 140 legal game species.
I might never make it to any of these places, but I certainly hope to one day. Don't be discouraged if you'll never find your way to the wilds of Africa or the wide open range of Alaska, many wildlife adventures can be had, and many trophy quality animals can be found in your own backyard. Get out in the woods and remember to have fun and enjoy the hunt! Thanks for reading and if you have a hunting bucket list of your own, be sure to share!

AS AMPHIBIOUS assaults go, the invasion of the Malaysian state of Sabah by the self-styled Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu on February 11th is admittedly tame. Scores of men, many heavily armed, came ashore from motorboats that had brought them from the Philippines, an hour away, where they and the sultan of Sulu are citizens. Without firing a shot, they occupied a sleepy village. There they announced that they had come to enforce the sultan's claim to Sabah.

At first the Malaysian security forces suspected the intruders were Islamist militants (the Philippines has plenty such people in its southernmost islands). They swiftly surrounded the village. Negotiations ensued. Malaysian officials informed the Filipinos that they had entered Sabah illegally and would be deported. The men refused to go, and as The Economist went to press were still there. The Philippine government was taken aback. It denied any hand in the incursion and asked for the safe return of its citizens.
To understand what it is all about, go back to 1658. Then the sultan of Brunei gave Sabah, in what is now the Malaysian portion of the France-sized island of Borneo, to the sultan of Sulu, who ruled a part of what is now the Philippines. In 1878 the sultan of Sulu leased Sabah in perpetuity to the British North Borneo Company. In 1946 the company ceded control of Sabah to Britain. Eleven years later, the sultan declared the lease void. But Sabah opted to become part of Malaysia when it gained independence in 1963. The sultan subsequently assigned their Sabah claim to the Philippines. Malaysia still pays them a token rent.
Some Filipino Muslims regard with nostalgia the heyday of the sultanate of Sulu—a time before colonial rule first by Spain, then by America, and latterly by the Christian majority in an independent Philippines. The sultan, Jamalul Kiram III (there is also another claimant), is now a merely symbolic figure. Their claim to Sabah is a romantic fantasy, yet one that grips the imagination of those hoping for another golden era. It was the Philippine government's betrayal in 1968 of a plot to pursue the claim to Sabah by force of arms that provoked the rebellion by Muslims seeking independence for their heartland in Mindanao in the south of the country.
The rebellion persisted for more than four decades, costing tens of thousands of lives. But last October the government and the main rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), signed a preliminary agreement to give Muslim areas greater autonomy in exchange for peace. The agreement was brokered by Malaysia.
The Philippine government suspects that the incursion into Sabah is a plot to wreck the peace agreement. A representative of the sultan denies this was the purpose. But the sultan themselves says they are upset at being excluded from the process. Suspicion also falls on another Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). It made peace in 1998, but many of its fighters were never disarmed. A spokesperson, while expressing support for the sultan's claim, denies that the MNLF had a hand in the Sabah affair. However, its chairperson, Nur Misuari, has frequently complained that the peace agreement between the government and the MILF has pushed their organisation to the margins.
The incursion clearly embarrassed the Philippine government in Manila. It has never renounced the claim to Sabah bequeathed to it by the sultanate. But it has let the claim lie dormant while Malaysia intercedes to bring about peace with the MILF. The Philippine and Malaysian governments are unlikely to be deterred by what seems to be an armed publicity stunt. They have a common interest in ending the Muslim separatist rebellion in the Philippines in case it once again descends into militancy. The Philippines remains awash with Muslim armed groups: the MILF, the MNLF, Abu Sayyaf, myriad criminal gangs—and now the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu. Militants will be difficult to root out from an environment so disorderly that some have the nerve to try invading another country.
Q: On a recent episode of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” the comedic actor Marlon Wayans tugged at your beard and said, “I'm so jealous of this. I want to rob your face.” What did you think of that?
A: I thought it was funny.
Philadelphia, specifically among black men, was way ahead of the curve in terms of the popularity of wearing a beard. Rocking a beard in Philly is like wearing a chin crown. To what do you attribute the popularity? I know that there is a large percentage of African-American men in Philadelphia who are followers of the Islamic faith. Do you think that is a factor?
I do. I was raised as a Muslim. I think the beard, and specifically long facial hair, is indicative of a sense of wisdom, strength and royalty, and not just in Islamic. In most of the religious books, when men of faith or kings are described, they are usually described wearing long facial hair. The beard is a reflection of both wisdom and royalty.
I also think the barbers from Philly are the best when it comes to the beard game. I made the mistake of going to a barber who was not from Philly, and let's just say, I would never do that again.
Do you have a specific barber from Philly that is your go-to guy?
I actually have three barbers from Philly that I use. Shout out to Faheem Alexander and the Hands of Precision shop in South Philly, Darien Hilliard in the East Falls section of Philly and Shaun “Shizz 215” Porter, a Philly barber based in Los Angeles. Those guys are true craftsmen.
Video of two women hurling insults at one another at a Koreatown IHOP has gone viral after a man, who says they are the son of one of the women and who joined in the fight, posted the argument to Facebook.
It is hard to make out the first words of the blue-shirted woman shown in the video, but as the argument ensues, the two women become agitated, as the son of the largely off-camera woman joins in while filming.
“You can't say that to my mom,” said Carlos Vasquez, the son, in the video. They say the woman in blue started it with comments about their mother not speaking to them in English.
“You're stupid. You're stupid,” said Norma Vasquez, the woman expressing offense at the speaking English comments. They briefly appeared on camera clearly distressed.
Visibly upset, the blue shirted woman said, “We speak English in America.”
The women yell at each other back and forth before Carlos Vasquez chimes in, “Don't be racist like that.”
The unidentified woman talks about not wanting Nazis or Fascists back.
“You have to change your heart or you're gonna die really soon. You're gonna die really soon,” Carlos Vasquez said.
“That's why I'm voting no for Trump. No for Trump. No for Donald Trump,” they continued.
Vasquez and their mother Norma Vasquez later spoke with NBC Los Angeles. Ms. Vasquez said they felt awful and worthless after the exchange.
Though the woman featured on camera is said to be a regular at the IHOP, NBC LA was has not been able to determine their identity or track them down for comment.
NBC LA reported that Norma Vasquez came to the United States from El Salvador 30 years ago.
The video posted to the Facebook page of Carlos Steven Vasquez had over 430,000 shares and over 15 million views as of Tuesday afternoon. NBC News' attempts to contact IHOP for comment have received no reply.

‘I am very stressed'
NORTHFIELD, Minn. – Just hours after they found a typewritten note with a racial slur on their car, St. Olaf College student Samantha Wells said in an email that they didn't want the school to investigate their case.
That remark came at the same time as racial protests launched on campus, during which angry students blocked entrances to campus buildings, trapping students inside as demonstrators demanded redress for a string of alleged racial incidents on campus.
The aggressive protest forced administrators to cancel classes last Monday to allow demonstrators to air their grievances in a daylong sit-in.
“I am so glad that you are leaving soon. One less [n-word] that this school has to deal with,” the anonymous note Wells found on their car stated. “You have spoken up too much. You will change nothing. Shut up or I will shut you up.”
Wells' email saying they did not want the person who put the note on their car investigated was obtained by The College Fix on Tuesday. It is part of an April 29 chain that began with a subject line “TRACK DOWN RACIST BEHIND THREATS.” Carbon copied on the email was stolaf-extra, a public email list students can subscribe to at the private Lutheran college.
The thread includes university members speculating on how the college could use its technological resources to identify whoever is behind a string of racial notes found at the college that sparked the protest.
As the discussion continued, one student chimed in and said they are speaking directly to Wells, who told them “she doesn't want people tongo [sic] through computers to find the person who wrote the note to them They do, however, want everything possible to be done for the others.”
Wells replied to the email, confirming the sentiments.
“I would like to echo Krysta and say that I do not want my case to be investigated,” Wells wrote. “Not because I do not want to let this person go but because I am very stressed and I think that efforts could be utilized elsewhere. That said, I do want them to investigate both previous and possible later cases.”
Wells told Fox News 9 they discovered the note on the afternoon of April 29 on the windshield of their car, adding they “immediately shared the note on Facebook and with St. Olaf Public Safety,” saying “I knew I had to share it because it was another incident; it's the third incident this week.”
Wells, in their email on the campus listserv sent the same day they found the note, also pointed out: “Also, this message could have been printed off school grounds and could have been printed days, months, or years ago. I mean heck, I printed off a form today for work (that I didn't get to turn in whoops) right before I went to my car so I too could be a suspect but even I am not that extra.”
They wrote that the incident “is about more than one person being a butthole, it is about an institution and society that allows them to think that they can do something like this. Sorry if I am not making sense but I am extremely stressed by this and part of me wishes that I had never posted the message.”
Wells didn't respond to The Fix's request for comment.
For its part, the university says it's “sparing no effort,” using all its resources to try and identify whoever is behind the notes that sparked the protest. St. Olaf denied The Fix's request to meet with an administrator to discuss the investigation.
On Tuesday, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported the university has “persons of interest” identified in regard to the racial incidents. The university's vice president and general counsel Carl Crosby Lehmann said those of interest include university members as well as outside individuals.
Spokesperson Kari VanDerVeen told the Star Tribune that St. Olaf “retained a computer forensic consultant who is analyzing evidence relating to one of the recent incidents.”
The university said it's reached out to the Northfield Police Department for assistance and it has also reportedly contacted the FBI. The Northfield police did not respond to The Fix's request for comment on their involvement in the investigation.
Northfield Police Chief Monte Nelson told the Star Tribune that their department has initiated investigations in two of the incidents, but that one has been closed “at the victim's request” without charges, while another remains active.
The university launched a probe following the first racial incident on campus, which allegedly occurred last fall. There have been nine total incidents this academic year, with six occurring in April, St. Olaf President David Anderson told Minnesota Public Radio in a recent interview.
In the interview, Anderson briefly touched on some of the college's efforts, saying they've included reviewing security camera footage, records of computer and printers and comparing handwriting samples.
They added the investigation includes “some other things that we'd rather not disclose in public.”
“These are generating leads,” they said of the efforts.
In an email sent to students last month, Anderson said they believe the racial messages are “the work of one or a small number of people.” They also suggested someone outside the university community could be behind them.
“This person uses the same modus operandi every time this happens; even the handwriting on the notes is similar from incident to incident,” they wrote. “This person has adopted a strategy similar to the one terrorists use: under the cover of darkness and anonymity engage in acts that frighten, dishearten, and frustrate people with a goal of unsettling the community and turning people against one another.”

The festival holding at the Dallas City Performance Hall, will climax on July 3, with the awards night. While ‘Oloibiri' will open the festival, Uganda's award-winning film, Remand will close the festival.
Also, screening during the festival is South African crime film, ‘Call Me Thief', which was submitted for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards but was not nominated.
The founder and festival director, Kelechi Eke told newsmen, they are leaving no stone unturned in their bid to record a successful outing this year, adding that not less than 200 filmmakers from over 40 countries are expected to storm Dallas for the festival.
Giving more highlights of the festival, Kelechi explained the festival will commence on Friday, June 24, with shooting of short film and screening it on the closing night (June 24 — 29). Master Acting class with TAFF 2017 Host, Richard Mofe Damijo (RMD) holds June 30.
July 2, will be the charity dinner, where TAFF supports AVODA in its Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Program in Africa (BCASPA), this will be followed with filmmakers soccer match on July 3.
According to Eke, “My expectation is to have a better festival than last year, with more filmmakers and African movie fans in attendance; and with more media coverage globally. We received better films this year, and some from very well-known filmmakers.”
Explaining why they established the festival, Eke, who is also a filmmaker, writer, director, producer, and actor stated that they set up the film festival to give Africans in diaspora a sense of belonging as well as promote the continent's culture.
They said, “The African film industry is growing by the day. New creative filmmakers are emerging; better quality film production is on the rise. Yet, we do not have enough platforms to showcase African films and celebrate our filmmakers. There are several other challenges that African filmmakers face, ranging from lack of adequate finances to fund a film – to lacking distribution after managing to complete one – to piracy when the film finally makes it out there.”
“These facts make it discouraging for African filmmakers to even bother to produce another motion picture. But the passion and drive that many of us have continued to push us to not quit. Good quality films need a large budget for production and marketing just like we observe from our Hollywood counterparts where millions of dollars are spent in making one film,” they added.
They continue, “This makes their films unbeatable with quality in the film market. And to compete with such productions in various film festivals, makes it look as though we do not have films that are good enough. In fact, some of our story lines are better but we do not have the luxury to pay for the best visual effects.
“If given a quarter of the funds used to make some of Hollywood films, the African filmmaker could probably make three equally quality films. It is therefore difficult to compete with such films at a given festival. Hence, TAFF is born to showcase and celebrate some of our best films that would normally be overshadowed by the wealthier Hollywood productions,” they explained
Two Mumbai street kids thought that all their dreams would come true when they were cast in key roles in Slumdog Millionaire but, director Danny Boyle apart, they feel let down.
MUMBAI // Rubbish lies thick and festering outside the entrance to Rubina Ali's new home, little islands of it poking through pools of foul-smelling stagnant water.
Someone has tried to improvise a precarious path across the oozing mud with concrete slabs and pieces of broken pipe, but it is a losing battle. A large rat, its fur black and matted, emerges from under a discarded sack and scuttles away through the driving monsoon rain.
This is not what the young actor dreamt of when they flew back to India from Hollywood after celebrating the success of the movie Slumdog Millionaire at the Oscars three years ago.
Then, they and their little co-star, Azhar Ismail, believed they stood on the threshold of a new life, away from the slums of Mumbai from which they had been plucked by director Danny Boyle to play the two leading characters in the film, Jamal and Latika, when they were very young children.
The movie, made on a comparatively small budget for a major feature, went on to earn more than US$370 million (Dh1.36 billion) at the box office.
The children were sure they had the world at their feet, that Hollywood was waiting. They lapped up the attention and fantasised about plush apartments, plum acting roles, a world away from the squalor of their everyday reality. They had glimpsed the promised land and they wanted a part of it.
Yet three years on, their dreams are in tatters.
Rubina sits with them back to the graffitied wall of the tiny apartment that they moved into with their family six months ago. There is one living room, about 15ft by 10ft, which doubles as a bedroom for the 14-year-old, their mother, father and two sisters. Them two brothers sleep on the floor of the small kitchen. There is a toilet cubicle and a shower room, and that is it.
"When we came back from the Oscars we were so happy. We had all these dreams about what we were going to do and how our lives were going to change," they say.
"People promised us many things and we believed them. But my dreams have not come true."
They and Azhar sat in front of their televisions as Boyle's dazzling London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony was beamed around the world this summer, marvelling at the spectacle, gasping at the fireworks, delighted at the success of the man they still affectionately refer to as Danny Uncle.
But it was hard for them not to reflect on how far their lives had diverged. While Boyle has gone from strength to strength, their young proteges have lurched from crisis to crisis, feeling let down by people they believed would help them make their dreams come true.
Both had their slum shacks demolished by municipal authorities determined to crack down on illegal settlements.
Last year, Rubina lost all their Slumdog mementoes, including the dress they wore to the Oscars, in a devastating fire that ripped through the city's Garib Nagar slum.
They thought their luck had finally changed this year when the Jai Ho trust - set up by Boyle to look after the two children - belatedly bought them a permanent home.
They had dreamt of moving to Bandra West, the buzzing upmarket suburb on the opposite side of the railway tracks to their old slum home. They wanted a little slice of a life they had glimpsed but briefly.
"After the success of the movie I was dreaming that we would see a good apartment and be able to have that, somewhere where I could have my own room," they say.
Instead, the trust put them in an unfinished apartment in a cramped apartment block in a rundown part of the suburb.
"I still have no privacy. In the slum it was exactly the same, so what is the difference between this and the slum? I still have to share with everyone. There are seven of us, all in here."
They gesture round the room. The walls are dirty and covered in graffiti left behind by workmen.
Tiles are falling off, with bare stretches of rough cement and a curtain to shut off the bathroom and kitchen. A pile of blankets - the family's bedding - sits on a cheap sideboard, the only piece of furniture in the room. There is a TV on one wall, a small pink plastic mirror on another.
They fiddle with their long black hair, hands covered in the fading mehndi henna designs applied to celebrate Eid.  They are wearing blue jeans and a pretty blue, white and brown top.
Life is still a constant struggle, they say. The water comes on for only 10 minutes a day, and in that time the women scramble to fill buckets and other containers to last them the rest of the day.
Rubina gestures at the shower-room.
"What use is a shower when there is no water?", they asked. "Are we all supposed to fit in there when the water comes? This place is worse than the slum."
Neither child bears any animosity towards Boyle, the man who gave them their big break.
"I am very grateful to Danny Uncle because whatever we are is because of him. If they had not come into our lives nothing would have changed," says Rubina.
But for the people they appointed to look after them and those who promised them the earth and delivered nothing, the children have only contempt and anger.
The trust stuck Azhar in a down-at-heel neighbourhood and took three more years to find Rubina a permanent home. Last month, they say, the trust told them it would not pay to make the house habitable.
"I am feeling very angry about what has happened, but what to do? The trust says that Danny Boyle has done what they wanted to do and we are to take care of ourselves."
The family say they simply cannot afford it. Both children receive a monthly allowance of Rs 7,000 (£79), but that is the only money coming into Azhar's house and Rubina's father, a carpenter, says work is hard to find.
The local housing authority promised them new homes but never delivered. Other promises also evaporated as interest in the pair dwindled.
Both say that financial assurances they received from their biographers have been broken and their last real hope of a breakthrough - a part in a mooted British movie, Lord Owen's Lady - remains uncertain.
The children say that it is months since they have heard anything from Dragons Productions Wales, the company behind the venture, though they were assured that shooting would start this month.
Azhar is sitting on the bed of their apartment. Paint is peeling off the walls and there are damp patches. Outside, rain hammers down on greasy paths. They lean against the security bars covering the one window and stares out.
 They are not as unhappy with their home as Rubina; the Santacruz area where they live may not be anything special, but it is a far cry from the squalor in which they lived before they were plucked from obscurity.
They too share one room with their family - mother Shamin, 45, their brother Irfan and their brother's wife Heena (his father Mohammed died from tuberculosis on the floor of the apartment not long after they moved in) but it is 14-year-old Azhar, as the only one bringing in any money, who gets the bed. The others sleep on the floor.
"This is much better. People talk to you better here and in the slum they throw garbage everywhere but here there are dustbins," they say.
 They are getting ready for school. The children go to the same school, but Rubina is the only one of their friends to live in a house; the others still live in the slums.
"I feel bad for them because they are living in a bad place," they say.
They watched the Olympics and liked the fireworks best, but was just happy because it was the work of Danny Uncle.
"Danny Uncle is helping us.  They are a very good man," they say.
Yet much of the hope they brought back from Hollywood has slowly ebbed away.
"When I came home I thought I would take my father back to Los Angeles and I would work with the big stars and the dreams have not come true," they say.
"I dream about the places I went, all the luxury in LA. Everything is very nice there and here in Mumbai everything is slums.
"I want to be a big star. If I do the hard work, I am sure I will get the jobs. I say to Danny Boyle, please give me some more work so I can give my family some money.
"I think we have been lucky but I would like to me more lucky. The trust is helping but my family is big and the house is very small. We need more for food and clothes because we don't have enough money. Everything costs so much now."
They mention their ghosted autobiography, Slumboy, and their eyes flash with anger.
"That woman who wrote my biography. They promised that they would give me money and they gave me nothing."
Back in Bandra West, Rubina is standing on the flat roof of the apartment block, leaning on the parapet and gazing out towards the sea.
Spread out beneath them are the metal sheet roofs of the neighbouring slum, many draped with blue tarpaulins to keep out the rain.
Beyond, the view is breathtaking, the city stretching away into the distance, new buildings soaring skywards all around.
 They are quiet for a while, the little girl from the slums still surrounded by them, forever trying to find a way to bridge the gap to the life they can see but which remains just out of reach.
"Sometimes I feel that I am nothing," they say suddenly. "Then somebody comes to see me and I believe again."
They look out across the city. "But then they go away and everything goes back to how it was.
"I dream and dream of being an actor but if I don't get the work how will people know me? How will I ever be an actor? How will I achieve my dreams?"
The women's muscles are throbbing with fatigue and their faces drizzle sweat.
But their trainer, an ex-Marine named Thompson Plyler, continues to scream at their five trainees (all garbed in red tee-shirts to promote solidarity), goading them through pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, squat jumps, runs, burpees, Romanian deadlifts and customized exercises to build upper body strength.
"You're going to do planks every day of your life! You might be going into the Academy in July!" they scream. "If you don't prepare yourself today, you'll be in a world of pain!" they warned.
Plyler is training women who want to be FDNY firefighters, and their harshness is a calculated cruelty: Less than one-half of 1% of the FDNY's force of 10,500 is female - a mere 41 women. Even when women pass the computer exam, psychological exam and "CPAT" (Candidate Physical Ability Test), there is a 34 -- 56% chance that after entering the FDNY Fire Academy, or "probie school," they won't graduate, said Sarinya Srisakul, president United Women Firefighters (UWF).
The FDNY's physical requirements are daunting for both men and women, but pose a particular challenge for those who lack large reservoirs of testosterone -- and the social validations and preparations required to pursue a non-traditional career.
Barking and castigation are designed to accustom women to treatment inside a paramilitary organization, Plyler explained: "This isn't Zumba or yoga. It isn't supposed to be. And the people of NYC don't want it to be! My drill instructor had to be stronger than the enemy. In this environment, they have to be tougher than a fire."
The workouts - organized by the United Women Firefighters and provided free, twice a week on Wall St., courtesy of the New York Sports Club -- are customized to build strength in ways specific to firefighting and FDNY Fire Academy tasks: Candidates perform most of their drills wearing cumbersome lead vests, so they'll be ready to carry 75 lbs. of equipment during the Functional Skills Test. A technique for developing grip strength involves grasping 10-pound discs swathed in thick towels using only three fingers of each hand.
"We have to make sure they develop upper body strength and a LOT of grip strength - 70% of what you do in probie school deals with your grip strength," explained Regina Wilson, 44, a 14-year firefighting veteran with the FDNY and past UWF president. A strong grip is needed to wield a pulsing pressurized hose, but also to climb and move ladders, saw and hack "trench cuts" in ceilings, and to use fittings, hooks and tools to force open doors, Wilson explained.

Women are also taught how to recruit muscles of their lower bodies when pulling hoses and hoisting tools or bodies. "We're just strong differently," Srisakul, 33, explained.
When Wilson came on the FDNY in 1999, they were the first African American woman hired in 15 years. Them accomplishments "came with a lot of scars," they acknowledged. The UWF training not only prepares women for a macho environment where they may be subject to excessive scrutiny, but provides important social and psychological support. Wilson's frustration with applicants who don't prepare is plain: About 425 women (or 4.6% of the total "list" from which the FDNY will be hiring from over the next three years) are on track to attend the FDNY Training Academy, according to the Fire Department.
"We've reached out to a lot of them. But the most that show up (for training) is about 10," for the free workouts, Wilson lamented. Women who graduate from the Academy "are women who have been through our training. We have a very good record," of getting women on the job, they declared. Indeed: Three of the four women who graduated from this year's FDNY Training Academy class (out of 286 grads) were veterans of the free UWF courses.
A spokesperson for the FDNY pointed out that in the last two years the FDNY has hired 13 female Probationary Firefighters "and anticipates continuing to hire women at increasing rates with upcoming classes." The FDNY works hard to support all applicants and candidates, they added.
For Josephine Smith, 34, of Suffolk County, becoming a firefighter has been a lifelong dream: "My father was a firefighter who was killed in the attacks on September 11th," said Smith. "I grew up in the fire house, going to work with my dad," Kevin Smith, a member of the FDNY HazMat Company 1.The UWF trainings "have gotten me mentally and physically prepared," to go into the Academy, which they expect to do this year. "I've seen incredible differences in the women who go through this - real transformations," said Smith, who has their 1.5-mile run down to 11.14 minutes.
"The training is dead on," added Nicole Viel, 23, of Ridgewood, Queens, who is waiting to take their CPAT. "It really helps a lot. I couldn't do pull ups at all when I started. Now," they said, "I can do five or six."

Brendan Rodgers has praised the work of Liverpool FC's transfer committee as the manager reiterated they will have the final say on all signings this summer.
The Reds have yet to add to their squad since the window opened earlier this month but the manager has faith in the Anfield officials looking to close out deals.
Rodgers sits on the committee along with managing director Ian Ayre, head of recruitment Dave Fallows and head of performance and analysis Michael Edwards.
It was created by Fenway Sports Group following Rodgers' arrival two years ago after the owners ditched plans to appoint a director of football.
Rodgers must secure the agreement of the committee that a player meets the club's requirements and is worth pursuing.
However, the boss says the input of Ayre, Fallows and Edwards is a help rather than a hindrance in the recruitment process.
“Obviously, I am involved heavily in the identification of the player,” Rodgers told the ECHO.
“The principle idea when I first came in was that like any manager you will have the first call on a player and the last call.
“That's the call on whether he's good enough to continue to look at and try to organise a deal and the last call to say yes or no.
“There is a big part that goes on in between. In modern football you need to trust other people to do the work. That's something we do here and that's why we have had the success we've had.
“The finer details of that are left to Ian who does a terrific job and our other guys in that field who will go through the contracts. I am aware of where the situation is at right the way through the process.
“We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn't want in. That's a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club.
“We work very closely together – it's worth stressing that. It's key that we are very much one club.
“We are really preparing for next season. I've had some very good meetings with our recruitment team. We are very much together as one.”
The negotiating of transfer fees and player contracts is carried out by Ayre and Fallows, who have been busy working on deals to try to secure the likes of Southampton's Adam Lallana and Bayer Leverkusen's Emre Can.
Rodgers is after quality rather than quantity this summer with five or six signings being targeted to ensure Liverpool boast the strength in depth capable of coping with the increased demands of Champions League football next season.
The manager doesn't intend to dip into the loan market again. Last term the Reds took Victor Moses from Chelsea and Aly Cissokho from Valencia but both flopped and have returned to their parent clubs.
The previous campaign Liverpool snapped up Nuri Sahin from Real Madrid but they failed to establish themselves at Anfield and their loan stay was cut short.
“I would hope we don't have to go for loans this summer,” Rodgers admitted.
“But it's always about the availability of players. If you are not satisfied with the squad and you feel you can improve it then you have to look at every option.
“In these first couple of years I've been here we have had to do that as we've had a thin squad.
“The players we wanted we couldn't get but we're hopeful that this summer will be different. We turn the page and it's another chapter in terms of where we are going.
“Hopefully that will mean it will be more permanent players than loan players but I can never rule it out completely. There could be a situation where a player becomes available, we can get them and they can add to what we're doing.”

The Fars News Agency of predominantly Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which is in a constant feud with the Sunni-led Saudi Arabia monarchy, charged that the Jeddah Astronomy Society made a colossal mistake and caused other Muslim nations to pronounce Tuesday as Eid al Fitr.
“The society had said that people actually saw the planet Saturn and not the crescent moon that marks the beginning of the Islamic month of Shawwal,” the government-controlled news agency reported.
Hatem Auda, director of the National Institute for Astronomical and Geophysical Research, had said that astronomical calculations by scientists of the institute noted that the first day of the Eid was Wednesday, August 31, making Tuesday, August 30 the last day of Ramadan.
It claimed that the Saudi government apologized and will pay citizens money as compensation for the sin of breaking the fast a day early.
However, the Egyptian Fatwa Authority told the country's Al Masry Al Youm newspaper, "The crescent was clearly seen with the naked eye…
"There are seven committees made up of the finest astronomers that view the crescent… and they coordinate with each other before they take a collective decision, so as to avoid error."
Maged Abu Zahra, director of the Jedda Astronomy Society explained that all astronomers in the Arab world sighting the crescent in Saudi Arabia on the same night would be impossible.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars running back Chris Ivory is keeping whatever condition put them in a local hospital for two days private, but they did say that they are completely healed and hopes to be back on the field soon.
"There's no more issues," Ivory said Thursday afternoon. "I'm ready to go. Did a little cardio today and now it's just day-by-day."
Ivory said they didn't want to go into details about what caused them so much pain that they needed to be taken to Baptist Medical Center early Sunday morning, but they did say that they were glad to return to the facility on Thursday, two days after they were released from the hospital.
"It feels good to be back," they said. "I'm just ready to get back going."
It's unlikely that Ivory will be able to play on Sunday in San Diego. They were hospitalized early Sunday and released on Tuesday but did not practice Wednesday or Thursday. In fact, Thursday was the first time they were with their teammates since last Saturday at the team hotel.
"Had a chance to visit with him," coach Gus Bradley said. "I think at this stage right now they just wants to move forward. He's always kind of had that mindset to focus on today and, 'What do I need to do,' and just wants to move on.
"... I think it'll be really challenging for them [to play against the Chargers]. We'll see but I think the arrow would be down."
Bradley said earlier in the week that the team has a plan in place if Ivory is unable to play against the Chargers. T.J. Yeldon would be the starter and Denard Robinson would be the top backup, but kick returner Corey Grant also could get some reps on offense.
The possibility of signing another running back -- Joe Banyard and Jonas Gray were both on the roster and released before the season began -- also is in play. That seems less likely after Bradley said they don't expect Ivory to miss an extended period of time. However, they also said it's too early to know if Ivory will be able to play against Baltimore on Sept. 25.
When asked if they could play on Sunday, Ivory said they aren't "going to put a time on it but when the time comes I'll be ready to go."
The Red Sox have designated lefty Edwin Escobar for assignment, per a club announcement. Their 40-man spot was needed for the club to add righty William Cuevas to the active roster.
Boston will be forced to expose Escobar to waivers, if it can't first work out a trade, because of a need for fresh arms at the major league level. In addition to Cuevas, Noe Ramirez will be coming back up as Joe Kelly hits the DL. Infielder Marco Hernandez is heading down to Pawtucket on optional assignment to clear room for Ramirez.
Escobar, who'll soon turn 24, came to the Sox along with Heath Hembree from the Giants in the 2014 Jake Peavy trade. Though they were added to San Francisco's major league roster before the 2013 season, they have only made two major league appearances; this is their final optionable year.
Though they have previously received some top-100 prospect consideration, Escobar hasn't been terribly impressive since coming to Boston. Last year, they worked to a 5.07 ERA in 49 2/3 Triple-A innings while seeing time as both a reliever and a starter. They issued 25 walks against just 24 strikeouts in that span — a far cry from the impressive K:BB ratios they sported at times earlier in their minor league career.
The third tale is of a young man named Sean, who, while shop lifting in Liverpool back in 2006, ran away from a Security Guard and headed down Hanover Street. Trying to shake off the Guard, Sean, 19, turned into a dead end street called Brookes Alley.
By this time they were out of breath and started to get a tight sensation in their chest. They soon realized that actually it wasn't a problem with him, but the atmosphere around him.
They waited for the Guard to come around the corner after him, but they never appeared. So, thinking they had given them the slip, they sauntered back out and started to walk down Hanover street again. But they soon realised that something was wrong.
The road looked different, and so did the pavement. They noticed cars driving by that looked very old fashioned, and the road works that they knew were there, were now gone.
Soon they saw that the people around them were wearing strange clothes. Crossing over to Bold Street, they noticed that there were traffic lights where they weren't before, and bushes growing around the Lyceum, near a bar that they recognized.
They carried on walking. Soon they began to feel that something was not quite right. Then they began to panic. They realized that somehow they had stepped back in Time. And the time slip was not going away.
Then they remember their Cell phone. Taking it out of their pocket, they tried to get a signal, but of course it didn't work. Eventually they began to really panic, but soon spotted a kiosk selling newspapers and headed over.
Leaning over the Stand, they took a look at the front page of the Daily Post. There in bold lettering was the date. 18th May 1967.
They wondered what to do. What happens if they can't get back to their own time? What about family and friends?
So, speeding up their pace, they reached H. Samuel the Jewelers, and tried their phone once again. This time it worked. Sighing with relief they looked around and realised that they had returned to the present. But the strange thing was, they could still see, down the end of the road, people still walking around in 1967.
By this time Sean had seen enough, and dived onto a bus to go home. When they were interviewed by the local newspaper later, they stated over four times, the exact account.
Now, you may think that Sean was making the story up to escape from the guard. But the strange tale didn't end there. When the Security Guard was interviewed, they stated that when they ran after Sean, and turned down the dead end Alley after him, they said that Sean had completely disappeared!
When the newspaper checked out the facts of Sean's story, they found that everything they said was historically accurate.
KAHILTNA GLACIER BASE CAMP — Three massive U.S. Army helicopters swept onto a stretch of snow here Sunday, surrounded by mountains and carrying more than 11,000 pounds of food, tents, medical supplies, tables, shovels, solar panels, sleds and more.
It's the start of the remote Kahiltna Glacier base camp, the main gateway to North America's highest mountain peak. By Sunday, 16 people had started the climb up Denali, which stands at 20,310 feet..
But National Park Service rangers said it's still early in the climbing season for the ascent. Most people attempt to summit the mountain from late May to early June. Then, Denali's popular West Buttress route can have between 500 and 600 climbers on it at one time
Soldiers and rangers are preparing for their arrival.
Long-time partnership
For the soldiers, Sunday capped a week-long training session in the Alaska Range. It's part of a decades-old partnership between the U.S. Army and the Park Service.
"It's kind of an 'I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine,'" said Kirk Donovan, chief warrant officer with Company B, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment based at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks.
For the Army unit, the partnership means soldiers get to use Denali National Park and Preserve as a gigantic training ground for a week. They practice flying the CH-47F Chinook helicopters at high altitudes, landing on peaks and hoisting each other off mountains. The soldiers receive their high-altitude rescue team qualification, Donovan said.
In return, the Army uses those helicopters to haul Park Service gear up to the Kahiltna Glacier. One soldier likened the helicopters to a flying school bus or a large dumpster. Each one weighs nearly 25,000 pounds.
On Sunday, the Chinook helicopters took off from Talkeetna — flying over glaciers and between steep mountains amid clear skies and a bright sun. They carried the Park Service equipment, mountaineering rangers, soldiers and reporters.
Upon landing here, rangers began digging holes in the snow to store fuel. Soldiers formed an assembly line. They stood in the calf-deep snow and unloaded dozens of plastic boxes marked with labels like "All Burgers," "Spices and Oil" and "Bread."
As they passed down the boxes, they called out, "This is kind of a heavy one," or "This is is really, really light."
Other equipment will stay at the Kahiltna Glacier base camp at 7,200 feet. It's the main access point not only to Denali but also to other major peaks including Mount Foraker and Mount Hunter.

"Denali is one piece of a 1,000-mile puzzle," said Melis Coady, a Park Service mountaineering ranger. "There's a lot of really interesting, exploratory climbs."

Soon, the mountaineering rangers will start patrolling Denali in month-long shifts. They will climb between base camp and a third camp at 17,200 feet, reaching the summit if time allows. The rangers typically go at a slower pace to acclimatize and interact with other climbers, said Dave Weber, a Park Service mountaineering ranger.
"This is the best office in the world," they said. "I can't think of any set of windows at a desk anywhere in the world that has 360 degrees of this."
Mild temperatures
Up a small, gradual hill from the helicopters, a handful of climbers had set up colorful neon tents by Sunday afternoon. Geoffrey Johnson, 34, of Boston looked over the edge of the hill, down at the bustling scene of soldiers and Park Service rangers.
Around the tents it was quiet. Johnson, who works full time as a software developer, said they were taking a 12-day trip with a friend. They each had a tent set up next to a shared blue cooking tent.
The weather, for the most part, had remained pleasant and sunny, they said.
Coley Gentzel, lead mountaineering ranger at Denali, said temperatures in the Alaska Range have been milder over the past five or so years.
When Gentzel started climbing Denali about a decade ago, they said, it was common for temperatures at the Kahiltna base camp to dip below zero at the end of April. On Sunday, temperatures were around freezing.
"On the lower mountain it's a little bit of a curse and on the upper mountain it's a little bit of a blessing," they said of the warmer weather.
On the lower mountain, melting snow can reveal more problematic crevasses, they said. But on the upper mountain, it means temperatures might only dip 10 degrees below zero compared to 40 degrees below.
"That is a lot more manageable," Gentzel said.
Meanwhile, snow accumulation has remained about normal in the Alaska Range. Any rain falling at lower elevations was typically snow above 5,000 feet, they said.
Beginning of a climb
As soldiers and rangers finished unloading gear and sorting it into piles to go to the next base camp, four California climbers arrived on two small planes.
Aaron Pessah, 28, said about a year ago they created an online group to find people who wanted to climb Denali in 2016. About 70 people responded. By Sunday, that number had narrowed to three.
"We're a team here," they said.
Since the early 1990s, the number of climbers who attempt to summit Denali has remained relatively stable, hovering between 1,000 and 1,340. The percentage reaching the summit has varied from 36 percent to 68 percent.
Last year, 1,092 people climbed Denali and 628 reached the summit. The year before that, only 429 of 1,204 reached the summit.
Maureen Gualtieri, public information officer with Denali National Park and Preserve, said bad weather is most likely the reason behind the lower percentages.
By Monday, more than 730 people had registered to climb Denali, Gualtieri said.
Pessah was among the 16 on the mountain.
They said their team chose to climb Denali because of its status as the tallest mountain in North America and because they considered it the most accessible mountain on the list of the world's highest peaks.
On Sunday, they wore a backpack and pulled a sled up part of the small hill at base camp, closer to the tents already assembled and away from the helicopters preparing to take off with the soldiers, rangers and reporters.
"This is an addiction. It really is," Pessah said.
On the same day the Florida Gators saw a highly-rated tight end transfer out of the program, the team added a commitment from one in the 2014 class as four star Moral Stephens (Perry, FL) announced their intent to play for the University of Florida.
“I just committed to the university of Florida #GatorNation” they wrote early Thursday afternoon via their Twitter account.
Stephens (6-foot-3, 205-pounds) is ranked No. 191 overall by Rivals and No. 206 by ESPN, which also rates them as a four-star prospect.
Their offer sheet was expansive including interest from Arkansas, Clemson, Florida State, LSU, Miami, Ohio State, South Carolina and others.
Though listed as a wide receiver, Stephens is expected to be a hybrid tight end in college, making them the third player at the position to join the Gators this cycle.
Florida also has pledges two other tight ends – four-star DeAndre Goolsby (Derby, KS) and C'yontai Lewis (Tuscaloosa, AL). Stephens is the fifth overall pass catcher on the Gators' commitment list, which also includes two four-star wide receivers in Ermon Lane (Homestead, FL) and Ryan Sousa (Orlando, FL).
It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment I started hating “The Rules” and everything they represent.
It might have been the afternoon I was sitting near the back of a big weekly group ride, listening to a couple of middle-aged club riders ripping on a new guy in a sleeveless jersey within earshot. Or maybe it was the time on Twitter that I observed someone get slayed for expressing an affinity for ankle-length socks. Or perhaps it was that recent morning when someone I don't even know insulted me for wearing fluro legwarmers.
To be honest, I have witnessed cyclists berated or scorned for seemingly innocent apparel, equipment or etiquette choices hundreds of times. It is 2017 and it's time to resist.
As many of you will deduce, I'm talking about the Velominati and their now iconic rules.
Back when they first emerged — founders Frank Strack and Brett Kennedy launched in 2009, I think — the context was different. In the beginning, the list was shorter and served two purposes — to codify some roadie traditions and to simultaneously mock those same traditions. It was, in my mind, both a reference manual of sorts and a tongue-in-cheek joke.
Now, eight years later, the list has stopped being useful or funny. It has instead become source code for a culture of semi-clueless exclusion in the cycling universe.
The outermost layer of the problem is that many of the rules are empirically stupid. Telling everyone to stuff tubes and tools in jersey pockets sounds really clever until a group ride grinds to a halt because no one has a chain tool. Urging the masses to remain in the big ring and slam their stems and ditch frame pumps is neither smart nor droll. (But telling a demographic of hobbyists that spends thousands of dollars to buy bicycles that reduce road chatter to “Harden the fuck up” — now that's funny.)
Digging a bit deeper, so many of the rules take this absurd leap of portraying fashion preferences as commandments. Let's be clear: When it comes to sock length, sunglass choices, saddle and bar-tape coordination, recreational use of pro-team kit, weather thresholds for wearing shoe covers or a vest, and countless other personal or inconsequential choices that cyclists make, a few middle-aged white guys who do semi-hard rides on Sundays and maintain a web site don't get to make the rules. Riders do. You do.
Look, I have my own sense of style and tradition and cycling etiquette, and many of my preferences line up with “The Rules.” I like black bar tape and I hang my helmet on my stem at the coffee shop and pay attention to the nuances of quick-release lever position. But I'm also just another middle-aged white guy with no authority to dictate how anyone should ride — plus I often wear intentionally mismatched socks and sometimes don't shave my legs and have been known to wear a cycling cap to the beach.
I've come to realize that I don't have to conform to a secret code to be a proper road rider. As long as you're safe and having fun, you're in the club.
I live and ride in Los Angeles, and my local bike lanes are full of women, fixie kids, riders of color, rebels, throwback granddads, artists, and other interesting people who are defining and redefining cycling culture in a good way.
I see folks on road bikes with mismatched colorful rims and helmet mirrors and triple chainrings and aviator sunglasses and miraculous medleys of technical and casual apparel. And the truth that we all need to get our heads around is that these people are not doing it wrong.
But that's what it's like in 2017. Cyclists telling other cyclists they're doing it wrong. At a moment in time in which outsiders of many kinds face exclusion or prejudice in our society, this kind of behavior is embarrassingly off-key.
As time has passed and The List has gotten longer (and painfully more earnest), an insidious thing has happened: More people have started to take the document, and what it represents, too seriously.
In a 2015 interview, a Velominati cofounder bragged that “The List” was generating 850,000 pageviews a month. (To me, the habit of these guys calling themselves the “keepers” of The List is too pretentiously lame to approximate an inside joke.)
All that traffic might be great for monetizing banner ads, but it has not been good for cycling culture. Rather than looking for an inside line on how the pros and their imitators stow their glasses on a ride, a large segment of mainstream roadies has actually come to believe that riders who don't follow these grandiose decrees are outsiders, or amateurs, or idiots. (Velominati co-founder Frank Strack did not respond for comment on this piece.)
It's not just the Velominati, of course. In recent months, I have engaged in a semi-serious Twitter battle with the editors of a popular American bike-racing magazine over their repeated claims that cycling enthusiasts who don't wear leg warmers in certain weather conditions are foolish. They have published display copy for a podcast that asserts that riders who don't cover their legs below a certain temperature are “dumb, not tough” — and have doubled down on that contention when challenged.
On Twitter, I constantly see references to riders who are “doing it wrong.” All of these voices are reflecting and amplifying an element of cycling culture that needs to die.
Paradoxically, an attempt to celebrate the refined subtleties of road cycling is suffocating it. Look at how participation for recreational road racing is flat. Look at the struggle to get more women and minorities and young people engaged with riding as a sport. Look at the way so many potential riders look at road cycling as too exclusive or complicated or intimidating to try. In any case, the subculture that “The Rules” and its supporters inhabit is making itself increasingly trivial.
The solution is so simple it's painful: Just do your thing and don't tell anyone they're doing it wrong. If you want to mimic the pros and reference Euro traditions in your everyday riding and abstain from wearing camo bibs or using spacers, Godspeed. One of the cool things about cycling culture is the seemingly infinite depth and nuance of its traditions.
But people don't need a turgid 95-point instruction manual to find their way as cyclists. They just need other riders to open their minds and shut their mouths.
Finally, the skeleton is out of the Arab Spring closet via an article in Foreign Policy written by Jonathan Spyer. Israel has been at war for total dominance in the Middle East and, according to the senior research fellow at the Global Research in International Affairs Center (Rubin Center) and Jerusalem Post columnist, Tel Aviv is about to engage in Syria to confront Iran.
All I can say is, if the director of one of Israel's research centers located at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) is right, then the kickoff to Armageddon could be around the corner. For some months now my research and reporting on Syria and the wider crises has revolved around Israel's role in world affairs. So, with this revelation it seems clear that the gloves will soon come off where Israel as the instigator of crises is concerned. Bibi and Trump meeting in Washington, the role of AIPAC in pressing for sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, and the provocative geostrategic role the Netanyahu government has played equal overwhelming circumstantial proof of the tiny nation's responsibility for Middle Eastern chaos. Quoting Speyer:
“Israeli officials believe that Iran is winning its bid for dominance in the Middle East, and they are mobilizing to counter the regional realignment that threatens to follow. The focus of Israel's military and diplomatic campaign is Syria.”
From my point of view, I cannot decide which facet of this news is scarier, the apparent fact that top Israeli analysts now don't care about public opinion or the possibility that Israel really might go nuclear against Iran. The Foreign Policy article also reveals Israeli motives that have driven international incidents. For instance, with regard to the United States' initial psychotic episode over chemical weapons that the Assad government was supposed to have used against its own people, those “weapons fears” had nothing whatsoever to do with Syrians. Spyer takes special note of Israeli missions against chemical weapons facilities at Masyaf. Let's face it, Israel does not fly missions to rescue endangered Arabs. But the acute problem for the Israeli regime is not Assad anymore. Since the Syrian Army with Russian and Iranian assistance has nearly eradicated ISIS, Tel Aviv is worried about the aftermath of the Syrian mess. And about their precious Golan Heights. Quoting FP again:
“Iranian forces now maintain a presence close to or adjoining the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Heights and the Quneitra Crossing that separates it from the Syrian-controlled portion of the territory. Israel has throughout the Syrian war noted a desire on the part of the Iranians and their Hezbollah clients to establish this area as a second line of active confrontation against the Jewish state, in addition to south Lebanon.”
The Israeli expert goes on to assert that “Syria hardly exists today”, and proclaims Iran and Russia the “masters” of the war-torn country. The Foreign Policy article lays out in no uncertain terms the essential mindset and strategy Israel has deployed against neighboring enemies and allies alike – even though the author did not intend to do so. By showing what Israel fears most, and in listing in convincing form the geopolitical and military counterweights of Tel Aviv, Spyer betrays the actual intentions of Israel. Read how Israel has worked with rebels inside Syria:
“Israel has developed pragmatic working relations with the local rebel groups who at the moment still control the greater part of the border, such as the Fursan al-Joulan group. This cooperation focuses on treating wounded fighters and civilians, and providing humanitarian aid and financial assistance. There has also probably been assistance in the field of intelligence, though no evidence has yet emerged of direct provision of weapons or direct engagement of Israeli forces on the rebels' behalf.”
Finally, scanning reports and propaganda from the Rubin Center's website one finds the Israeli group not just focused regionally. First, we find this Spyer fellow with eyes on Ukraine and the Jewish community there in a piece for Jerusalem Post portraying pro-Russian factions as Nazis. Next, I find it interesting that the Caucasus and Georgia are covered in depth. A story by Mahir Khalifa-zadeh (a veteran of the Kosovo OSCE mission in 1999) from September of 2014 entitled “The South Caucasus: Obama's Failed Russia “Reset” and the Putin Doctrine in Practice” betrays Israeli geostrategy in the heart of that more distant calamity. A pragmatic person might ask the question here, “Was Israel against a reset of US-Russia relations?” The answer there leads us to new ideas on just “who” is behind the current west-east divide. Quoting from the report:
“Since 2009, under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has pursued a “Russian reset” policy, promising a fresh start to previously tense relations. Yet this policy has failed to improve American interests, particularly in the South Caucasus region, which is strategically important for both Israeli and U.S. policy towards the greater Middle East and the post-Soviet space.”
This report from the Azerbaijani expert touches on US and Israel “energy security”, which also reflects the core catalyst for crisis in these regions. We don't often read or hear about the so-called Contract of the Century between Azerbaijan and the big oil heavyweights in the west, but this quote frames the issue well:
“The discovery of the Azeri, Chirag, and Guneshli oil fields in that region significantly energized U.S. policy and diplomacy to transform the area into an important source of non-Middle-Eastern energy. Huge Azeri oil and gas reserves also raised the issue of energy transportation routes to bypass Russia.”
Bypassing Russia and Iran, cutting Syria off as a gateway for delivering energy, destroying any semblance of resistance to Israeli power in the region, shoring up America's dominance in the global scheme – these deals and strategies show tradeoffs that have created massive crises. And the Zionists that run Israel are smack in the middle of all of them. This is no longer arguable. The question remains, “What can we do about it?”
The answer to the question is not a positive one, for in the west the game is pretty much rigged. Citizens are either distracted by local crises, or they are uneducated and apathetic toward global geopolitics. In short, we're ill prepared to do anything at all. This is one reason why we see globalist magazines like Foreign Policy, and even leading politicians, unafraid to simply lay out the plans. These revelations we are seeing are a consequence of our own indifference, and the solutions to Israeli or US encroachments are not easy for people to accept. Where Tel Aviv is concerned, the only mediation that will get its attention is force. In my opinion, until the international community (or Russia perhaps) slaps Israel down (and hard) these crises will only escalate. Israel had the key role in Arab Spring, and in the regime change targeting Assad and Syria. As a result, millions of people are now displaced or worse. It's high time that these Zionist autocrats face the music. The alternative will be a cataclysm.

Public school privatization troops were out in force yesterday in the Wisconsin State Capitol as the Senate Education Committee held a public hearing on SB 76, a bill that undermines the authority of local schools boards to approve charter schools, and dips into their pockets to pay for the insult.
The proposal comes in the wake of a failed attempt last session to create a state-wide charter school authorizing board that would have forced local school districts to accept and pay for charter schools they did not want.
The current proposal is more nuanced, but no less invasive. For charter schools that would operate as part of the school district known as "instrumentality" schools, SB 76 bars a school board from considering the financial impact of a charter school on students in the rest of the district, and removes input from teachers in the decision. It also forces school districts to allow "high performing" charter schools to open new schools in the district whether the community wants it or not.
Emotions ran high during the four-hour hearing on the bill, as public school defenders clashed with charter proponents. Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) authored the substitute amendment to the bill, which was only released two days before the hearing. The legislative council memo explaining the meaning of the legalese in the amendment was not available at the time of the hearing, so many people were unaware of what it meant.
In what has become a typical divide-and-conquer tactic of the Wisconsin Republican legislative leadership, the hearing was scheduled at the same time as three other public education-related hearings involving school mascots, scholarships, and a high profile Common Core hearing.
It was sparsely attended by public education advocates, who wanted their voices to be heard in the Common Core hearing. Most of the people who testified were registered lobbyists for the charter school industry, or people who work in charter schools.
In their opening statement on the bill, Sen. Darling used the frame favored by school privatizers to justify their theft of public resources: failing schools and bureaucracy vs. kids. "This bill gives children the opportunity to attend a charter school that works," they said.
When challenged by Sen. John Lehman (D-Racine), who called it a "statewide mandate requiring school boards to approve schools whether or not they want to approve them," Darling replied, "You could look at it as diminishing the authority of school boards, or as increasing the freedom of charter schools to innovate."
Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma) challenged Darling on the funding mechanism for independent charter schools that reduces general school aids to districts in order to pay for charters. Vinehout pointed out that property-poor districts such as the one they represent are hit even harder since they rely more heavily on state aid than do districts which have high property tax receipts.
According to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, state aids were reduced by 1.5% or $64 million last year in order to fund the currently existing independent charter schools in Milwaukee and Racine. An expansion of independent charter schools statewide would take a larger bite out of the ever-diminishing public education budget.

As if hitting the play button on rightwing talking point #729 out of the ALEC songbook, Darling said, "You're interested in the funding of the schools but I'm more interested in the education of the children. We're at a point in our history where we have to say charter schools are public schools." They then went on to say that they agreed that the school funding formula should be changed and that they wished there were more money in the public education budget.
Vinehout called out Darling, who is Senate leader of the state's budget committee.
"Madam co-chair of Joint Finance, it may come as some shock, but there was actually plenty of money in this budget," Vinehout said. "It spent $4 billion more than the last budget. There was plenty of money to fully fund schools and all of the requests made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, but that wasn't done. You had more input into the process than I did."
Sen. Tim Cullen (D-Janesville) agreed: "The fact is there was $500 million in the budget that could have gone to schools but went to roads."
The most disturbing element of the hearing was the aggressive confidence of charter school and chamber of commerce lobbyists representing both state and national groups, as if their domination of public education policy and budgets were a foregone conclusion. They quoted statistics drummed up inside their own school reform echo chambers about how low Wisconsin ranks on national charter-school friendliness indices, and bemoaned the bureaucratic obstacles posed by the democratic public processes required of local school boards.
Several lobbyists argued that charter schools run by local school districts should be called something else, like magnet schools, since they were under the influence of the inefficient, status quo-supporting school district bureaucracies. In their view, the term "charter school" should be reserved for private schools that receive taxpayer money but are not accountable to democratically elected local school boards.
They argued this even as they hammered home their talking point "charter schools are public schools" (because the kids who attend them are members of the public) and "flexibility comes with strict accountability" (where accountability is exercised every five years when school districts can choose to not renew a contract).
SB 76 adds five new charter-school-authorizing entities to the four already in place in southeastern Wisconsin. The proposal states that any of Wisconsin's state colleges, universities, technical school districts and regional school district agencies may authorize a private charter school operator to open a school without the input, consent or even knowledge of the local school district where it would be located.
Gary Vose, President of the Kettle Moraine School Board said this is a "huge issue" for their district, which just opened an instrumentality charter school centered around the medical sciences. "For an authorizer outside the school district to create an identical school a block away would be detrimental to our school," they explained.
Last month SB 286, a bill authored by the chairs of the Assembly and Senate Education Committees that would fully include religious and other private schools receiving funds through the school voucher program in the state-wide school accountability system met with opposition from key Republican legislators.
The sudden appearance and hasty hearing this week of the substitute amendment to SB 76, a bill that was introduced last March, may be a signal that some of the opponents of SB 286 are willing to compromise on that measure in exchange for the give-aways included in the charter school bill. No executive session has been scheduled yet for either proposal.
The Senate cleared an overhaul of the controversial No Child Left Behind program in a bipartisan vote on Wednesday, sending the measure to President Barack Obama, who then signed it into law Thursday.
The vote was 85-12.
Critics complained the George W. Bush-era law, which was supported by Republicans and Democrats when it was approved in 2002, gave too much influence to Washington in controlling education policy and that power should be returned to state and local school boards.
"It wasn't long after the law was passed that we realized it was full of flaws," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said shortly before the vote.
Under the new law, named the Every Student Succeeds Act, students still must be tested in reading and math, but state and local officials would have greater leeway in determining how to respond to underachieving schools.
"This forward-looking replacement for a broken law would open new opportunities for our kids and put education back in the hands of those who understand their needs best: parents, teachers, states, and school boards," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called the bill a victory for "conservative reform."
But not all conservatives agreed.
Presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said they opposed the deal because it still gives too much power to Washington.
The bill "continues to propagate the large and ever-growing role of the federal government in our education system---the same federal government that sold us failed top-down standards like Common Core," Cruz said in a statement.

Craig Cobb, the self-described white supremacist who seeks to turn Leith, N.D. into an Aryan enclave, got a taste of their own medicine after DNA test results revealed on daytime television that he's part-African.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that a fellow white supremacist targeted Cobb with racially charged graffiti after their appearance on the “Trisha Goddard” show, where a DNA test revealed that they were genetically “14 percent sub-Saharan African.”
“The individual in question was interviewed, and when their interview answers weren't matching up, they essentially admitted it,” Grant County Assistant State's Attorney Todd Schwarz told the Times. “The one that tipped it off — they painted on the house, ‘BACK IN BLACK,' and he's not an AC/DC fan.”
Cobb was arrested and jailed Saturday on charges of terrorizing along with one of their followers, Kynan Dutton, after Leith residents called 911 to complain the men were threatening them with guns.
Cobb sent the Bismarck Tribune a text message before that arrest explaining their actions: “Because of the many violences and harassments against we and the children, we have commenced armed patrols of Leith.”
Schwartz told the Times that Cobb and Dutton “had a falling out” with the other supremacist the day Cobb's DNA test results were revealed. Since Schwartz thought Cobb knew their fellow supremacist targeted him, the prosecutor said, the armed patrol was a “manufactured” excuse to harass Leith residents.
Yuri Dmitrievich Budanov (Russian: Ю́рий Дми́триевич Буда́нов, IPA: [ˈjʉrʲɪj ˈdʲmʲitrʲɪjɪvʲɪtɕ bʊˈdanəf]; 24 November 1963 – 10 June 2011) was a Russian military officer convicted by a Russian court of kidnapping and murder in Chechnya.
Budanov was highly controversial in Russia: despite the conviction, Budanov enjoyed widespread support of Russian households as polled by public opinion.[1] At the same time, they were broadly hated in Chechnya, even by the pro-Russian Chechens. In December 2008, a court in the south Russian Ulyanovsk Oblast granted a petition for early release. After eight years in prison (of the ten years they were sentenced), they were released on parole on 15 January 2009.[2]
On 10 June 2011, Budanov was shot dead in Moscow by an unknown perpetrator;[3][4] responsibility for the attack was later claimed by the Caucasus Emirate.[5]
Biography [ edit ]
Budanov was born in 1963 in Khartsyzk, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. They graduated from the Tank Military School in Kharkiv and went on officer career in the Soviet Army, particularly, serving with the Soviet base in Hungary.
At the fall of the Soviet Union, Budanov was serving in Belarus, but they refused Belarusian citizenship and was transferred to the Siberian Military District, and then to Chechnya. In 1999 Budanov graduated from the military academy, receiving the rank of Guards Colonel.
According to the father of Budanov's victim, Budanov's tank regiment had been encamped just outside Tangi-Chu since February 2000, and Budanov themselves had a notorious reputation among villagers. About ten days before the murder, Budanov reportedly arbitrarily searched and looted several homes in Tangi Chu, and two days before the incident they reportedly looted and threatened to torch several other homes.
From 2001 to 2003, Russian courts tried Colonel Yuri Budanov on the charges of March 27, 2000, kidnapping, rape (an allegation later withdrawn by the prosecution[6]) and brutal murder of Elza Kungaeva, an 18-year-old Chechen woman whom Budanov alleged of being a sniper for Chechen rebels who were attacking their unit. They admitted killing them in a fit of rage, but denied the rape charges.[7]
They were assassinated on 10 June 2011 in Moscow, Russia.
Prosecution [ edit ]
Arrest [ edit ]
Budanov was arrested on March 29, 2000. According to press reports, Budanov claimed that Kungaeva was a suspected sniper, and that they had gone into a rage while questioning her.[7]
Colonel-General Anatoly Kvashnin, then chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, appeared on national television to announce to President Vladimir Putin and the nation the arrest of Budanov in the grisly case. Kvashnin accused Budanov of "humiliating" and murdering Kungayeva, and denounced the colonel's behavior as "barbaric and "disgraceful."[6]
In a stark contrast, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Shamanov, who was Budanov's commanding officer, exhibited strong sympathy towards him.[citation needed] They said that Budanov was one of their best commanders and offered this challenge: "To [Budanov's] enemies I say: Don't put your paws on the image of a Russian soldier and officer."[8]
The Chechen rebels offered to exchange nine recent OMON special police captives for Budanov.[9] After the Russian side refused the offer, the prisoners were executed on the morning of April 4, 2000.[10]
Charges [ edit ]
In relation to the case of Kungayeva, Budanov was charged with three crimes: kidnapping resulting in death, abuse of office accompanied by violence with serious consequences, and murder of an abductee.[11] No charges have been brought expressly for the beating and torture Kungaeva endured prior to their death.[citation needed] They were also charged in the beating up of a subordinate officer, threatening superior officers with a weapon, and other crimes.[12]
Budanov claimed that they detained Kungaeva on suspicion of being a sniper, and that they killed them during interrogation. The investigation, however, reportedly found that no member of the Kungaev family had in any way been suspected of involvement in the anti-Russian activity.[citation needed]
Budanov used their official position and a combat vehicle to remove Kungaeva from their home, and detained Kungaeva at a military installation; they were thus charged with exceeding their official position with violence resulting in serious consequences, which is punishable by three to ten years of imprisonment (article 286.3 of the criminal code).
Lack of a rape prosecution [ edit ]
The forensic physician, a Captain in the Russian military medical service, found three tears in their hymen and one in the mucous membrane of their rectum, and the report concludes that they were penetrated anally and vaginally by a blunt object before death.[13]
Three of Budanov's subordinates, Sergeants Li En Shou and Grigoriev and a Private Yegorev, were found responsible.[13] Charges against all three were simultaneously brought and dropped under the May 26, 2000 amnesty law.[13]
Trial [ edit ]
The trial began on April 9, 2003, in Rostov-on-Don. Legal proceedings against Budanov, who underwent several retrials, lasted a total of 2 years and 3 months.[14]
Witnesses included Yahyayev, the person in the town administration, who according to Budanov had given them the picture representing Chechen snipers. However, Yahyayev said they had given no such picture to Budanov.[15] General Shamanov came to defend Budanov during trial.[citation needed] They expressed their solidarity with the defendant, as did Colonel-General Gennady Troshev and numerous other Russian soldiers and civilians who picketed the court.[citation needed] According to a poll, 50% of the Russians asked supported the demands of picketers to release Colonel Budanov from custody; 19% did not support these demands.[16]
In a controversial decision, Budanov was initially found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity on December 31, 2002, and committed to a psychiatric hospital for further evaluation and the length of the treatment would have been decided by their doctor.[12]
However, in the beginning of March 2003 the supreme court invalidated the sentence and ordered a new trial. This took place in the same place but with a new judge. The sentence of 10 years of imprisonment was given on July 25, 2003.[12]
The judge who convicted Budanov, Vladimir Bukreyev, themselves was convicted of bribe-taking and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment on July 6, 2009.[17]
In prison [ edit ]
On 21 September 2004, Shamanov, now the Ulyanovsk regional governor, signed a pardon for Yury Budanov; Interfax quoted the head of the Ulyanovsk pardons commission, Anatoly Zherebtsov, as saying that if Putin backed the recommendation, Budanov would also get back their military rank and awards.[citation needed]
The commission's decision sparked outrage in Chechnya. "Whether in jail or freed, Budanov will remain a person who has committed a grave crime, which took the life of an innocent girl," Taus Dzhabrailov, the head of Chechnya's parliament, told Interfax. Ramzan Kadyrov said: "The Ulyanovsk commission's decision is like spitting on the soul of the long-suffering Chechen people." [18] Kadyrov also made statements that "If any of Elza's friends should meet [Budanov] I don't want to predict how they will act. The Chechen people do not consider them to be a human being, and as a war criminal, they do not deserve to be. One might be able to forgive their crime to some extent if they had killed a man. But to sexually assault a girl cannot be forgiven.  They are beneath contempt. They have brought shame on the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation."[citation needed]
In February 2006, a Russian prison official announced that Budanov, who was serving their 10-year sentence, might be released early on good behaviour.[citation needed] The Chechen regional branch of the United Russia party addressed the State Duma and the Russian President with a request not to grant amnesty to Yuri Budanov.[19] The same month, on the petition of Budanov's attorney, with account of good behaviour of the inmate, the former colonel was removed from the strict custody colony to a settlement-colony.[20]
On 24 December 2008, a court granted them a release on parole. This was the fifth attempt by Budanov's lawyers to obtain them a release on parole. Four applications before that were rejected.[21] Victim's lawyers appealed to overturn the decision (thus the delay in release), but without success.[21] Budanov was released on 15 January 2009, 15 months before completion of their conviction term.[21] The decision was protested by Chechnya's human rights ombudsman, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, who accused Russian judges of "double standards" with regard to Russians and Chechens.[22]
The lawyer for the Kungayeva family, Stanislav Markelov, who had attempted a last-minute appeal against the release of Budanov, was shot dead in Moscow on 19 January 2009 along with Anastasia Baburova, a 25-year-old journalist for Novaya Gazeta.[23] However, the investigation of Markelov's murder showеd in November 2009 that the murder was probably unrelated to this case, but committed by Neo-Nazis as a revenge for Markelov's support of Marxist activists as a lawyer.[24]
Assassination and funeral [ edit ]
Yuri Budanov was assassinated around 11:30 on 10 June 2011 in central Moscow (Hamovniki, Komsomolski prospekt), Russia. Six silenced shots were fired, four of which struck Budanov in the head.[25] The killer escaped in a car driven by an accomplice. The car was subsequently found partially burned several blocks from the site of the attack. A gun believed to be a Makarov PM was found with a silencer inside the car. Budanov's wife witnessed the assassination and was held by Russian authorities.[26] Russian police investigators commented that the attack was carefully planned and they considered blood revenge as one of the likely motives.[27] One witness to the murder described the driver of the car from which the six shots were fired as being of Slavic appearance.[28] Dokku Umarov claimed responsibility for the assassination as they sat by the commander of the Riyadus-Salikhiyn Brigade saying "I am addressing you today about a joyous occasion: yesterday, on 10 June, Allah by their will brought us a great celebration, punishing one of the sadists, the reprobate, the killer Budanov. The same fate, the same revenge awaits the others. Let these celebrations happen more often for Muslims." Upon the release of a video by Umarov, one of the investigators in the case said that "We have been expecting this kind of statement for a long time because the 'Chechen version' is one of the main ones we are working with. Nevertheless, these types of terrorist statements will not alter the course of our probe. We are studying all the leads."
Their funeral was attended by such Russian right-winged leaders as Vladimir Zhirinovsky and accompanied by a three-gun salute. The Moscow police is reported to have made a dozen arrests immediately before closing most of the investigation to the press.[29]
On 7 May 2013, Yusup Temerkhanov was convicted by a jury of Budanov's murder and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. According to investigation, Temerkhanov's motive was revenge for their father, who was killed in 2000 during the Second Chechen War.[30] Temerkhanov's defense lawyer, Murad Musayev, was charged with trying to bribe two jury members to find their client not guilty, but the charges against Musayev were dropped in February 2015 due to statute of limitations.[31] Two jury members in question, Diana Lomonosova and Vitali Pronin, were also charged with taking that bribe of 6,000,000 rubles. Pronin plead guilty to the charges during their trial.[32] Lomonosova was amnestied on 28 April 2015 due to being older than 50.[33] Pronin was sentenced to a suspended sentence of one year and immediately amnestied on 5 May 2015.[34] Temerkhanov denied any involvement and pleaded not guilty. They died while serving their sentence in a penal colony in Siberia in August 2018.[35] Chechnya president Ramzan Kadyrov praised Temerkhanov as "people's hero" after attending their memorial service.[36]

Political muckraker Mark Dice is exposing just how far liberals are willing to go to “stop Donald Trump” in the 2016 by concocting a fake petition to allow illegal immigrants to vote.
In a YouTube video posted Monday, Dice conducted the “social experiment” on beach-goers on a San Diego boardwalk, and the results were eye-opening, though not particularly surprising.
“Quick signature to support the illegal aliens to help them be able to vote this election?” Dice asked as they handed the fake petition to a pink bikini-clad blonde, who happily signed.
“We're just trying to stop Donald Trump any way we can,” they said. “We figure desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Another young couple strolling the boardwalk were also happy to oblige.
“Will you support the undocumented immigrants and let them vote this election?” Dice asked the couple.
“Oh ya, of course,” the woman said.
“We're just trying to get as many liberals on the voter registrar as possible,” Dice explained. “Fifteen or 20 million undocumented immigrants, if we can help them vote …
“They've lived here, they have driver's licenses, so it's kind of discriminatory to not allow them to vote in the election, don't you think?” they asked.
“Ya, I agree. I definitely agree,” the woman said as their partner added their name to the petition.
“Since this election has a lot to do with them, they should probably have a say,” Dice said.
“I agree,” the woman responded.
Some people seemed puzzled when Dice explained the petition, but signed anyway.
A woman in a red and white striped tank top furled their brow when Dice described the petition but followed through when they said the aim is to “stop Donald Trump.”
“Ok,” they said.
Others had a similar reaction.
“Will help to allow the illegal immigrants to be able to vote in this election?” Dice asked two young ladies, who shrugged when first approached.
“Why not?” they said. “Only if they don't vote for Trump, can you guarantee that?”
“Well none of them are,” Dice said. “If we can get the Mexicans to be able to vote in this election, we can definitely stop Donald Trump.
“So 15 million undocumented immigrants, we're going to get them registered to vote.”
“Cool!” they said, giving Dice a high-five. “Good job!”
Several other folks – a young woman, a guy skateboarding the boardwalk – gladly signed the petition, as well, though one fellow did call Dice out on the prank.
“I've seen this before,” they said. “Who's recording?”
“Right over there,” Dice said, pointing to the camera man. “Good for you. …”
"Planet of the Apps" judge Gwyneth Paltrow. Apple The first episode of Apple's new reality show, "Planet of the Apps," has arrived — and it's a total mess.

: Navratna Defence PSU Electronics Ltd (BEL) today said the company's spend on R&D isexpected to grow to 12 per cent over the next five years.
"Our target is actually to touch 10 per cent, we are about 8.5 per cent now. In the next three to five years we will grow beyond 10 to 12 per cent," BEL Director (R&D) Ajit TKalghatgi said.
They said the company focused "very heavily" on design and development and "so we have a very strong R&D focus."
Compared with the industry standard in India, BEL was the largest spender on indigenisation or indigenous R&D development.
Putting a number to the R&D spend of BEL at a conference at the Aero 2017 air show here, Kalghatgi said it amounts to about Rs 500 to 700 crore per year.
Stating that the money is spent on development of new projects, new technology and new products, they said, "we are not into fundamental research as we are an industry. We work with academic community we fund for projects, but developing a technology module and product design which is relevant for an industry is being addressed by BEL."
The company works very closely with DRDO and also co-develop with it with work share, as well as investment sharing on some projects.
BEL today said it was awarded an offset contract for supply of 10 numbers of CoMPASS systems for use in Light Combat Helicopters (LCH) being manufactured by HAL by Elbit Systems Electro-Optics Ltd (ELOP), Israel.

Switching from Presentations to Hack Nights
The number of tech meetups in San Francisco is pretty insane. You could probably eat free pizza every night of the week if that was your thing.
Despite the quantity of meetups here, they almost all have the same structure. Tens of people show up, everyone has pizza and beer, a person gives a presentation for 30 or 60 minutes, people ask questions or flex at the speaker, people mill about for a bit, and then everyone goes home. Okay, but is that actually a nice way to build a community? I mean, sometimes the talk is boring. Sometimes the talk is interesting, but I only really understood 50% of it. Maybe I want to ask someone, but it is hard to start talking with strangers. Often I end up talking to between zero and one new person.
Early on with the Elm meetup in SF, I switched to a hack night style. I wanted the meetup to be more inclusive and beginner friendly. I wanted to see what sort of cool things everyone else was working on. Basically, I wanted to build a fun community where people learn and make cool stuff together!
Now that there are Elm meetups popping up in cities all over the world, I figured it was a good time to share my thinking on this!
What is a Hack Night?
We structure the Elm meetups in San Francisco like this:
Sometimes spend 10 or 15 minutes up front showing something cool. Maybe that is me previewing improved error messages or Richard demoing elm-css or Aaron showing elm-format. This is more of a show-and-tell about making something cool. If there is nothing to show, we skip this.
Pairing and collaboration is kind of the whole point of these meetups, so we have a couple minutes where folks can briefly share what they will be working on. This does two important things. First, it makes it clear to everyone that this meetup and this community is about building cool and useful stuff. (Not all functional language communities are this way!) Second, it gives new folks an easy way to find some form of mentorship. Maybe that just means asking a few questions at the meetup, but hopefully it means finding collaborators on interesting projects!
From there we work together until the place clears out hours later!
One thing to notice is that “the spirit of Elm” is embodied by this structure. Elm is about making great projects and having fun programming. It is about the joy of learning. It is about bouncing ideas off others to find better answers. So the Hack Night format is a great cultural fit for us.
Not all parts of the presenter/audience meetup style is gone though. We definitely still have free pizza and beer!
Before and After
I did maybe three meetups in the traditional presenter/audience style before switching, and it was amazing to see how the attendees changed almost immediately.
In one of the presenter/audience meetups, the topic was “The Taxonomy of FRP” and the audience was a mix of PhDs, authors of reactive libraries, and maybe a few folks curious what this Elm thing is. Most people had backgrounds in languages like Haskell and Scala. Now this was a fun event, but in a way, this was actively harmful for Elm. I was helping experts get even farther from mainstream programming! This is not how typed functional languages are going to break out of their niche.
As soon as I switched to the hack night style, the attendees totally changed. It became primarily folks who write JavaScript for work. (We also get a reliable subset of folks using backend languages like Ruby, Clojure, Erlang, etc. who are trying to get into frontend programming without going crazy.) More importantly, a lot of these folks are very new to Elm. Often people will come planning to get things installed while at the hack night. This is great! We end up with a healthy mix of new and experienced people, so everyone is learning from each other. Beginners gain confidence quicker by asking questions and working with others. Package authors stay grounded in reality, seeing how their API works for the real life humans they are trying to help. Core folks such as myself learn from novices and experts alike, making it possible to make targetted improvements to docs, libraries, etc.
So with hack nights, Elm is just a backdrop for meeting interesting folks and building cool stuff together. I think this was a huge part of how we built a community that is friendly and fun.
Designing Culture
Now I knew I did not want a presenter/audience style for my Elm meetups, but I was pretty clueless about what to do instead until I talked with Cecily Carver about how they ran Dames Making Games in Toronto. They shared ideas about collaboration and community building that were the primary inspiration for the hack night style meetups we ended up with. Thank you again Cecily!
Now, maybe a hack night will work well for your community, but maybe not! The point here is more that the spirit of your project manifests in your meetups. Elm is about everyone making cool stuff, so the meetups are too! Papers We Love is about reading interesting academic computer science papers, so maybe only the community building aspects of a hack night are interesting. For some projects, maybe nothing really translates at all! The real point here is that: even if you do not think about it, your meetups help define your community and its culture. If you are concious of this, you will end up with a healthier community and culture.
That said, it is super easy to be blind to your own failings. Sometimes people within a community may see themselves a certain way, but the meetups tell a different story. Maybe It's like that for us! The only way to know is to come to one of the Elm meetups at the NoRedInk offices in SF and check it out. Beginners are welcome! (Feedback on how to do better is welcome too!)

Pete Davidson is with them — forever.
The “Saturday Night Live” star took to Instagram on Friday to show off their new ink, a portrait of Hillary Clinton.
“Wanted to get @hillaryclinton a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero,” they wrote. “Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe.”
Clinton caught wind of Davidson's permanent homage and responded, writing, “Thanks, @petedavidson. This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years. But seriously, I'm honored. Merry Christmas, my friend.”
The 24-year-old, who notoriously wrote “F—k you, b—h” to Donald Trump in an Instagram post that has since been deleted, has also been vocal on the “SNL” “Weekend Update” segment about their views on the current administration.
In Thursday's post, they credited New York City tattoo artist Jon Mesa for the vintage Clinton tat.
Japan's constitution prohibits a standing army. Its troops are called self-defense forces and their functions have been severely limited until recently. In July, the lower house of Japan's parliament endorsed a package of security bills allowing the army to fight abroad for the first time since WWII.
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The US Department of States has approved $1.5 billion sale of a guided missile destroyer DDG 7, eight AEGIS Combat System, an Underwater Weapon System and Cooperative Engagement Capability equipment to Japan, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced in a statement on Friday.
“The State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to Japan for DDG 7 and 8 AEGIS Combat System, Underwater Weapon System, Cooperative Engagement Capability and associated equipment, parts and logistical support for an estimated cost of $1.5 billion,” the agency said.

Additional defense items in the deal include a new propulsion system, special purpose test equipment, engineering systems, training systems and the necessary staging services to support ship construction as well as delivery.
The agency added the delivery of two new AEGIS DDG's will also help Japan to reach its goal of “acquiring 8 ballistic missile defense capable ships and will further enhance interoperability with the US Navy.”
“The addition of two new AEGIS DDGs to Japan's fleet will afford more flexibility and capability to counter regional threats and continue to enhance stability in the region,” the agency said.
The announcement of weapons deals between the United States and Japan comes as China's pursuit of land reclamation in the East and South China Seas has led to deteriorating relations with Washington and its close ally Tokyo.
The same groups that fought off the anti-piracy bill SOPA are now rallying the Internet community against Cispa, a cybersecurity bill introduced Thursday during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee.
Like all good advocacy groups these days, Internet activist groups Demand Progress and Fight for the Future are employing social media in a big way in the campaign to put added pressure on lawmakers. On the same day the Cybersecurity Sharing and Protection Act was introduced, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future delivered to the Hill a petition with 300,000 signatures opposing the act. The groups also set up a dedicated Twitter account (@CISPApetition) that automatically tweets (under the hashtag #NoCISPA) a portion of the signatures every hour to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairperson of the committee, and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the ranking member of the committee who reintroduced the bill.
Other organizations, including Free Press and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are also collecting signatures for online petitions opposing the bill. In total, the groups have amassed more than 1 million signatures to date.
Opponents of the bill argue it violates consumer privacy because it would allow companies to share users' private data with the government in unprecedented ways. Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Demand Progress, who died in January, had said, "It sort of lets the government run roughshod over privacy protections and share personal data about you."
Cispa ran into some of the same criticism from civil liberties groups and privacy advocates last year when it passed the House. President Obama said they would veto it.
Opponents of the reintroduced version remain skeptical that changes to the bill will include better privacy protections, especially since no civil liberties groups were asked to testify at Thursday's hearing.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachussetts, attends a US Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, February 24, 2015.Yellen said Tuesday that the US labor market still showed cyclical weakness and inflation continued to fall, making any interest rate hike unlikely before June. In testimony in Congress, Yellen also said that frailties in China and Europe continued to pose a risk for the US economy, supporting the need for keeping the extraordinarily loose monetary policy currently in place. But they said that generally the US economy continued to grow fast enough to bring down unemployment, and the Fed expected that inflation would return back to normal over the medium term.

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been locked in a public feud over whether free trade agreements can be used to undermine the 2010 Wall Street reform law. On Wednesday, the Canadian government sided with Warren.
Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver gave a speech in New York arguing that the Volcker Rule -- a key tenet of the 2010 banking law -- violates the North American Free Trade Agreement. The move underscores Warren's warning that such deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama is currently negotiating, jeopardize financial reform.
The Volcker Rule bars banks operating in the U.S. from speculating in securities markets for their own profit -- a risky activity that can put taxpayers on the hook for big bailouts if the bank bets turn sour. But there are exceptions to the rule. For instance, banks are allowed to hold U.S. government debt in their own accounts.
But those same banks aren't allowed to trade in Canadian government debt. Oliver thinks that's a NAFTA violation. Although they didn't lay out their argument in detail on Wednesday, NAFTA, like the TPP, generally bans countries from discriminating against each other's financial services. NAFTA prohibits policies that limit cross-border trade in financial services and requires the U.S. to treat Canadian companies the same way that it treats U.S. companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department vociferously rejected Oliver's claim in a statement provided to HuffPost.
"The Volcker Rule is clearly not a violation of NAFTA or any other trade agreement, all of which explicitly safeguard the ability of the United States to protect the integrity and stability of our financial system," a Treasury spokesperson said. "The Volcker Rule is a key prudential financial regulation that prohibits risky proprietary trading while protecting taxpayers and the depth, liquidity, and stability of U.S. capital markets. NAFTA does not weaken our ability to implement Wall Street Reform now or in the future, and neither would any trade agreement we're negotiating."
It's true that NAFTA contains an exemption for "prudential" regulation, and financial reform watchdogs strongly agree with the Treasury Department's interpretation. But it's not an airtight case.
Sorting out whether the Volcker Rule qualifies for that exemption is the sort of thing that a court would traditionally determine under U.S. law, and U.S. courts typically give significant deference to the views of the executive branch. U.S. courts, however, don't have jurisdiction over NAFTA or any other free trade pact. International tribunals do.
"The administration can say whatever it wants about its interpretation of these trade agreements," said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a Wall Street watchdog group. "The problem is, under the terms of these agreements, they are not going to be interpreting them. Private tribunals of trade lawyers are going to be interpreting them, and there are going to be plenty of openings, as this shows, to make claims that critical prudential regulations conflict with trade agreements. And eventually one of those is going to win out."
Treasury has known about Oliver's objection to the Volcker Rule for more than a year. As far back as 2011, a lobbying group representing Canadian banks claimed that the Volcker Rule runs afoul of NAFTA in arguments presented to U.S. regulators. But none of this turmoil prevented Obama from flatly rejecting Warren's contention that trade agreements, particularly the TPP, can be used to attack financial standards.
"The notion that corporate America is going to be able to use this provision to eliminate our financial regulations and our food safety regulations and our consumer regulations -- that's just bunk," Obama told reporters in an April conference call. "It's not true."
In the same discussion, the president also suggested that Warren's trade warnings were "dishonest" and constituted "misinformation."
Canada may not opt to pursue a NAFTA case against the U.S. over the Volcker Rule. If it doesn't, Canadian banks won't have the right to sue on their own because NAFTA bars individual companies from suing sovereign nations over most financial services violations.
But the TPP would be different, according to congressional briefings by the U.S. Trade Representative, which are reflected in a December letter from Warren to Ambassador Michael Froman, the top Obama trade official. The TPP wouldn't just empower foreign governments to sue the U.S. over bank regulations; it would allow individual companies and investors to bring such cases.
Under the "investor-state dispute settlement" process, an international tribunal cannot overrule a law or regulation, but it can assess financial penalties to encourage countries to change said law or regulation. In the past, under other trade deals, the mere existence of such cases has sometimes pressured governments into abandoning non-financial services regulations.
Moreover, the TPP would reportedly allow foreign banks to sue the U.S. government for failing to provide them with a "minimum standard of treatment." The term is vaguely defined, but international tribunals have interpreted it very broadly to make corporations eligible to receive damages for lost profits caused by policy changes that occurred after they invested in a country. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) raised similar concerns in their own December letter to Froman over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a pending trade deal with Europe.
Obama's "bunk" comments referenced investor-state dispute settlement. In the same call, they insisted that progressives should see the TPP as a major step forward from NAFTA.
But some of the world's largest and most powerful banks are headquartered in Europe (covered under the TTIP) and Japan (part of the TPP talks).
"If our trading partners are already invoking existing U.S. trade pacts to issue clear threats against Wall Street reform, why would we undertake an unprecedented expansion of this trade model's threat to financial stability by fast-tracking TPP and TTIP?" asked Ben Beachy, research director at Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
Financial watchdogs worry that future administrations will not share Obama's commitment to the Volcker Rule and other safeguards, making them more willing to cave in the face of trade pact pressure.
Justices prepare to hear arguments in of case of California teacher and co-plaintiffs who say ‘tyranny' of unions violates their rights through forced dues
Last year the US supreme court handed major victories to liberal Americans, legalising gay marriage and throwing out a challenge to Barack Obama's landmark healthcare reforms. But 2016 may be less kind. On Monday the justices will begin to hear a case that labor leaders argue could “bankrupt” public sector unions and geld one of the most powerful forces in politics.
Rebecca Friedrichs, who has taught elementary school children for close to 30 years, mostly in the Savanna school district in Anaheim, California, is the lead plaintiff in a case they say is being brought against the “tyranny” of union dues.
“We are required, as a condition of employment, to financially support teachers unions and their political agendas,” Friedrichs wrote in an editorial for the Orange County Register.
“Americans of all political preferences would rise up against such tyranny if their rights were squelched by corporations, yet teachers unions have been legally trampling the free-speech rights of teachers throughout our nation for decades through forced dues used to fund their one-sided political agendas.”
If their case is successful, it would sharply limit the power of public employee unions, which have charged “fair share” fees to non-union members when the union negotiates their contracts.
A win would cost unions millions of dollars in revenue, and be a heavy blow to a major backer of the Democrat party.
Altogether 10 California teachers are suing their union so that they do not have to pay any dues. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiff in Friedrichs v California Teachers Association (CTA), California would essentially become the latest, and largest, “right to work” state for public sector employees – meaning union membership would not be a requirement.
Powerful, rightwing anti-union forces have lined up to back the case. The teachers, who are represented by the Center for Individual Rights, a conservative organization with links to billionaire conservatives the Koch brothers, argue that the money they pay to the CTA is used for political purposes that do not represent their interest and often go against what they believe. The union argues that the educators, who pay only a portion of the full dues as a “fair share”, are only paying the union for the costs of bargaining and negotiations.
But the CTA is no political lightweight either. The union is one of the biggest players in state politics and one of the biggest spenders when it comes to political contributions in the California.

From 2000 to 2009, the CTA spent about $211.9m on campaign contributions. According to the Los Angeles Times, in the following three years the union spent another $40m, including $4.7m to elected Jerry Brown as governor. And then in 2014, the union spent about $7m to re-elect Tom Torlakson as the state superintendent of public instruction.
According to the union, only a fraction of its funds is dedicated to political contributions. The rest is spent on its defending its members and negotiating a contract through collective bargaining.
The teachers suing the CTA over dues argue that any work done by the union, even collective bargaining, is political.
To Erica Jones, who is an active member in the CTA, being a teacher itself is political.
“The union, of course, does political action, but our job in itself as educators is in a political field. I don't even know why you wouldn't want that voice, that political voice,” they explained. “Education is on every politician's platform. It's about either changing or reforming education. You are constantly being talked at and talked to, so if you are not in that discussion when you are an expert then why wouldn't you want that voice to be heard.”
Friedrichs and their co-plaintiffs believe they deserve a choice about whether they want to belong to a union or not.
California's right-to-work fight forces unions to prove their relevance Read more
“In our view, paying fees to a union should not be a prerequisite for teaching in a public school. No one in the US should be forced to give money to a private organization they or they disagree with fundamentally. Teachers deserve a choice,” Harlan Elrich, one of the plaintiffs, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this month.
The teachers in my family disagree about the union. Some support it and others don't. But everyone agrees that each of us should have the right to decide whether to join. So I'm not against the union; I'm against the state forcing me to pay union fees against my will.
The CTA declined to “speculate” about how many members it might lose if the supreme court rules in favor of Friedrichs.
“CTA works to engage all educators in the union and has over 91% membership,” Becky Zoglman, CTA's associate executive director, told the Guardian. “We'll continue to do that outreach regardless of the Friedrichs decision.”
But the experience of 25 states where right-to-work laws are already on the books show that union membership rates do indeed decline over the long term after the laws are introduced.
As of August of last year, there were 325,000 educator members of CTA and about 28,000 fee payers. The 2015 dues for CTA were $644. Those who wanted to pay just a fair-share portion of the dues were issued a rebate of $230. That means they still paid a total of $414.
CTA is not the only union that could be affected by the ruling. Other public-sector unions – like those for nurses and firefighters – could also be affected.
In 2014, 28% of California's 169,765 state government workers were paying “fair share dues”. A ruling against unions could lead to these workers having to pay no fees at all.
“The intended effect is to essentially bankrupt public sector unions, including many nurse unions,” said Jean Ross, co-president of National Nurses United in June when the supreme court first announced that it would hear the case. A ruling in favor of Friedrichs and their co-plaintiffs would essentially make California a right-to-work state for public sector employees. “Right-to-work means lower pay, higher poverty rates, and much greater income disparity. That's the same reason why groups like supporters of Friedrichs v CTA have targeted states like California that have avoided such anti-worker laws.”
A change could cost public sector workers more than their union dues. Public employees in right-to-work states earn $1,000 less than those living in “fair-share” states, according to Jeffrey Keefe, professor emeritus at the school of labor and management at Rutgers University.
“In states where unions cannot collect fair-share fees, the employees they represent earn lower wages and compensation, regardless of whether they are union members or not,” they said. “Public sector unions exist primarily for collective bargaining and their capacity to bargain effectively on behalf of public-sector employees is closely linked to their ability to collect fair-share fees and maintain high levels of union membership. Free-riding undermines their ability to fulfill these duties.”
Employees who benefit from the union's negotiations but do not want to pay dues are often referred to as freeloaders by the dues-paying members of the union.
“Fair-share has been ruled on by the supreme court before and it's really the best way to have a compromise. Ultimately as an educator, you are benefiting from your union, you are benefiting from bargaining and negotiations, so to be able to take the benefit but not actually help pull your own weight, I think that's a tad … misguided,” said Jones, who has been a teacher for 11 years and active member of the CTA for more than seven years.
A ruling in favor of Friedrichs “would be really devastating” they told the Guardian.
“Devastating in the way that we are trying to improve public education and I feel like we have this distraction and it's taking away from that conversation. We are really not talking about students. We are still focused on this misguided conversation.”

Four more Republican Senators all from rural states are withholding support for the Republican health care bill due to the damage it would do to rural hospitals. If McConnell brings this bill to the floor for a vote, Trump will be humiliatingly defeated by their own party.
The New York Times reported, “Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, signaled this week that they would not vote for the bill as written, following negative remarks from other senators with large poor and rural populations. That was the 10th defection. Three other Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and John Boozman of Arkansas, have withheld their support, although they have not declared their opposition, and others have largely remained silent.”
The problem for McConnell is that they don't have enough money to rob Peter to pay Paul in the legislative sense. Moderates want Medicaid funded, the rural Senators want rural hospitals not to lose funding, and Sens. Collins and Murkowski are weighing teaming up on an amendment that would restore Planned Parenthood funding.
There is a larger more underlying issue that may doom the healthcare bill. There are a series of differing ideologies within the Senate Republican caucus for what the healthcare bill should do. Far right Republican Senators want Obamacare repealed and replaced with nothing; there is a faction that wants Obamacare repealed with some popular provisions kept and a moderate faction that basically wants to keep the Affordable Care Act with changes.
McConnell has no margin for error since they are trying to pass this legislation with only Republican votes, but each concession that they make to gain votes from one faction loses votes from another.
If the Republicans want a health care bill to pass, they are going to need Democratic votes. The only way that they are going to get Democratic votes is by dropping the Obamacare repeal.
It is looking more and more likely that McConnell will bring the Republican bill to the floor for a vote, it will be defeated, and then work will begin on a bipartisan bill that keeps Obamacare.
Trump vow to repeal the ACA will go down in flames, and they will suffer defeat in the most humiliating way possible from their own party.

Last summer, after receiving my bachelor's degree, I moved from a rural Texas town to New York City with my 3-year-old daughter, Amora. In Texas, I'd had family, friends, and the best support system a single mom could ask for. But New York was the site of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, where I'd just been accepted. It felt like a fair trade-off.
When I searched for child-care options on Columbia University's Office of Work/Life website, I found that the listed resources and programs were unaffordable for a single-income family. But, to my excitement, I found the Back-Up Care Advantage Program, which describes its services as “care for anyone you have or feel a responsibility toward” for when “you still need to get to work, teach your courses, attend to your lab, or write a paper.” Columbia fronts the bill but asks parents for a $2 co-pay per hour, per child.
I quickly scrolled to see if I'd qualify.
“You can take advantage of the Back-Up Care Advantage Program®, if you are a full-time Columbia Officer of Instruction, Officer of Research, Officer of the Library, Officer of Administration, Non-Union Support Staff, Post-Docs (including Post-Doc Research Fellows, Research Scholars, and Research Scientists, regardless of eligibility for other University benefits) Doctoral student, enrolled either full-time or part-time, Teaching Fellow not in a Ph.D. program,” I read.
I emailed the Office of Work/Life to see if I understood correctly. Was the majority of the student population really excluded? “If you are a PhD level student, you are potentially eligible for the program; Master's students are not eligible,” a coordinator wrote back. Columbia's undergrads don't qualify either.
As a result, last year, I took out about $9,000 in Graduate PLUS loans to pay a sitter $20 per hour to pick Amora up from school on Tuesdays and Thursdays while I commuted from work to home. If I was in class or working on big assignments, friends and classmates watched them Amora loves hanging out with other trusted adults (ice cream and new books are usually involved), but the long-term financial costs are scary, especially if their future college tuition is considered.
According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, child care is vital for the 4.8 million parents in college, but because of federal funding shortfalls and long waiting lists, only 15 percent of the millions eligible receive subsidized care. For single moms at New York–area universities, it can be common to spend several days or weeks scouring for options just to wind up with significant student-loan debt.
Amina (some names have been changed) is a 39-year-old mom living in Brooklyn. Initially, their mother watched their 11-month-old daughter while they studied for their master's at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. But when their mother passed away unexpectedly, Amina was left scrambling to find child care. And when they told their professors about the unforeseen loss, one of them told them that they should consider taking a break from their studies.
NYU offers a subsidy for full-time grad students, but it's $200 per fall or spring semester, which doesn't even cover one week of full-time child care. Back when Amina was pregnant, before their mother passed, they turned to NYU's website for options but didn't find anything. Since they had a full-time school load, they might've qualified for a subsidy through NYC's Administration for Children's Services, but it's state-mandated that low-income student parents work a minimum of 17.5 hours per week.
“There was no support, but I couldn't afford to take time off of school to find child care … my success determined our financial well-being,” they explained.
Barbara Gault, the executive director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, traces the lack of support for single moms in school to the welfare-reform movement of the 1990s, which emphasized immediate work over longer-term skills development. Even now, states' child-care-subsidy requirements mirror the limitations on education set in place during that era.
“Many argue that these limitations were based on negative attitudes toward low-income mothers,” Gault explains.
When single moms pursue their education at distinguished but expensive universities, their needs for child care are often dismissed by state social services. “They think if you can afford to go to NYU then you can afford child care,” Amina said. “I was in an emotional whirlwind … I didn't have it in me to go through any agencies again.”
Amina isn't wrong. Helen Blank, National Women's Law Center's Director of Child Care and Early Learning, said the misconception is that “many moms do need to work and that, wrongly, school is a luxury,” which explains why some single-mom students are living in poverty and working low-income jobs.
Amina arranged for their cousin to babysit at a low cost, which they paid for with student loans, and they graduated on time in May 2012. They now works as a marketing analyst, but is still paying off more than $200,000 in debt accrued from their NYU tuition and child care.
It's not just financial support that's often absent, but an understanding of the kind of logistical and lifestyle challenges that single moms can face. Take, for instance, Shanice Lyons, a 23-year-old mother from Long Island who is pursuing a bachelor's in legal studies at St. John's University. Them 7-year-old daughter, Victoria, is blind, developmentally delayed, and gets around in a wheelchair because they have congenital conditions known as optic nerve hypoplasia and nystagmus. Since Victoria has disabilities, Lyons had tremendous difficulty finding a day care that would accept their daughter until Victoria was admitted into the Lavelle School for the Blind.
Lyons takes classes online so they can work full-time as a paralegal to support themselves and their daughter. She's also responsible for paying for Victoria's medical equipment and home adjustments that aren't covered by Medicare. (For instance, a stairlift for their wheelchair costs $3,200.) Initially, they didn't want to tell their professors that they were a single mom.
“I didn't feel like the school would be accepting, and when I did tell a professor what all I was dealing with, they didn't believe me,” they said. “He couldn't believe that a 23-year-old could have a 7-year-old with disabilities. I actually brought in their hospital records to prove it.” That wasn't the only time a professor doubted their situation. Shanice said they had to convince skeptical educators on multiple occasions.
“Just because there's one of me doesn't mean that my daughter doesn't get the best life,” they said. “Because they wake up so much at night, I usually hold my daughter in one arm and hold a book in my other hand to study.”
Helen Blank, of the National Women's Law Center, says that all moms have trouble with costs of child care, but low-income moms obviously struggle the most.
“You would think that child-care access for mothers in school would be higher on the agenda … there's been bipartisan support from legislators but the money isn't forthcoming,” they say. “It can help reduce the need to be on welfare because it allows parents to be qualified for long-term higher-paying positions. Early child care is also really great for kids because it prepares them for school.”
A 2013 study of student parents at Monroe Community College in upstate New York showed that students who used the campus child-care center were nearly three times as likely to graduate or go on to strive for a bachelor's degree than those who did not take advantage of the service.
Samantha Pezzolanti, a 26-year-old mom pursuing a B.S. in professional and technical writing at City Tech-CUNY, found that even when programs are available, they often aren't realistic for student parents' schedules.
“If you have to take classes at night because you work in the day, the child-care center is usually closed,” they say. “And if you need the care while you're working, it's not possible because you have to be on campus while your kid is at the center.”
“If affordable, quality child care were more readily available to families at all income levels, as it is in most other high-income countries, we would be able to support college students as well as working families in general, and we'd be able to move away from the vilification of low-income families who need to help that we've seen recent decades,” Gault from IWPR says.
A couple months ago, I didn't have the budget to hire a sitter, so I decided to bring Amora to class. I was anxious because I didn't know if she'd be a distraction. She, on the other hand, was excited because I told them they could play games on my iPad. As fellow students were rushing to class, outside of the classroom I ran into a professor I had last year.
“I can take them to the park and bring them back by 7,” they told me. Amora's eyes lit up. “I have a daughter, too. She's older now. But, yeah, let's go to the park.”
I handed them the quesadilla and rice I'd packed for them as my eyes welled up with tears of gratitude.
But why was the onus on my compassionate educator? Single moms aren't welfare queens. Many are busting their butts to succeed despite the infrastructure and lack of support working against them.

Engineers at the University of Illinois have taken a step forward in developing a saltwater desalination process that is potentially cheaper than reverse osmosis and borrows from battery technology. In their study, the researchers are focusing on new materials that could make desalination of brackish waters economically desirable and energy efficient.
The need for practical desalinization technology is rising in the context of global climate change. Coastal regions, where the rise of seawater could encroach upon and contaminate groundwater aquifers, present just one area of concern. As demand for diminishing clean water sources increases, the need for desalination of lower-salinity brackish water from inland and industrial sources will increase, the researchers said.
Illinois mechanical science and engineering professor Kyle Smith and their co-authors have published a study demonstrating the viability of this batterylike technology in the journal Electrochimica Acta.
In a previous study, Smith and their co-authors used theoretical modeling to show that technology used in sodium-ion batteries may efficiently desalinate seawater. Their theory states that by using electrodes that contain sodium and chloride ions, salt is drawn out and held in a chamber separate from the purified water.
"In our new study, we constructed and experimented with a batterylike device that uses electrodes made from a different material. That material can remove from brackish water not only sodium ions but also potassium, calcium, magnesium and others," Smith said. "This is important because salt and brackish waters do not contain just sodium chloride. It is often in a mix with other salts like potassium, calcium and manganese chloride."
The new material is a chemical analog to the compound Prussian blue -- the intense pigment used in ink for blueprints. It works by taking and holding positively charged ions like sodium within its crystal structure, Smith said.
"The competition between the rate of diffusion of the positively charged ion within the crystal structure and the volume at which the ions can be stored creates a traplike structure," Smith said. "They go in easily but can't get out."
There are other materials that can secure positive ions, but the Prussian blue analog has an additional benefit -- it is potentially very cheap to source.
"To make a technology like this be economically feasible, it needs to be cheap and, ideally, have some value-added benefit," Smith said. "By showing that our device works well with lower-salinity waters, the door for use with inland brackish waters and possibly industrial wastewater has opened."
Smith and their co-authors show that the amount of salt removal is sufficient to demonstrate their concept using brackish water. However, further research is needed to determine how the removal of salts from higher-salinity seawater and wastewater will impact that energy efficiency.

FOXBORO — Believe it or not, Patriots running back Dion Lewis' list of priorities on a given play don't begin with breaking an opponent's ankles or making someone look foolish.
Yes, those things still tend to happen when Lewis gets the ball, but their objective has been far simpler: Maintain possession.
“Just putting more emphasis on it, making that the most important thing when I have the ball in my hands, making sure I give it to the ref after every play,” Lewis said.
Lewis' cult-hero status has blown the roof off Gillette Stadium this season. Their teammates have nicknamed them “The Human Joystick” for their real-life video-game moves on the gridiron, and they have become one of the team's feel-good stories along the way.
But for Lewis to capture this level of success, they had to shake the pair of fumbles that were a slight concern in the first two weeks of the season. They haven't put the ball on the ground since.
“We do ball-security drills every day,” Lewis said. “When it's time for that, my antennas go up, and I make sure I'm doing all the things I'm supposed to do.”
That's important because, as Kevin Faulk and Stevan Ridley can attest, when a Patriot develops a penchant for fumbling, Bill Belichick orders the defense to attack them with a far greater voracity during practice. Lewis has passed those tests.
Interestingly, Lewis' playing time never diminished after their first two fumbles. They were subbed out for three plays against the Steelers because the Patriots used a goal-line package, which they aren't part of anyway, before getting the very next carry when the standard offensive grouping returned to the field for the ensuing series. And they were on the field with the offense for the next series after losing a fumble against the Bills. Heck, a week and a half later, Belichick gave them a contract extension.
Maybe Belichick would have been less forgiving if Lewis got a third strike, or if Lewis didn't prove to be such an indispensable part of the offense in the early going. But Lewis didn't want to test him, and the fumbles have ceased.
“That's the most important part of the game, ball security,” Lewis said. “When you don't turn the ball over, your chance of winning goes up tremendously. I'm trying to make sure I'm accountable when it comes to that.”
Trap . . . month?
Here's a new one. The Patriots were asked about a “trap month” yesterday, you know, just in case they were looking ahead to their Week 12 showdown against the Broncos.
“I mean, we can't worry about the Broncos and then go out and play the Redskins,” running back LeGarrette Blount said. “We've just got to go out there and focus on who we got to play this Sunday. Whenever the Broncos come up, they come up. We've got to focus on playing these guys.”
Obviously, there's a distinct danger of the hype machine blowing a gasket if Tom Brady and Peyton Manning both carry their teams into the Nov. 29 game with 10-0 records. But what do you expect the Patriots to say?
“You guys are the ones who bring up the weeks away,” Blount said. “We stay focused on the task at hand, which is the Washington Redskins this week. That's what we are taught. That's instilled in us the whole time we are here, and eventually, it's just kind of habit.”
Absent observations
Safety Duron Harmon was excused from practice due to the birth of their son. It was their first absence from practice in three years with the Patriots, including training camp, the regular season and playoffs.
Defensive end Jabaal Sheard, who hasn't practiced since injuring their ankle against the Colts in Week 6, strolled through the locker room for the first time since the injury. They aren't wearing any protection on the ankle, nor did they walk with a noticeable limp.
If you've heard one too many gripes about your boozy postings, don't fret -- there'll soon be a like-minded social app for you. It's called "Livr," and you won't even be able to log in without a smartphone breathalyzer confirming you've tippled enough. In fact, the higher your BAC, the more app features are unlocked. Those include a crowdsourced "truth or dare" game and hotspot map that shows the location and sobriety of other users. You'll even be able to drunk-dial random Livr folks, simulating the types of encounters you'd normally have at a bar (sans the possibility of getting punched). After a questionable evening, whatever happens on Livr can stay on Livr, thanks to the "Blackout" button that deletes all evidence of your misdeeds. We're not sure if this is one of the best or worst ideas in recent memory, but in any case, prepare your actual liver -- the app will arrive to Android and iOS sometime in the spring.
Update: Gizmodo's knocked the beer goggles off our faces, revealing that Livr is almost certainly a hoax. We'd apologize for the misinformation, but we're going to blame this one on the alcohol -- we told you we were drunk.
Traveling should be about being carefree and having all the right things in place so that the trip runs as smoothly as possible. There are many things you can do before and after you travel to make things easier, and I wanted to make that the focus of today's blog. Here are some of my best tips for keeping your peace of mind while travelling.
Carrying Less

It may sound counterintuitive, but carrying less is one of the best ways to make travel easier and better while keeping your sanity. The less you carry, the less you have to worry about — and the easier it is to carry around with you. Trust me when I say that lugging a huge bag full of stuff isn't a fun experience, especially on a long trip! It's also always a great idea to clean out your wallet before you go, so you only take the essentials with you, like cards and cash. Some things are better left at home because you'll just worry about them otherwise. It's an amazing feeling going to an airport with only a few cards and some cash. It even makes your travel experience nicer. read more
Tips on making golden delicious and crunchy Taiwanese Paleo Chicken Nuggets –
– Fewer steps & fewer carbs for the win: unlike traditional chicken nuggets – dipped in flour, egg, and flour again – this recipe uses only sweet potato flour/powder or arrowroot flour/powder only. No need to dip in egg or another layer of flour mix.
– Super flavorful: marinate the chicken pieces overnight in the fridge for maximum flavor but if you are short on time, 2 hrs should be okay.
– Crunchy and golden delicious: pan-fry the chicken in separate batches and try not to overcrowd the frying pan so that your chicken nuggets will be extra crunchy and gorgeous looking !
– Basil infused flavor: I infused the oil with fresh basil leaves so that the chicken nuggets will have a light and aromatic herb flavor. This, however, is an optional step. You can totally skip it. When you pan fry the basil, because the leaves contain water, they will splatter even after you pat them dry really well. So please be extra careful and use a splatter or deep frying pan cover. In my case, I pan-fried them in a large size dutch oven so it will be less messy around my stovetop.
– Bake v.s. Pan-fry: In order to make the crunchiest and gorgeous looking Paleo Chicken Nuggets, unfortunately, baked nuggets will not be as tasty and pan-fried. Part of the reason is also because these lovely chicken nuggets aren't breaded with a thick coat of coconut or almond flour. They are thin, light, and crispy little morsels so I strongly recommend that you pan-fry them in either coconut oil, avocado oil, or ghee butter.
The U.K.'s data and privacy chief has warned that the draft bill, dubbed the "snoopers' charter," could end up helping police and government agencies catch "incompetent criminals and accidental anarchists," rather than the intended serious offenders the bill is intended to help catch.
Also under scrutiny is exactly what the £1.8 billion ($2.9bn) budget set aside for implementing the bill, provided by the British taxpayer, will be spent on, something the U.K. Home Office is keen to keep under wraps.
Introduced formally during the Queen's Speech earlier this year, the Draft Communication Data Bill will force ISPs and Web providers to collect data associated with browsing, email, and landline and mobile phone calls, allowing U.K. law enforcement to determine the communication patterns between citizens.
Details pertaining to Web addresses visited, emails sent and received and to whom, along with the details of phone calls placed will be logged to help authorities build up a picture of a person's connections. While social network activity will be logged to an extent, only the domain names will be logged rather than each sub-domain or user's social networking page.
The move is to help law enforcement crack down on terrorism and national security threats, along with serious crime such as fraud and premeditated violent crime.
Serious criminals 'home free'
But the U.K. Information Commissioner, Sir Christopher Graham, warned that the determined and most serious criminals could evade capture by simply modifying their online behavior, reports the BBC News.
Graham told a committee made up of a cross-bench of members of Parliament (MPs) that only the six largest companies -- which control around 94 percent of the market -- may be affected by the bill.
They also warned that serious criminals, including terrorists, could start using smaller ISPs which allow encryption-based technologies in order to avoid detection by authorities.
As the country's data and privacy chief, they also warned that the balance between civil liberties and freedom must be balanced. They noted the law, if approved, should be kept under close, ongoing review.
However, European officials have already warned of "clashes" with European law. During the introduction of the bill, the Queen's speech read that "strict safeguards" would be put in place and the bill would be "subject to scrutiny" by Parliament, seemingly noting Europe's concern and averting a diplomatic clash.
'Secret' budget at the taxpayers' expense
While the £1.8 billion price tag for the scheme is no secret, exactly what the taxpayers' money will be used for remains unclear.
Freedom of information activist Zoe O'Connell submitted a request to the Home Office, the government department responsible for the "snoopers' charter" bill. Despite confirming it had the information, the department refused to divulge exactly what the budget would be spent on "national security" grounds (PDF).
The Home Office wrote back claiming the release of the details of the £1.8bn budget would be "likely to prejudice... the prevention or detection of crime," adding:
Information withheld includes details of how the Communications Capability Development programme intends to maintain access to communications data for the purposes of preventing and detecting crime and safeguarding national security. The information relating to UK capabilities is considered to pose an unacceptable risk to the ability of the UK to safeguard national security; the disclosure of this could be used to avoid detection.
The £1.8bn figure is the "highest cost" scenario over the next ten years -- between 2010-11 and 2020-21 -- and was approved by HM Treasury in June 2011, a month after the Queen's speech, the letter noted.
The reply added:
The business case described what needs to be done to maintain capability to access communications data before and after the introduction of new legislation. The cost estimates in the 2010/11 business case are based on assumptions about the roles of certain technologies, law enforcement and agency capabilities and the telecommunications market. The main assumptions were informed by independent research and surveys, and best practice across the telecommunications industry.
The Home Office said that one of the main reasons was that the U.K.'s data bill continues to rise year-on-year as citizens continue to consume more data; the total volume will increase ten-fold during the decade. Also, because data must be held by communication service providers (CSPs) for 12 months, this also adds costs despite the "per unit data storage costs continue to decrease by 25 percent per annum."
Crucially, the 'snooping' technology would have to be "upgraded or renewed as appropriate on a five year cycle" in line with upgrades made by the telecoms industry.
All in all, exactly what the £1.8bn budget will be spent on remains unclear. However, a revised estimate will be given "before the Communications Data Bill is introduced formally in [Parliament]." That said, "Parliament will then have the opportunity to consider again the latest costs and benefits of the programme enabled by the Bill," the letter reads.
The U.K. Parliament will still have to pass the bill before it becomes law, which could happen in the coming calendar year. The European Commission would also have to pass the bill in Brussels, but would likely only veto the bill if the law omits adequate safeguards by U.K. authorities.

Wearable tech is amazing. From Glasses and wristbands to Smartwatches and fitness trackers, the field is opening up to a wide range of play. One company is willing to take things to the next level with a gadget that quite possibly has the potential to change the game. Meet the Cicret bracelet. Its aim is to replace a smartphone. Now that is a bold statement to make, but the guys over at Cicret are not kidding around, they genuinely believe that their product could change the way we use wearable tech.
The Key feature is a built-in projector and eight sensors, which will allow a wearer to manipulate an image that is projected onto their arm. The ‘Screen' will let users read emails, surf the web, watch videos, play games and even make phone calls. The technology inside the device will consist of an accelerometer, memory card, processor, micro USB port, battery, long range sensors, pico projector, Bluetooth unit, Wi-Fi component, LED, Snap Button and SIM storage tech.
The cost is more than likely going to be in the region of £300 (€379 or $471) and it will come in either a 16GB or a 32GB model and be made available in a choice of 10 colours.
The team behind the idea say that the wearer of the Cicret bracelet will be able to check an email or watch a film, which is projected onto their forearm and control the picture by using their skin like a touchscreen device.
The designers are currently raising money on their website in order to put the gadget into production. They ‘say' it can do anything a phone or tablet can. You could, in effect, do any of the basic functions that you can do with a smartphone: read emails, surf the web, watch videos, play games and even make telephone calls without relying on a conventional screen. The device will work by using a tiny projector housed in the bracelet that will cast an image onto the skin, then eight long-range proximity sensors will detect a swipe, tap and pinch. The bracelet will also contain a USB port and accelerometer as well as support for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
A man who was on a terror watch list managed to slip through the cracks of France's surveillance system to become a police officer, according to media sources.
A follower of radical Islam who was flagged with a French state security ‘Record S' became a police officer last week unbeknownst to French security services, reports RTL.
The man was being surveilled in 2012 following concerns over their behaviour and they were immediately added to the watch list issued by the intelligence service of the Ministry of the Interior.
Unaware that they were being watched, they applied to join the army but was rejected and became interested in a career in the police. Still under surveillance by the DGSI, they were recruited as an Adjoint de Securité, a role ranked below a qualified police officer which can involve patrolling the streets, administrative duties, and dealing with the public.
Sources told RTL that after three years of surveillance, there was nothing to suggest that the unnamed recruit was engaged in terrorist activity and the DGSI removed them from the watch list. On Friday, 22 September, they officially became an officer after training at the police academy.
Last year, Turkish Islamist Mevlut Mert Altintas used their position as a police officer to get close to and assassinate Russian ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov at an art exhibit in Ankara.
In late 2015, following the Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan attacks, it was revealed by then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls that French security services had 20,000 people on the terror watch list in France. More than half of those with a ‘Record S' belong to or were linked to an Islamist movement.
France's new anti-terrorism law, which will come into effect on 1st November, is intended to ensure strict background checks will be made on anyone recruited into the police, customs, and security forces.

Virtual reality's introduction to mainstream video gaming has largely excluded the sports genre, whether for questions of licensing or the fact one can, like, play these sports in reality-reality. But 2K Sports' NBA 2K series seems poised to deliver a VR experience for PlayStation 4.
That's per a trophy list leak discovered by Exophase (via Pasta Padre). The 13 achievements don't speak to the full delivery of NBA 2K17 into virtual reality, but more of a series of minigames. Party events, three-point shooting challenges and time attack modes are all referenced within them.
Still, this would be the first licensed sports video game to make a dedicated VR offering. My theory has always been that sports and VR are a poor fit, not only because the games they represent are playable in real life, but because virtual reality makes an ordinary player's limitations more relevant — and the point of sports video games is to play like a superstar. That's probably why this is being introduced as a set of minigames first. Down the road, who knows.
KIEV, Ukraine, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- Ukraine's government broadcasting agency had a problem on its hands Wednesday: Zombies. There were dozens of them outside to protest an increasingly "zombified" public willing to put up with more Russian programming on the walking-dead network of Ukrainian TV.
The Kremlin is in the midst of a new press to spread the Russian word through "Sputnick," a global expansion of its state-run media operations.
Now the "zombies" are demanding Russian programs be jettisoned. They particularly object to Russian sitcoms that they say glorify the Russian military.
Organizers say they "deeply resent the domination of hostile Russian content" on Ukrainian television.
Ukraine's National Television and Radio Broadcasting Council responded to the protest by saying that it is working on new legislation to combat Russian propaganda. "It will have more authority to see such matters are dealt with easily and quickly," said representative Vladislav Sevryukov.
A video of the protest was uploaded to the Ukraine National News website.

Trump's inner circle has developed a genius plan for winning the war in Afghanistan:
Erik D. Prince, a founder of the private security firm Blackwater Worldwide, and Stephen A. Feinberg, a billionaire financier who owns the giant military contractor DynCorp International, have developed proposals to rely on contractors instead of American troops in Afghanistan at the behest of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, their senior adviser and son-in-law, according to people briefed on the conversations. On Saturday morning, Mr. Bannon sought out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at the Pentagon to try to get a hearing for their ideas, an American official said. Mr. Mattis listened politely but declined to include the outside strategies in a review of Afghanistan policy that they are leading along with the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.
At great personal expense and after conducting interviews with dozens of Mattis confidants, I have painstakingly reconstructed what Mattis was thinking while Bannon pitched this idea to him:
Blackwater …. DynCorp …. wait …. is they serious? …. that's fucking brilliant, Steve …. what could go wrong? …. maybe we should ask Putin for Russian troops? …. jfc …. stay steady Jim …. nod your head …. uh huh …. uh huh …. what's that? …. Prince thinks their boys can operate “cheaper and better than the military”? …. I'll bet they do …. hey, how about if we just nuke the place? …. that would be cheaper and better …. is this guy ever going to leave? …. do they think I work weekends for my health? …. I wonder how much money these guys would make if we actually did outsource the war to them? …. gotta be billions …. give 'em credit for balls, anyway …. hmmm …. what? …. “Oh yeah, great meeting with you Steve” …. “Sure, sure, anytime” …. fuck fuck fuck.
Mattis is either the world's biggest sellout or the world's biggest hero. Time will tell, but probably the latter.
MSNBC host and NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell scored an exclusive interview on Wednesday afternoon with Secretary of State John Kerry following their speech blasting Israel and, not surprisingly, they served up softballs for Kerry up to attack Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The warm feelings were clear from the onset as Mitchell gushed over how Kerry's 70-minute-plus remarks were “unusual,” representing “an important moment” even though President-elect Donald Trump had been tweeting how he's “very much disagreeing” with the Obama administration's Israel policy and December 23 United Nations (UN) vote.
Mitchell obsessed about Trump (instead of actual points of contention in the Middle East) by fretting: “How difficult is it for you to operate in this atmosphere where the President-elect is communicating directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu?”
“But also that is an impact because they had a direct impact. They called Egypt's president. As a result of their call, of Prime minister Netanyahu's call, Egypt pulled down the resolution. That is part of the reason you were then accused of orchestrating other sponsors of it,” Mitchell added when Kerry chose not to completely take them bait.

On the issue of settlements, Mitchell relayed news that, during Kerry's speech, “we got word that Israel had gone ahead with at least one new settlement approval in East Jerusalem on Palestinian — understood to be Palestinian territory.”
NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent then bemoaned: “Could you possibly be making it worse by making the speech now? Are you pushing Netanyahu into moving to the right because of their own domestic politics?”
Perhaps the worst part of the interview came later when Mitchell worried that the Obama administration's progress (or lack thereof, depending on your view) could be wiped out when Trump takes office:
MITCHELL: How much was Donald Trump's choice of an Ambassador to Israel someone who has been described as to the right of Netanyahu, who is so pro-settlement, how much is that behind your thinking in making your speeches? KERRY: None. I haven't considered it. MITCHELL: But how disappointed are you after all the work you have done?
By the waning moments of the ten-minute-plus live interview, Mitchell seemed equally if not more concerned about Kerry's legacy than Kerry himself:
MITCHELL: If — with all the work that you have put into this and with your firm passionate belief in the two-state solution which goes at least 37 years, what is the prospect for a two-state solution if the stated proposals of Donald Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other members of their coalition in particular, if those policies proceed? What is the possibility for a two-state solution?
Here are the relevant portions of the transcript from MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports on December 28:
WNCV (93.3 FM, "Coast 93.3") is a radio station licensed to serve Shalimar, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Cumulus Media and the license is held by Cumulus Licensing LLC.
Programming [ edit ]
WNCV broadcasts an adult contemporary music format to the greater Fort Walton Beach, Florida, area.[2] Notable syndicated programming on WNCV includes the John Tesh Radio Show hosted by John Tesh.
History [ edit ]
The beginning [ edit ]
This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on November 23, 1981, for a new FM station in Evergreen, Alabama, broadcasting with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power at 93.5 MHz.[3] The new station was assigned the call letters WEGN-FM by the FCC on January 31, 1983.[1]
In March 1982, Vogel Moody Corp. contracted to sell the permit for this still-under construction station to Stafford Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on .[4] WEGN-FM received its license to cover from the FCC on December 20, 1983.[5]
In December 1983, less than a week before the station would receive its broadcast license, Stafford Broadcasting, Inc., made a deal to sell WEGN-FM to Davis Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 14, 1984, and the transaction was consummated on February 29, 1984.[6]
In October 1986, Davis Broadcasting encountered financial difficulties and the station's broadcast license was involuntarily transferred to Wayne Stafford acting as receiver.[7] Within two weeks, Stafford arranged to sell the station to Wolff Broadcasting Corp. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 10, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on December 31, 1986.[8] The new owners had the station's callsign changed to WIJK-FM on May 10, 1988.[1]
Move to 93.3 [ edit ]
In May 1989, WIJK-FM received a construction permit authorizing the station to change to the current 93.3 MHz frequency, upgrade to class C2, and increase effective radiated power to 50,000 watts.[9] On October 26, 1992, the station had its call letters changed to WPGG.[1] The station received its license to cover for these changes on February 8, 1993.[10]
In January 1995, WPGG received another construction permit, this time authorizing a move to class C1 and an increase in effective radiated power to 100,000 watts.[11] The station was given its license to cover at this power on June 14, 1996.[12]
In February 1999, Wolff Broadcasting Corp. agreed to sell this station and AM sister station WIJK to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc. (R. Lee Hagan, president) for a reported combined sale price of $1.5 million.[13] The deal was approved by the FCC on April 13, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on May 10, 1999.[14]
In November 2003, Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc. (R. Lee Hagan, president) made a deal to sell this station and AM sister station WIJK to Star Broadcasting, Inc. (Ronald E. Hale, Jr., president) for a reported combined sale price of $2.75 million.[15] The deal was approved by the FCC on April 13, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on April 18, 2005.[16] This would prove short-lived as less than a month later, in May 2005, Star Broadcasting, Inc., applied to trade this station to Cumulus Media holding company Cumulus Licensing LLC in exchange for WNCV (100.3 FM, now WTKE-FM) in Niceville, Florida.[17] The deal was approved by the FCC on March 23, 2006, and the transaction was consummated on August 2, 2006.[18]
Move to Florida [ edit ]
In June 2005, the station applied for a construction permit to change its community of license to Shalimar, Florida, just over 80 miles south-southeast of Evergreen, Alabama.[19] The permit, which would also see the station downgraded to class C2 and an effective radiated power of just 50,000 watts, was granted on June 20, 2006.[19] The station applied for and received new call letters WRKN on July 18, 2006, then less than two weeks later applied for and received the current WNCV call letters on August 1, 2006.[1] The FCC accepted the station's filing for a license to cover for this new location and power on August 3, 2006, and the station has been operating from Shalimar under the construction permit since this date.[20]
Controversy [ edit ]
The station made national headlines in November 1992 when the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled in Howard v. Wolff Broadcasting Corp. that Alabama state law permits employers to fire people solely because of their gender.[21] Patricia Williams Howard sued after they were fired from their job as disc jockey and advertising salesperson at WEGN-FM, then owned by Wolff Broadcasting Corp., on January 26, 1988.[22] The station manager told Howard they were being let go at the insistence of the station owner's wife, Karen Wolff, as they "did not want any females on the air".[22][23] The unanimous ruling stated that only the Alabama Legislature could pass a law prohibiting such firings, in light of Alabama's at-will employment laws.[21][22]
OnePlus may or may not launch a second phone this year. Multiple reports have conflicted on the status of the OnePlus 5T, which was originally believed to be the follow-up to the OnePlus 5 released over the summer. Last week it appeared like the OnePlus 6 for 2018 would get all of OnePlus' attention. A new report from GizmoChina, however, suggests the upgraded model is indeed real and will be announced next month.
One reliable source revealed information to the site regarding the phone's design, specifications, and availability.
Expect OnePlus' next phone to resemble other flagships currently on the market. The OnePlus 5T should ship with a 6-inch Full HD+ (2160×1080) Optic AMOLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio. It'll have slim bezels on the top and bottom while the display flows into the sides for a waterfall-like appearance. The display's resolution is slightly raised to accommodate for the taller and narrower layout.
Here's a leaked image of the alleged OnePlus 5T:
The phone shown here might look familiar, and that's because the body already exists. The OnePlus 5T will be identical to the Oppo F5. Both OnePlus and Oppo are owned by the same parent company, BBK Electronics. To cut costs, the subsidiaries share designs and just tweak internal components and software. OnePlus already did the same for the OnePlus 5 by copying Oppo's R11.
When should you expect to see the OnePlus 5T? OnePlus is eyeing November 2017 for the launch and release, according to GizmoChina‘s source. That would align with the arrival of the OnePlus 3T in 2016.
If the company does plan on releasing a new phone before 2017 is over, the OnePlus 5T should be making its debut in just a couple weeks. OnePlus will want to get the phone out in time for the holidays when hardware sales spike. And, assuming the OnePlus 5T does launch in November, you can count on TechnoBuffalo to get our hands on it right away.
The police chief in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, where unrest left more than 50 people dead, has been sacked, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has said.
Yatsenyuk made the announcement of Pyotr Lutsyuk's dismissal on Sunday hours hours after the country's interim president declared two days of mourning.
They said an investigation into the unrest would be carried out.
In a statement announcing national mourning, interim president Oleksandr Turchynov said: "The day of May 2 was a tragic day for Ukraine. I have signed a decree for two days of mourning in Ukraine for the heroes who died in the course of the anti-terrorist operation and also for those who died in the tragic events in Odessa."
Al Jazeera's Jonah Hull, reporting from Odessa, said that a large crowd had gathered outside a police station in the city.
"It appears as though they are demanding the release of a number of people arrested on Friday. It is an extremely angry crowd.
"There is a contingent of police outside, and the crowd are chanting fascists, fascists, fascists."
At least 42 people lost their lives in Odessa on Friday after fighting between pro-Russian and pro-Ukraine armed groups climaxed in an inferno that trapped dozens as both sides hurled petrol bombs.
Nine more people, including four servicemen, died in fighting on the same day as the Ukrainian army intensified what the government calls an "anti-terrorist" operation around the rebel-held town of Slovyansk.
The Kremlin and Ukraine traded accusations over the violence, with Kiev saying the Odessa violence had been "coordinated by sabotage groups from Russia".
Moscow said it was "outraged" as the scenic port city became a new front in an escalating months-long crisis that has sparked fears of a Russian invasion.
Our correspondent in Odessa said the people there did not accept Kiev's version of events, and that the mourning period and firing of Lutsyuk would not reduce the tension in the city.
"People walking around the building that was on fire on Friday are dazed and shocked by what happened," they said. "They reject the idea of Russian involvement and place the blame on the government in Kiev."
Meanwhile, European military observers held for more than a week by pro-Russian separatists arrived in Germany a day after they were released in Slovyansk.
Observers freed
The seven observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - along with five of their Ukrainian assistants - were freed on Saturday.
They were deployed following a pact struck between Russia, Ukraine, the European Union and the US in mid-April aimed to resolve the crisis, which began with Russia's annexation of Crimea.
"We are deeply relieved that the members of the kidnapped OSCE team have landed unharmed here in Germany, in Berlin," Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's defence minister, said in Berlin.
"I would like to express my deep gratitude and my respect for the infinitely good cooperation we saw."
Nicolai Wammen, Denmark's defence minister, said they would continue to support the OSCE mission.
"It is important that they can work and conduct their important business in Ukraine and that this event will not make that more difficult in the future," they said.
The mission's prospects became clouded a week after their deployment when they were detained by armed men in Slovyansk, the crucible of unrest in eastern Ukraine.
Smile! You're on GigaPan camera
Here's your chance to be in one of the world's biggest and most detailed photos, and you don't have to crowd in with thousands of people to do it.
A team of "gigapanners" will be shooting tomorrow from atop the U.S. Steel Tower, Downtown, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., weather permitting.
They will be using a regular digital camera on a special GigaPan robotic mount that was designed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. The mount makes it possible to pan the horizon in incremental strips, horizontal and vertical. The result is thousands of explorable, multi-gigapixel pictures assembled on a computer to form an enormous 360-degree panorama.
To be in the photo, pick any spot that's visible from atop the U.S. Steel Tower -- including the right or left sides of the field in PNC Park during the Pirates game. Then, using Facebook or Twitter, let the team know where you'll be standing and at what time. You can even move around and be in multiple shots. Costumes, bright colors and signs are encouraged to help you stand out against the landscape.
For complete instructions on how to participate, go to http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org and click on Pittsburgh Gigapanorama Photo Shoot.
The image will be taken in four geographic segments on this approximate schedule: 11 a.m. to noon -- Oakland, the Hill District, South Side and points east; noon to 1 p.m. -- The Strip District, Lawrenceville and points north; 1 to 2 p.m. -- Station Square, Mount Washington, South Hills and points west; and 2 to 3 p.m. North Shore, PNC Park, and points north.
"It may not be the largest photo ever made but it will be right up there," said David Bear, who initiated the Pittsburgh Gigapanorama project at Carnegie Mellon's Studio for Creative Inquiry, with support from the Heinz Endowments and Sprout Fund. A former Post-Gazette travel editor, Mr. Bear also has been spearheading an effort to promote use of the top of the U.S. Steel Tower as a public park.
This will be the second Pittsburgh Gigapanorama. The first was taken last October, but without any attempt to populate it. The team actually printed a 23-foot-long copy last month and mounted it above the bar at the Sprout Fund Hot House party in the old Don Allen car dealership in Bloomfield, where it received a lot of attention.
Maybe too much. It was stolen 20 minutes after the event ended.
"The wait staff told us two guys who looked like crew just came in, unscrewed the mounts, rolled it up and took it," Mr. Bear said. "I think that constitutes the largest art theft in the history of Pittsburgh."
The photos are being done as experiments, they said.
"It's something that's never been done before by anybody, anywhere, so it's kind of cool."
The full size of last year's panorama was 249 feet long and 39 feet high.
"No computer screen is that big, so you can zoom in and get an incredible amount of detail. That's what makes it so special."
The team will be taking 11 different gigapans, they said, with as many as 8,000 individual images. The finished product should be online in late October for people to visit, find themselves and take a snapshot.
In addition, there will be a 4-foot-by-25-foot print of the image on display, along with other panoramas from the project, from Oct. 11 through Nov. 19 in the Photo Forum Gallery, upper lobby of the U.S. Steel Tower.

The 1670 Inks collection celebrates the life and adventures of J. Herbin, a famous French sailor.
On their travels, J. Herbin gathered formulas for inks and sealing waxes. The inks in this collection pay homage to this history.
Each bottle contains 50ml of the finest quality Herbin ink in colours only available in this collection, and include tiny flecks of gold; whilst these give another dimension to the ink and to your writing, we recommend that you don't leave this ink unused in a pen for a prolonged period of time. The gold flakes do make it an ink that deserves extra care.
When writing with Stormy Grey ink, you'll notice that the ink will go down a deep grey colour and dry to a slightly lighter grey with an intense gold sheen. The gold sheen tends to linger at the centre of your writing, taking on a grey shadow effect.
The Ocean Blue and Rouge Hematite inks seem to give a more consistent sheen of gold all through your writing, adding a little sparkle to what's usually more conservative colours.
Caroube de Chypre is a deep golden brown colour, with a green sheen when laid down very heavily, and a warm gold sparkle.
Emerald of Chivor is a beautiful blue-green ink with hints of red as well as the gold.
After another prosperous and eventful year, Heavensturn is upon us at last. A Far Eastern delegation has come to Eorzea to celebrate the advent of the year of the dog. Adventurers enthused to partake in this celebration of man's best friend are encouraged to seek them out.

I'll admit that I'm a relative newcomer to Be'lakor. “Of Breath And Bone” was my first foray into the band, and while I heard certain aspects of their sound that I very much appreciated, it didn't entice me as much as I was hoping, especially with the hype the album received upon it's release. So while I was hoping for them to build on their promising sound, I wasn't sure I could anticipate what their newest release would sound like. Well, I feel safe in saying that with the new album “Vessels”, the band have taken major strides in upping the creative ante and publishing a masterful classic for the metal masses to dig into and feast on.
For fans of the last album, they will be happy to know that the band have built on that sound and have gone to the next level. And for those wondering what this Australian band sounds like? Walking the line between an emotional melancholy and a superbly driven death metal backdrop, the five members give us a memorable concoction of melodic death with serious progressive leanings. It's a very engaging and attention-grabbing sound. Many bands have strived to meld those styles together perfectly. On paper it sounds like a perfect marriage, but while many bands have attempted this fusion and failed, Be'lakor have done this idea justice. And the atmospheric and mesmerizing qualities of their sound give the music so much warmth and ambiance. Imagine Katatonia going back to their harder roots and giving the music a good dose of prog, and you might have a decent sense of where Be'Lakor lies aurally.
Song structure and delivery are paid attention to in the eight songs presented on this album with such detail that the band must have really given their all to put this project together. Starting from the emotive mid-paced delivery in the quick opener “Luma”, we're set up for a glimpse into what lies ahead. “An Ember's Arc” follows with a beautiful acoustic layered opening which helps start the journey of weaving atmosphere and depth with a perfectly placed death sensibility that doesn't sound overdone or too dominant with regard to the overall sound. “Withering Strands” delves into very nice guitar riffs that duel with equally well-placed guitar harmonies, giving the song a real momentum and drive. Clean vocal harmonies and piano help project the sound in new directions near the end of this epic track, while closing out with a somewhat frantic drum and guitar expression. This is the longest song on the album at just over eleven minutes in length, but the time flies by. This is easily my favourite song on the album, but that's not to say there isn't more to dig into after this triumphant track. “Roots To Sever” follows as well assembled as the previous track, but more lush and low-key in certain areas of the song, providing a nice contrast in sound. Keeping the pace going with “Whelm”, “A Thread Dissolves” gives the listener a quick stop-gap on the continuing journey, and while short, the mid-paced structure and ambient sounds help uphold the interest in the product. “Grasping Light” provided something interesting for me as the drums drew me in right away as they can go from helping propel the pace of the song to offering a driven double-bass kick that switches things up. And with the album closer “The Smoke Of Many Fires”, we're given a perfect blueprint of how to end this epic album, showcasing all the great moments of “Vessels” as a whole, not to mention the seamless tempo changes that are a major component of their overall sound.
One of the most impressive elements of their sound is the fact that all the instruments and vocals are on equal footing here. They all team together to make a magical sound. Too often I find with bands like this that while there is cohesion in sound, usually one instrument (most often the guitar) is given more of a lead role. In this case, everything is placed perfectly with the main goal of having a complete song being the main selling point of the band's sound.
In conclusion, if this album doesn't grab you and envelop you at first listen, it definitely will with repeated listens as there's always new areas to discover and investigate. The band takes a great concept and runs with it, leaving us with many lasting impressions and giving us the unenviable task of wondering how they will ever top this gorgeous album with future releases.

This book is incredible. I wish there was one like it for humans, haha! At first glance, it is a little overwhelming with all the charts, and the idea that there are several components to each meal that you have to combine together each time, but 15 minutes into it, I realized that it is something I can really do and so can you! Obviously I've tailored it to be as convenient as possible for me, but honestly, I love the idea that my dog is getting all the nutrition they need and none of the junk that normal dogs in the wild don't eat. A newish pet owner, I never really did understand why there were grains and potatoes in dog food since I couldn't imagine a dog eating potatoes and grains in the wild, but since it is literally almost the only option out there for dog good, I would buy it. However, my dog developed a fungal skin condition and after googling it (google!), I came across Dr. Becker's article on dog fungal infections and how diet is really the main thing to change. And then began my homemade dog food journey. 2 weeks later I have seen some improvements, but it's not completely gone. I think it will be a slowish process, and hopefully the probiotic I added in will really make a difference. The one amazing thing I did notice the NEXT DAY after getting them off of processed dog food (and they were on Blue Grain Free!) is that their eyes were immediately brighter and clearer. I didn't really they weren't bright and clear until then. They used to have pretty regular eye gunk (gross - sorry), but in 2 weeks I have only seen it once now. Also, their fur is much softer AND their skin is actually normal skin tone now. Again I didn't realize they were pink all over and that was abnormal until I saw the normal skin tone after they got off of the processed food. Of course, I read Dr. Becker's article about dog fungal infections and they said some dog's are reacting so badly to their food that they're pink from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail, and I was like, hm, glad my dog doesn't have that. Lo and behold, they did, but I didn't realize it until after it was gone. While it may sound like I am the most unobservant pet owner ever, honestly these are very subtle changes and you would never know it till after. I have taken them to the vet regularly for check ups and my vet never mentioned these things either. In fact when I brought up the dark spots that now progressed into full blown fungal infection, the vet or vet tech (I can't remember) told me they were freckles. Helpful. Also, please don't be overwhelmed by the vitamin powder you have to make. At first I tried to find one I could buy, but since all the products that I found didn't give amounts of the vitamins, I just bit the bullet and made it myself because if I was going to go this far, might as well go all the way and make sure they are actually getting vitamins. You can find all the vitamins on Amazon, and while Dr. Becker says just throw them in a blender in the capsule form, I prefer to minimize the steps (why blend and then sift out the capsules?) and just opened the capsules and dumped out the powder. There aren't really that many capsules to break open - I think it took me less than 15 minutes. Buy a cute little mason jar and a measuring spoon and you're good to go! Honestly, this is THE best book on pet nutrition, the end.

Gord Downie was not in Ottawa for the Juno Awards Sunday evening but their music was the talk of the show.
That's because Downie took home two of the night's seven prizes: songwriter of the year for their solo Secret Path project along with group of the year for fronting the Tragically Hip.
Downie did appear over video however, thanking the crowd for embracing Secret Path and "recognizing our friends who were here before us." The album tells the story of 12-year-old Chanie Wenjack, who died after running away from a residential school in 1966.

The Hip's Rob Baker and Paul Langlois were there to accept the group of the year prize on behalf of Downie and the rest of the band. And when their speech ran long, the show's producers tried to play them off the stage with music.
"Oh, you're actually going to play me out?" said Langlois, as they kept running through their list of people to thank.
At that point, the band's hit Ahead by a Century starting playing. They fired back by taunting the producers. "Go to commercial, go ahead," Langlois said. "This is my arena, not yours."

And that's precisely what the producers did, muting their mic and cutting to a commercial break. It was by far the most spontaneous moment in what was rather a pretty predictable live show, held at Ottawa's Canadian Tire Centre.
'I left my dog in the car'
That's not to say the show wasn't entertaining. Russell Peters returned for their third stint as host, joined by Bryan Adams, who was hosting for the first time. The show started with Peters giving the rookie Adams advice: "Try not to s--- the bed."
It set the tone for Peters' jokes, familiar to anyone who has watched their stand-up specials or their past Juno hosting gigs in 2008 and 2009. Nothing and no one was off limits, with Peters ribbing Ben Mulroney, Thunder Bay, Ont. and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in attendance.
The Juno fan choice award winner has no problem being known as a nice guy, and says "there's nothing wrong with having a teenage girl fanbase" 1:24
"Oh my god, that reminds me, I left my dog in the car," they said after bringing up Sarah McLachlan, famed for their sombre SPCA ads.
Though Adams opted to mainly serve as the straight man to Peters' risque sense of humour, they too kept the crowd entertained, performing their tune You Belong to Me and closing the show as a star-studded rendition of their Summer of '69 included contributions from McLachlan, Alessia Cara, Whitehorse and Arkells frontman Max Kerman, among other nominees.
The night's remaining winners were:
Album of the year: Leonard Cohen, You Want It Darker
Leonard Cohen, You Want It Darker Juno fan choice: Shawn Mendes
Shawn Mendes Breakthrough artist of the year: Ruth B
Ruth B Country album of the year: Jess Moskaluke, Kiss Me Quiet
Jess Moskaluke, Kiss Me Quiet Pop album of the year: Alessia Cara, Know-It-All
MacLachlan was also inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame during the near-three hour ceremony. In the most odd appearance of the night, a video touting their legacy was opened by Bill Clinton, who called their music a "gift to" him.
McLachlan speaks about the progress women have made in the music industry and the work still to be done 2:09
"I have the best job in the world and I have so much to be thankful for," they said in their acceptance speech. "Music is my church ... because of music, my life has deeper meaning."
Feist pays tribute to Cohen
The bulk of the awards were handed out Saturday evening at a gala dinner where the big winner was the late Leonard Cohen.
The legendary singer-songwriter was honoured again Sunday night, with album of the year and a simple, moving tribute by Feist, who took on the Cohen tune Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye with just their guitar, their voice and two female backup singers — Daniela Gesundheit and Ariel Engle, their bandmates in the group Hydra.
The tribute was introduced by the prime minister and their wife, Sophie. They fondly recalled Cohen, who served as an honorary pallbearer at Pierre Trudeau's funeral and was a friend of the Trudeau family.
Shortly after winning the Juno award for pop album of the year, press asked Cara with which performers she'd like to collaborate 1:36
Cohen's son, Adam, said they were moved by Feist's rendition of their father's tune.
"It takes a certain amount of courage to do something as stripped down as they did," they told reporters backstage.

Leonard Cohen won six previous Junos during their lifetime and was inducted into the hall of fame in 1991.
While accepting the album of the year award, Adam Cohen was joined on stage by their own son Cassius and remembered their dad with a sense of humour.
"My father said that they saw a Juno in my future," they said. "Of course, it was his."
FORESTBURGH, N.Y. — Three assistant Scout masters from Randolph helped save a shooting instructor who suffered a near-fatal heart attack at a camp in upstate New York last weekend.
Bob Dannhardt of Randolph told NJ Advance they and fellow assistant Scout master Roger Heck were taking several older Scouts with Randolph Boy Scout Troop 50 to practice shotgun shooting at the Forestburg Scout Reservation gun range Saturday evening when the shooting instructor collapsed. The camp is run by the Boy Scout Council in Monmouth County.
The instructor — a 58-year-old man from Monmouth County — had complained of indigestion when the group arrived at the range but they didn't think anything of it initially, Dannhardt said.
"The next thing we knew we heard a thud and they were on the ground clutching their chest," Dannhardt said.
The man had a weak pulse and shallow breathing so Dannhardt and Heck told the Scouts to call 911 and get the camp ranger while the duo began performing CPR. They were later joined by assistant Scout master Chris Borinski who helped perform chest compressions.
Dannhardt said they performed chest compressions on them for the next "10 to 15 minutes" while waiting for the camp ranger to arrive and were able to resuscitate him. When the ranger arrived, they began administering oxygen to the instructor and used the defibrillator to evaluate their condition, which indicated that they didn't need to be shocked, Dannhardt said.
About five minutes later, paramedics arrived and began working on the man, who suffered two more heart attacks later that day, Dannhardt. Emergency surgery was later performed on the instructor at a regional hospital to place stents in two of their occluded arteries, Dannhardt said.
Despite the trio of heart attacks, the instructor survived and is expected to leave the hospital today, they said.
Randolph Rescue Squad Capt. Todd Houston, who trained the Scout masters, said they had no doubt that if they didn't perform CPR the instructor wouldn't have lasted until the ambulance arrived.
"If somebody hadn't performed CPR, the guy wouldn't have had a chance," Houston said.
Before last weekend, the only first aid Dannhardt had had to perform in the field was "washing off cuts and putting on Band-Aids."
"I never thought I'd have to use it," Dannhardt said of their CPR training.
Speaking of the older Scouts who called 911, Dannhardt said they had appeared scared but they handled the situation well.
The Randolph Rescue Squad has been running first aid and CPR classes for local Boy and Girl Scout troops for the past... Posted by Randolph Rescue Squad on Sunday, March 22, 2015

Antarctica's icy fringe is dissolving in warming ocean waters—and the loss of ice has ramped up dramatically in the last decade, according to a new study. By piecing together an 18-year record of ice shelf thinning from three different sets of satellite data, the researchers found that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18% of their volume in the last 2 decades. But the story in East Antarctica is still murky, they report; although the volume of its ice shelves has fluctuated significantly, they found no clear trend of volume loss during that time period.
The Antarctic ice sheet, the thick layer of ice covering much of the continent, is anchored in place by its floating fringe, shelves of ice that jut out into the surrounding ocean. The shelves act as a buttress to the “grounded” ice, helping slow the flow of the ice sheet's glaciers into the ocean. But warming ocean waters have been eating away at the underside of these ice shelves, thinning them in many places and reducing their ability to buttress the ice. This effect is particularly apparent in parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), long regarded as the more vulnerable part of the continent to climate change. Two regions of the WAIS, the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, have experienced especially dramatic losses of ice over the last couple of decades.
But even the far larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is vulnerable: Some data suggest its fringing ice shelves may be thinning, too. A 2012 study in Nature, using satellite data from the ICESat mission from 2003 to 2008, sounded the alarm, reporting that ice shelves in the EAIS were now losing volume. In particular, the study noted volume loss at the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves, which help buttress a large section of the EAIS.
However, those 5 years of data are too few to fully identify trends in volume loss in many regions of Antarctica, says Fernando Paolo, a Ph.D. student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. To get the biggest picture now available, Paolo and their colleagues stitched together satellite radar altimetry data from three consecutive and overlapping missions: the European Space Agency's (ESA's) ERS-1 and ERS-2 (which flew from 1991 to 2000 and 1995 to 2011, respectively), and ESA's ENVISAT mission, which collected data from 2002 to 2012. Together, the three missions span nearly 20 years of observations.
And that matters, Paolo says, because in some parts of Antarctica, there have been significant fluctuations in the loss or gain of ice. While some regions—such as the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas—are experiencing steady enough losses that the time period of observation might not influence the result, that's not the case in other regions, particularly those in the EAIS, they say. “That's where the long record is very important; you can start to see these fluctuations.”
Even so, the overall picture they report online today in Science is grim: The 18-year record suggests that the average loss in volume of Antarctica's ice shelves across the entire continent has accelerated significantly in the last decade. From 1994 to 2003, the overall loss of ice shelf volume across the continent was negligible: about 25 cubic kilometers per year (plus or minus 64). But from 2003 to 2012, that number jumped to 310 cubic kilometers per year (plus or minus 74). That rapid acceleration was particularly apparent in the WAIS, where volume losses increased by 70% in the last decade. In the hot spots of the Amundsen and Bellinghausen seas, the ice shelves lost 18% of their thickness in less than 20 years.
But in the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves over on the eastern half of the ice sheet, the story was far less clear, Paolo says. “We still are not able to say with confidence whether that ice shelf is thinning or thickening—the data are very noisy, very difficult to interpret.” Although their data concurred with the earlier finding that the shelves had thinned from 2003 to 2008, they say, “before and after those 5 years the conditions changed. The ice shelves gained thickness.”
“It's very important work,” says Martin Siegert, a glaciologist at Imperial College London. “These assessments of ice shelves need to be done regularly” to build up a time series of data—and ultimately to be able to separate a trend signal from the noise. But, they add, identifying an overall trend is just one side of the equation. “You have to unpick that answer a little bit. Even the time series we've got isn't enough to really understand what's going on with this system.” For example, they say, although the new study found no overall change in the rate of melting at Totten Glacier over the last couple of decades, the large variability in melting rate within those decades warrants a much closer look at the region's complex topography, among other factors, in order to anticipate how the system could actually change in the future.
To that end, Siegert is part of a team of scientists that has been examining the topography of the sea floor in the region, one piece of the puzzle. In a recent paper published in Nature Geoscience, their team identified two deep underwater cavities beneath the glacier that they note could be pathways for relatively warm ocean water to reach the underside of the glacier, enhancing its melting. But the topography is just one part of the story—coupling that with vastly improved satellite data as well as a better understanding of glacial processes and oceanographic and climate conditions is “probably what we need to do in all of these places,” Siegert says.
Paolo agrees that the new measurements are only part of the ongoing story about the future of Antarctica's ice sheet. In fact, they say, they highlight the need for additional data to track its progress. To really understand what's going on with the ice shelves and ice sheets, they say, scientists will need not only radar altimetry data but also continuous measurements of ocean properties near and under the ice shelves, and better bathymetry maps, such as Siegert's team produced. “Now we can start thinking in a different way about how [the region] could respond in future to potential perturbations.”

A new House bill unveiled this week would lift a ban on allowing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes of gun violence.
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), the bill's author, said that allowing a public health agency to study the causes of gun deaths would offer a "data-driven approach" to preventing violence.
“How many times must we bury our loved ones from senseless acts of gun violence before we pass commonsense legislation to understand the problem our society is facing?" Honda said in a statement.
The CDC's self-imposed prohibition has been in place since 1996.
In the 1990s, the National Rifle Association accused the CDC of trying to use scientific studies to promote gun control, such as one that found having a gun in the home increased the odds for injury.
Congress later threatened to cut the CDC's budget by the same amount the CDC was spending on gun violence research. Lawmakers also enacted legislative language prohibiting the use of funds to "advocate or promote gun control."
The CDC has since then shied away from pursuing the topic.
Republicans have continued to defend the ban.
"The CDC is there to look at diseases that need to be dealt with to protect public health,” former Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerEx-GOP lawmaker joins marijuana trade group Crowley, Shuster moving to K Street On unilateral executive action, Mitch McConnell was right — in 2014 MORE (R-Ohio) said earlier this year. “I'm sorry, but a gun is not a disease. Guns don't kill people — people do. And when people use weapons in a horrible way, we should condemn the actions of the individual and not blame the action on some weapon.”
But others have suggested openness to allowing gun violence research. GOP presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said last week that "more information is better."
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last month called for a select committee to investigate gun violence in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at an Oregon community college.
In a shocking incident, spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living and the World Cultural Festival controversy has said that Nobel Malala Yousafzai did not deserve the prestigious award.
The spiritual guru also said that they would never accept the Nobel Peace Prize.
"That girl (Malala) has done nothing to get the Nobel prize," said the Sri Sri.

They were quoted by the Deccan Chronicle saying, “I was in the past offered the Nobel Peace Prize, but I had rejected it as I only believe in working and not in being honoured for my work. We should always honour only to those who deserve it and I am totally against honouring Malala Yousafzai with the prize and it is of no use,” they said.
The leader was on a visit to drought-hit areas in Maharashtra. They were at Latur while speaking about the Nobel Peace Prize.

Splash Potionist
The Splash Potionist makes use of contact-based concoctions stored in a fragile glass vial. These make for excellent ranged potions and poisons, as they can be thrown, shattering upon impact and spattering those nearby with the creation stored within.
Splash Potions and Poisons
Splash Potionists specialize in ranged potions and poisons. These concoctions are thrown like bombs, however have the effect of a poison, or half that of a potion, to all those within the effect radius.
Splash Poisons are affected by any Discoveries that affect poisons, and Splash Potions are affected by any Discoveries that affect potions. Both are affected by any Discoveries that affect any element of bombs other than damage.
When throwing a Splash Potion or Poison, you must select a spot or target within range, 30 feet. When throwing at an empty spot, you must make a ranged attack against an AC of 10, when throwing at another target, you must make a ranged attack against the target's AC. Upon failure, the DM rolls 1d8, and moves the splash location by 5ft in a direction indicated by the roll.
Against Splash Poisons, all affected targets must make a Constitution Saving Throw against your Alchemist DC, succeeding this save negates all damage.
Splash Focus
At 2nd level, a splash potionist's splash potions and poisons use d6s instead of d4s as concoction dice.
In order to truly master this craft, Splash Potionists forfeit their knowledge of bombs and consumable potions.
Resilient Skin
At 2nd level, excessive tinkering with contact-based poisons have hardened your skin, you have resistance to all damage dealt by your own splash poisons.
Splash Potionist Discoveries
A Splash Potionist gains the following discoveries at certain levels. Some of these are unique to the Splash Potionist, while others are available to other studies.
Elemental Concoctions
At 2nd level, your experiments have delved into techniques that alter the makeup of your concoctions, creating poisons that can freeze, burn or corrode anything it comes into contact with.
You've also found that, through the same techniques, your potions can be modified to grant resistance to these effects.
This Discovery has the same effect as the general Discovery of the same name, but with Acid damage in place of Lightning damage.
Holy Hand Grenade
At 6th level, through a briliant stroke of genius, you have created a splash potion filled with holy water.
This Holy Hand Grenade can be thrown like other splash poisons, however it only affects undead, dealing radiant damage equal to your Concoction Dice.
For the purposes of Discoveries and other traits, the Holy Hand Grenade is considered a poison, however it's damage is not affected by poison Discoveries.
Shatterglass Vials
At 6th level, you create your poison vials from Shatterglass. These vials send out glass shrapnel shards upon breaking.

Patna: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday slammed BJP saying the united secular forces in the state had "unmasked" its game plan of creating a situation for imposing President's Rule by propping up Jitan Ram Manjhi against him.
"Today they stand unmasked after their game plan has been foiled by a strong unity among secular forces of JD(U), RJD, Congress and CPI," Kumar said while answering nearly four-hour debate on their confidence motion in state Assembly.
Kumar, who was sworn-in as Chief Minister of Bihar for the fourth time on 22 February last, passed floor test comfortably.
While a total of 140 votes were cast in favour of the confidence motion none was against it. BJP with 87 members had staged a walk out in the House before the motion was put to vote. The trust vote was first approved by voice vote and later on insistence of the treasury bench by lobby division.
Kumar said Delhi election had heralded the "downhill electoral journey" of BJP which would gain momentum from Bihar where poll was due later this year.
Kumar attacked BJP for propping up outgoing Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi against them and tore into saffron party claim on welfare of mahadalits.
"If you are sincerely in favour of mahadalit than why don't you change your slogan from' Jai Sri Ram' to 'Jai Jitan Ram'," they said mockingly.
Kumar also defended theirs joining hands with RJD of Lalu Prasad and instead questioned BJP tie up with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir.
"Are you feeling happy today when terrorists are being freed by your partner PDP?" Kumar taunted BJP members.
They alleged that by giving a goodbye to its stand on Article 370, "BJP caused ideological death of Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee who had given the slogan one flag one constitution."
Kumar hit out at BJP for "interfering" in the affairs of JD(U) by extending support to former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi.
"Changing CM is a priority of a party, but what for you (BJP) were meddling in our affairs to gain politically?" they questioned BJP.
"Though the mandate was for Keshubhai Patel in Gujarat, but Narendra Modi was made CM in their place by BJP in 2002. Likewise in Madhya Pradesh the vote was won in the name of Uma Bharti but first Babu Lal Gaur and later Shivraj Singh Chauhan were made CM there," Kumar said to justify JD(U) deciding to bring them in place of Manjhi midway.
"I know you (BJP) are readying audio tapes of my comments on RJD chief Lalu Prasad when we were separate and their views on me at that time to play during Bihar poll later this year. We are also preparing to play comments on your new found friend (LJP) whose leader Ram Vilas Paswan had proudly told Pakistan President that they are the leader who broke away from NDA on 2002 Gujarat riot," they said.
"We share the same background and has parted ways due to difference on question of certain issues in Bihar. Now seeing the present situation when secularism has been under threat we have joined hands to defeat BJP," Kumar said.
The Bihar CM alleged that BJP had been playing foul with old associates like Shiv Sena and Shrimoni Akali Dal (SAD).
Earlier, leader of Opposition in Assembly Nand Kishore Yadav attacked Nitish Kumar for putting "sushasan" (good governance) which was invented during NDA rule to satiate their ego and in the lust to become Prime Minister.
They said Kumar claim of good governance was "self contradictory" as they have joined hands with RJD and Congress.
Yadav refuted any efforts by their party to facilitate ground for imposition of President rule in Bihar and said after six months the party would come to power in the state.
RJD Legislature party leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui launched a scathing attack at BJP while supporting trust vote in favour of Nitish Kumar government.
Their Congress counterpart Sadanand Singh echoed similar views. Lone CPI member Awdesh Roy also supported confidence motion of Kumar.

With support from Mayor Garcetti and Councilman Mitch O'Farrell (who replaced Garcetti in the Hollywood council district), there wasn't much doubt about the vote - despite protests from neighborhood groups. The vote was 13-0. All told, the NY developers will be able to build more than 1 million square feet of apartment, office, hotel and retail space on land surrounding the iconic Capitol Records building. It's a big win for those pushing a denser, more vertical L.A.; it's a big loss for homeowner groups concerned about increased congestion.
*From KPCC:
Opponents of the project wanted to delay the vote, asserting that the towers will be built on an active fault line. Council members said more geo-technical studies would be required before any final building permits for the project are issued. The issue had re-surfaced behind an attorney, Robert P. Silverstein, who accused developers Millennium Partners of misrepresenting the project's proximity to an active fault. Millennium co-founder Philip Arons released a statement accusing Silverstein of "bluster", but just this week USC earthquake expert James Dolan approached the city's Department of Building and Safety with their own concerns about the project's proximity to a fault line, leading the department to request a new round of seismic tests from the developers. In addition, the California Geological Survey issued its own investigation into the Hollywood fault and surrounding "splay faults" that may be active, an investigation that may not be finished until the end of the year.
ROME (Reuters) - The global market is “full of oil” and rising crude prices are being artificially driven by forces trying to further their geopolitical aims, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday.
“While the growth of consumption is lower than that of production and the market is full of oil, prices continue to rise and this situation is completely manipulated,” Ahmadinejad said in their address to a U.N. food summit in Rome.
Without naming countries, the Iranian leader said “hidden and unhidden hands are at work to control the prices mendaciously to pursue their political and economic aims.”
They said the goal of “powerful and international capitalists” was to keep the price of oil and energy “artificially high” in part to justify new explorations in the North Pole and the deep seas.
In an apparent reference to the United States, they said the international community should have a mechanism to force “the bullying powers to resort to peace and amity instead of occupation and warmongering....”

Police identified a man found dead in their St. Cloud home Monday as 66-year-old Jeffrey Eugene Schilling.
Schilling's daughter, 38-year-old Lisa May Kearney, was arrested Tuesday in Louisville, Kentucky, in connection with their death. They have been charged with second-degree murder.
Property tax records show Schilling owned the house, 335-21st Ave. N, since at least 2010.

Police responded to a welfare check around 3 p.m. Monday and found Schilling dead in their home. They began searching for Kearney, whom they originally described as "missing."
Kearney had been found guilty of DWI and disorderly conduct in Stearns County in 2005.
According to the criminal complaint against Kearney, a neighbor called police because they saw Schilling lying on a couch with a blanket over their head, not moving. Police responded and saw blood pooling near Schilling's head, with blood splatter on the wall and ceiling near their body. A maul was propped against a wall nearby, according to the complaint.
Kearney was a co-resident at their father's house. According to the complaint, police established they had a "strained" relationship with Schilling. Schilling's tablet, wallet, keys and vehicle were missing, according to authorities. Kearney was not there. The neighbor told police they had last talked to Schilling, and last seen their vehicle, on Jan. 1.
The vehicle was found Tuesday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Kearney was found in Louisville on Tuesday in possession of Schilling's wallet, keys and tablet, according to the complaint. They were arrested.
Kearney is currently being held in the Jefferson County Jail in Louisville, Kentucky.
Neighbors described Schilling as their "best buddy." Tom Becker said they saw Schilling almost daily, and that on nice evenings, a group of men living on the block would hang out by a fire pit in Schilling's back yard.
Greg Peterson, another neighbor, said Schilling had been a hydraulics mechanic in the Air Force for around 25 years, and then had worked at the post office in St. Cloud for about 10 years.
Before they moved to Minnesota about a decade ago, Schilling had lived in Fairbanks, Alaska, where two of their two sons still live, according to Peterson. Both Becker and Peterson said they occasionally saw Kearney around but did not know them well. Becker said Schilling was a great family man who "would do anything for their kids."
"He didn't deserve this," Becker said. "It's going to be a huge hole in the neighborhood. In the spring we'll be hanging out back here and we'll say, 'Where's Jeff?'"

After removing Planned Parenthood, Texas made efforts to recruit new providers to the Women's Health Program, later renamed Healthy Texas Women.
Despite the addition of dozens of health centers, the number of women receiving care declined from more than 115,000 in 2011 to just over 70,000 in 2016, according to the report. Texas women have also seen a reduction in access to contraception and increased rates of births financed by Medicaid, the report states.
Texas has become ground zero in the national battle over public funding for Planned Parenthood, a group social conservatives have targeted because some clinics in its network perform abortions. During the last decade, lawmakers have passed bill after bill aimed at cutting funds to the group. Lawmakers are considering bills that would further defund the health care provider.
One of those measures, Senate Bill 4 by Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, would prohibit local governments from sending tax dollars to abortion providers or their affiliates.
Federal and state laws already ban taxpayer money from being used to pay for abortions. Planned Parenthood receives some public funds to provide services such as cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.
Les Waters will never forget their reaction after they ate a hamburger at a restaurant in January 2015.
"It's like your throat swells up, you can't breathe, your blood pressure drops, and you black out," said the 63-year-old man from Harcourt, a small community in eastern Ontario.
Waters, an avid hunter and meat lover, learned they had developed a rare allergy to everything made from beef, pork and lamb.
A bite from a tiny tick, recently spotted in Canada, is to blame.
The culprit, the lone star tick, is named for the white dot or lone star on the back of the female. Native to the southeastern United States, it has slowly migrated north, hitching a ride on birds, deer, and domestic animals.
Waters is not sure where the tick found him, but they suspect it might have been on a hunting trip in northern Quebec. The lone star tick has been found in neighbouring New Brunswick.
"The two we have which were contributed to us by people in New Brunswick, one fed from a human and one fed from a dog," said Prof. Vett Lloyd, a biologist at Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B.
Dr. Lloyd says the lone star tick, unlike other ticks, is aggressive. "It is one of the few that will actually chase their prey. Once they know that you're there, they will trundle towards you," they said.

How these ticks cause the allergy that affects Waters, which was first identified in the 1990s, is complicated.
When the tick bites a person, it spits alpha gal into the blood.
That's a compound present in beef, pork and lamb, and humans usually digest it harmlessly. But when it appears elsewhere in a person's body, for example in the bloodstream, it causes a strong reaction.
The body develops antibodies to fight back, and the battle causes symptoms that range from a general rash to a severe anaphylactic reaction. There is no treatment yet.
It took almost two years for Waters to get a diagnosis from an allergist, and much of the work was through their internet sleuthing.
Part of the problem is that the effects of this allergy, unlike food allergies, don't appear immediately. "It comes hours after I eat something. They [the doctors] had no clue, basically. Now they know about it. Not all of them, but they're getting better at it," they said.
'A novel allergy'
Dr. Gordon Sussman, an allergist in Toronto, says, "It's a novel allergy that sort of changes our concept because you can see reactions occurring several hours later. It's going to change the way we investigate allergies."
Lloyd says that while sightings of the lone star tick are rare in Canada, that might soon change.
"There's going to be more of them simply with climate change, with the environment warming. Ticks that were comfortable in the south are going to be more comfortable in the north," they said.
The Public Health Agency of Canada is aware that the lone star tick is expanding its range and is identifying Canadian locations that may soon fall within it.
A boring diet
As for Waters, who loves to hunt, there's an irony in developing this allergy. "I have all sorts of wild game in my freezer and I just have to give it away now. I'm just going to have to give this up," they say.
They carry an EpiPen now and avoids red meat, although the temptation is always there.
Waters calls the allergy "an annoyance."
Still for the diehard carnivore, it's a tough transition. "The taste of a good burger, a nice moose steak or some venison loin chops. You get very bored with the fish or the chicken over and over," they said.
Warriors: It's impossible to compete with Golden State
It's hard to even build a starting All-Star team to match up with them. Mine would be Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Even with those five, I'm not confident. . . . No one has solved their small-ball look: too much versatility on the defensive end, five playmakers on offense. Most teams can't get away with five playmakers because one or two won't be able to guard well enough. The Warriors still don't have a weak link. . . . Klay Thompson was not bad during the playoffs; they were playing elite defense against great players. What they do for Steph Curry is priceless. They take the best perimeter player, whether it's a point guard or a two guard. Plus, even if he's not making shots he's a threat. It's not like you can leave him. . . . Nick Young has been a volume shooter their whole career. They won't get those touches, even in the second group. How do they react if they take them out or cut their role? . . . Kevin Durant bought into the off-ball movement that we hadn't seen in OKC. By the end of the season it looked beautiful. You could tell they were energized by not needing to create every single shot. Their defensive intensity and focus were better, and their activity on offense was way better. . . . Draymond Green was my Defensive Player of the Year. They take on guards and bigs—that sets them apart. They get slap steals all the time. . . . The bench guy who excites me the most is Patrick McCaw. Their growth will be important after they lost Ian Clark. They can slash, shoot, score with consistency from the wing.
Lakers: The worst is over
The worst is over. Lonzo Ball gives them real momentum, and they've got legitimately intriguing young guys. . . . They'll have one of the worst defenses in the league again. They'll just try to outscore you and make it a track meet. . . . Ball is my favorite for Rookie of the Year. I don't think he'll be better than a hot-and-cold shooter, but I'd rather have Ball than Ben Simmons or Markelle Fultz to start a franchise. Ball has that old-school feel. They do more for their team than other young prospects, and they fit cleanly into lineups. It's not crazy to say they could finish in the top five in assists. . . . I like the Kentavious Caldwell-Pope signing for two reasons: Ball's passing and tempo should help them slide into a more comfortable offensive role, and Caldwell-Pope's defense should really help cover for Ball. . . . Brandon Ingram is a great breakout candidate because all eyes are going to be on Ball. Luke Walton made Ingram earn their starting spot last year; they earned it, and he's ready for more. Their confidence is growing and he's got a deep package of moves. We might still be one year away from them being a show-stopper. . . . This is a gigantic year for Julius Randle. I'm still not convinced he's going to get it. He's not a good team defender. They can't shoot. They don't play above interior defenders. I don't think they can grow out of some of those limitations. All of Randle's best plays come in the open court. When the game slows down in the playoffs, what do they do for you?. . . . Kyle Kuzma looked like a steal in Summer League. Their shooting and energy were exciting.
Clippers: No team will look more different
They will look more different this year compared to last year than any team in the league. . . . For years their biggest problems have been small forward and depth. They solved those by adding Danilo Gallinari and improving their bench, but losing Chris Paul creates an even bigger problem. . . . Patrick Beverley's life is about to change. It's a big drop from playing with James Harden to playing with Austin Rivers. They will be exposed offensively. He's better as a spot-up guy, but it's hard to do that playing off Rivers. . . . Blake Griffin has been slipping athletically. They just committed to a [five-year, $173 million] contract that says, “We need you to be better than you've ever been before.” I'm not sure they can do that. It's going to be a lot harder with defenses keying on him. . . . DeAndre Jordan will miss Paul more than anybody. He's depended on them for their offense for most of their career. They definitely should look at trading Jordan before the deadline. . . . Milos Teodosic is a magician with the ball and a matador on defense. Late in games, I could see them going to offense/defense substitutions with their point guards, swapping them and Beverley in and out. . . . If Gallinari has to play most of their minutes at small forward, he'll find it harder to exploit matchups. But they'll have a hard time going smaller with Griffin at center and Gallinari at power forward because both guys will struggle defensively. . . . Lou Williams needs to have a huge year for them. He's going to have a major, major responsibility as a scorer.
Kings: Sacramento is free of Boogie
I love that they enter this season fresh without DeMarcus Cousins's trade and free agency talk hanging over them. They can play free and happy. Cousins is talented but it wasn't worth turning over their franchise's direction to him. . . . I understand people who question how good they can be if George Hill is their best player. But he's a good two-way player and a leader, which they needed. I like that they can run the point and they can play alongside their rookie, De'Aaron Fox. . . . Fox has All-Star potential long-term, and I don't see anyone else on this roster who you can say that about. Their speed gets compared with John Wall's, but that's unfair for any rookie point guard. With their size, I'm worried about how long they can stay on the court. They need to build out a jumper and prove they can run an offense. . . . Buddy Hield will be better this year because they can settle into a role. Their offense is going to come from lots of different sources rather than just leaning on him. . . . Justin Jackson had a good Summer League; he's always up to stuff. I don't see a huge ceiling for him, but they can be a solid, steady pro for 12 years. . . . Bogdan Bogdanovic is a great shooter. He's ready to hit the ground running. He's a really good catch-and-shoot player. If they get a clean look, you think it's going in. . . . Willie Cauley-Stein isn't as experienced as Kosta Koufos, but he's the guy you want to groom as the center of the future. Their offensive game is very limited but he's active, and they get up above the rim to challenge shots. You want their motor in the middle of your defense.
Suns: What is their direction?
I don't see a direction for them. They added a lottery pick in Josh Jackson, but that was their entire summer. It's like they want to be forgotten. They're just praying that Devin Booker becomes a top five shooting guard. This is a pretty hopeless situation. . . . It's hard to put together one single five-man lineup that gets you excited, mostly because their frontcourt is so thin. They can't stop anyone. . . . Among the young prospects at their position, I think Booker is the best all-around scorer. They can score out of pick-and-rolls and isolations. They can catch-and-shoot. They have all those levels and layers. . . . How many guys really complement Booker and can be part of the core? Jackson, I guess, but not really anyone else. Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss are both question marks after shaky rookie years. I'm not even a big Jackson fan. Their defense, size and athleticism will help, but their shooting motion is a mess. . . . We've reached the point where you have to conclude that Eric Bledsoe can't be the main guy for a winning team. He's probably their best trade piece, but Brandon Knight falling off a cliff and getting injured again killed their ability to move Bledsoe. . . . Chriss and Bender both look disinterested at times. They're too young to be checking out. Bender will have to play center; defending on the perimeter is a huge challenge for him. Chriss has a better body and physical tools, but I'd bet both are busts. Chriss has to improve their basketball IQ and awareness to have any shot. An unstructured environment like Phoenix was the worst place for him.

We know that the Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone captures impressive night photos. The optically stabilized camera with BSI sensor sheds light on some of the darkest scenes. But how does it compare with a stand alone digital camera? Windows Phone Central Reader, Keng Chang, took the issue to task and compared their Canon 1DX DSLR to the Lumia 920. The results aren't all that surprising but does speak highly of the Lumia 920's low light performance.
Keng's set up was to mount the DSLR on a tripod and take a series of photos at various ISO levels with both the DSLR and Lumia 920. While the DSLR was supported by a tripod, the 920 images were taken handheld, using the tripod as support. First the Canon 1DX image.
And now the Lumia 920 image.
Taking a look at the settings for the brightest of shots, the Canon 1DX image was shot at f2.8 with a shutter speed of two seconds at ISO 800. The Lumia 920 on the other hand was shot at f2.0 at a shutter speed of one second at ISO 800. The one second difference represents the one-stop difference in the aperture settings of the two lenses. While the 1DX clearly sheds more light on the subject the 920 doesn't do a bad job of things. Keep in mind that the Canon 1DX has a full-frame sensor that is vastly larger than the 1/3" sensor of the Lumia 920. Here's the full comparison captured by Keng using both Night and Auto Modes on the Lumia 920.
West Ham United Edit
Early years and club debut Edit
Tomkins playing for West Ham United in 2010
Aged seven, Tomkins was spotted while playing for their local Sunday League side and signed in to West Ham United's youth academy. Initially a striker, they eventually switched to their current position in central defence. They signed scholarship forms in 2005. Prior to making their first-team debut, their career had been marred by several injuries.
Tomkins made their Premier League debut on 22 March 2008 in a 1–1 draw away to Everton.[4] Although their costly slip allowed Yakubu to score the opening goal,[5] They made five more starts and a substitute appearance. As first choice centre backs James Collins, Danny Gabbidon and Matthew Upson were all out injured during various times in the season, they enjoyed an extended run in the first team for the remainder of the season, winning the Young Hammer of the Year for 2007–08.
2008–09 season Edit
On 27 November, Tomkins signed for Derby County on a five-week loan spell.[6] They made their debut for Derby in their 3–0 away defeat to Burnley on 29 November 2008.[7] They played 8 times in all competitions for Derby County during their loan spell, before being recalled to West Ham on 31 December 2008 by manager Gianfranco Zola.[8] After their stint with Derby, they started to feature regularly with the Hammers first-team. On 21 March 2009, they started and played the full 90 minutes alongside Jonathan Spector in a 1–1 draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Initially desputising for the injured Collins, they managed to stake their claim ahead of the Welsh international, and on 4 April 2009, scored their first senior goal, a header from Mark Noble's corner, in a 2–0 win over Sunderland.[9][10] The same month, they and several fellow youth products were awarded long-term contract extensions.
2009–10 season Edit
After the departure of James Collins and with Danny Gabbidon injured, Tomkins retained their place in the starting eleven at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, losing it to new signing Manuel da Costa for several games. They regained their place, starting alongside captain Matthew Upson.[11] They were named Man of the Match by Sky Sports as they and Upson helped keep the Hammers' first clean sheet of the year in the away draw against Aston Villa on 17 January 2010.[12]
2010–11 season Edit
Tomkins made 28 appearances in all competitions in the 2010–11 season scoring once against Manchester City at Upton Park. On 1 January 2011, they made their 50th first-team appearance for West Ham in a 2–0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.[13]
2011–12 season Edit
It was the 2011–12 season that Tomkins found their feet in the West Ham United first team, forging a partnership at the back with New Zealands Winston Reid. They scored the first goal in the 4–0 win against Watford at Vicarage Road and also received WHUFC player of the month for August, the opening month of the season. During the 2011–12 season, they were linked with a £4 million move to both Queens Park Rangers and Newcastle United of the Premier League, but the speculation soon ended about their future when they signed a new four-and-a-half-year deal at West Ham on 21 January running until summer 2016.[14] After signing they also proved their commitment and love for the club by saying "I'm a local boy and have come through the ranks at the club and loyalty is a far bigger currency to me than money".[15] For their outstanding performance in the 2011–12 Championship season they were voted by their fellow professionals into the PFA Championship Team of the Year, along with fellow Hammer Mark Noble.[16] They were also voted runner-up Hammer of the Year by West Ham fans, losing out to Mark Noble.[17][18]
2014–15 season Edit
In 2015, Tomkins signed a new, long-term contract which would keep them with West Ham until 2020.[19] Shortly after they dislocated their shoulder in training, an injury which was expected to keep them from playing for several weeks.[20] In March, they received surgery for the same injury.[21] They played 25 games in all competitions for West Ham including three FA Cup games.[22] They scored a single goal, in a 2–1 away win against West Bromwich Albion on 2 December 2014.[23] Their shoulder injury kept them out of the side from March 2015, finally returning for the last game of the season, replacing Reece Burke in the 69th minute, a 2–0 away defeat to Newcastle United.[24]
2015–16 season Edit
Tomkins opened the 2015–16 season by scoring the third goal in a UEFA Europa League game on 2 July 2015. West Ham won the game against Andorran team Lusitanos 3–0 with them as captain and with the other goals coming from Diafra Sakho.[25] On 16 July 2015, they scored another UEFA Europa League goal in the 1–0 win over Bikirkara in the 90th minute.[26] In the second-leg, in Malta, on 23 July 2015, they were sent-off after pushing Birkirkara's Nikola Vukanac as West Ham went through to the next round, 5–3 on penalties.[27]
Crystal Palace Edit

Shoppers have expressed their annoyance at receiving old £1 coins in change, a week before businesses can refuse to accept them.
From 16 October, the round £1 coin will no longer be legal tender as it is fully replaced by the 12-sided version.
Robert Dalgleish, who received three old coins from Lidl, said: "Why aren't business outlets stopping this?"
But Tesco says it will continue to accept the round pound for an additional week to help customers.
Eirlys Groves said they visited a branch of Tesco where machines gave old out coins as change, and then they were told by shop staff they could not swap them for new ones.
And Dianne Lilley said that they had been on holiday in South Devon and found that several small businesses there were still handing them out in change.
Consumer experts Which? said everyone could trade in the coins after 16 October in bank, building societies and post offices.
But it advised shoppers not to accept the old coins as change after this date and instead to ask for new ones.

Mike Cherry, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the changeover period had been "fairly short" and suggested it would be helpful if small firms were allowed a short transition period beyond the deadline to collect the old coins and bank them.
Budget retailer Poundland has said it will continue to accept the old coins until 31 October - meaning shoppers can continue to spend them while the supermarket chain takes on the job of banking them in bulk.
The Royal Mint introduced the new £1 coin on 28 March to help crack down on counterfeiting, with one in 30 of the old version estimated to be fake.
About 1.2 billion of the old coins have so far been returned, but an estimated 500 million are still in circulation.
Businesses have been updating their machines to accept the new coins, but some are still unable to take them.
Sainsbury's and Tesco said a small minority of its trolleys at their convenience and express stores were not accepting the new coin but would be able to do so shortly.
Problems have also been reported at other supermarkets.
A Tesco spokesperson said: "We've been updating our systems ready for the new pound coins, but to help customers who still have the old coins, we'll continue to accept round pounds at our tills and self-service machines for an additional week."
Transport for London said 27 of its machines at London Overground stations do not accept the new coins, but each of those stations has at least one machine that does take them.

New £1 coin's 'hidden' security feature
Image copyright PA
The new coin was described as the "most secure coin in the world", with a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including material inside which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines.
Nevertheless, it has faced some problems since its introduction.
A "small number" of coins put into circulation were found to be faulty, while some ticket and vending machines, as well as shopping trolleys, were unable to take it.
The AA reported in July that more than one in five UK councils had not converted all their parking ticket machines to accept the new coin.
Some small businesses have struggled with the process of moving to the new £1. Leonard Spillman, who owns a laundrette in Bath, said it had cost them £200 to convert their washing and drying machines.
"Could it not have been possible when designing the new coins to make them the same weight and width as the old coins so that businesses did not have to suffer?" they asked.

10 places to find your old £1 coins
The Royal Mint said some businesses waited until July to upgrade machines - once there were more new pounds in circulation than old ones.
Businesses were warned by the Treasury last year that they would need to update their machines and the Royal Mint says all "coin handling equipment should be able to accept the new £1 coin" from 16 October.
Efforts to phase out the old £1 coin have also been hampered by companies who returned the new 12-sided replacement by mistake.
Banks are encouraging customers to return their old coins as soon as possible and not to wait until after they cease to be legal tender.
The Post Office said customers could continue to deposit them into any of their usual high street bank accounts "until further notice".

Since touching down in Sydney two weeks ago, no trip to the grocery store or one of the city's myriad of amazing restaurants has been complete without an anguished cry of "how much?", or as they say in my Yorkshire homeland "How many?"
On day one it was raspberries, A$10 ($9.20, £5.90) a punnet! On day two it was French cheese, A$149 a kilo! On day three a bacon and egg sarnie, A$12. ("What an eclectic diet they have," I hear you cry.)
Sydney is pricey - the third most expensive city in the world apparently. Gatherings of expats here often quickly descend into dispirited diatribes on just how costly it is. I am sure it bores the locals stupid given they too are having to live with it day in, day out. House prices continue to soar. Cost of living (or perceived cost of living) is certainly a big issue for voters in next month's election.
And a study out this week from HSBC bank shows that foreign students are footing the bill too, with Australia now the most expensive place in the world for international students to go to university. A$42,000 is the average annual cost for fees and living expenses, more than both the United States and the United Kingdom, which ranked second and third respectively.
For starters the study says university fees for foreign student are now the highest in the world but it's the cost of living that really makes Australia a place for students with deep pockets.
Germany, remarkably, comes out more than six times cheaper for international students to study. Australia's relatively strong economy and the subsequent high Aussie dollar in recent years are big factors. Both have weakened in the last few months, easing things slightly.
In the meantime, I can recommend "A$3 Taco Tuesday" at my local boozer in Redfern for any students seeking out a rare bargain.
Rush Limbaugh: Democrats Are Nervous About Their Dud Candidate
By the latest numbers things could not be going any worse for the Hillary Clinton campaign.
They Blew Through $75m in Advertising and Went Down in the Polls
Clinton spent $257m on their campaign to Trump's $87m so far this election cycle. In June it was reported that Clinton spent $23m on ads in swing states to Trump's $0. By mid-August Clinton had spent more than $75 million on advertising in 10 swing states to Trump's $0 . Trump has since invested $5 million in swing state advertising.
Clinton's campaign ads are not working. In spite of spending millions in negative advertising against Trump in highly competitive states like Pennsylvania, Hillary is falling behind in the polls. The fact that biased media attacks and negative advertising don't seem to impact the race and only help Trump put Clinton in a quandary. These were their only tools to beat Trump in the election. Now they seemingly have nothing.
No One is Showing Up at Them Events
Hillary Clinton has only one Clinton campaign event scheduled (on Thursday in Las Vegas) in the foreseeable future. No other campaign rallies are currently scheduled! Trump on the other hand continues to materially outpace Hillary Clinton in rallies and in attendance at campaign events. Through the first three weeks of August Trump has more than doubled the number of events that Clinton has. Month to date through Sunday August 21stTrump has held 24 campaign events to Clinton's 10. They also have events scheduled daily through Thursday, August 25th. (Note that this list only includes individual campaign speaking engagements and not fundraisers or visits with government and corporate leaders which Trump appears to be outpacing Clinton as well.)
Due in part to the number of events held, Trump continues to significantly outpace the number of event goers that Clinton has month to date. Trump has accumulated more than 135,000 people at their rallies while Clinton has accumulated only a little more than 10,000. As a result Trump has 13 times more attendees at their events than does Hillary.
While Trump continues to smash Clinton in attendance at events, Clinton continues to take time off. Clinton has only held campaign rallies ten of the first 21 days in the month and as noted above they have no campaign event scheduled till Thursday. Clinton is now holding campaign events less than 50% of the time. Either the Clinton campaign does not want to show that no one is coming to their events or they are sick or both.
Them Health is Now an Issue
A couple recent events bring to light Clinton's health. A video of them having some sort of seizure was released that went viral.
Then they had a similar response at the Democratic convention. A black man spotted repeatedly by Clinton's side appears to be a doctor or medical professional. Although there is no word from the Clinton campaign regarding health issues, if they are sick then they risk getting sicker if they hold more campaign events. Also, the more time they spend in public the greater the chance of them having another episode that is recorded. This may be why they are not partaking in campaign events.
 They are Getting Destroyed on Social Media
Trump is crushing Clinton in basically every conceivable numerical measure on social media . They have double the Facebook ‘likes' (10m to 5m), a 5 to 4 ratio (11m to 8m) in Twitter followers, averages 30,000 livestream viewers on YouTube to Hillary's 500, and ‘Hillary for Prison' has more Reddit subscribers (55,000) than Hillary subscribers (24,000) while Trump has nearly 200,000 Reddit subscribers.
These numbers are simply staggering.

On Wednesday Rush Limbaugh called the liberal media's bluff.
Rush believes Democrats are very nervous about the corrupt and low energy politician they are running for president.
Via The Rush Limbaugh Show:
RUSH LIMBAUGH: My thinking on this, with Hillary basically phoning it in now — and they're making no bones about it, by the way. The Democrat Party, other than their fundraising, which they seem hell-bent on. But that's nothing really odd. That's what the Clintons do is ask people for money. That's essentially the reason they're alive is to ask people for money, and they're probably better at it than most anybody else. But aside from that, no press conferences, no campaign appearances, let the media run the campaign, essentially. And it's the old overconfidence aspect settling in. And it makes a lot of people on the Democrat side nervous. And I think privately they're a little bit more nervous than they admit simply because they saw what happened during the primaries. They saw what Trump can do. So I don't think this show that they're putting on of, “Hey, you know, it's over. This guy's a buffoon, they have no prayer. Everybody loves Hillary. She's gonna win this thing in a cakewalk.” I think that a lot of that is making others on the Democrat side a little nervous. We're not talking about Babe Ruth here calling them shot. I mean, Hillary Clinton has got their own problem with negatives. They have their own problem with people that don't like them In fact, this may be an election, one of those elections where more people vote against somebody than actually vote for somebody. It could well be.
How many players then?
A reserve does not have to be used.
In American Football (with abundant thanks to nfl.com for the clarifications), one 11-man team has possession of the football.
It is called the offense and it tries to advance the ball down the field and score points by crossing the goal line and getting into an area called the end zone.
Each team has 3 separate units: the offense, those players who are on the field when the team has possession of the ball; the defence, players who line up to stop the other team's offence; and special teams that only come in on kicking situations (punts, field goals, and kick offs).
The other side (also with 11 players) is called the defence - assuming they don't have the ball.
It tries to stop the offensive team and make it give up possession of the ball.
If the team with the ball does score or is forced to give up possession, the offensive and defensive teams switch roles (the offensive team goes on defence and the defensive team goes on offense).
What about the pass, is it the same?
No.
In general play (that is when the ball is passed back to the quarter back in American Football), they can throw the ball forward, kick it (although they rarely will, this often constitute a ‘team change'), or even pass it backward.
In rugby, passing it back is key, a forward pass will: In American Football (), one 11-man team has possession of the football.It is called the offense and it tries to advance the ball down the field and score points by crossing the goal line and getting into an area called the end zone.Each team has 3 separate units: the offense, those players who are on the field when the team has possession of the ball; the defence, players who line up to stop the other team's offence; and special teams that only come in on kicking situations (punts, field goals, and kick offs).The other side (also with 11 players) is called the defence - assuming they don't have the ball.It tries to stop the offensive team and make it give up possession of the ball.If the team with the ball does score or is forced to give up possession, the offensive and defensive teams switch roles (the offensive team goes on defence and the defensive team goes on offense).No.In general play (that is when the ball is passed back to the quarter back in American Football), they can throw the ball forward, kick it (although they rarely will, this often constitute a ‘team change'), or even pass it backward.In rugby, passing it back is key, a forward pass will:
Rugby law 12.1: The outcome of a knock-on or throw forward: (a) Unintentional knock-on or throw forward. A scrum is awarded at the place of infringement.
However in rugby the player in possession can kick it, but unlike their counterparts in the NFL, this will not constitute the subbing of a specialist punter.
Rugby is played over 80 minutes over two 40 minute halves.
In the NFL, games are divided into four 15-minute quarters, separated by a 12-minute break at halftime.
There are also 2-minute breaks at the end of the first and third quarters as teams change ends of the field after every 15 minutes of play.
Tackling in rugby looks to do to general things, bring a player to the ground or hold them and keep them off the deck.
Holding a player up can force a turnover.
If a player goes to ground in rugby, it is fair game.
If the defence follow the laws – keeping their feet, taking the ball after the carrier goes to the deck and releases the ball (ideally), then they may take possession.
In the NFL, if the defence brings the ball carrier to the ground (i.e. a player is tackled when one or both of their knees touch the ground).
The play is then over.
A play also ends when a player runs out of bounds (as it does in rugby if the ball is run into touch or kicked out).
As long as you hold onto the ball in rugby, you can do whatever (within the laws of course!) you can to move the ball up the field.
In American Football, play is measured in yards (1 yard is .9144 metres) with the field 100 yards long as opposed to a 100 metre field in rugby.
The offensive team tries to get as much "yardage" as it can to try and move closer to the opponent's end zone.
Each time the offense gets the ball, it has four downs, or chances, in which to gain 10 yards.
If the offensive team successfully moves the ball 10 or more yards, it earns a first down, and another set of four downs.
In rugby, a try is worth five points, a conversion two – and a penalty or drop goal is worth three points.
In American football, a touchdown (roughly equivalent to a try) is worth six points.
An extra point (or a rugby style conversion) can be earned, but two points can be earned if the offensive team can essentially score another touchdown.
A field goal, which a team can opt for if they cannot score a touchdown, is worth three points and can be attempted from anywhere on the field on any down, but generally are kicked from inside the defence's 45-yard line on fourth down.
For a field goal to be "good", the placekicker (or field goal kicker) must kick the ball through the goal-post uprights and over the crossbar.
Unlike a drop goal in rugby, in the NFL a specialist kicker will come onto the field.
The NFL season feature 256 games which are played out over a seventeen week schedule.
Each of the league's 32 teams play a 16-game schedule with one bye week for each side scheduled between weeks' four and twelve – with a wildcard round, a divisional round, conference championships and of course the Super Bowl rounding out the season.
The ‘Pro Bowl' is the NFL's all-star game.
Rugby has domestic and Test seasons.
Tier one sides (the likes of the All Blacks, Springboks, Wallabies and European countries such as France, Ireland and the British Isles) play what is typically a 12 to 15 Test (match) calendar year.
Please note this piece is for fan purposes and is not representative of an official partnership between New Zealand Rugby, the All Blacks and the NFL.
Is rugby NFL without pads?Um, no.Rugby has 15 players on the field, and eight reserves which form a 23-man squad.Unless certain circumstances such as major injuries, blood bins or concussions come into effect, when a starting player from the run on XV leaves, they or they will not come back.
EAST RUTHERFORD -- Police made 34 arrests Sunday at the Hot 97 Summer Jam concert, New Jersey State Police said Monday.
Some 50,000 people attended the event at MetLife Stadium, police said.
Those arrested face a range of charges, including trespassing, possession of marijuana, and assault.
Police said eight people were issued summonses for soliciting without a permit and they left the venue.
The event also had a couple points of chaos, including when the gates closed on fans.
Summer Jam 2017
After the gates had been open for three hours, they were closed after a few fans in the security line "caused a disturbance by not following entry protocol," state police said.
The gates were eventually reopened and fans could enter.
During the concert, a car reportedly caught on fire and flames spread to two other vehicles. Additionally, a woman passed out from the 90-degree heat.
Hot 97's spokesperson had no comment.
Last year, 35 people were arrested at Summer Jam while 61 people were arrested in 2015.

The mysterious authors behind the most sophisticated cyber weapon on the planet appear to be planning another strike and have updated their advanced spy program designed to search out weaknesses in target systems, according to an American cybersecurity firm.
Researchers at Symantec, the firm which helped the U.S. government analyze the infamous Stuxnet computer worm that allegedly attacked an Iranian nuclear facility for months before its discovery in 2010, said they have been sent a new version of the Duqu worm for analysis. Discovered last fall, Duqu is an espionage program designed to gather intelligence on industrial control systems, perhaps for use in a future Stuxnet-like attack, according to several international cybersecurity firms including Symantec.
READ: Could Cyber Super-Weapon Stuxnet Be Turned on the US?
Based on the similarity in code, whoever wrote Duqu, researchers say, either also wrote Stuxnet or had access to the powerful worm's source code, which was never made public. As of November of last year, the original Duqu worm was believed to have infected systems in countries from Vietnam to France, including Iran.
READ: Stuxnet Returns? Researchers Warn of Coming Cyberattack
In a blog post earlier this week, Symantec researchers wrote that they were only sent one component of the new Duqu code, but it was enough to see that the new version, apparently updated just last month, featured new "partially successful" security-evading measures. They did not say who provided the code in the first place.
"Although we do not have all of the information regarding this infection, the emergence of this new file does show that the attackers are still active," the blog post says.
The authors of both Stuxnet and Duqu have never been identified, but speculation has long swirled around the idea that Israel, perhaps with the aid of the U.S., was behind the attack on the Iranian nuclear facility. A 2010 Congressional report noted that both countries were on a short list of nations with the financial means, technical expertise and motivation to carry out the attack.
But new clues as to the authors continue to emerge. Just a day before Symantec's post, another respected cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, reported it had solved the mystery of some curious code buried inside Duqu.
In a blog post on its own site, a Kaspersky researcher wrote that experts had long been confused about a certain section of code that was apparently written in a coding language no one could identify. But after putting the question to its readers, Kaspersky's audience of computer experts was able to figure it out: the code was written in "pure C," a programming language long since discarded by most programmers in favor of newer versions.
That meant, Kaspersky said, that the authors were likely "old school" - meaning they've been expert coders likely beyond the last ten years when pure C was still the preferred language - and, by using a more basic code that can be widely read by diverse systems, they wanted to make sure the worm could infect just about everything it touched.

I've scoured the ruins of this land and found the Focus of the Old Ones. Now you can have one too!
You can order this item one of several ways, please make sure you select the right option before ordering. All options come as aluminum cold-cast, no need to paint! If you choose one of the lighted options, you will need to get your own CR2032 battery to power the lights, I'm not shipping these with batteries. The Focus measures 1.5" wide, 1.6" long and .5" thick.
Full Cast: This is just the Focus piece with no earpiece, battery holder, or LED. There is no acrylic bar in this cast for the lights and the back side of the Focus is smooth. This piece is easier to trim smaller if you wish, but it will not light up.
Lighting Cast: This is just the Focus piece with no earpiece, battery holder, or LED. It has the acrylic bar in place in the cast if you wish to make it light up with your own light source and it has the space in the back for the battery holder!
Blue Acrylic Focus: This is the complete Focus piece with the earpiece, but no electronics. The acrylic has been replaced with blue acrylic.
Finished Focus: This is the whole thing. Focus comes wired and ready to go once you install the CR2032 battery. The earpiece is installed so the focus will clip to your right ear and can be bent to fit your ear.
Again, please make sure you pick the right option from the drop down list before you order. If you accidentally select the wrong option, please let me know before the order ships out and we can get it changed. And again please note that you WILL NEED TO GET YOUR OWN CR2032 BATTERY.
One last note, the earpiece clip is not guaranteed to hold the focus to your ear. People's ears are shaped differently and it may not work well for everyone. I recommend using a small bit of spirit gum or wig tape if you intend to wear the Focus as an accessory for cosplay so it doesn't accidentally fall off while taking down a Thunderjaw or fighting to the death with Nil. That would be awkward. Just use the spirit gum to hold it to the side of your head with the clip over your ear.
EL SEGUNDO, California, 10 April 2014 – Advanced Tactics Inc. announced that it has successfully completed the first flight test of the Black Knight Transformer, a modular and roadable vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Advanced Tactics is at the forefront of large scale multicopter design, production, and testing and the successful flights of the Black Knight Transformer open the door to a number of future aircraft designs that leverage Advanced Tactics' patented and patent-pending technologies.
The patented AT Transformer technology combines the capabilities of a helicopter, such as the ability to take off and land anywhere, with the capabilities of an off-road automobile. The AT Black Knight Transformer completed driving tests in December 2013 and completed its first flight tests in March 2014. The Black Knight Transformer is the world's largest multicopter that is controlled and stabilized with propeller speed. The aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 4,400 lb.
The flight test was performed at a private location in Southern California and the aircraft was remotely piloted for safety. The stability and attitude of the aircraft was controlled entirely by the autopilot. The only commands from the remote (human) pilot were to increase or decrease power. Outrigger landing gear was attached to the aircraft to prevent it from rolling over in case of any mishaps. The aircraft completed multiple short hover flights. Although the aircraft is capable of hovering at thousands of feet above the ground, the altitude was limited to less than 10 feet above the ground for safety. The aircraft was stable, controllable, and performed as expected.
An electric quadcopter drone was used to capture aerial footage of the flights as seen.
The development of the AT Transformer concept was spurred by several things: the growing popularity and acceptance of “multicopter” aircraft, the military's need for a low-cost platform for casualty evacuation and cargo resupply missions, and our passion for developing game-changing military and civilian vehicle technology. The aircraft is designed specifically for autonomous casualty evacuation and unmanned cargo resupply missions. Its unmanned capabilities keep pilots out of harm's way during dangerous missions while a pilot-optional capability allows it to be flown like a conventional helicopter. Advanced Tactics began work on the AT Black Knight Transformer in 2010 with funding from the United States Congress. In 2012, Advanced Tactics began work on the AT Panther Transformer, a similar vehicle designed specifically for Special Operations missions. It is a low-cost vehicle that carries two passengers and their gear, is transportable in a CV-22 Osprey cargo hold, and is operable with minimal training. Advanced Tactics is also currently developing a modular, cargo carrying aircraft capable of delivering up to 3,500 lb payloads in a detachable cargo pod. The AT Transformer technology is scalable and reconfigurable.
The Black Knight and Panther Transformers both utilize the AT Transformer technology, which leverages the simplicity and robustness of a “multicopter” helicopter at a full-scale size. Like the small electric multicopters that are prevalent today, the AT Transformer uses engines with a direct drive connection to prop-rotors. The propulsion system and airframe structure are made of low cost, field-replaceable components.
Like an electric multicopter, the vehicle is stabilized and controlled by differential thrust between opposing sets of prop-rotors. This design is simple and robust, eliminating the mechanical complexity and cost of the articulated rotor system that stabilizes and controls a conventional helicopter and replacing it with a high-speed computerized feedback control system. Additionally, the configuration negates the need for a tail-rotor or engine transmission. The AT Transformer has the ability to perform controlled engine-out flight in case of a critical component failure.
The design benefits from a large interior volume compared to the overall footprint of the vehicle, which makes it an ideal candidate for unmanned cargo resupply missions as well as civil missions such as package delivery and fire-fighting. Both the Black Knight and the Panther Transformers have automotive suspensions and drive-trains similar to those used in off-road trucks. Large truck tires and shocks provide excellent terrain handling and soften the vehicles' landings. The wheels are driven by an independent engine and transaxle for speeds up to 70 mph. The engines stow along the side of the vehicle to reduce to driving width to less than 8.5 feet, also allowing it to be transported in a C-130 Hercules without disassembly.
The AT Transformer design is highly modular for rapid repair and reconfiguration. For instance, each of the propulsion subsystems can be replaced in the field by two people and the mission package can be rapidly reconfigured from casualty evacuation to cargo resupply. Additionally, the modular automobile portion of the vehicle can be removed for additional payload capacity or replaced with a boat hull or an amphibious hull for water operations.
The AT Black Knight and Panther Transformer aircraft have been developed through an iterative prototyping process starting with small scale electric prototypes in 2010 and moving to larger internal combustion powered vehicles including a 2,000 lb aircraft in 2012. A scaled electric prototype of the Panther vehicle has been tested and the full-scale internal combustion powered version is in the design phase.
Advanced Tactics has also announced that the AT Transformer sUAS is currently available for sale. This rugged VTOL vehicle combines the capabilities and technology of Advanced Tactics' larger vehicles into a small, low-cost platform that weighs less than 55 lb. Its driving and flying capabilities allow it to perform unique missions such as exploring plateaus or rooftops, jumping over extreme terrain and obstructions, and performing ground-based reconnaissance for several days in the field. It is the world's first air- and ground-mobile surveillance robot. With the optional ground drive-train removed, it can serve as a cargo delivery vehicle for heavy payloads.
The AT Transformer technologies are available worldwide and can be configured and customized to the customers' needs. Advanced Tactics is actively seeking investors as well as U.S. and foreign government and commercial opportunities. Please visit Advanced Tactics' website for more information:

"The Eddie" can go this year.
In a joint press release issued Monday, Quiksilver and the Aikau family say they have amicably resolved their differences, ensuring that the 2016-2017 Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational holding period begins Dec. 1.
Last season's epic Eddie suddenly looked like its last when, one month ago, the family announced a breakdown in talks with Quiksilver and the World Surf League, which meant although Quiksilver has the city permit for this year, it couldn't go -- not without an agreement with the family.
Officials say Quiksilver and the Aikau family worked constructively together for the past several weeks to avoid interrupting the event's 31-year track record. The World Surf League will produce the event and manage the broadcast and media.
"We are proud to see the tradition of The Eddie continue without interruption, a testament to our respect for Eddie Aikau, the Aikau family, the Hawaiian people, and the community at large. We are very grateful for the efforts and support of the Aikau family and the World Surf League under the leadership of Paul Speaker who have all worked very hard with our team over the past few weeks to come up with a solution," said Pierre Agnes, Quiksilver's CEO. "Consistent with Quiksilver and the Aikau family's wishes, we are pleased to confirm that the same stringent condition requirements we instituted when we inaugurated The Eddie 31 years ago will continue this year. We have every confidence that WSL's greater involvement in the event this year will only improve The Eddie's reputation as one of the world's premier surfing contests."
Beginning in 1985, the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational has been an invite-only big-wave event that takes place at Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu, where the late Eddie Aikau served as the North Shore's first lifeguard. Opting only to run when conditions reach the 20-foot-plus range (Hawaiian scale 40- to 50-foot faces), The Eddie has only run nine times in its history.

Aikau's surviving brothers and sister, Solomon, Clyde and Myra, say they're relieved everyone was able to come together to maintain the integrity and Hawaiian spirit of the competition.
"This is a really special day for all of us, the Aikau family, to really be smiling a lot... We're really proud to announce that yes, we're going to have an Eddie big wave event this year," said Clyde Aikau. "I think what's real important is that the sponsors finally realized that what is important to this family is larger than all the money you could offer the family, and larger than almost anything, trying to preserve what Eddie Aikau is all about, their legacy, saving lives, helping people is what this family is all about."
The family thanked Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell, Honolulu City Council Chairman Ernie Martin, and state Sen. Brickwood Galuteria for their support in finding a solution.
An opening ceremony will commence at Waimea Bay on Dec. 1 at 3 p.m. with the contest holding period extending to Feb. 28, 2017. A significant number of the world's greatest big-wave surfers will gather to show their respect for one of their heroes.
New this year, with women's surfing reaching new heights, the Aikaus announced their decision to include Kauai big wave surfer Keala Kennelly on this year's alternate list, the first female invited in the history of The Eddie.
"I still ride big waves and I'm right in the mix on who's doing the great riding, big-wave riding, and the young lady has done tremendous riding at the big wave spots all over the world," said Clyde Aikau. "She's very outstanding, a real 'Eddie would go' attitude."

Last year, our editor at Off the Bench was selling the parts of their fantasy baseball team in a tank-job that would make the Braves proud, and they could not find a taker for DJ LeMahieu. They pleaded with everyone, laid out that the second baseman was a .300 hitter and a top 100 fantasy player, but nobody bit. They were disgruntled, and accused us of malificence, ignorance, or some combination therein, but the reality is that none of us believed in DJ LeMahieu. They were a product of Coors and had put together a solid half season of fantasy relevance. They were a good player, sure; They provided value with their glove and hit plenty to stay relevant, but they didn't stick out as someone who would bring our squads closer to eternal fantasy glory (especially not as a keeper).
Fast forward one year and LeMahieu is again hitting above .300, but this time they are all the way up at .344 and leading the league. He's hitting for power, too. At age 27, DJ already has more doubles (25), triples (7), and homers (10) than they have had in any previous season. All of that adds up to a .915 OPS and a 125 OPS+ that equates to a player that is 25% above average offensively.
Is this new LeMahieu the real LeMahieu? In their previous 5 seasons and 526 games in the big leagues, they managed just 15 home runs and a .699 OPS. This year's performance appears to be fueled at least in part by the thin air of Coors Field. DJ has hit .400 and has 70% of their extra base hits at home. Coors has been DJ's home park for a few years now, so this offensive maturation cannot all be chalked up to the Mile High Stadium, and LeMahieu has actually been an above average offensive contributor on the road this season as well.
The Rockies have a lot more to figure out with LeMahieu than if their offensive performance this year is the new norm: They need to figure out what he's worth to other teams, too. The Rockies have a very solid left side of the infield, with MVP candidate Nolan Arenado manning third and Rookie of the year candidate Trevor Story at shortstop. They also have last year's third overall pick, Brendan Rodgers on the way as well. Rodgers is just 19, but hit extremely well in A-ball this year and could be ready by sometime next season. The Rockies will soon have too many infielders deserving of playing time.
LeMahieu seems the most likely to be floated in trade talks. Do other teams value them for what they are now? They have basically the same WAR as Jake Arrieta! Will the Rockies experience the same frustrations that Ari did in their failed trade talks a year ago? I'm really not sure. I simply don't know how to value this new DJ LeMahieu. I feel like other teams will feel similarly and want to wait another half season for LeMahieu's progression before making their earnest bids.
This puts us in a July, 2017 bidding war for the Rockies second baseman. Regardless of where the Rockies are in the standings, they will be likely to shop LeMahieu as Rodgers' presence will make to potential loss of their All-Star second baseman palatable. With that, there are two distinct scenarios that will dictate what the Rockies will be able to fetch.
LeMahieu Continues to Hit Exceptionally
Imagining a scenario where a Gold Glove winning second baseman with a .900+ OPS is available at the Trade Deadline is fun. DJ simply has to hit like they have this year again to solidify their place as someone who can bring a fringe playoff team over the top. He's under contract through 2018 and would presumably fetch a fortune as a savior to a team on the outside looking in at a playoff spot. The Rockies would of course be searching for pitching in return as their eternal struggle to find arms continues.
Would the White Sox be willing to trade one of their big three starters? Probably not. Would the Mets be willing to trade one of their stable of starters? Possibly, depending on where Neil Walker ends up at season's end. A LeMahieu-to-the-Dodgers trade makes a lot of sense in a situation like this. The Dodgers may even be aggressive on DJ this offseason as they look to replace Chase Utley.
Bottom line – if LeMahieu continues to hit and the Rockies make them available, teams will call. They will be an instant upgrade for a contender in need of some life and the Rockies will be in a position of power. A midsummer bidding war for an expendable piece is a midsummer's night's dream for GMs.
LeMahieu Returns to Who They Are
DJ showed signs of this outbreak a year ago, but the power numbers are new and would certainly not be as enticing without the Coors Effect. The margins in the big leagues are slim and opposing GM's would be a lot more “meh” about LeMahieu if they were walking around next summer with their 2015 stat line.
If Neil Walker fetched Jon Niese, then a “meh” DJ LeMahieu is not going to bring the Rockies the impact pitching that they want and need.
It's a simple situation really. Soon, LeMahieu will be expendable to a Rockies team that needs all of the pitching. If other teams value them as the star that their 2016 numbers seem to indicate, then the Rockies rotation will get a large upgrade. If their performance slips, with this season the outlier, the Rockies won't be getting anything more exciting than a lump of coal when they ship them out.

1 PHOTOS NORAD Santa Tracker See Gallery The origin of NORAD's Santa Tracker: A typo, a red phone, a friendly colonel It's that time again — Santa spends all year watching little boys and girls but for one night the tables are turned, thanks to NORAD Santa Tracker. Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION SHOW CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE
It's almost time for Santa to begin their journey around the world, and that means the volunteers over at NORAD are gearing up to keep tabs on St. Nick with their annual Santa Tracker.
These days the young (and the young at heart) can hop online to follow Santa's progress across the globe, but the tradition started almost 60 years ago with a typo and a phone call.
In 1955 Sears published an ad in a Colorado newspaper encouraging kids to call Santa, but accidentally printed a wrong number. That number didn't reach Sears, or the North Pole, but instead rang up a secret military hotline -- often known as a "red phone" -- manned by U.S. Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup.
Shoup's kids recently joined StoryCorps to tell their memories of the fateful call.
"Only a four star general at the Pentagon and my dad had the number," daughter Terri Van Keuren recalled."This was the '50s, this was the Cold War, and they would have been the first one to know if there was an attack on the United States," son Richard Shoup said.Initially, the colonel thought it was all a Christmas prank, but when they realized the "little voice" on the other end of the line was a kid really looking for Santa, they quickly changed their tune, daughter Pamela Farrell says."So they talked to him, 'ho ho ho'ed and asked if they had been a good boy," they explained. Shoup then asked for the little boy to put their mom on the phone who quickly explained the situation and the misprinted advertisement."Dad looked [the ad] up, and there it was, their red-phone number," they continued. "And they had children calling one after another, so they put a couple of airmen on the phones to act like Santa Claus."His children all remember the red phone's new purpose quickly became a big joke in the Colorado Springs office where their father worked. The "Christmas Eve of 1955, when dad walked in, there was a drawing of a sleigh with eight reindeer coming over the North Pole."By 1998 NORAD shifted its tracking options online, developing its Internet-version of the Santa Tracker and more recently unveiling a mobile app.All that tracking takes a lot of work even before Santa's flight begins, with workers monitoring weather reports prior to takeoff and even compiling a "threat assessment" as different flight paths for their journey are considered.Last year 1,200 volunteers answered almost 120,000 calls and the program logged more than 19 million unique visitors to its website.And while there are more than a thousand volunteers to thank, ultimately a Sears typo and Col. Shoup get most of the credit."He was an important guy, but this is the thing he's known for," Van Keuren said of their dad's Christmas legacy.Richard Shoup agreed: "It's probably the thing they were proudest of too."

Knowing this, it's time to ask whether women are being given unnecessary care, not only during pregnancy and labour, but throughout their lives.
A recently released report from the Canadian Institute of Health Information found that up to 30 per cent of all health care provided offers no value to patients.
More than 350,000 babies were born in hospitals across the country last year. And the most common in-hospital surgery is caesarean section delivery, with approximately 100,000 performed annually. So obstetricians and gynecologists provide a lot of patient care, for pregnancies and other aspects of women's health.
Birth is the most common reason Canadian women are hospitalized each year. It's also the root of unnecessary care.

More than 350,000 babies were born in hospitals across the country last year. And the most common in-hospital surgery is caesarean section delivery, with approximately 100,000 performed annually. So obstetricians and gynecologists provide a lot of patient care, for pregnancies and other aspects of women's health.
A recently released report from the Canadian Institute of Health Information found that up to 30 per cent of all health care provided offers no value to patients.
Knowing this, it's time to ask whether women are being given unnecessary care, not only during pregnancy and labour, but throughout their lives.
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) recently joined Choosing Wisely Canada, a clinician-led campaign to reduce unnecessary care, and in consultation with their membership developed an evidence-based list of recommendations: Ten Things Physicians and Patients Should Question.
The list includes unnecessary tests and procedures in labour, delivery and gynecological care that offer no value to patients and may cause harm. Unnecessary care is also costly to the Canadian health-care system.
Such guidelines would have helped Tracey and their care providers. Tracey was pregnant with their second child after a successful, healthy first pregnancy. A care provider recommended a Doppler study of the umbilical arteries. But evidence shows that Doppler studies are helpful only for high-risk pregnancies. In low-risk pregnancies, this intervention most often leads to false positives.
This is exactly what happened with Tracey. Abnormal flow in the umbilical arteries was seen on the ultrasound and so they underwent multiple ultrasounds and blood tests to ensure that the growing baby was safe.
They lived in a rural location and had to make several trips to the referral hospital for assessments. This caused them a great deal of unneeded anxiety and wasted resources.
It turned out that all was normal and Tracey had a healthy baby. The Doppler study was inappropriately applied at a cost to the patient and the health-care system. This is why the SOGC recommends Doppler studies be reserved for high-risk patients only.
Another item on the list of 10 cautions for unnecessary routine care is a routine episiotomy.
Episiotomy is when a cut is made right before a baby is delivered to try to widen the vaginal opening and reduce potential tearing. But evidence shows this pre-emptive cut can lead to increased pain, longer periods of healing and complications down the road. Sometimes, in an emergency, an episiotomy is needed, but it should not be done routinely.
Another of the 10 cautions is continuous electronic fetal monitoring. Fetal heart rate monitoring has been done to ensure babies aren't in distress during labour. But evidence now shows that sometimes during labour and delivery there are changes in the heart rate that can be misinterpreted by even the most seasoned clinician as a baby in distress.
Research has shown that increased monitoring doesn't reduce birth complications, but does increase potentially unnecessary interventions in labour and increases the rate of C-sections. Obstetricians do need to follow the well-being of the fetus in labour, but most deliveries are low-risk so listening to the heart rate intermittently is effective.
For gynecological health throughout life, there have been tremendous advances in screening for diseases such as cancer, but certain screening tests can do more harm than good. This is why the list includes not doing Pap smears to detect cervical cancer for women under the age of 21 and over age 70.
Routine cervical cancer screening for women in these age groups hasn't been shown to provide any benefit, and high false-positive rates lead to more investigations and potential harms.
Screening for ovarian cancer in low-risk women has also been shown to cause more harm than good. Studies show such screening results in a high number of false positives, causing overtreatment and complications — with no lives saved.
In medicine, as in life, more is not always better. The best medicine is based on evidence, and Choosing Wisely lists are a good reminder of how we can continue to improve the quality of care we provide to Canadian women.

The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history keeps getting worse.
The combined death toll in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria spiked to 2,296 over the weekend -- and the situation in Liberia is spiraling out of control, with the number of Ebola cases there "increasing exponentially," according to the World Health Organization.
There are dire, if unreliable, predictions that the number of total Ebola cases could reach 100,000 (the WHO has said that "the aggregate case load" of victims "could exceed 20,000"). And now, Oxford researchers are predicting that 15 more countries are at risk of Ebola exposure.
Photos documenting the terrible toll and dangers of Ebola -- of the dying and the dead, of doctors and missionary workers and others in head-to-toe protective suits -- have become ubiquitous as the West African outbreak has turned into a full-fledged epidemic and a crisis of global proportions.
Less visible internationally: The different ways officials throughout West Africa (and beyond) are warning the public about the deadly Ebola virus disease and telling people how to avoid becoming infected by it. The warnings are being conveyed through signs, billboards, flyers and even hand-painted murals.

Post Eurovision depression – it's a bitch! Eurovision was almost a month ago (*sob*), the next national final won't be until at least November (*wail*) and Junior Eurovision is still months away (*wah*). And believe us, the team at wiwibloggs are suffering from it just as much as the rest of y'all. But moping is soooo not our style. We've decided to shake off the fug and create our own contest. Readers, welcome to the second annual wiwivision – our alternative song contest.
wiwivision 2016 Trailer
In the lead-up to the real thing, everyone on the team analyses all the entries in minute detail. We scoff at song choices, we bemoan the chosen singers and tear apart staging decisions. Now it's time to turn the tables. Our correspondents have each adopted a country and selected a hypothetical entry for the song contest. In a bid to maintain some degree of reality, we're keeping the structure used by the EBU in 2016 but with some tweaks — same 42 countries, two semi finals and one grand final of 26 qualifiers. Unlike 2015, there won't be any automatic qualifiers. No delegations contribute extra towards wiwivision, so they're all going to have slummed it out in the semis. Aside from that, we're essentially reliving Eurovision 2016 but with our own personal song choices.
Entries
To make things interesting, we've banned past Eurovision and national final entrants in so far as possible. We want to go on a new musical journey and hopefully y'all will hop on for the ride. Each act must have some connection to the country they're representing, although we're allowing certain countries to borrow from their neighbours if necessary (hi San Marino). When it comes to song selection, we're a tad more flexible than the EBU. Songs must be original, but we've scrapped the three minute rule and the window within which songs must be released is 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016. Basically, we've a year's worth of great music to choose from. There's no excuse for us to mess up, but y'all should totally judge us if we do… otherwise we'll be judging you!
Voting
Just like last year, we're going to carry out the voting similar to Sweden's Melodifestivalen and, as of 2016, Eurovision. Who knew we were such trendsetters? The juries (i.e. wiwibloggs correspondents) will give their points in the same manner as at the song contest and then the public vote will be added on at the end. And this is where y'all come into the equation. There will be reader polls for both semis and the grand final. The results from these polls will account for 50% of the total vote, with the Wiwi Jury accounting for the remainder. To paraphrase Queen Loreen – you got the power!
Launch Dates
For those of you wetting yourselves with excitement, stay calm. We're launching the first semi-final tomorrow, 7 June. The second semi final will follow two days later, on Thursday 9 June. The grand final is set for Saturday 18 June. Forty-two songs will battle it out for your votes, whilst the members of wiwibloggs watch tentatively as y'all rip into our selections. Let's do this!
wiwivision 2015
Ireland won the inaugural wiwivision with Markus Feehily and “Love Is A Drug”. They only managed to finish ninth with the juries, but a massive televote saw them knock Austrlia's Dami Im and Georgia's Tamta into second and third places respectively. Belgium's Selah Sue and the United Kingdom's Olly Murs completed the top five.

There are typically two main problems when it comes to building pillow forts: structural integrity, and a lack of building materials. And both of those issues are solved with these wonderful engineered cushions called Squishy Forts, which use super-strong magnets to ensure they stay standing for longer than ten minutes.

Currently raising funds on Kickstarter, $100 will get you a basic Squishy fort set that includes ten cushions held together using rare earth neodymium magnets. But for $300, you can bump that up to the ultimate set—which comes with 25 cushions, letting you build a living room metropolis.
And when you're done playing, the real genius here is that the cushions stack together and tuck away inside a footrest so they're out of sight. But who would ever want to stop playing with these? [Squishy Forts via ThisIsWhyI'mBroke]
Tiana Fough was removed from their flight earlier this week. Them fellow American Airlines passengers start to boo at the flight crew. (Bill Byrne/ViralHog)
Tiana Fough, 27, was fresh off a vacation in Tucson with their girlfriends when they landed in Phoenix for a connecting flight back to Portland, Ore., earlier this week.
The mother of two toddlers, Fough occasionally works odd jobs here and there, but they mainly stay home to care for their kids. When they buy plane tickets, they often just opts for the cheapest ones. This time, they happened to be with American Airlines.
“I think this is my first time I've ever flown American,” Fough told The Washington Post. And then they chuckled — they certainly hadn't been granted any “beginner's luck.”
To hear the traveler tell it, the boarding of US Airways/American Airlines Flight 408 began in a manner no different from any other flight. There were lines, some crowding, some disgruntled passengers.
As they waited in the aisle to get to their seat, Fough chatted casually with another passenger in front of them Then a flight attendant started yelling.
“Stay right there,” they shouted, in Fough's account. “I asked you three times.”
Bewildered, Fough asked, “What's going on?”
“You can get off this flight,” the attendant said. “I'll kick you off of this plane right now.”
Fough recounted that while the attendant was wearing a button-up shirt with the trademark winged pin of flight crews, they had on neither a name tag nor the uniform that the other attendants were wearing.
After refusing to give Fough their name, they said, they dismissed them with a curt, “Go.”
At their seat, a bewildered Fough started sobbing. Other passengers were comforting them when the flight attendant appeared again. They started opening the overhead compartments around their seat. “Where's your bag?” they said. “You're getting off this plane. I'm going to kick you off this plane.”
What happened next was captured in a furtive video by Bill Byrne, who was seated directly behind Fough. A female attendant came to support their colleague. “Tiana? Fough? Is that your last name?” they asked. “I need to have you come off the aircraft.”
“Why are you guys so mean to me?” Fough is shown crying. “I didn't do anything.”
After they reluctantly stood up to leave, the captive crowd's indignation could be heard in the background of the video. “Are you serious?” one woman said. “That's the last time I fly American,” the man sitting beside Fough shook their head. “Shame on American!”
Almost in unison, the passengers started to boo at the flight crew.
“I've seen people who deserve that,” Byrne told WPXI-Pittsburgh. “But never have I ever seen someone actually get thrown off a plane.” They said the video quality is poor because they kept their phone close to their chest, for fear of being discovered by the flight attendant who seemed “ready to throw more people off.”
Now back home in Tillamook, Ore., after boarding another flight four hours later, Fough said they still don't understand why they were forced off the plane. The flight attendant told them that they had asked them several times to make space in the aisle for another passenger, but Fough said there were four people between them, and they hadn't heard them until they started yelling.
Several of the other passengers on Flight 408 have since reached out to express their support, including one who said many of them approached the pilot after landing to complain. This passenger told Fough that the pilot said they had called another flight attendant — one Fough claims they never came into contact with — a derogatory term.
“Now they're making up all this stuff,” Fough said. They believe they were arbitrarily chosen to get off the flight to make room for a man who took their seat almost immediately after they were asked to leave.
“It's a little coincidental that I'm being attacked verbally for no reason, and then all of a sudden another guy is getting my seat,” they said.
American Airlines wrote in an e-mail statement to The Washington Post early Thursday that the incident has been taken care of.
“We are in contact with the passenger and have apologized,” the statement reads. “We have addressed the issue with our team members to ensure we provide a consistent, quality travel experience for our customers in the future.”
Fough isn't satisfied with the concession. After Byrne's video appeared on the news, they said, a customer service representative contacted them and offered them a $250 voucher. When Fough told the employee they would never use it, they were offered the money in cash.
“That's how you're going to solve this problem?” said Fough, who is seeking legal counsel. “What about my rights?”

Reporters later saw one of the group - accompanied by two men - get into an OSCE vehicle which then drove away.
A spokesperson for Mr Ponomaryov told Reuters the Swedish national who was freed "has a mild form of diabetes and so we decided to let them go".
Germany strongly criticised the group's appearance before the media.
"The public parading of the OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is revolting and blatantly hurts the dignity of the victims," said a statement (in German) from Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Mr Steinmeier added that Russia had a duty to "influence" the separatists" so that the other members of the mission can be freed as soon as possible
The monitors who were captured are not part of the main OSCE mission in Ukraine, which Moscow agreed to.

They are from individual OSCE countries, invited to Ukraine by the Kiev government, says the BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna, where the organisation has its headquarters.
Earlier, Mr Ponomaryov said there was the possibility of exchanging the monitors for militia members held by the Kiev government.
Russia, an OSCE member, has pledged to "take all possible steps" to secure the observers' release.
Kiev has accused the militia of using the Europeans as a "human shield".
The West has blamed Moscow for fomenting a secessionist revolt in eastern Ukraine after it annexed Crimea last month. Moscow denies the claim.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine must end military operations in the east of the country as part of urgent measures to defuse the crisis.
HELENA, Mont. — To make the plains and mountains safe for the great herds of cattle that were brought to the West at the end of the 19th century, grizzly bears were routinely shot as predators by bounty hunters and ranchers.
Ever since, the bears in Yellowstone National Park, protected from hunting, have been cut off from the rest of their kind. Their closest kin prowl the mountains some 70 miles north, in and around Glacier National Park.
In a new paper, biologists say that as grizzly populations increase in both Glacier and Yellowstone, more adventurous males from both parks are journeying farther to stake out territory, winding up in places where they have not been seen in a century or more.
If they keep roaming and expanding, the two populations will likely reconnect, perhaps as soon as five or 10 years from now.
Both the pacman package manager and the makepkg tool for building packages verify files using PGP signatures. However, these two pieces of software do it using different keyrings. There seems to be a lot of confusion about this and misinformation is spreading at a rapid pace, so I'll attempt to clarify it here!
Pacman Package File Signature Verification
By default, pacman is set-up to verify every package using a PGP signature. It has its own keychain for this purpose, located at /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/ . This keychain is initialized during the Arch Linux install – a root key is created and the Arch Linux master keys are locally signed by the root key. The master keys sign all Arch Developer and Trusted User keys, creating an effective web-of-trust from your pacman root key to each of the packager keys allowing verification of package files.
If you want to allow the installation of package files from a non-official repository, you need to either disable signature verification (don't do that…), or trust the packagers signing key. To do this you first need to verify their key ID, which should be well publicized. Then you import it into the pacman keyring using “ pacman-key --recv-key <KEYID> ” and signify that you trust the key by locally signing it with your pamcan root key by running “ pacman-key --lsign <KEYID> “.
Makepkg Source File Signature Verification
When building a package, the source files are often (and should be!) signed, with a signature file available for download alongside the source file. This typically has the same name as the source file with the extension .sig or .asc . makepkg will automatically verify the signature if it is downloaded in the sources array. e.g.:
source=(http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/${pkgname}-${pkgver}.tar.xz{,.sig})
However, makepkg needs some information to verify the source signature. It will need the public PGP key of the person who signed the source file, and that key to be trusted. The difference here is that you do not trust whoever provided the source file to provide packages for your system (or at least you should not the vast majority of the time), so your user's keyring is used. To get the key use “ gpg --recv-key <KEYID> ” and trust it (once suitably verified) using “ gpg --lsign <KEYID> “.
If you provide a package to the AUR, it would be a lot of work for everyone to suitably verify a PGP key and locally sign it. To demonstrate that you have verified the key, you can add the following to the PKGBUILD:
validpgpkeys=('F37CDAB708E65EA183FD1AF625EF0A436C2A4AFF') # Carlos O'Donell
Now makepkg will trust that key, even if it is not trusted in the package builder's PGP keyring. The builder will still need to download the key, but that can be automated in their gpg.conf file.

WASHINGTON. Black Hat events are often times when new security exploits are reported and discussed. For me this year, at the Black Hat DC event which kicks off tomorrow (for the Briefings, training is on today), I see a lot of reasons to be very optimistic.
Sure there is a talk about how to hack satellites that could gravitate towards the pessimistic side, and there is a talk about new techniques for defeating SSL --
but overall the talks here this year that will in my view yield improvements in security.
Renowned database security research David Litchfield is talking about how to identify a compromised Oracle Database server. Dan Kaminsky (yes that Kaminsky) is back talking about DNS (he did save the Internet after all) and I expect their talk will yield some interesting observations about the current state of DNS security. Flash which is an often attacked but not well understood technology from a security perspective also gets some Black Hat attention in a session where researcher Rajakta Jagdale will highlight the issues and provide mitigation techniques.
From a pro-active perspective, researcher Ryan Barret is going to talk about how to use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to help mitigate all types of threats while Peter Silberman is going to turn Snort IDS (Intrusion Detection System) signatures on their ear to detect issues in host memory.
Sure there are always a few items that emerge from any Black Hat event that could be causes for concern, but with new tools and new techniques to mitigate and protect users against risk - the only true risk is ignorance.
I for one am optimistic that I'll be safer once Black Hat DC is over.

The average rent here in Brooklyn is over $3,000 a month. In New York City, where humans cannot afford to live, the average apartment sells for more than $1.4 million. You fool. You could have a Braveheart castle for that price!
The Wall Street Journal reports that there has never been a better time to buy a huge country estate way the hell out in Loch Nowhere, Scotland, except perhaps during the years when you could have purchased these castles for a large quantity of hay. Still, just look at these prices! Every castle must go!
A fantasy highland home—whether it be a full-scale castle, a sporting estate or a historic country house—is becoming an increasingly appealing addition to the property portfolios of the superrich... According to data from estate agent Savills, the average price paid in 2007 for a prime country house was $1.856 million. Today, prices are struggling to return to that high point, standing at $1.127 million.
That's right: you can buy your "fantasy highland home" for less than you would pay for a one bedroom in Murray Hill. Sure, a full-on castle with the turrets and catapults and whatnot might run a little higher, but it's still a deal. The ceaseless grey skies and depression come free!

Labour MPs who have doubts about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership should stay off Twitter and raise concerns "behind closed doors", the shadow business secretary has said.
Angela Eagle, the most senior woman in Corbyn's frontbench team, urged critical backbenchers to focus their fire on the Conservative government rather than their own party.
But they refused to rule out running for the Labour leadership themselves at some point in the future. Eagle was speaking at a press gallery lunch in Westminster on Thursday.
They were asked by BuzzFeed News if they had any message for dissenting Labour MPs who took to social media to air their grievances.
"I think that we ought to have our discussions about things like that with each other, rather than in public," they said.
"And certainly not on Twitter, because 140 characters is rarely enough for me, let alone anyone else, to have a sophisticated rant, let alone a more nuanced debate.
"I would say it's really important that we try and focus our fire on the Conservative party, which is doing great damage up and down the country in various ways ... and let's have our discussions about the right way to do that behind closed doors."
A number of Labour MPs have tweeted their frustration with Corbyn since they became leader last September.
Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulThe Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump escalates fight with NY Times The 10 GOP senators who may break with Trump on emergency MORE (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that there was no "objective evidence" that black voters were being disenfranchised, as they entered a contentious battle over new voter identification laws in Southern states.
"The interesting thing about voting patterns now is in this last election African-Americans voted at a higher percentage than whites in almost every one of the states that were under the special provisions of the federal government," Paul said at a forum in Louisville, according to WFPL-FM.

"So really, I don't think there is objective evidence that we're precluding African-Americans from voting any longer," they added.
Paul's comments come after North Carolina's governor on Monday signed a new law requiring voters to show a photo ID before casting a ballot. Republican legislatures in others states, including Texas, are moving similar bills.
The new voting laws follow the Supreme Court decision earlier this year that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act which required jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination to preemptively clear any changes to election laws with the Department of Justice.
The lawmakers in those states say the laws are intended to prevent fraud, and argue that requiring voters to present identification is not overly burdensome. But Democrats and civil rights activists say the laws are discriminatory and intended to make it more difficult for poor voters to cast their ballot, noting that actual instances of voting fraud are rare.
In a speech in San Francisco on Monday, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE accused Republicans of a "sweeping effort to construct new obstacles to voting, often under cover of addressing a phantom epidemic of 'election fraud.'"
"In the weeks since the ruling, we've seen an unseemly rush by previously covered jurisdictions to enact or enforce laws that will make it harder for millions of our fellow Americans to vote," Clinton said.
But Paul told the audience at their forum in Louisville that it was wrong to compare the identification requirement to poll taxes and tests used to prevent blacks from voting in the Jim Crow South.
"I don't see a problem with showing your driver's license to vote," they said. "I also think that some people are a little bit stuck in the past when they want to compare this. There was a time in the south when African-Americans were absolutely prohibited from voting by selective applications of bizarre and absurd literacy tests. And that was an abomination, that's why we needed the Voting Rights Act, but that's not showing your ID."

Sorting Through Salafism
The pattern was familiar. Following the identification of the Boston Marathon bombers, US media were awash with experts, explaining the appeal of Jihad in Muslim communities. Security forces were deployed in major metropolitan areas. Returning from Pakistan a week after the attacks, a Homeland Security officer at JFK Airport asked me how often I pray, as though, because I'm South Asian, I must therefore be religious.
I could go on. Ask any North American American of Muslim background, and they'll give you the same answer. There's something farcical about it all. Instead of using the opportunity to actually learn something about Islam, Americans are taught to fear its adherents more, as though the religion is itself were a form of terror. Very rarely, or so the complaint goes, do Americans ask why Muslims embrace militarism. Most specifically, the form embraced by the Boston Marathon bombers: Salafism.
The Tsarnaev brothers are the latest incarnation of a growing social problem. Often, in the face of growing Islamophobic sentiment in North America and in Europe, left-leaning Westerners feel the need to downplay the appeal of terrorism in Muslim communities. Much of this is well-warranted, as Salafi militarism remains a fringe movement, and is often publicized for xenophobic reasons, rather than the security threat that the ideology actually poses.
However, it is equally true that there are young Muslims who grew up in Western countries, who view Salafi militant organizations with sympathy and affection. Intelligence agencies have some reason to see the Tsarnaev brothers as only one manifestation of an overall trend. It is one that includes the assassinated al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula leader Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico as the son of a Fulbright Scholar, and who studied engineering at Colorado State University.
The bloated field of security studies that was spawned by the War on Terror has yet to provide an answer as to why this is happening, let alone how to solve it. This is part of the reason that homegrown Islamic militarism has become an American obsession. But the reason that security studies is unable to assess this issue is because the field tends to over-emphasizes the importance of non-state violence. This makes it next to impossible to analyze why some young Muslims become terrorists without first understanding Salafism's appeal.
Salafism is a complicated movement of revivalism that began in the 18th and 19th centuries. It seeks to emphasize the Islamic scriptures of Qu'ran and Hadith that are associated with the Rashidun Caliphate. The love for this period in Islamic history is based on a Sunni mythology of its four Rightly Guided Caliphs. It is believed that the Caliphs ushered in a golden age for the young Muslim community that was marked by justice, prosperity, and perhaps most importantly, military strength. Understanding that they have to accept certain elements of modernity, the many groups that spring from the movement attempt to use various methods in order to establish the Rashidun Caliphate under modern conditions.
It is fairly easy to understand why this idea became popular when it did. The Rashidun Caliphate became hailed for its piety and strength during a period when Muslim-dominated areas of the world were grappling with the consequences of European imperialism. The bloodshed directly correlated with a faith in the Rashidun in order to heal the past and prevent more instances of the violence.
There have been a number of recent changes on these models, most notably that many groups (such as the Deobandi movement) now have a source of funding from Saudi Arabia. Salafism remains a reaction to colonial and post-colonial violence. Especially after two bloody wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and taking into account other neoliberal characteristics such as financial crises, ecological devastation, and rampant consumerism, Salafism holds a great deal of appeal in Muslim communities throughout the United States and Europe.
This is the ideological precondition for youth joining terrorist outfits that brandish a post-modern definition of jihad intent on reviving the Rashidun. Salafism, as it is practiced in most communities, is actually apolitical. This is primarily because Saudi Arabian Wahhabism focuses on ritualistic aspects of Islam in order to discourage religious movements against the country's monarchy-theocracy. However, many young people become frustrated with this apathy, which is seen as being inadequate to ending the humiliating relationships of violence that continue to dominate their relationships with Europe and North America.
The Tsarnaev brothers are proof that this is often felt amongst Muslim immigrants, which, in the United States is already burdened with an invisible pressure to perform its whiteness to ensure its integration. Since September 11th, Muslim communities have had the additional expectation to publicly distance themselves from terrorists. This has often meant ensuring that other Americans do not perceive them as threatening, which has become increasingly difficult and anxiety-provoking due to a rise in Islamophobia. It is not at all difficult to imagine why the possibility of a mythical Rashidun free from these and other struggles would have an appeal to the minority of Muslim youth that take it seriously.
Journalists such as Glenn Greenwald have written that the irony of the War on Terror is that the strategies purported to be essential for its victory end up creating exactly the conditions for it to be prolonged. Certainly, the fact that the Tsarnaev brothers are stated to have been self-radicalized by the U.S.-led occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan agree with that assessment.
We must also remember, though, that for many radicalized Muslims who grew up during the War on Terror, these occupations were merely an indication of wider political failures in North America and Europe, which has little to do with Islam, or the Middle East. Taking up arms against the West is just another chapter in opposing imperialism (or post-imperialism, as it were,) in this case, in the guise of neoliberalism.
The mythology of the Rashidun is not simply an objective for Islamist state building similar to the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan, Somalia, Timbuktu, and so on. It is also an idolization of a period in Islamic history that Salafi rhetoric regards as separate from history itself. The Rashidun has become seen as a vaguely paradisiacal epoch of social organization that stands in direct contrast to the uncertainties and brutality of modernity. The desire to realize it through violent means should therefore be read as a desperate attempt to break current trends of history in favor of something else.
For many Salafi Muslims, a return to the Rashidun is actually a collective reincarnation. It would constitute an ethical renaissance in an Islamic world still mired in conflict with Western governments. Many Salafi terrorists, including radicalized Muslim youth, see themselves in service of this mission. In my view, the only way to fully tackle this problem is to embrace the best aspects of the Arab Spring, meaning those formulated by the leftwing of the rebellion – labor unions, and pro-democracy advocates, in particular – to help create a new social order in the Muslim world.
Certainly, if rebuilt according to the dictates of such a left, the conditions that inspire Salafism would be significantly reduced. Including those that inspire its adherents in the West, who look towards the worst aspects of the Levant, for their inspiration.

Friends of BARC volunteers are looking for the owners of a lost 35-pound cat, KHOU-TV reported.
Dubbed “Tiny Tim” by volunteer Tim Hebert of southwest Houston, the cat was picked up by animal control officers late last month in the 10400 block of Kirkwood.
Rather than leave the obviously pampered, but dangerously obese, kitty in the city animal shelter, Friends of BARC intervened, the station reported.
Tim Hebert, one of those volunteers, got Tiny Tim out of the shelter and into the Southside Place Animal Hospital, where he's been boarded ever since.
“He's just so fat,” Hebert, who visits Tiny Tim every day at the animal hospital, said. “He's just huge. I can tell you and send you a picture, but until you see them and pick them up, you have no idea how big a 35-pound cat really is.”
Hebert, something of a one-man clearinghouse for lost and found animals, said they had put signs all over the neighborhood where Tiny Tim was found and has talked to veterinarians, to no avail.
“We have not heard back at all – at all – from anyone about this cat,” Hebert said. “And he's a very unique cat, just the hugest one I have ever seen.”
Dr. Alice Frei of the Southside Place Animal Hospital said the cat must be lost from a home, rather than a stray.
“It's very unusual. This cat should weigh 12 pounds, and it weighs 35,” Frei said. “There's no way a cat in this condition was living on the streets, so this cat had a very loving home.”
If you have any information on Tiny Tim's owners, or if you are interested in adopting him, contact Tim Hebert at timh@friendsofbarc.org.
(updated below - Update II - Update III)
News reports purporting to describe what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told US interrogators should, for several reasons, be taken with a huge grain of salt. The sources for this information are anonymous, they work for the US government, the statements were obtained with no lawyer present and no Miranda warnings given, and Tsarnaev is "grievously wounded", presumably quite medicated, and barely able to speak. That the motives for these attacks are still unclear has been acknowledged even by Alan Dershowitz last week ("It's not even clear under the federal terrorism statute that this qualifies as an act of terrorism") and Jeffrey Goldberg on Friday ("it is not yet clear, despite preliminary indications, that these men were, in fact, motivated by radical Islam").
Those caveats to the side, the reports about what motivated the Boston suspects are entirely unsurprising and, by now, quite familiar:
"The two suspects in the Boston bombing that killed three and injured more than 260 were motivated by the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials told the Washington Post. "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 'the 19-year-old suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, has told interrogators that the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan motivated them and their brother to carry out the attack,' the Post writes, citing 'US officials familiar with the interviews.'"
In the last several years, there have been four other serious attempted or successful attacks on US soil by Muslims, and in every case, they emphatically all say the same thing: that they were motivated by the continuous, horrific violence brought by the US and its allies to the Muslim world - violence which routinely kills and oppresses innocent men, women and children:
"I had an agreement with at least one person to attack the United States in retaliation for US support of Israel and in retaliation of the killing of innocent and civilian Muslim populations in Palestine, especially in the blockade of Gaza, and in retaliation for the killing of innocent and civilian Muslim populations in Yemen, Iraq, Somalia, Afghanistan and beyond, most of them women, children, and noncombatants."
"If the United States does not get out of Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries controlled by Muslims, they said, 'we will be attacking US', adding that Americans 'only care about their people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die' . . . . "As soon as they were taken into custody May 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, onboard a flight to Dubai, the Pakistani-born Shahzad told agents that they were motivated by opposition to US policy in the Muslim world, officials said."
When they were asked by the federal judge presiding over their case how they could possibly have been willing to detonate bombs that would kill innocent children, they replied:
"Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq, they don't see children, they don't see anybody. They kill women, children, they kill everybody. It's a war, and in war, they kill people. They're killing all Muslims. . . . "I am part of the answer to the US terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people. And, on behalf of that, I'm avenging the attack. Living in the United States, Americans only care about their own people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die."
Emails and other communications obtained by the US document how Shahzad transformed from law-abiding, middle-class naturalized American into someone who felt compelled to engage in violence as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, drone attacks, Israeli violence against Palestinians and Muslims generally, Guantanamo and torture, at one point asking a friend: "Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows?"
"Your Honor, during the spring and summer of 2008, I conspired with others to travel to Afghanistan to join the Taliban and fight against the U.S. military and its allies. . . . During the training, Al Qaeda leaders asked us to return to the United States and conduct martyrdom operation. We agreed to this plan. I did so because of my feelings about what the United States was doing in Afghanistan."
"Part of their disenchantment was their deep and public opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a stance shared by some medical colleagues but shaped for them by a growing religious fervor. The strands of religion and antiwar sentiment seemed to weave together in a PowerPoint presentation they made at Walter Reed in June 2007. . . . For a master's program in public health, Major Hasan gave another presentation to their environmental health class titled 'Why The War on Terror is a War on Islam.'"
Meanwhile, the American-Yemeni preacher accused (with no due process) of inspiring both Abdulmutallab and Hasan - Anwar al-Awalaki - was once considered such a moderate American Muslim imam that the Pentagon included them in post-9/11 events and the Washington Post invited them to write a column on Islam. But, by all accounts, they became increasingly radicalized in anti-American sentiment by the attack on Iraq and continuous killing of innocent Muslims by the US, including in Yemen. And, of course, Osama bin Laden, when justifying violence against Americans, cited US military bases in Saudi Arabia, US support for Israeli aggression against its neighbors, and the 1990s US sanctions regime that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, while Iranians who took over the US embassy in 1979 cited decades of brutal tyranny from the US-implanted-and-enabled Shah.
It should go without saying that the issue here is causation, not justification or even fault. It is inherently unjustifiable to target innocent civilians with violence, no matter the cause (just as it is unjustifiable to recklessly kill civilians with violence). But it is nonetheless vital to understand why there are so many people who want to attack the US as opposed to, say, Peru, or South Africa, or Brazil, or Mexico, or Japan, or Portugal. It's vital for two separate reasons.
First, some leading American opinion-makers love to delude themselves and mislead others into believing that the US is attacked despite the fact that it is peaceful, peace-loving, freedom-giving and innocent. As these myth-makers would have it, we don't bother anyone; we just mind our own business (except when we're helping and liberating everyone), so why would anyone possibly want to attack us?
With that deceitful premise in place, so many Americans, westerners, Christians and Jews love to run around insisting that the only real cause for Muslim attacks on the US is that the attackers have this primitive, brutal, savage, uncivilized religion (Islam) that makes them do it. Yesterday, Andrew Sullivan favorably cited Sam Harris as saying that "Islamic doctrines ... still present huge problems for the emergence of a global civil society" and then themselves added: "All religions contain elements of this kind of fanaticism. But Islam's fanatical side – from the Taliban to the Tsarnaevs – is more murderous than most."
These same people often love to accuse Muslims of being tribal without realizing the irony that what they are saying - Our Side is Superior and They are Inferior - is the ultimate expression of rank tribalism. They also don't seem ever to acknowledge the irony of Americans and westerners of all people accusing others of being uniquely prone to violence, militarism and aggression (Juan Cole yesterday, using indisputable statistics, utterly destroyed the claim that Muslims are uniquely violent, including by noting the massive body count piled up by predominantly Christian nations and the fact that "murder rates in most of the Muslim world are very low compared to the United States").
As the attackers themselves make as clear as they can, it's not religious fanaticism but rather political grievance that motivates these attacks. Religious conviction may make them more willing to fight (as it does for many in the west), but the motive is anger over what is being done by the US and its allies to Muslims. Those who claim otherwise are essentially saying: gosh, these Muslims sure do have this strange, primitive, inscrutable religion whereby they seem to get angry when they're invaded, occupied, bombed, killed, and have dictators externally imposed on them. It's vital to understand this causal relationship simply in order to prevent patent, tribalistic, self-glorifying falsehoods from taking hold.
Second, it's crucial to understand this causation because it's often asked "what can we do to stop Terrorism?" The answer is right in front of our faces: we could stop embracing the polices in that part of the world which fuel anti-American hatred and trigger the desire for vengeance and return violence. Yesterday at a Senate hearing on drones, a young Yemeni citizen whose village was bombed by US drones last week (despite the fact that the targets could easily have been arrested), Farea Al-Muslimi, testified. Al-Muslimi has always been pro-American in the extreme, having spent a year in the US due to a State Department award, but they were brilliant in explaining these key points:
"Just six days ago, my village was struck by a drone, in an attack that terrified thousands of simple, poor farmers. The drone strike and its impact tore my heart, much as the tragic bombings in Boston last week tore your hearts and also mine. "What radicals had previously failed to achieve in my village one drone strike accomplished in an instant: there is now an intense anger and growing hatred of America."
They added that anti-American hatred is now so high as a result of this drone strike that "I personally don't even know if it is safe for me to go back to Wessab because I am someone who people in my village associate with America and its values." And they said that whereas they never knew any Yemenis who were sympathetic to al-Qaida before the drone attacks, now:
"AQAP's power and influence has never been based on the number of members in its ranks. AQAP recruits and retains power through its ideology, which relies in large part on the Yemeni people believing that America is at war with them" . . . "I have to say that the drone strikes and the targeted killing program have made my passion and mission in support of America almost impossible in Yemen. In some areas of Yemen, the anger against America that results from the strikes makes it dangerous for me to even acknowledge having visited America, much less testify how much my life changed thanks to the State Department scholarships. It's sometimes too dangerous to even admit that I have American friends."
They added that drone strikes in Yemen "make people fear the US more than al-Qaida".
There seems to be this pervasive belief in the US that we can invade, bomb, drone, kill, occupy, and tyrannize whomever we want, and that they will never respond. That isn't how human affairs function and it never has been. If you believe all that militarism and aggression are justified, then fine: make that argument. But don't walk around acting surprised and bewildered and confounded (why do they hate us??) when violence is brought to US soil as well. It's the inevitable outcome of these choices, and that's not because Islam is some sort of bizarre or intrinsically violent and uncivilized religion. It's because no group in the world is willing to sit by and be targeted with violence and aggression of that sort without also engaging in it (just look at the massive and ongoing violence unleashed by the US in response to a single one-day attack on its soil 12 years ago: imagine how Americans would react to a series of relentless attacks on US soil over the course of more than a decade, to say nothing of having their children put in prison indefinitely with no charges, tortured, kidnapped, and otherwise brutalized by a foreign power).
Being targeted with violence is a major cost of war and aggression. It's a reason not do it. If one consciously decides to incur that cost, then that's one thing. But pretending that this is all due to some primitive and irrational religious response and not our own actions is dangerously self-flattering and self-delusional. Just listen to what the people who are doing these attacks are saying about why they are doing them. Or listen to the people who live in the places devastated by US violence about the results. None of it is unclear, and it's long past time that we stop pretending that all this evidence does not exist.
Dirty Wars
Several weeks ago, I wrote about the soon-to-be-released film, "Dirty Wars", that chronicles journalist Jeremy Scahill's investigation of US violence under President Obama in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere. That film makes many of the same points here (including the fact that many Yemenis never knew of any fellow citizens who were sympathetic to al-Qaida until the US began drone-bombing them with regularity). Scahill's book by the same title was just released yesterday and it is truly stunning and vital: easily the best account of covert US militarism under Obama. I highly recommend it. See Scahill here on Democracy Now yesterday discussing it, with a focus on Obama's killing of both Anwar Awlaki and, separately, their 16-year-son Abdulrahman in Yemen. They also discussed their book this week with MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Morning Joe (where they argued that Obama has made assassinations standard US policy).
UPDATE
The incorrect day was originally cited for Goldberg's column. It has now been edited to reflect that it was published on Friday.
UPDATE II
I was interviewed at length this week by the legendary Bill Moyers about Boston, US foreign policy, government secrecy and a variety of related matters. The program will air repeatedly on PBS, beginning this Friday night (see here for local listings). You can see a preview for the show they released today - here - as well as one short excerpt from the interview on the recorder below:
UPDATE III
Here's one more excerpt released today by the Moyers show, this one pertaining to exactly the questions raised in today's column:
During its first 14 days, the Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip has left a toll of over 500 dead, the vast majority of whom civilians, and many more injured. Thousands of houses were targeted and destroyed together with other essential civilian infrastructures. Over one hundred thousand civilians have been displaced. By the time you will read this article the numbers will have grown higher and, despicably, no real truce seems in sight. When I say real, I mean practicable, agreeable to both sides and sustainable for some time.
The Israeli government, followed suit by Western media and governments, was quick to put the blame on Hamas for that. Hamas – they claim – had an opportunity to accept a truce brokered by Egypt – and refused it. Others have already explained at length why this proposal crafted without any consultations with Hamas, was hard to accept by Hamas.
Much less noticed by the Western media was that Hamas and Islamic Jihad had meanwhile proposed a 10 year truce on the basis of 10 – very reasonable – conditions. While Israel was too busy preparing for the ground invasion, why didn't anyone in the diplomatic community spend a word about this proposal? The question is all the more poignant as this proposal was in essence in line with what many international experts as well as the United Nations have asked for years now, and included some aspects that Israel had already considered as feasible requests in the past.
The main demands of this proposal revolve around lifting the Israeli siege in Gaza through the opening of its borders with Israel to commerce and people, the establishment of an international seaport and airport under U.N. supervision, the expansion of the permitted fishing zone in the Gaza sea to 10 kilometers, and the revitalization of Gaza industrial zone. None of these demands is new. The United Nations among others have repeatedly demanded the lifting of the siege, which is illegal under international law, as a necessary condition to end the dire humanitarian situation in the Strip. The facilitation of movement of goods and people between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had already been stipulated in the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA) signed between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005. Even the construction of a port and the possibility of an airport in Gaza had already been stipulated in the AMA, though the actual implementation never followed. The requested increase of the permitted fishing zone is less than what envisaged in the 1994 Oslo Agreements and it was already part of the 2012 ceasefire understanding. Unhindered fishermen's access to the sea, without fear of being shot or arrested and having boats and nets confiscated by Israeli patrols is essential to the 3000 Gaza fishermen struggling to survive today by fishing in a limited area which is overfished and heavily polluted. The revitalization of the Gaza industrial zone, which has progressively been dismantled since the 2005 disengagement and by continuous military operations, was already considered a crucial Palestinian interest at the time of the 2005 Disengagement.
The proposed truce also demands the withdrawal of Israeli tanks from the Gaza border and the Internationalization of the Rafah Crossing and its placement under international supervision. The presence of international forces on the borders and the withdrawal of the Israeli army requested by Hamas is unsurprising, considered the heavy toll of casualties by Israeli fire in the Access Restricted Areas near the Israeli border (i.e. an area of 1.5km along the border comprising 35% of Gaza land and 85% of its whole arable land). The international presence should guarantee that Egyptian and Israeli security concerns are equally met.
The proposal also requests Israel to release the Palestinian prisoners whom had been freed as part of the deal to liberate Gilat Shalit and were arrested after the killing of the three Israeli youths in June 2014 in the West Bank; that Israel refrains from interfering in the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Fatah; and that the permits for worshippers to pray at the Al Aqsa Mosque be eased.
Not only are these conditions sensible in light of previous agreements but, especially those who pertain to the lift of the siege, are the minimum standards that Hamas and the people of Gaza could accept in the current circumstances. As Raji Sourani reports, the most common sentence from people in Gaza after the announcement of the Egyptian ‘brokered' ceasefire was “Either this situation really improves or it is better to just die”. The dire circumstances under which Gazans have lived in the last 7 years have indeed evoked in many the image of the enclave as “the world's largest open air prison”. A prison which is overcrowded and where in 6 years there will no longer be enough drinkable water or capacity to provide other essential services, as a recent UN report denounces. Facing this gloomy context, for many the continuous launch of rockets from Gaza is a response to the siege and the harsh conditions imposed by the occupation.
One could imagine that an agreement on the basis of the Hamas proposal could not only stop the current round of hostilities but also pave the way towards a lasting solution of the conflict. However Israel has shown no interest in considering this proposal and continues to prefer the military option. As a result one wonders whether Israel really wants a long lasting resolution of the conflict. This resolution would necessarily require compromises on the Israeli side, including relinquishing control over the West Bank and Gaza. Netanyahu recently made it perfectly clear that this option is off the table. An eventual agreement between Israel and Hamas would further strengthen the legitimacy of Hamas in the newly achieved Palestinian unity, which is a prerequisite for any lasting peace. Legitimizing the Palestinian unity is something the Israeli government is avoiding like the plague as it would push forward their quest for justice in the international arena.
Perhaps more surprisingly, the international community – with the exception of Turkey and Qatar – has spent no words on the Hamas truce proposal although many of the points of the proposal already enjoy international support. This refusal to deal with the proposal is particularly problematic in the current context. Without any pressure by the international community, Israel, the party who has the upper hand in this conflict, will feel legitimized to keep refusing negotiations for a real truce with Hamas. Truces and negotiations are made with enemies not friends. International organizations and Western leaders, echoing Israel and the United States, maintain that Hamas is a terrorist organization and thus any direct negotiations with it are embargoed.
Hamas resorts to violence, which is often indiscriminate and targets civilians – also due to the lack of precision weapons. But so does Israel – no matter how sophisticated its weaponry is. If the point is to help parties negotiate, both parties have to be treated equally, encouraged to consider measures other than military ones and accept compromises based on international law. Especially when sensible proposals are on the table as in this case. The firm refusal to engage with Hamas at this point epitomizes the failure of the international community to deal with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Unless the international community reverts this pattern by taking a honest stand grounded in international law and diplomacy, the plight of Gaza and of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue.
I had the pleasure of being in Takasago, in Hyogo prefecture, for 3 nights on business. If you'd ever been to Takasago, you'd probably wonder why I'd enjoy staying in a town that has a business hotel, a train station, a convenience store and, er, that's it. It's what the Japanese call ‘Inaka', basically very rural and quiet. But because the town is so quiet, it also has many old buildings. This is my 2nd post, showing all the old, abandoned houses I could find. Basically, I found one old, abandoned house, then started wandering around the backstreets, taking photos of all the old , abandoned buildings I found. Which was a lot. So I'm just gonna put up all the pictures for you to enjoy, without any notes. Hope you like them.
Sorry for the all pictures together style, by the way, it's not my normal approach, and I'll try not to do it too often.
Out of interest, I'm writing this on the shinkansen to Hiroshima, using a Windows 8 tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, and tethering the data connection from my Lumina. Ain't technology great?

Norwich and Premier League rivals Swansea have reportedly had bids accepted for Birmingham's England Under-21 starlet Nathan Redmond.

Former Canaries' assistant boss Lee Clark confirmed on Monday their prized asset is now free to speak to two unnamed clubs to discuss personal terms after the Blues' transfer valuation was met.
Chris Hughton fast-tracked Redmond into the first team at St Andrews during their Midlands stint and the 19-year-old had been widely touted with a Carrow Road reunion this summer.
The pacy wide player has already played 62 Championship games for the struggling Blues, but Clark admits Birmingham's perilous financial position will force them to cash in.
“The truth, me being transparent and not speaking out of line, is that there are six to eight Premier Leagues clubs interested in Nathan,” they told the Birmingham Mail. “That's in various different ways. Sometimes you get a call from an agent, then get a call from the player's agent, sometimes you get an inquiry from a fellow manager.
“Now what we have had been three bids, two that have been accepted and one that hasn't been accepted. Now it's up to Nathan if they want to speak to those two clubs and see if it's right for him. Unfortunately that's where we are at the moment and we have just got to get on with it.”
There is a common conservative narrative that indicates the disproportionate incarceration of black people is not the result of systemic racism, but rather of shortcomings within the black community.
It is also common to hear the supposedly neutral statement that "black people commit more crimes than white people." This "fact" is used to justify a belief that black people have a natural criminal propensity, or that a "culture of violence" is to blame for problems faced by black people in America.
Black people make up roughly 13% of the United States population, and white people make up 64%. Black people make up 40% of the prison population, and white people 39%. Therefore, even though there are roughly five times as many white people as black people in this country, blacks and whites are incarcerated in equal numbers. But the fact that black people are incarcerated five times as frequently as white people does not mean black people commit five times as many crimes. Here's why:
(1) If a black person and a white person each commit a crime, the black person is more likely to be arrested. This is due in part to the fact that black people are more heavily policed.
Black people, more often than white people, live in dense urban areas. Dense urban areas are more heavily policed than suburban or rural areas. When people live in close proximity to one another, police can monitor more people more often. In more heavily policed areas, people committing crimes are caught more frequently. This could help explain why, for example, black people and white people smoke marijuana at similar rates, yet black people are 3.7 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. (The discrepancy could also be driven by overt racism, more frequent illegal searches of black people, or an increased willingness to let non-blacks off with a warning.)
(2) When black people are arrested for a crime, they are convicted more often than white people arrested for the same crime.
An arrest and charge does not always lead to a conviction. A charge may be dismissed or a defendant may be declared not guilty at trial. Whether or not an arrestee is convicted is often determined by whether or not a defendant can afford a reputable attorney. The interaction of poverty and trial outcomes could help explain why, for example, while black defendants represent about 35% of drug arrests, 46% of those convicted of drug crimes are black. (This discrepancy could also be due to racial bias on the part of judges and jurors.)
(3) When black people are convicted of a crime, they are more likely to be sentenced to incarceration compared to whites convicted of the same crime.
When a person is convicted of a crime, a judge often has discretion in determining whether the defendant will be incarcerated or given a less severe punishment such as probation, community service, or fines. One study found that in a particular region blacks were incarcerated for convicted felony offenses 51% of the time while whites convicted of felonies were incarcerated 38% of the time. The same study also used an empirical approach to determine that race, not confounded with any other factor, was a key determinant in judges' decisions to incarcerate.
*****
Racial disparities at every stage of the criminal justice process build upon one another. So, if 1,000 white people and 200 black people (a ratio of 5:1 to reflect the U.S. population) commit the same crime, here is what the eventual prison population could look like:
100 white people and 74 black people might be arrested.
It is impossible to determine what percentage of crimes committed result in arrests because there can be no data on un-observed crimes. As noted above, however, it has been found that while black and white Americans smoke marijuana at similar rates, blacks are arrested 3.7 times as frequently for marijuana possession. These numbers were picked to reflect the 3.7:1 ratio of black to white arrests for marijuana possession. 100 is 10% of 1,000 and 74 is 37% of 200, so these numbers would represent an arrest disparity equivalent to that noted in the example above.
50 white people and 48 black people might be convicted.
If black people account for 35% of drug arrests and 46% of convictions, this indicates a conviction rate that is approximately 1.3 times higher than it should be based on the black arrest rate. So, if 50% of white arrestees were convicted we would expect to see 65% (.5 x 1.3) of black arrestees convicted: 50 is 50% of 100 and 48 is about 65% of 74. (50% was picked at random; the important factor here is the comparative proportion.)
19 white people and 24 black people might be sentenced to prison.
Using the example felony incarceration rates cited above, we might expect to see 38% of the 50 convicted white defendants (19) and 51% of the 48 convicted black defendants (24) incarcerated for their crimes. In this scenario, 12% of black people who commit a crime and less than 2% of white people who commit the same crime might eventually go to prison.
This example demonstrates that there are systemic differences in how blacks and whites are treated by the law. These differences, which are compounded in each successive phase of the criminal justice process, increase the percentage of black people incarcerated for committing a particular crime.
This example is NOT meant to be a conclusive analysis explaining the incarceration gap. The statistics presented above and applied to the illustrative example come from different contexts and refer to different crimes. Racial disparities in the application of criminal justice are not the only source of differential incarceration rates. Poverty, geography, and lacking educational and career opportunities all likely play a role. These factors exacerbate the effects of systemic racism and feed the cycle of incarceration, joblessness, and poverty that plagues some segments of the black population.
In this medieval image, a midwife prepares a pennyroyal mixture for a pregnant woman.
An abortifacient ("that which will cause a miscarriage" from Latin: abortus "miscarriage" and faciens "making") is a substance that induces abortion. Abortifacients for animals that have mated undesirably are known as mismating shots.
Common abortifacients used in performing medical abortions include mifepristone, which is typically used in conjunction with misoprostol in a two-step approach.[1] Oxytocin is commonly used to induce abortion in the second or third trimester.[2] There are also several herbal mixtures with abortifacient claims,[3] though there are reports that they may have caused severe side-effects, including death.
Medications [ edit ]
Prostaglandin analogues, such as misoprostol or gemeprost[4] (both synthetic prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1 ) analogues), are often used to terminate pregnancy up to 24[5] or 60[4] days of gestation, in combination with mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) or methotrexate (an antifolate). Misoprostol administered vaginally is more effective than when administered orally.[6] Misoprostol is approved in France under the trade name GyMiso for use with mifepristone for medical abortion. Misoprostol is used off-label with mifepristone for medical abortion in the U.S. Dinoprostone, given by the extra-amniotic route, can be used for late abortion (second trimester).[4]
Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist also known as RU-486. It is marketed under the trade name Mifegyne in France and countries other than the U.S., and under the trade name Mifeprex in the U.S. It is used in conjunction with a prostaglandin analogue.
Misoprostol alone is sometimes used for self-induced abortion in Latin American countries where legal abortion is not available, and by poor people in the United States for whom it is easier or cheaper than a legal abortion in a clinic.[7]
History [ edit ]
In the Bible, many commentators view the ordeal of the bitter water (prescribed for a sotah, or a wife whose husband suspects that they were unfaithful to him) as intended to cause the abortion of a potential bastard. The wife drinks "water of bitterness," which, if they are guilty, causes the abortion or miscarriage of a pregnancy they may be carrying.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Others dispute this interpretation,[15] saying that "There is no reason to suppose that the woman was pregnant at the time"[15]:18 and "Final proof of the woman's innocence would be pregnancy, final proof of their guilt would be the 'belly swelling and thigh falling' which possibly describes the prolapsed uterus."[15]:24
Ancient silver coin from Cyrene depicting a stalk of Silphium
The ancient Greek colony of Cyrene at one time had an economy based almost entirely on the production and export of the plant silphium, considered a powerful abortifacient.[16] Silphium figured so prominently in the wealth of Cyrene that the plant appeared on coins minted there. Silphium, which was native only to that part of Libya, was overharvested by the Greeks and was effectively driven to extinction.[16] The standard theory, however, has been challenged by a whole spectrum of alternatives (from an extinction due to climate factors, to the so-coveted product being in fact a recipe made of a composite of herbs, attribution to a single species meant perhaps as a disinformation attempt).[citation needed]
In aboriginal Australia, plants such as cymbidium madidum, petalostigma pubescens, Eucalyptus gamophylla were ingested or the body or vagina was smoked with Erythropleum chlorostachyum.[17][page needed]
As Christianity and in particular the institution of the Catholic Church increasingly influenced European society, those who dispensed abortifacient herbs found themselves classified as witches and were often persecuted in witch-hunts.[18]
Medieval Muslim physicians documented detailed and extensive lists of birth control practices, including the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence. The use of abortifacients was acceptable to some Islamic jurists provided that the abortion occurs within 120 days of conception, the time when the fetus is believed to receive its soul, though others considered the procedure fully prohibited.[19]
In English law, abortion did not become illegal until 1803. English folk practice before and after that time held that fetal life was not present until quickening. "Women who took drugs before that time would describe their actions as 'restoring the menses' or 'bringing on a period'."[20] Abortifacients used by women in England in the 19th century (not necessarily safe or effective) included diachylon, savin, ergot of rye, pennyroyal, nutmeg, rue, squills, and hiera picra,[21] the latter being a mixture of powdered aloe and canella.[22]
During the American slavery period, 18th and 19th centuries, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies to induce a miscarriage.[23]

At a time when many other bitcoin miners are shutting down because they can't afford to continue operating based on current prices, Bitcoin Shop, rebranded as Blockchain Technology Consumer Solutions (BTCS), is moving aggressively into the mining sector in an attempt to take a large chunk of market share.
“People are leaving the mining business because it is a sucker's game,” said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “But the only way to make money in the next 1-2 years is with mining.”
The company is putting its money where its mouth is. It signed a partnership with Spondoolies Tech, a provider of mining hardware, to acquire a significant amount of mining equipment. Spondoolies became a shareholder at about 10 cents a share and in exchange, BTCS was able to ramp up its mining operations from 176 Th/s (tera hashes per second) to 891 Th/s.
Allen said that if the effort works, the company is ready to quickly scale from there.
It signed a lease in a repurposed manufacturing building with 83,000 square feet. The first year rent is $58,271, and if the operation goes according to plan, BTCS has the option to buy the facility outright in the second year.
Allen feels this is the perfect time to get into bitcoin mining because the price has dropped enough that everyone else is starting to leave.
“The mistake everyone made was that they didn't care about cost structure,” Allen said.
In other words, everyone kept thinking about how the price could go to the moon, so they didn't try to get the cheapest electricity or the best hardware. Allen explained that there were miners who were paying 10 cents per kilowatt hour.
“You need to be under 6 cents per kWh. If you're in the 3-4 cent range, you're doing good,” Allen said.
Operation Hedge Strategy
BTCS intends to succeed with a mechanism it calls Operation Hedge. Allen believes it will be one of the cheapest — if not the cheapest — miners on the market. That means that it can tolerate bitcoin price drops more than other miners.
Allen is banking on smaller and more inefficient miners to go offline as the price drops, which will cause the network hash rate to drop and the difficulty with it. If that happens, BTCS' overall operation will account for more of the total hash rate, which will result in more bitcoin mined per month.
“Because we were able to get the lead manufacturer [Spondoolies] to take equity, we are in a good position,” Allen said.
Between the decreased cost of hardware because the life of mining hardware increases when the difficulty drops, the decreased costs to run the mining operation, and the increased number of bitcoin mined, BTCS expects to find success in its mining operation.
It's About the Ecosystem
BTCS isn't just looking at mining, though it is the way to generate revenue fastest with Bitcoin. The company is expanding into the entire sector, trying to become a universal Bitcoin ecosystem.
It has made strategic partnerships with GoCoin, Gem, Expresscoin, and Coin Outlet, which will allow it to spread out into multiple parts of the total network.
In particular, Allen feels that remittance is the way that businesses can generate revenue longer term. If mining is 1-2 years, remittance is likely 3-5.
“The best way for remittance to work is to set up ATMs,” Allen explained. “You have one in the target country as well as the originating country, and users can go in and out of bitcoin.”
Its partnership with Coin Outlet will allow it to quickly grow out the ATM business across the world.
Mining As a Business
BTCS is in a position to get into the mining business at an attractive price point. And as it scales, Allen explained that its power costs will decrease for each kilowatt hour because it will be able to negotiate based on its buying power.
In the United States, Washington State is the best place to mine and then, Allen said, North Carolina, which is where BTCS has its operation. The electricity is cheap enough, and with its Spondoolies hardware, it is in a good position to take a significant amount of market share.

Shadow minister accuses government of dragging its feet on promise to make it easier for victims to access legal aid
Thousands of victims of domestic violence are still being denied access to justice eight months after the government promised to make it easier for them to obtain legal aid, Labour has said.
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said in February that it would scrap a requirement for victims of domestic violence to produce evidence that they have been abused within the last five years.
It also promised to widen the pool of officials who could provide the evidence from doctors, courts, police and social services to other sources such as solicitors, housing officers and women's charities.
However, ministers have not yet brought forward secondary legislation to change the requirements.
Gloria De Piero, the shadow justice minister, said it was unacceptable that vulnerable people were still waiting for the change to be made.
“We welcomed the government's announcement in February that it would reform evidence requirements for victims of domestic violence, a process that should be done in close cooperation with domestic violence and women's charities as well as legal aid providers. However, it should not take eight months to put this right,” they said in a letter to David Lidington, the justice secretary.
“Every month the government drags its feet on implementing these reforms, victims of domestic violence are being denied access to justice in matters as important as securing the safety of themselves and their children. I ask that you now urgently implement the reforms promised and ensure domestic violence victims have swift and simple access to legal aid support.”
De Piero said MoJ figures showed that the number of applications for civil legal aid for domestic violence cases had fallen by 20% in five years, from 17,652 in 2012 to 14,152 in 2017.
An MoJ spokesperson said: “Maintaining access to justice remains vital and continues to be at the heart of our reforms. We are focusing legal aid resources on those who most need help, which is why we are making wider changes which will make it easier for domestic violence victims to qualify for the financial support they need to pay for legal representation.”
When the changes were announced by Liz Truss, then justice secretary, charities welcomed the removal of the five-year limit and the admission of fresh categories of evidence, saying it would help large numbers of women and also some men who had previously been deprived of legal advice and representation in often embittered family court disputes over custody and contact with children.
Organisations such as the Rights of Women and the Legal Aid Practitioners Group have campaigned against the restrictions and estimated that 40% of female survivors of domestic violence are unable to meet legal aid evidence requirements.
Restrictions on access to lawyers were initially introduced as a cost-saving measure in 2012 by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling, under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act.

America is a land of billionaires, boasting five of the 10 richest people on the planet as of the most recent Forbes 500 list. Then again, we're a large country, and in per capita terms, we lag behind several smaller states. Many of these—like world leader Monaco (No. 1 per capita, with three billionaires in a population of 35,427)—are true micro-nations, or else they're St. Kitts and Nevis (No. 2, one billionaire, population 53,051): more of a vacation destination for the rich and less a place where people actually go to earn a fortune. But one country stands out on the list: Sweden (No. 12, 14 billionaires, population 9.56 million).
No single Swede comes close to the epic wealth of a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett. But Stefan Persson, the chairperson, main shareholder, and former longtime CEO of H&M, leads a roster of Swedish billionaires who outpace the U.S. (No. 14) on a per capita basis. In part this is just a bit of a funny coincidence—it's a fairly small country, after all—but the fact that a famously left-wing country like Sweden can be so rich in billionaires is telling and important.
That's because a billionaire isn't just a guy with a well-paying job. To reach that level of stratospheric riches, you probably either need to start a big, successful company or else inherit one from someone who did. And however much people care about inequality, almost every place on Earth would like to be the kind of place where successful new firms are born and raised. The good news about Sweden is that it's exactly that kind of place. High taxes go to finance cheap health care and education, an excellent system of public transportation, and relatively generous subsidies to low-income households that keep the poverty rate and inequality low. But they haven't stopped Swedish entrepreneurs from building giant firms like H&M, Ikea, and Tetra Pak.
This reality cuts against a recent critique of the Nordic social model from Daron Acemoglu, James Robinson, and Thierry Verdier that was popular in right-of-center circles. The authors contrasted American-style cutthroat capitalism with Nordic-style cuddly capitalism as two social systems that are compatible with high levels of GDP per capita. The cuddly Nordic system might be better for human welfare, they said, but the American system is better for the world. Their reasoning was that high levels of inequality create financial incentives for innovation; cuddlier nations don't have those incentives. The authors test this rather schematic model empirically by showing that the U.S. files more patents per capita than any of the egalitarian Nordic countries.
That's fine, except patents aren't innovation—counting them up tells you more about a country's patent policies than about the number of good ideas its people are coming up with. Lots of things that get patented are completely trivial. Or where they're not trivial, they often aren't very innovative—Amazon's infamous 1999 patent on one-click shopping, for example, only looked innovative to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because the whole Web still seemed so new at the time. Nobody owns a patent on brick-and-mortar checkout procedures like “have the customers wait in line until a register is free,” because patent law didn't use to be as promiscuous as it is today. Conversely, lots of important innovations such as “affordable Scandinavian modern design” aren't patentable.
At the same time, while Scandinavian success stories show that great companies can be born and innovate amid generous welfare states, they do have some cautionary tales for left-wing thinking. The Swedish tax code was substantially reformed in 1990 to be friendlier toward capital accumulation, with a flat rate on investment income. Sweden has no taxes on inheritance or residential property, and its 22 percent corporate income tax rate is far lower than America's 35 percent. Even after spending cuts by the current center-right government, the Swedish public sector is still about half the total economy (much higher than here), but the taxes that finance it fall more heavily on consumption and less on business investment than in the U.S.
Sweden also has a relatively lightly regulated economy. There are rules about public health and environmental protection, of course. But Sweden is arguably further down the neoliberal path of dismantling purely economic regulations than the U.S. In Stockholm, for example, taxi fares are completely unregulated and for-profit charter schools are common. All things considered, international surveys rank Sweden as a place where it's easy to do business. Within the U.S., surveys show that licensing rules rather than tax rates are the main driver of local business-friendliness.
It's much the same in the international context. Regulations that prevent firms from growing big and putting other companies out of business are widespread in many countries, and harm both economywide living standards and billionaire production. France, for example, is considering a ban on free shipping of books to protect its small bookstores from the depredations of Amazon—protections that numerous American retailers in the book industry and beyond would no doubt appreciate. And here in the U.S., the arcane, three-tier liquor distribution system and baroque car dealership rules similarly prevent the most efficient firms from growing and putting the others out of business.
This kind of protectionist regulation has an obvious appeal to incumbents, and the small-business owners it protects are often more sympathetic to it than the wannabe billionaires who'd like to see these rules dismantled. But letting the best firms thrive and grow is what creates both vast fortunes and at least the possibility of broadly shared prosperity. If those parameters are in place, even high taxes and generous social welfare benefits don't stop great business people from building great businesses—or even amassing great sums of money.
A U.S. government-funded medical information site that bills itself as the world's largest database on reproductive health has quietly begun to block searches on the word "abortion," concealing nearly 25,000 search results.
Called Popline, the search site is run by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland. It's funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, the federal office in charge of providing foreign aid, including health care funding, to developing nations.
The massive database indexes a broad range of reproductive health literature, including titles like "Previous abortion and the risk of low birth weight and preterm births," and "Abortion in the United States: Incidence and access to services, 2005."
But on Thursday, a search on "abortion" was producing only the message "No records found by latest query."
Stephen Goldstein, a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins, said they aren't aware of the censorship, and couldn't immediately comment.
Under a Reagan-era policy revived by President Bush in 2001, USAID denies funding to non-governmental organizations that perform abortions, or that "actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations."
A librarian at the University of California at San Francisco noticed the new censorship on Monday, while carrying out a routine research request on behalf of academics and researchers at the university. The search term had functioned properly as of January.
Puzzled, they contacted the manager of the database, Johns Hopkins' Debbie Dickson, who replied in an April 1st e-mail that the university had recently begun blocking the search term because the database received federal funding.
"We recently made all abortion terms stop words," Dickson wrote in a note to Gloria Won, the UCSF medical center librarian making the inquiry. "As a federally funded project, we decided this was best for now."
There was no notice of the change on the site.
Dickson suggested other kinds of more obscure search strategies and alternative words to get around the keyword blocking.
"In addition to the terms you're already using, you could try using
'Fertility Control, Postconception'. This is the broader term to our
'abortion' terms and most records have both in the keyword fields,"
they wrote.
They also suggested using a euphemistic search strategy of "unwanted w/2
pregnancy." But the workarounds don't satisfy critics of the censorship.
"The main function of their site is keyword search, and if you use a phrase that contains the word 'abortion,' it ignores it," notes Melissa
Just, the library director at the cancer research institute and hospital named City of Hope in Duarte, California. Just followed the conversation on a listserv and said they were outraged when they found out about the censorship incident.
"Even if you were trying to make an argument to someone that abortion is a bad idea for them – whether it's a health risk, or you're concerned about their mental well being, you wouldn't be able to find articles about your claim," they note. "It's shutting off both the pro and the con access."

Two Quebec men called 911 Sunday to report their vehicles were being taken away — by police.
Ontario Provincial Police said officers from the Leeds and the Thousand Islands detachment had stopped the two men on Highway 401 east of Gananoque after spotting them racing at 54 km/h over the posted speed limit, which is grounds for automatic impoundment.
While their vehicles were being towed, the men, 20 and 44, called 911 from the roadside — in the presence of OPP officers — to report their vehicles were being taken away, according to an OPP news release.
The men were "upset" and "arguing the authority to tow vehicles for stunt driving," OPP said.
In the release OPP did not specify whether the men had been charged, but under Ontario's Highway Traffic Act drivers can be charged with stunt driving if they're caught going 50 km/h over the posted speed limit.
"Leeds OPP remind drivers that under provincial legislation, police officers in Ontario have the authority to impound a vehicle for seven days when it is involved in a speeding offence of 50 km/h or more over the posted speed limit. Your vehicle will then be immediately towed to an impound yard," the release said.
Police are also reminding the public that non-emergency calls to 911 can take operators away from responding to real emergencies.
They make their living by taking people's cars away.Jim Ford, a repo man in Illinois, sprung a huge surprise on an elderly couple after helping to get their car paid off."You know, it was just one of those repos," Ford, owner of Illini Asset Recovery, told KTVI . "My grandparents are gone, but you know - I could see them in the Kippings. I knew what was going on. The cost of their medications have doubled or tripled, and I know that's happening to everybody. I knew why they were behind."Pat Kippling said they and their husband used the Buick to travel to the doctor's office, the drug store and the grocery."That's about all we ever got to do," Kippling said.But now, the Kipplings' transportation was gone. Ford did repossess their car, but they immediately got on the phone with the bank."I pulled over about a block away from their house and called the bank and said...we got to do something. How about I just pay it current right now?" they said.Ford set up a GoFundMe account and within eight hours, raised most of the balance to pay off the car. Not only did the car get paid off, Ford and their fellow benefactors got the oil changed and had the vehicle detailed."When they took my car, I thought my husband and I were going to break. I thought, 'We have no way of going places.' I prayed to God. I said, 'Whatever you decide, God, we'll be OK.' And that's what happened," Kippling told ABC News Stan and Pat are now behind the wheel again, thanks to the generosity of the man who took their car.
“The old order changeth,” Tennyson wrote, “yielding place to new.”
For three-quarters of a century, Americans have been debating whether the state should guarantee health coverage for all. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the “yes” side seemed at last to have prevailed, or nearly so. Obamacare is not quite a universal health-care program, but it shifted the U.S. closer to that outcome. For seven years, Republicans have vowed to shift it back. Now the moment for reversal has arrived. If Paul Ryan's version of health-care reform prevails, the speaker will have accomplished something that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher never could: Repeal a fully operational social-insurance program.
But it looks increasingly unlikely that Ryan will prevail. Monday's Congressional Budget Office estimate that 14 million Americans will lose coverage in the first year after repeal—with 7 more to lose it just in time for the 2020 presidential election—must spread panic among already nervous Republicans. Paul Ryan, a true believer, accepts that toll as the price of principle. It seems doubtful that very many other Republican officeholders will long agree.
Unlike Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who absurdly promises that not one person in the United States will be rendered worse off by the GOP bill, Ryan has been commendably frank about the choice before the country. Here's what they told CBS's John Dickerson on Sunday, March 12.
Dickerson: How many people are going to lose coverage under this new— Ryan: I can't answer that question. It's up to people. Here—here's the premise of your question. Are you going to stop mandating people buy health insurance? People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country. So the question is, are we providing a system where people have access to health insurance if they choose to do so? And the answer is yes. But are we going to have some nice looking spreadsheet that says we, the government of the American—of the United States are going to make people buy something and, therefore, they're all going to buy it? No. That's the fatal conceit of Obamacare in the first place. So it's not our job to make people do something that they don't want to do. It is our job to have a system where people can get universal access to affordable coverage if they choose to do so or not. That's what we're going to be accomplishing.
Ryan's forthright remarks reveal the assumptions on which their policy is founded. Health-care coverage, their comments suggest, is a good that comes with a cost primarily borne by the covered individual or family. If individuals or families assesses that the good is not worth the cost, then they should be free to forgo the coverage. If that decision should ruin them financially—or expose them to life-threatening medical risk—then that is the price of freedom. As Ayn Rand wrote in The Virtue of Selfishness: “No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation , an unrewarded duty or an involuntary servitude on another man.” And what is a mandate but an unchosen obligation?

More than 29 million Americans have diabetes — it is the 7th leading cause of death in the U.S. In most cases, poor diet and lack of exercise are contributing factors to Type 2 diabetes, in which the pancreas doesn't use the hormone insulin properly. Insulin is needed to convert sugar into energy.
The rarer form of diabetes is Type 1, in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. About 3 million Americans have this form, which is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously known as juvenile diabetes. Unlike Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 is chronic and requires a lifetime of insulin therapy.
For children and their parents, Type 1 diabetes is relentless. Imagine having to sort through information every five minutes — 288 times a day — about how to control your sugar levels. People with Type 1 diabetes often have to do just that. For parents, it can be frightening, especially at night when their child is asleep. Ed Damiano, an associate professor in the Biomedical Engineering department at Boston University, knows that all too well. "The possibility that you could go to sleep and have your blood sugar drop profoundly low while you're unconscious and there's no one there to intervene. And the fear is something called 'dead in bed syndrome.'"
Damiano's son, David, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when they were an infant.
David will be going to college in 2017, something their dad worries about. "He's afraid that I won't be able to take care of myself as well when I'm away and alone," says David. "He felt like they needed to do something in order to make it better for me. So they took on this huge project of building and developing the bionic pancreas."
The bionic pancreas is a device that currently uses a smartphone that calculates blood sugar information and sends it wirelessly to two pumps that automatically release the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin lowers blood sugar and glucagon raises blood sugar. "The idea behind the bionic pancreas is to emulate as much as possible what a healthy pancreas does," says Damiano.
Damiano is working with a team that's developing the device to take the thinking out of having to manage Type 1 diabetes 24/7. "People with Type 1 diabetes just don't have good enough tools. … The bionic pancreas is a device which gives them the tools they need to achieve good blood sugars. And so much so that they don't have to think about it anymore. That's really the ultimate goal."
Damiano hopes the bionic pancreas will be FDA approved by 2017. "Thirty-seven months from now — not that I'm counting — David goes to college," they say. "And so somebody needs to help them out, and I'm hoping their college roommate would. I'm actually hoping the bionic pancreas will take over. But if it weren't for that technology, then I'd have to rely on the kindness of strangers."
Watch the video above to learn more about the bionic pancreas and the story of Ed and David Damiano. For more about juvenile diabetes, go to The Barton Center for Diabetes Education or Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

Liars blink less frequently than normal during the lie, and then speed up to around eight times faster than usual afterwards.
The findings, reported in the Journal of Non-verbal Behaviour, mean that blink rates could soon be used by professionals, such as the police and security forces, to tell when someone is being duplicitous.
Dr Sharon Leal, co-author of the study at Portsmouth University, said: "It is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers.
"Such striking differences in behaviour between liars and truth tellers are rarely seen in deception research."
Researchers studied a group of volunteers as they went about their normal business for ten minutes. A second group were asked to steal an exam paper from an office, then to deny having taken it.
The groups were then asked each to recall exactly what they had been doing.
During the interview their blink rates, which had all been the same at the start, were monitored with electrodes placed above and below and at the sides of the eyes to monitor all movements.
Results show that when the questions were being asked and the answers given, the blink rate in the liars went down. In contrast the truthful group's rate went up, though this could have been down to test anxiety.
Afterwards, the blink rate of the liars increased rapidly, while that of the truth tellers remained the same.
Researchers believe the increased effort involved in telling fibs could be the reason why liars do not blink during the act of lying.
Dr Leal said: "Liars must need to make up their stories and must monitor their fabrication so that they are plausible and adhere to everything the observer knows or might find out.
"In addition, liars must remember their earlier statements, so that they appear consistent when re-telling their story, and know what they told to whom. Liars will be more inclined than truth tellers to monitor and control their demeanour so they will appear honest.
"The reasons why there is a flurry of blinks after the lie is not really clear. It may be that this flurry is a kind of safety valve, like a release of energy after the tension of lying."
Not even 24 hours after Karen Handel defeated Jon Ossoff in Georgia's special congressional election Tuesday evening, Democrats began blaming the election results on possible hacks.
The special election in Georgia's 6th district Tuesday night resulted in a 52-48 victory for Republican candidate Karen Handel over Democrat Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional staffer who did not reside in the district. Democrats are already claiming that Georgia's voting system is flawed, because it relies entirely upon electronic voting records and has no system of verification, like a simple paper backup system.
Left-leaning media outlets are calling the election results into question, like the Raw Story headline Tuesday night, “No Paper Trail: Georgia's Antiquated Voting System Prevents An Audit For Hacks.”
In fact, multiple outlets were questioning the Georgia electoral system in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's vote.
ThinkProgress wrote a story June 16 claiming that the results of the election should be scrutinized, because the state has no verification system in place and state officials have repeatedly refused to address voter's concerns on the issue. The Nation ran the headline Monday evening, “Karen Handel Has A Long History Of Suppressing Votes.”
“You have an un-provable system,” Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, told Wired June 15 regarding Georgia's electoral system. “It might be right, it might not be right, and that absence of authoritative confirmation is the biggest problem. It's corrosive.”
Other outlets also questioned the validity of Georgia's voting system.
Several factors make Georgia's voting systems an especially good candidate for hacking: https://t.co/JsT53kHaRU — POLITICO Magazine (@POLITICOMag) June 18, 2017
The voting system in Georgia, which has a big special election coming up, is super-vulnerable to hacking.https://t.co/8AD5CH858r — ProPublica (@ProPublica) June 19, 2017
Democrats first cried wolf about hacking in elections in the 2016 presidential election. The left claimed that Russian interference in the election caused President Donald Trump to defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore.
An Oregon member of congress says they want to test having a government GPS unit in every car so a tax could be imposed on the miles driven.
The proposal, H.R. 3311, which calls for a test project costing $150 million-plus, was introduced by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore.
“Oregon has successfully tested a Vehicle Miles Traveled fee, and it is time to expand and test the VMT program across the country,” they said in a statement on their website. “A VMT system can better assess fees based on use of our roads and bridges, as well as during times of peak congestion, than a fee based on fuel consumption.
“It is time to get creative and find smart ways to rebuild and renew America's deteriorating infrastructure,” they said.
Their plan calls for the Department of the Treasury to study the idea with test GPS-equipped car projects in every state.
Blumenauer said the Oregon test “charged drivers for the number of miles they traveled rather the fuel they consumed. The test was convenient for drivers, protected personal privacy, and proved to be easily administrable.”
In a WND column, however, Henry Lamb raised several concerns unaddressed by the member of congress.
For example, what other applications would there be for a GPS unit attached to each car in the nation?
What about “shutting down the vehicle when its allotted emissions cap had been reached.”
“Why not?” Lamb wrote, “The current cap-and-trade bill would limit industrial emissions and force each business to pay an extra tax for the privilege of emitting additional carbon dioxide. Why not arbitrarily assign a weekly or monthly cap on auto emissions and shut down the vehicle when that limit is reached? The new Global Positioning Satellite device would have that capability.
“Every American ought to be outraged that such a system is even contemplated,” they continued. “This system is the tool that makes slaves of every person who depends upon a vehicle. Every person should consider just how their life would be changed if they were required to get approval from the federal government to start their car.”
Lamb said shutting down a vehicle would be among the less intrusive possibilities.
“The proposed GPS road tax system could easily be programmed to listen to and record conversations inside any vehicle. It could stop a vehicle, lock the occupants inside and notify the ‘jack boots' that the occupants were en route to a tea party,” Lamb wrote. “We would hope that the federal government would never sink to the level of paranoia that gripped Nazi Germany. But then, we also hoped that the federal government would never sink to the level of labeling legal, peaceful assemblies, such as the recent tea parties, as gatherings of potential terrorists.”
According to a report at Landlinemag.com, the bill does not call for a removal of the “fuel tax” if a mileage tax is established.
“The current system of levying federal taxes on trucks is as discriminatory as it can be to small business, and harmful, but there are lots of unanswered questions with a VMT,” Todd Spencer, vice president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, told the magazine.
“And those questions need to be resolved before we start launching down that path,” they said.
The bill, introduced July 23, has been assigned to the House Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation.
It states the subjects that need to be evaluated include “ease of compliance,” “public acceptances,” and “geographic and income equity.”
The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported besides Oregon's test project, several other states also have considered checking out the idea.
Under the Oregon plan, a dashboard display, a GPS receiver and antenna, mileage counter and a radio were built into several hundred cars. When a driver pulled up to a pump at a specially equipped gas station, a radio sent information about the car's travels to the pump.
It was programmed at that point to remove the gas tax and add the mileage tax.
On the Cleveland newspaper's forum page, there was alarm over the potential.
“Are you people convinced yet that it's time to grab the pitchforks and head for the castle?” wrote a participant.
Another expressed frustration.
“I purchased a small car last spring because gas prices were on the rise. This small car averages 43 mpg. This saved me a lot of money when gas prices hit $4.00+/gal. The car also has the smallest carbon footprint of any non-hybrid vehicle being produced today. The small carbon footprint helps save the environment. I travel 100+ miles/day. The government encourages us to use less gas to help the country become less dependent on foreign oil. The people are doing what they want by driving less or driving more fuel efficient vehicles. Of course gas tax revenues are going to decrease. And now they are thinking about a mileage tax because people are doing what they want…..they can't have it both ways…”
Transportation officials in the Obama administration have downplayed the idea for now.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc has approved a new form of peaceful resistance which has spread through Turkey after almost three weeks of protests.
Hundreds of protesters stood still for hours on squares on main streets in several cities, mimicking a lone protester who started the trend on Istanbul's Taksim Square on Monday and has been dubbed the "Standing Man."
In the first direct government comment on the new style of protest, the deputy prime Minister told reporters that the standing protests are peaceful and "pleasing to the eye." They urged protesters, however, not to obstruct traffic and not to endanger their health.

"This is not an act of violence," Arinc said. "We cannot condemn it."
The first such protest was carried out by performance artist Erdem Gunduz, who stood for eight hours at Taksim Square, in passive defiance of Mr Erdoğan. Mr Gunduz stood silently facing a portrait of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern, secular Turkey.
Hundreds of others joined them in the square, which was reopened on Monday, before being dispersed by police. Others copied them in Istanbul and other cities, and the act provoked widespread comment on social media.
Mr Gunduz's vigil was broken up by police after others joined him.
Mr Gunduz told the BBC: "I'm nothing... The idea is important: why people resist the government. The government doesn't want to understand, didn't try to understand why people are on the streets. This is really silent resistance. I hope people stop and think 'what happened there?'"
The state-run Anadolu Agency said police used water cannons last night to scatter hundreds of protesters who set up barricades in the capital Ankara and in Eskisehir, some 140 miles (230 kilometers) further west.
More than 7,500 people have been injured and at least four people — three demonstrators and a police officer — have been killed as the authorities tried to quell the protests using tear gas and water cannons. Authorities are investigating whether a fifth person who died was exposed to tear gas.
Bulent Arinc denied that Turkey would restrict the use of Twitter or other social media but said the government could consider enacting legislation in a bid to deter users from "inciting crime, spreading lies and disinformation."
"Social media is a part of modern life and none of us can remain outside of it," Arinc said. "But there have to be some deterrents."
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoganhas branded Twitter the "worst menace" to society and criticized it for spreading "lies."
Mr Erdoğan says they will increase police powers as dozens of demonstrators were questioned by police following a series of raids.
NTV television said the swoops in Ankara and Istanbul targeted left-wing groups. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said at least 25 people were detained in Ankara and many others in Istanbul.
Mr Erdoğan said riot police deployed to disperse protesters had acted with restraint and said their powers would be increased, allowing them more leeway in dealing with future protests.
"Our security forces put up a successful and extremely patient struggle against the acts of violence, by remaining within the limits set by democracy and the law," they said.
The government said on Monday that it may send the army on to the streets to end the unrest that has gripped the country for almost three weeks.
Bulent Arinc told Turkish state-run television that the government would use “all its powers” to end the unrest. “There is the police, If that's not enough there's the gendarmerie [a paramilitary force]. If that's not enough there are the armed forces,” they added.
The deployment of the military would represent yet another escalation of a crisis that looked to be heading for a peaceful resolution as recently as Saturday, before Mr Erdoğan ordered police in to clear protesters from Gezi Park with tear gas and rubber bullets.
The Prime Minister is still trying to reign in mass protests that have spread across the country over the past three weeks. The protests gained momentum after police used tear gas against a peaceful sit-in in Istanbul's Gezi Park on 31 May, objecting to the demolition of the park for a commercial development.
The protests grew into wider demonstrations against Mr Erdoğan's perceived attempts to impose a religious and conservative lifestyle in a country which has secular laws. But the prime minister, a devout Muslim, says they are committed to Turkey's secular laws and denies charges of autocracy.

Cleveland officer not guilty over deaths of two people shot at 137 times by police
A Cleveland police officer who stood on the hood of a car and fired their gun 49 times through the windshield at two unarmed passengers was on Saturday found not guilty on two counts of voluntary manslaughter.
Officer Michael Brelo was also found not guilty of felonious assault, and discharged. They remain on unpaid leave.
The federal Department of Justice announced a review of the decision. In a statement to which civil rights division head Vanita Gupta was one of three names attached, the DoJ said: “We will now review the testimony and evidence presented in the state trial … to collaboratively determine what, if any, additional steps are available and appropriate.”
Protests followed the verdict, as civic leaders called for calm.
“It is my expectation that we will show the nation that peaceful protest is a right,” said Mayor Frank Jackson, at an afternoon press conference. Jackson added that anyone, protester or police, who had “a different agenda” would not be tolerated.
In court in the morning, Cuyahoga County judge John P O'Donnell said prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that bullets fired by Brelo were the cause of death of Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell, or that Brelo had no fear for their own life during the volley of gunfire that ended a high-speed car chase on 29 November 2012.
Regarding the shots fired from Brelo's gun, O'Donnell said they could have been the ones causing death, but so could others fired by other officers before their shots from the hood of the vehicle.
“I cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt which of the fatal wounds they caused,” O'Donnell said.
As far as Brelo's perception that they were in danger, and therefore justified in firing their weapon, O'Connell said the prosecution only proved that Brelo's action may not have been in line with some of the department's procedural standards.
“Not conforming to the training, and maybe not appropriate for the circumstances, but not illegal,” the judge said of Brelo firing their last 15 shots from on top of the car hood, down into the passengers in the front seats.
“The verdict should be no cause for a civilized society to celebrate or riot,” O'Donnell said in remarks preceding their lengthy reading of 10 pages of their 35-page verdict, in which they discussed the wounds suffered by Williams and Russell, which were indicated on two mannequins in court, and the views and actions of other police officers involved in the shooting.
After O'Donnell delivered their verdict, some African American spectators in the courthouse shouted: “No justice, no peace!”
About 40 protesters gathered outside the courthouse in downtown. The protest turned a little ugly as Brelo's attorney, Patrick D'Angelo, made their way outside for TV interviews. The small crowd surrounded D'Angelo and some screamed “protector of killers” as they were escorted back into the courthouse by deputies.
Police quickly barricaded the roads around the courthouse, closing them to vehicle traffic but permitting people to protest in the street.
“This verdict was no surprise to the black community,” said one African American community activist outside the court house. “The law is written so the police can get away with abusing people of color, and this is proof of how that works.”
Initially, protests seemed likely to remain peaceful. One city councilman, Jeff Johnson, told the Guardian: “I would encourage everyone in Cleveland to hit the streets, and express your opinion if this decision outrages you.
“But rioting will do nothing for the cause of changing the judicial view of these cases of excessive force. We must show restraint.
“I believe this verdict is unreasonable, and I'm sure members of many communities in Cleveland will think it is unreasonable. There is a court of popular opinion, and we must raise our voices in a peaceful way that this is not a standard of police behavior we will tolerate.”
Another councilman, Zack Reed, added: “I'm hoping Cleveland will be a model in how to handle decisions like this, and that everyone will agree to be calm and not bring any harm to the citizens of this city.”

Brelo's trial ended about three weeks ago, and was decided by a judge instead of a jury at the request of the defendant. The move allowed the decision to be made by a judge looking only at the strict legal interpretation of the case, rather than by a jury that might render a decision based more on emotion.
Sources have told the Guardian that O'Donnell waited so long to issue their verdict in order to give the city time to prepare for any resultant civic unrest of the kind seen recently in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore after cases involving deaths at the hands of police.
The judge picked a Saturday morning on a holiday weekend to announce the verdict, the sources said, to provide an extra day for law enforcement to calm the city, and also as a way to lessen problems that might be caused by high school students. In recent years, downtown Cleveland has experienced some acts of mob violence carried out by high school students – in particular on St Patrick's Day this year.
Brelo, 31, joined the Cleveland police department in 2007, having served in the marine corps in Iraq. They were charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter. Each count can carry a sentence of three to eight years in prison.
Brelo's trial resulted froma police chase on 29 November 2012, when Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell led police on a 20-minute pursuit that involved 60 police cars and about 100 police officers. The chase began when their car, a 1979 Chevy Malibu, apparently backfired as it passed police headquarters in downtown Cleveland. The noise was mistaken for a gunshot.

Williams, 30, and Russell, 43, were boxed into a middle-school parking lot when 13 Cleveland police officers fired 137 shots into the car in an 18-second volley. Brelo fired the most – 49 shots total – including 15 at the end of the barrage while standing on the hood of the car, aiming at the pair through the windshield. Even though a dozen other officers fired 88 bullets into the car, only Brelo was charged.
If Brelo was fearful that they or another officer or a bystander might get hurt, they were entitled to use deadly force.
The prosecution also had to prove that Brelo's actions led to the deaths of Williams and Russell, meaning the bullets fired from their gun were the ones that killed them. No forensic science experts could say with any certainty that any of Brelo's 49 bullets resulted in death.
The Brelo case caused widespread outrage and led to an investigation of the use of excessive force by the Cleveland police department. In February 2013, the Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, found that the chase and killing of Russell and Williams represented “a systematic failure in the Cleveland police department”.
Last December, after a 21-month investigation sparked by the case, the then US attorney general Eric Holder released a report that found Cleveland police had engaged in a pattern and practice of excessive force, including unnecessary deadly force. The Department of Justice report alleged that the excessive force violated Cleveland citizens' constitutional rights, and was based on more than 600 incidents between 2012 and 2013.

Cleveland's mayor, Frank Jackson, has been in office for 10 years, during which time, according to a report in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, “in more than 60 lawsuits, citizens accused officers of needlessly shooting at them, beating them during routine traffic stops, shocking them with Tasers while face-down on the ground in handcuffs or arresting them when they had committed no crime”.
Those lawsuits cost the city more than $8m to resolve, according to the report.
Adding to the Cleveland police department's problems is the ongoing investigation into the killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. The boy was holding a toy pellet gun when they were shot by police in a city park last November.
With expectations that a not guilty verdict might spark riots similar to those seen in Baltimore last month, Cleveland police and city leaders met various community groups in private. Neighborhood outreach teams included religious leaders, youth league coaches, business leaders, motorcycle club members and former gang members, in an effort to keep the peace regardless of the verdict.
Standing over the dark elf's corpse the ogre pulls the metal pole-arm affixed to their left arm from the poor creature's chest with a sickening plop. The massive green skinned slave opens their mouth and a sound emerges that silences all noise from the celebrating crowd. Once a chieftain the sound is of deep rooted frustration.
The ogre has been a pit-fighter for decades. They live in intense agonizing pain. Every fight they hope to die. Every fight they take wound after wound, but lives on.
With a shudder they stop their moaning and reaches up their lone hand and feels around on their scarred bald scalp. They touch gingerly at the arrow jutting from their skull. It has only several inches showing below the feathered fletching. They scrunch their blood glistening brow and pinches the thin shaft between two fingers and pulls. It comes, slick with gore and is eventually freed, the serrated tip holding tight to a section of grey brain.
They drop the ash blackened arrow onto the ground and stands unsteady on their metal constructed legs. A long stringy strand of red tinged saliva drips from their rotten tooth maw. The light of thought dims from their eyes, but only for a moment. Like a spark catching flammable liquid their rage returns and they fill the air with a war cry, ready again for battle.
The crowd cheers in response chanting for a new challenger to be thrown into the pit.

Elite: Dangerous is the fourth instalment of the sandbox space sim series Elite, and due for release later this year.
As it's been almost 20 years since the last Elite, younger viewers could be forgiven for being unfamiliar with the series. 1984's Elite is widely credited as being the grandfather of the ‘open world/sandbox' game. Some might even go so far as to say that blockbuster titles like GTA might not even exist if it weren't for this ahead-of-its-time game.
Elite takes place almost entirely in the cockpit of a spaceship. The premise is that you are a pilot in a vast procedurally generated galaxy. You can become a trader, a courier, a pirate, a bounty hunter or any combination of the above. You can upgrade your ship and buy new ones to help facilitate whatever it is you'd like to do. Elite gives you no direction beyond “make your way in the galaxy”.
Elite Dangerous was funded by a Kickstarter campaign back in early 2013 and it has made rapid progress since then. Higher tier backers were given access to Alpha builds of the the game, but Alpha access is still available direct from their site for anyone who missed the Kickstarter and would like to get involved before the final game is released. On the 10th of April, Elite: Dangerous opened up access to the single player combat Alpha to all Premium Beta Kickstarter backers – those who chipped in £100 or more. Alpha backers, at £200 or more, have been enjoying the development of Elite for some months now, including this single player module. Recently, creator, David Braben mentioned that almost 10% of these backers were playing Elite using an Oculus Rift. This figure is encouragingly high, but not totally surprising. You might reasonably expect that early adopters of the one would be early adopters of the other. Especially considering the obvious synergies between the Oculus hardware and Elite's core gameplay.
I was recently able to have a go on this single player combat module with an Oculus Rift on a friend's PC. There are nine different combat scenarios to try. Starting with simple target practice, moving on to one-on-one duels, then facing off against multiple ships. One scenario has you make use of stealth tactics, another has you assault a large “Anaconda” class freighter. The later scenarios have you fighting waves of enemy ships or getting embroiled in an inter-factional conflict. These scenarios increase in difficulty as you progress and they showcase different weapon load-outs as well as different ways to approach combat. Of course they reflective only a small but central component of what the final game will involve but they act as a tantalising taster.
Ambushing the unfortunately named freighter “Big Score” in the Supply Strike mission, is one of my favourites. Trying to evade it's powerful beam weapons as you engage its fighter escorts before turning your missiles on it, is a thrill. Being in the midst of a massive space battle in the”Factions” scenario is just incredible to watch on the rift. The much talked about stealth system – based on a mechanic of trying to minimise your ships heat output, did not come into focus as sharply as I had hoped it would, in the mission “Predator and Prey”. It was not totally clear to me how far my attempts at stealth were effective; how close I was to being detected or if I was just sufficiently far away from the dangerous mercenary ship that you are supposed to avoid.
Elite: Dangerous is gorgeous and one of the nicest looking games on the Rift. The ship models are of an incredibly high quality and some of the lighting effects are breathtaking. Your cockpit looks very realistic, thanks to visual effects on the glass of the windows and it's great being able to look around, although it could certainly do with a pilot avatar. The holographic displays work well, and the classic radar is still as useful as it ever was. One of the loveliest little touches is how panels blow out, in true Sci-Fi fashion, as you take hits. It is even possible for the windows to smash, sucking out all of the oxygen from the cockpit, giving you two minutes before you asphyxiate. The visuals, combined with the realistic changes to the sound effects, are so compelling you'll feel in real peril – as if you really do only have moments before you die a cold death in the vacuum of space.
As this is just an Alpha build, it is prone to crash and has a few technical issues with regard to Oculus support. The occasional crash is no big deal, and to be expected. Luckily it seemed to happen most often at the start of a scenario so it wasn't frustrating in the sense of losing progress. Some of the issues with the Oculus implementation are somewhat strange – for example, when I first booted the game up, the Oculus was set as a duplicated monitor. This worked absolutely fine until it inexplicably stopped working after a couple of plays, after which the game only seemed to support setting the Rift as an extended display. The menus almost always, but not consistently, failed to display the right offset for each eye making them completely unusable, quite aside from resolution issues. Once in play, however, there were no real issues with the display or head-tracking. Comfort-wise, I experienced no nausea or disorientation in play, even as I barrel-rolled past asteroids or got knocked into a wild spin after clipping one of them. My friend, who had never tried VR before also reported no feelings of sickness, even after several hours of play. This is a really good sign for the game.
Playing Elite: Dangerous with a DK1 is a really thrilling experience and well worth doing if you have access to both. It's really close to being perfect, but there are currently a few issues that prevent it from being the definitive way to play the game. Luckily most of these issues are rectifiable, and hopefully fixed for the final release.
Firstly, the perennial problem of the DK1's screen being low resolution. On the whole it's not a problem but it can sometimes be very difficult to see the thin line to target when you are using ballistic weapons. This is exaccerbated by the targeting reticle being slightly off – sometimes your lasers will seem to hit a little to the side of the target dot. This may be to do with the reticle itself being situated at a different depth of field from the target. It is easily corrected for, but off-putting nonetheless.
When playing without a Rift, you have access to UI side-panels to your left and right. The left panel allows you to see a list of visible contacts, while the right allows you to fine-tune things like weapon firing groups. What is strange is that there doesn't seem to be any way to access these in Oculus mode. It is potentially tricky as controls change contextually when you are looking at these menus so you wouldn't want to accidentally select them when freely looking around. However, they seem to be positioned such that looking at them would be a pretty deliberate movement. Presumably they will be added in time, and the combat Alpha doesn't really need these menus so it does not significantly detract from the experience as is.
The other issue, that is more fundamental, is that Elite Dangerous is a complex game, skirting the edge of being fully fledged Sim. As such, it requires a lot of different control keys – far too many for a gamepad. If you're playing with a keyboard and mouse, you're going to need to peek out of the bottom of the Rift to check where you're fingers are from time to time, at least until you're well accustomed to the controls. If you really want to get the most out of Elite: Dangerous you may need to invest in a costly flight stick to ensure full immersion and to hope to attain a true sense of presence.
Is the Elite: Dangerous combat build worth £100 on it's own? Well, no, obviously not. While it is a far more polished VR space sim than anything else you'll find right now, it is not without it's share of implementation issues. The limited selection of combat scenarios will not hold your attention for that long, although to be fair, I would have loved to have a longer time with them. it should be noted that backing the game is about more than just getting early access – if you have the disposable income and want to support the creation of Elite, you probably won't regret spending the money. Furthermore, on May 30th the full premium beta will be released for these backers, this will be much closer to the final game; featuring, trading, a whole galaxy to explore and that classic Elite sandbox gameplay loop. Even then, though, you may be better off saving your money at least until you can play the game on your DK2, with it's HD screen, and until further improvements to have been made to VR support and general stability. When the full game is released at a standard price, later this year, there is no doubt that it will immediately become one of the must-have games for Rift owners.

MANILA, Philippines—Call it faint praise, but former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on Friday commended President Benigno Aquino III, their former student in economics at Ateneo de Manila University, over the 6.8-percent growth in the country's gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The country's-full year growth was pegged at 6.6 percent.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It is welcome news,” Arroyo said in a statement issued through their spokesperson Elena Bautista-Horn. “He is on track (to) restoring the growth of 7.9 percent where it was before the first half of 2010,” they added.
Arroyo said they would “support (Mr. Aquino's) policies that (would) translate such policies to poverty alleviation.”
Acerbic paper
The statement was a complete departure from Arroyo's acerbic paper titled “It's the Economy, Student” that they wrote between October and December 2011 while in detention. The paper accused President Aquino of obscuring the economic gains of the Arroyo presidency to allegedly make up for the shortcomings of their own.
“Neither the President nor anyone else can truly expect to govern the next five years with nothing but a sorry mix of vilification, periodically recycled promises of action followed by lethargy, backed up by few, if any, results, and presumptuously encouraging gossip about one's love life in which no one can possibly be interested,” Arroyo wrote in the 19-page paper.
The former President recalled that the country was riding on a 7.9-percent economic growth rate when they stepped down in 2010. But the growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011.
“The momentum inherited by President Aquino was already slowing down, and despite their initial brief honeymoon period, they have simply not replaced my legacy with new ideas and actions of their own,” Arroyo said in their paper.
Different tune
ADVERTISEMENT
But with the economy now enjoying impressive growth, Arroyo seemed to be singing a different tune.
In their statement, Arroyo said they “shares the commitment of President Aquino to integrity and opposition to corruption.”
“But the campaign against corruption must uphold the rule of law, due process and the independence of the judiciary,” they added.
Arroyo's statement said they also “fought corruption through available legal remedies” such as the passage of the Government Procurement Reform Act of 2003, the Attrition Act of 2005, the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007, and the Prosecution Service Act of 2010.
Rule of law
The statement added that Arroyo “followed the rule of law, due process, and the independence of the judiciary by respecting and implementing all court decisions, studiously avoiding any interference or comment on judicial proceedings and rulings.”
Mr. Aquino had been criticized in the past for publicly commenting on the merits of legal cases and ongoing judicial proceedings.
At the height of the impeachment trial of then Chief Justice Renato Corona last year, the President used a college forum to summarize the case against Corona and argue for their conviction.

The University of Louisville placed men's basketball coach Rick Pitino on administrative leave last week over their alleged role in a scheme to funnel $100,000 to the family of a coveted recruit, and while Pitino's contract reportedly affords them a chance to rebut the allegations against him, the school's intention was clear: When asked whether the school was “cleaning house,” interim school president Gregory Postel said “that's effectively what we're doing.”
That housecleaning has begun, and it's shaping up to be quite a mess. On Monday, the University of Louisville Athletic Association board of directors voted unanimously to begin terminating Pitino's contract for cause. Pitino's attorney, meanwhile, served the school with a letter accusing Louisville officials of breach of contract, according to WDRB, maintaining that the school didn't properly notify Pitino and didn't give them a chance to respond to the allegations against them when it placed them on leave.
There are two issues at play here. One is the process by which Louisville placed Pitino on leave with the intention of firing him. WDRB reports that the coach's contract contains a clause that says the school must give Pitino 10 days' written notice of its reasons for firing them or placing them on leave, and that Pitino must be allowed to present evidence in response. The former apparently has happened: Pitino was given a letter telling them that they were being placed on administrative leave with 10 days' pay on Wednesday, the day they were suspended.
The other issue involves how much salary Pitino is or will be owed, and the gulf between the sides is sizable. Postel said Monday the school is responsible only for “10 days additional salary” from the day Pitino was placed on leave, which according to ESPN's Myron Medcalf amounts to $11,800. Postel is clinging to this notion because the allegations made against Pitino “constitute material violations of your employment contract,” according to the letter that was given to them by the school. In other words, Louisville wants to fire Pitino for cause and owe them nothing more than the money it will pay them while on administrative leave.

SHARE COPY LINK After two years undercover, the FBI found members of top NCAA basketball programs involved in corrupt bribery schemes. Here's how those schemes worked.
Pitino's side seems likely to argue otherwise. Because the coach has not been accused of an NCAA violation, their attorneys seem poised to argue that they are owed the entire $44 million remaining on their contract, which was extended through the 2025-26 season in 2015.
According to the contract, the school can fire Pitino without buying out the remaining years on their contract for the following reasons:
▪ “Disparaging media publicity of a material nature that damages the good name and reputation of Employer of the University, if such publicity is caused by Employee's willful misconduct that could objectively be anticipated to bring Employee into public disrepute or scandal, or which tends to greatly offend the public.”
▪ “Major violation of any rule, or bylaw of employer, the athletic conference with which the university is then affiliated or the NCAA …”
▪ “Employee's (a) dishonesty with employer or university, (b) acts of moral depravity, (c) conviction of a felony or employment- or drug-related misdemeanor …”
Whether Pitino's alleged conduct rose to that level — in other words, whether Louisville owes them $11,800 or $44 million — almost certainly will be a matter for the courts to decide.
If there's one thing the last two months has taught, people love farming, tangling with townfolk, and fishing (ok maybe not so much that last part). A lot of them apparently since publisher Chucklefish Games just reportedly confirmed to Polygon in an email that Stardew Valley has sold over one million copies since its launch on February 26.
According to the email, the exact number is "1,007,000." Though the game is PC exclusive right now, creator Eric Barone revealed to us a while back that they wanted Stardew Valley on console as soon as possible.
Be sure to check out our review of the game as well as this handy list of mods.

Our Take
Stardew Valley is probably 2016's most surprising success so far given the sheer amount of enthusiasm it's been met with since release. It's not exactly unwarranted either, given just how unique and fun the game is. Hopefully this will encourage developers to take risks with their projects.
No candidate should get the support of any gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender organization if they have pledged to deny equality to our community. Some gay conservatives seem to think otherwise and they need to hear from us loud and clear: no anti-LGBT candidates allowed!
Three of the four leading Republican candidates have staked out decidedly anti-LGBT positions. Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum have each signed a pledge authored by a certified hate group promising to:
Support an amendment to the US Constitution banning marriage equality for same-sex couples.
Nominate federal judges who oppose equality for LGBT Americans.
Return to defending the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act in court.
Establish a presidential commission to initiate McCarthy-style investigations into the LGBT community with the pretext of protecting "religious liberty".
Meddle with the home rule of District of Columbia residents to attempt to overturn marriage equality in our nation's capitol.
In 2004, Log Cabin Republicans took a principled stand and refused to endorse George W. Bush for their support of a federal marriage amendment alone. These candidates have pledged to go farther than President Bush ever considered. Will Log Cabin Republicans follow its own precedent and refuse to endorse anti-equality politicians?
Recent stories in the media suggest they may actually be willing to overlook the anti-LGBT pledges GOP candidates have taken against our community.
Sign the petition and tell Log Cabin Republicans they should never endorse anti-LGBT candidates who pledge to deny us equality.
Don't forget - once you've signed the pledge to share it on Facebook and encourage your friends and family to sign as well - we have to send a message that anti-LGBT rhetoric is not acceptable on either side of the aisle.

Anzac Day anthems banned by Super Rugby bosses
ESPN Staff
The Brumbies launch their special Anzac Day strip © Twitter Enlarge Article: Greg Martin slams SANZAR decisions
Super Rugby officials have banned national anthems being played before the Anzac Day clash between the Brumbies and New Zealand's Chiefs, saying it would breach the tournament rules.
The Brumbies had asked for the anthems of Australia and New Zealand to be played before the match. The club have been heavily promoting the game and are pressing SANZAR to make an Anzac Day match in Canberra a regular part of the schedule, following a successful tradition established in rugby league.
A SANZAR spokesperson said anthems were reserved for international matches and rules prevented them being played before any Super Rugby games, even finals. Anthems are played in the NRL.
The game will still mark the occasion fittingly. The Last Post will be played and Corporal Mark Donaldson, one of four Victoria Cross recipients attending the Brumbies match, will read The Ode.
"They refused it [the anthems], it's a blanket rule and they said if you do it once you've got to do it for every game," Brumbies chief executive Doug Edwards told the Sydney Morning Herald. "So we move on, it's no big deal for us. I think it will be pretty special with the Last Post and all that we've got planned."
Brumbies and Australian Wallabies scrum-half Nic White said they hoped the anthems could become a feature in the future if the tradition of Anzac Day match continued.
"I'm sure they'd be able to change it if they made it an annual Anzac Day fixture,'' they said. "I'm sure they wouldn't mind turning a blind-eye maybe for one day a year. Maybe if they knew how much it meant to everyone then maybe they might let it happen."

A new book has strongly advocated for the concept of “mostly straight” men.
Ritch Savin-Williams, a developmental psychology professor, writes that “we hear a lot about the Big Three Sexualities – straight, bisexual and gay.
“Most of us assume that these three orientations encompass the universe of sexual identities.
“But there is a new kid on the block: the mostly straight male,” the Cornell University professor states.
Of course, since sexuality is a spectrum, there will be some people who identify nearer one end of the scale than the other.
That's only natural.
Young people are certainly more open, on average, to non-heterosexual identities and sexual fluidity.
Earlier this year, a study showed that 57% of people didn't identify with traditional definitions of heterosexuality – and that 47% preferred not to use any labels.
Research last month also revealed that a person's sexual orientation can fluctuate and change throughout their lifetime.
And that should only be encouraged.
But many people have observed that there may be a pre-existing term for people who are attracted – to whatever degree – to more than one gender.
The label “mostly straight” is fine for individuals, but if it's going to be used as a widespread term, it should be acknowledged that it leaves out – erases, even – a whole other identity.
Bisexuality – that is, being attracted to more than one gender – does not have to be 50-50.
As British activist organisation The Bisexual Index puts it, “You don't have to be equally attracted to redheads and brunettes to be attracted to both”.
“We prefer to think of bisexuality as being like the English Channel,” it explains.
“You get wet as soon as you start swimming from Dover, and can't dry off until Calais, no matter how deep it is beneath you!”
Savin-Williams also writes that “a 2011-2013 US government poll found that among 18- to 24-year-old men, 6% marked their sexual attractions as ‘mostly opposite sex.' That's nearly one million young men.
“Yet when these men were forced to choose between straight, bisexual or gay, about three-quarters marked straight because for them bisexual, even if it is understood as ‘bisexual-leaning straight,' is too gay to accurately describe their identity.”
People showing concern about being seen as “too gay” is, of course, homophobic in itself.
They should also be able to define themselves by whichever sexual identity they want.
But if people don't define as straight, and they don't define as gay – if they're attracted to more than one gender, basically – then for academics to not define them as bi can be damaging.
And that's the point a lot of people have made.
A lot of people.
DICE is "well into development" on next-gen multiplayer shooter Star Wars: Battlefront, EA Games Label president Frank Gibeau has revealed.
Gibeau discussed DICE's progress on the title during EA's FY14 Q1 earnings call earlier this evening, following the game's announcement at E3 last month.
"We showed 22 seconds of where we're going with it and the fan response was very positive," commented Gibeau. "The DICE team is well into development on that product already, so we feel very bullish about our shooter rotation over the next several years."
Star Wars: Battlefront also "has a third-person component to it", Gibeau confirmed, suggesting the game will retain the previous games' option to switch between first and third-person perspectives.
The game is said to be being created by the Battlefield team using the Frostbite 3 engine.
A release date for the title has yet to be announced.

The Rainforest Journal: Outing #17 – Days 4, 5, 6 & 7
(Friday 2-January-2014)
@2:27pm
Is being a couple days since the last journal entry because it's been (a) too hot to give a shit and (b) the same basic things happening during those four days: get up, chug some coffee, go dig a hole to shit in then grab some food and scatter it around for the birds and – later – the Possums. I prefer to write an entry every day but really, it's just for the appeasement of my OCD desire for a nice neat single entry per day. This time I cbf'd.
This afternoon finally brought a storm-front and it's raining right now, awesome. If only these stupid meteorologists could predict the weather with a degree more accuracy than I can by looking at the sky that'd be great.
New years eve was spent with the Possums, but although they got sweet lunch-box fruit twists among other special treats, the lack of any knowledge at all of the new year ticking over on the animals parts and thus complete lack of occasion of ceremony was a little depressing.
Since the last update of course, Guido and Bobby have been kicking each others arses all around the tent most nights, even though there's plenty of food for the both of them. But to be fair, I've heard other Possums snarling, hissing and grunting as they fight a good hundred meters away from the camp so I think they'd do it regardless who was here. I never see any marks on any of the four who eat around the camp here, but they certainly make a very noisy show of it – when they do fight.
Makes me wonder just how many Possums are around here. I can identify at least four, but I reckon there are heaps more. I think the ones I get at the tent are the more territorial/dominant, with the ‘weaker' Possums not daring to come near the tent for fear of Guido and Bobby beating shit out of them, or fear of myself – the strange smooth-skin creature in the bubble. Not all Possums are as forward or trusting, I mean.
Either way, the number of Possums I've heard recently indicates the population is larger than I thought, and it's not like I'm just hearing my regular visiting Possums further away, 'cause when I hear the distant grunting and fighting, Bobby, Guido and the Mum/Daughter are right here where I can see them.
Old Guido had the upper-hand over Bobby to begin with but in the past few nights I've seen Bobby kick Guidos arse on more than one occasion so I can't really say which Possum has won the war; just give a battle-by-battle account.
Incidentally, Guido prefers banana over dried cranberries, while Bobby prefers cranberries even more than fresh fruit and all Possums like crackers, bread, milk arrowroot and gingerbread, equally. They're not too keen on fresh tomato and not a single Possum shows any interest in died mango slices. Even *I* like the mango slices and I'm no Fruitarian by any stretch.
Junior made a cameo appearance the other day – briefly – stomping past the tent on their way… wherever they were going. I flat-out had no food that would interest them so didn't bother calling them over. A rustle of a plastic bag on the ground is all it takes when I *do* have food for the Monitors, but I didn't so whatever.
The parent Currawong has visited most days as usual but there's also a female Bower been coming each day lately. Bower-birds are closely related to the birds of paradise and I uploaded a photo of a male birds “Bower” a few weeks ago. The Bower itself isn't used to raise chicks of course, is just the males fuck-pad; like a drive-thru fertilization service the female spots the blue pegs, straws, bottle-tops etc, and lands there. The male then offers their gifts of the asupervisorstioned items by tossing them at her, then gives them a good shagging.
Afterwards, the female goes off and lays their eggs in their nest then rears the chicks on their own; the male doesn't give two shits, their involvement begins and ends with the shagging.
Today was water day, and having been coated in gossamer from the usual hundred spider webs I have to walk through to get to the trail – and thereby, the water – I spent around three hours there before the sky started accumulating clouds and thunder sealed the deal, whence upon I got my arse back to the camp lest my phone suffer the ruination of wetness.
While I was there I spotted a tiny yabby under a rock and although I was very tempted to grab them and pull them out for a photo, I controlled the urge and left them there in peace.
What I wouldn't give for a pair of scissors or a shaver right now. Being inherently lazy, I didn't get around to shaving while I was in town last and as a result I got this cave-man fuckin growth happening. I don't mind having facial hair accumulate in the colder months but it's too hot for a beard and the bits on my top lip have started curling into my mouth, which is my biggest annoyance with it. All I need's a mullet and a wife-basher singlet to let my inner bogon out. ‘STRAAAAYYYAAAA!!!
That'll do for now, I'm bored writing and I have a pasta-dinner to cook for the Possums. I have a heat-and-eat sachet of some kind of Curry-muncher shit, but I'm not sure I want to eat that. The rice would take ages – on top of the pasta for the Possums – and I can't even pronounce the name of the dish that's written on the pack. If I can't even say what it is I'm planning to eat then not eating it might be the more solid option. Teach me to take random food tourists leave behind.
Still I hear thunder, and the sky is full of clouds but sadly, for now, the rain has stopped. For dinner tonight I've opted not to share the Marsupials pasta – though I had a taste and it's pretty good – but have a wrap with the last fresh tomato, parmesan, wholegrain mustard and Nandos spicy mayonnaise.
The Possums dinner is done, with four seperate places set far enough – again – that nobody has to get their skank on or lose their shit at anybody else.
Jason I don't condense into a paragraph.
The Rainforest Journal: Outing #17 – Day 3 Dog's paw
Adam Casey doesn't want to be included in any racist narratives about the part they played in rescuing a fellow University of B.C. student from a violent attack this week.
Casey, a first-year engineering student, made headlines for their bravery in helping end the assault on a young woman inside a Totem Park dorm room on Tuesday.
The suspect in the attack is 18-year-old Thamer Almestadi, an international student from Saudi Arabia, and in certain corners of the Internet their name and background have prompted virulent Islamophobic comments.
One website known for its anti-Muslim views posted a story about Casey's actions with the headline “Saudi international student tries to MURDER girl with knife, gets put in chokehold by heroic Canadian boy.”

But Casey isn't interested in being called a hero by people with that mindset.
“I think that some people are bigoted, they're xenophobic, they're racist and this is just going to feed their bias,” they said. “We had one quite violent incident … and they're going to ignore the fact that we have tens of thousands of students here from across the world and everyone gets along just fine.”
Casey said they were picking up their mail in the Totem Park common area on Tuesday when two female students ran in, shouting that someone was being choked in another building. They ran to the scene and found a man holding a woman on the floor from behind with their hands around their neck.
Casey said they used their jiu-jitsu and judo training to place the man in a chokehold — but the suspect's response was surprising.
“One-hundred-per-cent of people I've ever met, if they get put in a chokehold they put their hands on their neck and they defend themselves,” Casey said. “He didn't care at all. They just kept holding on to her.”
Casey said they managed to pry one of the suspect's hands from the woman's neck and continued holding them until their friend Luca Berg managed to drag the victim away with the help of other students. With the woman gone from the room, all the fight went out of the attacker, they said.
“He didn't fight back to me, they didn't try to leave the room, they didn't try to run, they didn't fight the police at all,” Casey said.
Two days later, the assault seems like a dream to Casey. In their martial arts classes, they had learned a lot about self-defence, but he'd never practised a scenario like this. Still, they don't remember feeling scared.
“I'm not saying that to sound brave. I'm saying there was enough adrenalin and I'd trained enough that the instincts just kicked in and I just went for it,” they said.
UBC president Santa Ono has applauded the actions of the students who responded to the attack, writing that they were proud of the university's community.
Meanwhile, Casey feels he's received too much attention for their role in the incident, while the bravery of other students has been largely ignored.
“There were two dozen people there, calling 911, doing first aid, pulling this girl away from the attacker,” they said. “If Luca and I had been the only ones there, it would have been a very different day.”
No information has been released about the relationship between the suspect and the victim, who is recovering from non-life threatening injuries.
Almestadi has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in connection with the attack, and is scheduled to appear in court next week.

Amsterdam beer bike owners came up with a way to save their businesses in the current beer bike-unfriendly climate in the city - they will be turning their beer bikes into eight-person coffee bikes, Het Parool reports.
Ard Karstens of Damtours came up with this idea together with operator Borisbus. According to him, the eight-person bike has everything it needs to be a problem-free operation. No alcohol will be served, leading to fewer disturbances. And instead of up to 15 people, the new bike will only accommodate eight people plus a driver - a perfect number. "That number does not differ from other group activities in the city and is also in line with indications the city council previously brought out."
With this Karstens and their colleagues are reacting to a beer bike ban in the city center. The ban was approved by the city council earlier this year.
Walnuts contain a number of potentially neuroprotective compounds like vitamin E, folate, melatonin, several antioxidative polyphenols and significant amounts of n-3 α-linolenic fatty acid. The present study sought to determine the effect of walnuts on verbal and non-verbal reasoning, memory and mood. A total of sixty-four college students were randomly assigned to two treatment sequences in a crossover fashion: walnuts-placebo or placebo-walnuts. Baseline data were collected for non-verbal reasoning, verbal reasoning, memory and mood states. Data were collected again after 8 weeks of intervention. After 6 weeks of washout, the intervention groups followed the diets in reverse order. Data were collected once more at the end of the 8-week intervention period. No significant increases were detected for mood, non-verbal reasoning or memory on the walnut-supplemented diet. However, inferential verbal reasoning increased significantly by 11.2 %, indicating a medium effect size (P = 0.009; d = 0.567). In young, healthy, normal adults, walnuts do not appear to improve memory, mood or non-verbal reasoning abilities. However, walnuts may have the ability to increase inferential reasoning.

Pras Michel, the rapper who ­co-founded The Fugees, was a ­no-show as the headliner for a 9/11 charity event in Hell's Kitchen to benefit their own foundation.
Their Hope for Them foundation also bounced a check to the venue, falsely claimed MTV sponsored the fund-raiser and failed to register the charity with state officials.
The group claims to minister to the poor in Haiti but distanced itself in promotional material from the country for fear potential donors would confuse it with the disgraced charity run by their cousin, ex-Fugees frontman Wyclef Jean, said a Hope for Them insider.
Jean's Yele Haiti charity was shut after alleged mismanagement. It is under investigation by the state.
“Their whole basis is, ‘Don't let anyone know that we're from Haiti,' ” the insider said.
Hope for Them was founded in 2011 by Haiti native Mike Jean, a record producer and songwriter.
Michel was listed as a board member on the group's Web site early last week. By Friday, their name had disappeared, and Mike Jean told The Post the Grammy winner wasn't a board member.
The event, at Stage 48 in Hell's Kitchen last Sept. 11, was billed as “Fashion for Charity” to help New Yorkers. Tickets ranged from $40 to $2,000. In addition to a fashion show, Michel was to perform.
The well-established New York Cares charity was also brought in as a sponsor, the insider said.
MTV's logo was prominently featured on promo material. But the insider and MTV told The Post the network was never a sponsor.
The only connection was event hostess Lenay Dunn, a former host of the MTV show “10 on Top.”
Organizers said Saturday that the event pulled in $6,000 but $5,600 went to expenses, with $1,100 for Stage 48 and $500 for NY Cares.
Hope for Them owed the venue $1,100 after patrons failed to cover a promised bar minimum, the source said. It bounced a check to the venue, which threatened legal action, according to e-mails from a Stage 48 staffer to Hope for Them.
Mike Jean told The Post the bill was paid late last week. Stage 48 refused to comment, but an e-mail indicated the tab had not been paid as of Friday afternoon.
They said Michel couldn't perform because they had the flu. Mike Jean said NY Cares would be paid.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that “Michel said NY Cares would be paid.” That statement was made by Mike Jean, not Pras Michel.
The big money, by now, has largely been spent on the 2017 free-agent market. If you see significant multiyear deals popping up in the coming months, chances are they are going to players still under contract to prevent them from testing free agency in 2018 or 2019.
How can we assess the impact of the 2017 class? One way is to look at how the contracts ranked among the most lucrative at each position. What follows is an attempt to do just that, using average per year (APY) as the benchmark while also including money that is guaranteed for injury, skill or both.
Quarterback
1. Andrew Luck, Colts ($24.594M APY, $87M guaranteed)
2. Drew Brees, Saints ($24.250M APY, $44M guaranteed)
3. Kirk Cousins, Redskins ($23.944M APY/guaranteed)
4. Joe Flacco, Ravens ($22.133M APY, $62M guaranteed)
5. Aaron Rodgers, Packers ($22M APY, $54M guaranteed)
6. Russell Wilson, Seahawks ($21.9M APY, $61.542M guaranteed)
7. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers ($21.850M APY, $64M guaranteed)
8. Eli Manning, Giants ($21M APY, $65M guaranteed)
9. Philip Rivers, Chargers ($20.813M APY, $65M guaranteed)
10. Cam Newton, Panthers ($20.76M APY, $60M guaranteed)
Someone missing? Yup. Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady's perennially team-friendly contract ranks No. 22 on this list. Their current deal with the Patriots, which expires in 2019, included $30 million in guarantees and averages $15 million per year in this reckoning. The other missing name here is the Falcons' Matt Ryan, whose APY ($20.75M) falls just $10,000 short of Newton's. One player to keep an eye on is the Lions' Matthew Stafford, who is in position for a contract extension that should put them in the mix for this list. It also will be interesting to see when the Packers approach Rodgers about their deal, which has three more years on it. Cousins is on the franchise tag and, barring a major regression this season, it will keep them on this list whenever they sign a longer-term deal.
Running backs
1. Le'Veon Bell, Steelers ($12.083M APY/guaranteed)
2. LeSean McCoy, Bills ($8.01M APY, $26.55M guaranteed)
3. Jonathan Stewart, Panthers ($7.3M APY, $23M guaranteed)
4. Doug Martin, Buccaneers ($7.15M APY, $15M guaranteed)
5. Lamar Miller, Texans ($6.5M APY, $14M guaranteed)
6. Chris Ivory, Jaguars ($6.4M APY, $10M guaranteed)
7. DeMarco Murray, Titans ($6.375M APY, $15.25M guaranteed)
8. Ezekiel Elliott, Cowboys ($6.239M APY, $24.956M guaranteed)
9. Kyle Juszczyk, 49ers ($5.25M APY, $9.75M guaranteed)
10. Giovani Bernard, Bengals ($5.167M APY, $5M guaranteed)
This list provides a visual look at what we already knew: The 2017 class of running backs didn't cash in. Bell received the franchise tag, but the only other recent deal was for Juszczyk -- a fullback whom the 49ers say they will use as an "offensive weapon." McCoy's deal, renegotiated in 2015, is increasingly an outlier. Stewart's contract, meanwhile, was agreed upon five years ago. Elliott's high guarantee was a function of their draft slot as the No. 4 overall pick in 2016.
Wide receivers
1. Antonio Brown, Steelers ($17M APY, $19M guaranteed)
2. A.J. Green, Bengals ($15M APY, $15M guaranteed)
3. Julio Jones, Falcons ($14.25M APY, $47M guaranteed)
4. Demaryius Thomas, Broncos ($14M APY, $43.5M guaranteed)
5. Dez Bryant, Cowboys ($14M APY, $45M guaranteed)
6. T.Y. Hilton, Colts ($13M APY, $39M guaranteed)
7. Doug Baldwin, Seahawks ($11.5M APY, $24.25M guaranteed)
8. Keenan Allen, Chargers ($11.25M APY, $24.156M guaranteed)
9. DeSean Jackson, Buccaneers ($11.167M APY, $20M guaranteed)
10. Emmanuel Sanders, Broncos ($11M APY, $26.9M guaranteed)
Brown set the market by re-signing with the Steelers, but the only free agent to sign a top-10 deal with a new team was Jackson. That's a rarity for a player of Jackson's age -- they will turn 31 during the 2017 season -- but NFL player tracking last season revealed they haven't lost much, if any, of their high-end speed. The next-highest paid free agent to change teams was Alshon Jeffery, whose one-year deal with the Eagles is worth $9.5 million for this season (ranking them at No. 17 overall).

Tight ends
1. Jimmy Graham, Seahawks ($10M APY, $20.9M guaranteed)
2. Travis Kelce, Chiefs ($9.368M APY, $20.017M guaranteed)
3. Jordan Reed, Redskins ($9.350M APY, $22M guaranteed)
4. Rob Gronkowski, Patriots ($9M APY, $17.92M guaranteed)
5. Zach Ertz, Eagles ($8.5M APY, $21M guaranteed)
6. Charles Clay, Bills ($7.6M APY, $24.5M guaranteed)
7. Greg Olsen, Panthers ($7.5M APY, $12M guaranteed)
8. Jason Witten, Cowboys ($7.4M APY, $19M guaranteed)
9. Dwayne Allen, Patriots ($7.35M APY, $16M guaranteed)
10. Coby Fleener, Saints ($7.2M APY, $18M guaranteed)
The Patriots acquired Allen via trade from the Colts and now have two of the NFL's highest-paid tight ends. Otherwise, the big takeaway is that none of the free agents who changed teams this spring -- and there were many -- cracked this top 10. That list includes Martellus Bennett (Packers), Jared Cook (Raiders), Dion Sims (Bears) and Rhett Ellison (Giants).
Guards
1. Kevin Zeitler, Browns ($12M APY, $31.5 guaranteed)
2. Kelechi Osemele, Raiders ($11.7M APY, $25.4M guaranteed)
3. Kyle Long, Bears ($10M APY, $30M guaranteed)
4. David DeCastro, Steelers ($10M APY, $16M guaranteed)
5. T.J. Lang, Lions ($9.5M APY, $19M guaranteed)
The market for guards, long considered a secondary position, has exploded in recent years. Two players, Zeitler and Lang, jumped into the top five this year after Osemele set the bar in 2016. Two other free agents, Ronald Leary (Broncos) and Larry Warford (Saints), cracked the top 10. So did Joel Bitonio (Browns) and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif (Chiefs), who both signed extensions to existing deals.
Centers
1. Travis Frederick, Cowboys ($9.4M APY, $28.162M guaranteed)
2. Alex Mack, Falcons ($9M APY, $28.5M guaranteed)
3. Mike Pouncey, Dolphins ($8.95M APY, $22M guaranteed)
4. Rodney Hudson, Raiders ($8.9M APY, $20M guaranteed)
5. Maurkice Pouncey, Steelers ($8.827M APY, $13M guaranteed)
No one from the 2017 class came close to the top of the market. The closest was JC Tretter, whose APY of $5.583 million ranks No. 10 among NFL centers. Generally speaking, teams work hard to keep their starting centers because it is such an important leadership position.
The Chargers brought in left tackle Russell Okung to protect Philip Rivers' blind side. Isaiah J. Downing/USA TODAY Sports
Offensive tackles
1. Russell Okung, Chargers ($13.25M APY, $25M guaranteed)
2. Trent Williams, Redskins ($13.2M APY, $41.25M guaranteed)
3. Terron Armstead, Saints ($13M APY, $38M guaranteed)
4. Tyron Smith, Cowboys ($12.2M APY, $21.118M guaranteed)
5. Eric Fisher, Chiefs ($12M APY, $40M guaranteed)
6. David Bakhtiari, Packers ($12M APY, $16M guaranteed)
7. Riley Reiff, Vikings ($11.75M APY, $26.3M guaranteed)
8. Cordy Glenn, Bills ($11.573M APY, $36M guaranteed)
9. Joe Thomas, Browns ($11.5M APY, $29.5M guaranteed)
10. Andrew Whitworth, Rams ($11.25M APY, $15M guaranteed)
Left tackles were the biggest winners in the 2017 market, with Okung, Reiff and Whitworth all securing top-10 deals. The Panthers' Matt Kalil was not far behind. The Lions, meanwhile, made Rick Wagner one of the highest-paid right tackles with a deal that averages $9.5 million per year. When you consider the left tackle and guard markets together, you realize how motivated some teams were to upgrade their offensive lines. Concerns about the transition from college offenses, as well as the depth of the 2017 draft class, were contributing factors.
Defensive tackles
1. Ndamukong Suh, Dolphins ($19.063M APY, $59.955M guaranteed)
2. Fletcher Cox, Eagles ($17.1M APY, $63.299M guaranteed)
3. Marcell Dareus, Bills ($15.850M APY, $60M guaranteed)
4. Malik Jackson, Jaguars ($14.35M APY, $14.35M guaranteed)
5. Gerald McCoy, Buccaneers ($13.6M APY, $51.5M guaranteed)
The top of the 2017 class largely stayed home, without cracking the top five of this sub-group. Kawann Short signed their franchise tag with the Panthers. Brandon Williams received an APY of $10.5 million and guarantees of $27.5 million to return to the Ravens.
Defensive ends
1. Muhammad Wilkerson, Jets ($17.2M APY, $53.5M guaranteed)
2. Olivier Vernon, Giants ($17M APY, $52.5M guaranteed)
3. J.J. Watt, Texans ($16.667M APY, $51.976M guaranteed)
4. Jason Pierre-Paul, Giants ($15.5M APY, $60M guaranteed)
5. Calais Campbell, Jaguars ($15M APY, $30M guaranteed)
This list includes both 3-4 and 4-3 defensive ends. Campbell, 30, received a pretty extraordinary deal for a player their age even if the guarantees were lower than some others in this group. The Giants' commitment to edge pass rushing, meanwhile, is pretty clear based on this list. Pierre-Paul's numbers are approximate given their recent agreement. Pierre-Paul was never available on the market after receiving the franchise tag and, in truth, the NFL's best pass-rushers rarely reach free agency.

Linebackers
1. Von Miller, Broncos ($19.083M APY, $70M guaranteed)
2. Justin Houston, Chiefs ($16.833M APY, $52.5M guaranteed)
3. Chandler Jones, Cardinals ($16.5M APY, $53M guaranteed)
4. Melvin Ingram, Chargers ($14.55M APY/guaranteed)
5. Clay Matthews, Packers ($13.2M APY, $20.5M guaranteed)
6. Jamie Collins, Browns ($12.5M APY, $26.4M guaranteed)
7. Luke Kuechly, Panthers ($12.359M APY, $34.363M guaranteed)
8. Nick Perry, Packers ($12M APY, $18.5M guaranteed)
9. Ryan Kerrigan, Redskins ($11.5M APY, $23.788M guaranteed)
10. NaVorro Bowman, 49ers ($11M APY, $15.3M guaranteed)
Most of this list is composed of 3-4 outside linebackers, who are pass-rushers and thus the most valuable. Again, elite players in that role rarely are exposed to the open market. Jones, for example, was traded from the Patriots to the Cardinals and then given the franchise tag before they agreed to term. Collins' recent deal stands as a bit of an outlier given their production relative to this list, but the Browns have had to pay above market at several positions to retain or acquire talent. Dont'a Hightower was the best player at this position to hit free agency, and they wound up returning to the Patriots at an APY of $8.875 million.
Cornerbacks
1. Trumaine Johnson, Rams ($16.742M APY/guaranteed)
2. Josh Norman, Redskins ($15M APY, $50M guaranteed)
3. Patrick Peterson, Cardinals ($14.01M APY, $48M guaranteed)
4. Richard Sherman, Seahawks ($14M APY, $40M guaranteed)
5. Joe Haden, Browns ($13.5M APY, $45.078M guaranteed)
6. A.J. Bouye, Jaguars ($13.5M APY, $26M guaranteed)
7. Stephon Gilmore, Patriots ($13M APY, $40M guaranteed)
8. Janoris Jenkins, Giants ($12.5M APY, $28.8M guaranteed)
9. Darius Slay, Lions ($12M APY, $23.1M guaranteed)
10. Dre Kirkpatrick, Bengals ($10.5M APY, $12M guaranteed)
Whether or not it is true, NFL teams generally operate as if there is a massive shortage of cornerbacks. Big money goes to above-average players. Johnson's status as a consecutive franchise player is one example. So is the deal that the Jaguars gave Bouye, who is a promising player but didn't become a regular starter until 2016. It didn't make this list, but the deal that brought Logan Ryan to the Titans -- $10M APY, $16M guarantees -- was also strong.
Safeties
1. Eric Berry, Chiefs ($13M APY, $40M guaranteed)
2. Tyrann Mathieu, Cardinals ($12.5M APY, $35M guaranteed)
3. Reshad Jones, Dolphins ($12M APY, $33M guaranteed)
4. Harrison Smith, Vikings ($10.25M APY, $28.578M guaranteed)
5. Earl Thomas, Seahawks ($10M APY, $25.725M guaranteed)
6. Devin McCourty, Patriots ($9.5M APY, $28.5M guaranteed)
7. Malcolm Jenkins, Eagles ($8.75M APY, $21M guaranteed)
8. Tony Jefferson, Ravens ($8.5M APY, $19M guaranteed)
9. Tashaun Gipson, Jaguars ($7.2M APY, $12M guaranteed)
10. Kam Chancellor, Seahawks ($7M APY, $17M guaranteed)
Jefferson, the top safety to hit the market, got a deal that cracked the top 10 from the Ravens. But it didn't come close to what the Chiefs gave Berry, who spent last season under the franchise tag but vowed not to do it again. (Johnathan Cyprien got $6.25M in APY and $9 million to move from the Jaguars to the Titans.) Meanwhile, the Dolphins re-signed Jones a year before they would have been in position to replace Berry atop this list.

1. Stephen Gostkowski, Patriots ($4.187M APY, $10.1M guaranteed)
2. Justin Tucker, Ravens ($4.076M APY, $10.8M guaranteed)
3. Mason Crosby, Packers ($4.025M APY, $5M guaranteed)
4. Sebastian Janikowski, Raiders ($3.775M APY, $8M guaranteed)
5. Dustin Colquitt, Chiefs ($3.75M APY, $4.95M guaranteed)
Kickers are paid better than punters in the NFL. The best free-agent contract of this offseason has been the deal Steven Hauschka received from the Bills. Hauschka received $4 million guaranteed and an average of $2.95 million per year, ranking them 10th among kickers at the moment.
A woman's body was found inside a lift in China a month after it was improperly switched off, a regional government statement said.
Them body was found in a residential building in the central city of Xian.
The lift had been turned off by two maintenance workers on 30 January. The body was found when other workers arrived on 1 March.
Police are treating the death as involuntary manslaughter. Several people have been arrested.
Xian lift death: 'Why did no-one miss her?'
One local report said scratches were found inside the lift, one of two inside the building.
It is believed the woman was 43 years old and lived by themselves in the building, the statement by Gaoling's government said. Them family did not visit them often, it said.
The workers had been called to fix a fault with the elevator and had shouted to see if anyone was inside.
Their failure to check properly amounted to "gross negligence", government officials said.
The work on the broken lift was delayed partly because of the new year holidays.

Tim Kaine said they don't feel bad for their counterpart on the Republican ticket for having to defend Donald Trump constantly. Kaine doesn't feel bad for Pence
Tim Kaine doesn't feel much pressure when it comes to the day-to-day routine of defending and explaining the platform and background of running mate Hillary Clinton to voters, the Virginia senator said in an interview airing Wednesday on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
"Obviously because you're the nominee for vice president you have to defend Hillary because that's your job," DeGeneres remarked to Kaine during the friendly interview, to which Kaine affirmed, "Absolutely."
Story Continued Below
DeGeneres then asked, "Do you feel bad for Mike Pence that they have to defend … he's got to be constantly like, 'oh, no what do I say now.' 'What did [Donald Trump] say now?'" as Kaine and members of the audience laughed.
"It is part of the role," Kaine said, declining to specifically mention Pence or their defense of Donald Trump. "I don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work I have to do to tell people Hillary's story," Kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as Midwesterners who "both grew up in Republican families ... in small business families" and "in religious households."
Kaine added, "I kind of know the vibe. I know that for example, for them it's not easy for them to talk about herself, that's just not the way we were raised, but it's easier for me to talk about them so that's something I like to do is to tell stories about things she's done that really show who they are as a person and the kind of president she'll be."
So today, February 25th, myself and my good friend Eddy went down to Warhammer Leicester for an Age of Sigmar doubles tournament. Now, my memory isn't great so forgive me if this is a slightly rough account of proceedings, but I hope you enjoy reading about the event.
The rules were fairly simple to keep it straightforward. Each player was allowed a 550 point army containing 1 Leader, 1+ Battleline, 0-1 Artillery, 0-1 Behemoth, and 0-1 Other unit. Allegiance abilities would not be used for these games. Each game would take place on a 4×4 table with missions from the General's Handbook. And so it was that our armies looked like this:
JESSICA: 1 Lord Relictor, 5 Liberators with Paired Warblades + Grandblade, 5 Judicators with Skybolt Bows + Shockbolt Bow, 5 Protectors with 2 Starsoul Maces.
EDDY: 1 Knight-Questor, 3x 5 Liberators with Shields and Warhammer, 3 Prosecutors.
The plan, if it could be called such, was for my Lord Relictor to hide from shooting attacks behind the Protectors whilst healing said unit and taking potshots with lightning at enemy units. My sword Libs and Judicators would hold ‘home' objectives, preferably from cover. Eddy's units were to push forward as a moving shield wall, with the Knight-Questor taking on any heroes who strayed too close and the Prosecutors to fly around and harass any weak spots in the army or grab unclaimed objectives. Would it work? Well, maybe. Let's see.
GAME ONE
So game one was the Gifts From the Heavens battleplan, against a combined force of Seraphon and Stormcast Eternals. I was fairly confident at the start of this match, even though the opponent's team each had a roll on the Triumph table for being at 40 points less than ourselves.
We had a fairly strong hold on our own objective, so I intended to push my Protectors, some Liberators and the Lord Relictor forward towards the large unit of Saurus Warriors pictured above. The Gifts in turn two came down right next to that unit of Saurus on the opponents turn, and our own came down next to Eddy's Liberators, but also right next to a Realmgate. We came unstuck as a unit of Decimators surged through the Realmgate to assault the liberators holding our objective. They didn't actually kill much, but did manage to push forward enough to contest the objective. Meanwhile I tried to get to the objective behind the Saurus Warriors, but my Protectors died in a single round of combat before hitting once, as the Triumph effects and other skills meant the Saurus Warriors were re-rolling both Hit and Wound rolls. I simply couldn't hold up to that many attacks with a 4+ save roll.
Thus, with no way to contest the enemy objective and our own objective assaulted by Decimators, we lost the game.
GAME TWO
Game two was Escalation, against a combined Ironjawz army with two Warbosses on foot, two units of Brutes, a unit of Gore Gruntas and a unit of ‘Ardboyz. This mission would be tough, especially with the Gore Guntas getting into my Judicators far too quickly. For a fun narrative, we observed a lot of woods and ‘spooky' scenery so we all agreed for narrative purposes to call all the terrain Sinister.
We took a bit of a toll from each of the units of Brutes, and the ‘Ardboyz, and managed to kill the Gore Gruntas after piling in with two units of Liberators as the Judicators and Gore Gruntas both fell to battleshock at the end of a turn.
Luckily for us, the opponents left their Warbosses til the third turn to turn up due to the Escalation plan. Interestingly this resulted in them both not getting into combat at all, which allowed us to hold onto objectives just enough to call the game a draw. However, because the Ironjawz had killed more of our units, they won a victory based on kill points from the scenario putting us at two losses.
GAME THREE
This battle was against a force of Skaven Pestilens and Slaves to Darkness with the Nurgle keyword. This was the Take and Hold scenario with one objective in each player's zone 9″ from the table edges – to win a major victory a team had to control both objectives at the same time.
In this game we decided to just go for it and push forward, if we wanted that enemy objective we needed to push forward as much stuff as we can. So, being aware that the Skaven and Chaos force only had one shooting unit – one of the Skaven constructs – we pushed forward with Liberators and Protectors, with the Prosecutors and Knight-Questor jumping through a Realmgate right into the heart of enemy territory.
The enemy reacted fairly quickly, but were unable to kill the Knight-Questor or finish off the Prosecutor unit as they harassed the enemy and drew the Chaos Knights away from our side to protect their own units. WIth no Chaos units able to push into our own side, and with time running tight for the event, we attempted to push all our units forwards to clear out the units of Plague Monks and Chaos Warriors holding the objective leaving five Liberators to hold our own objective safely.
Had we had time for turn 5, I am sure we'd have been able to push through and claim both objectives. Sadly though, with the clock ticking we just about scraped to the end of turn four with no clear victor. However, again it came down to kill points for this scenario, in which we took the victory for slaying a good number of the Skaven and Chaos forces including the full unit of Chaos Knights.
END GAME
So in the end, we had a single win. But a great day was had, and I take a small moral victory in that our team was the only one with fully painted armies. The overall winners were the team we played last with the Chaos/Skaven army, partly due to the “favourite opponents” vote. Also we had doughnuts. That's worthy of note, even though I only had one of the mini doughnuts because I'm watching my calories!!
I had a brilliant time and can't wait to play even more AoS!

Hello, my name is Laurie. I have been married to my husband for 13 years. We have two young daughters, ages 9 and 12 years old. My family and I live in Oregon so that means we are just minutes from the beach, mountains, and desert. We love it here and try to spend as much time outdoors playing as we can. When we aren't outside playing, I enjoy reading, baking, refinishing furniture, and other crafts. http://www.emilyreviews.com/category/laurie

That Kristen Stewart shows up in the darndest places, be it the red carpet in Cannes, a health food store in Los Feliz or occasionally a particularly terrible vampire movie. This past weekend, they reached new levels of ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ by turning up at the Canadian wedding of a couple of women she'd never met before..
Kirsten and Kayleigh Jennings celebrated their wedding Saturday in a backyard in the River Heights area of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The pair met in 2010 when they were both bartending in the Cayman Islands, and have been together ever since. They moved back to Winnipeg (Kirsten is originally from there; Kayleigh is from Oklahoma) in 2012, as the US government did not federally recognize same-sex marriage at the time. They had a small ceremony in a backyard with about 90 guests, and then had a Dixie-land style band lead their friends and family to a reception at Pizzeria Gusto. As luck would have it, the lesbian wedding gods were smiling fondly upon Pizzeria Gusto that day, as they restaurant had been recently utilized to cater an event for JT LeRoy, a movie about the elusive/nonexistent author, currently filming in Winnipeg and starring the one and only Kristen Stewart.
Around 10 PM, the couple were approached with an intriguing proposition. “The owner came up to me, and they said, ‘Hey, is it OK if Kristen Stewart and their girlfriend Stella [Maxwell] come and have a few drinks with you guys?'” explains Kristen Jennings. “…I was like, ‘Yeah, totally! Yeah, no problem. Um, who is that?'”
Kayleigh continues, “I told Kir, ‘Hey, let's just treat them as random guests. Let's just treat them with kindness — southern hospitality. Winnipeg hospitality.'” Stewart and Maxwell arrived half an hour later.
Dj'ed the MOST fun wedding for these incredible woman last night and had an unplanned guest show up to dance with us at the end of the night! Apparently Kristen Stewart loves Beastie boys ! #djkchedda #kirandkay A post shared by Karli Elizabeth Colpitts (@colpitts) on Jul 23, 2017 at 10:06am PDT
While the couple admitted it was a little awkward having complete strangers crash their wedding party, Stewart and Maxwell were polite and fun and didn't make a spectacle of themselves. They reportedly hung around for about three hours, danced, drank and even requested songs. “We got to be formally introduced before they came in and partied with us. We got a chance to shake their hand and shake Stella's hand,” Kayleigh offered. “I actually wasn't as star-struck as I thought I would be.”
“They looked just like two normal girls,” Kirsten explained. “They look a little Hollywood, but if we didn't know who they were, I don't know if I would have known. We said ‘Hey, you know. Come on and meet your guests and, you know, don't segregate yourselves. Come and party… There were only a few people who were star-struck. My Aunt Linda was extremely excited.” Aunt Linda is not alone in this sentiment.
JT LeRoy will tell the story of Savannah Knoop, a woman who pretended to be the infamous but ultimately imaginary author JT LeRoy for six years. Laura Dern will play Laura Albert, the actual author of all of LeRoy's books. Aunt Linda is extremely excited.
Having 50+ people play scraps over the weekend showed up a few issues. The latest builder release (0.2.5) tries to address these. I also silently put up a 0.2.4 release about a week ago which contained some other fixes.
The things I noticed were:
1. A lot of people try to click and drag parts while holding the mouse button instead of clicking and then dragging. I knew this happened but I didn't realise that so many people would try it this way first – probably a third. It was a bit ugly because not only did it not pick up the part but it dragged the tooltip along which is a bit confusing.
So ideally I'd allow either method, but that'd take a few code changes and be slightly hacky since the GUI normally only detects button up events rather than button down. I've fixed the tooltip issue so at least it's more obvious that your drag didn't work. I've also pushed the tooltip updates to my Asset Store tooltips so now you can auto-hide tooltips based on distance moved.
2. The random freezing of physics happens quite a lot. Another one that was known but I didn't realise how often it happened. Sometimes the physics froze on the build screen for no good reason, with Freeze Physics still unticked. I never found a reliable way to reproduce this but it's probably fixed now. I found some dodgy code that was most likely causing it and fixed it up.
3. On two occasions someone placed a weapon and it'd spin around forever, including into areas it shouldn't be able to move. This turned out to only happen when a weapon's min horizontal angle was reduced to exactly 0 degrees. In the code it'd come out as 360, which of course is technically correct but since it's represented internally as 0, the weapon would never quite get there causing it to spin around forever.
Altogether, the changes since the last posted update are:
2013-10 – 0.2.5
– Just a few minor tweaks to things
Bug Fixes:
– [Build screen] Hopefully fixed the occasional random freezing of physics
– [Build screen] Stopped tooltips staying up when people drag things instead of clicking them
– Fixed some more weapon available range calc stuff
– [Game] Ever had a weapon just kinda randomly spin around instead of aiming where it should? Fixed that too
2013-09 – 0.2.4
– Fixed up 3D sound settings
Bug Fixes:
– [Build screen] Fixed hovering over weapons affecting the results of the cockpit visibility test
– Reinstated the two mysteriously missing snap points on large engine
– [Build screen]Fixed build screen lighting
– [Game] Fixed the small blip of audio that happened when pausing, minimising and then restoring
– [Build screen] Fixed weapon range display showing up through other parts (the code for this was really dumb – what was I thinking?)
– Improved weapon range calculations so weapons shouldn't slightly clip through stuff any more (maybe)
The person who makes the final decision on grant funding at the US Environmental Protection Agency agency is a political operative who doesn't want to see “the double C-word”—climate change—in grant applications, according to EPA staff who spoke with the Washington Post.
John Konkus is former aide to then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Now, their official role is in the EPA's public affairs office, where they review each grant the EPA gives out, despite little environmental policy background. According to the Post, EPA staffers say that Konkus “repeatedly has instructed grant officers to eliminate references to the [climate change] in solicitations.”
Former EPA officials who served under presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush called the move unusual.
“We didn't do a political screening on every grant, because many of them were based on science, and political appointees don't have that kind of background,” former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who served under Bush, told the Washington Post.
The report comes after a scientist from Northeastern University posted an email to Facebook in which a US Department of Energy staffer asked them to cut mentions of “climate change” and “global warming” from their grant application. (The Department of Energy denied having a systematic ban on “climate change,” but did not specifically deny or confirm the validity of the email). Employees at the US Department of Agriculture have also been asked to avoid terms including “climate change” going forward, and replace them with less-specific terminology like “weather extremes.”
When I tentatively began to keep a diary in April 1969, I could scarcely have imagined that decades of my life would not only be recorded but later published for all to see. I was 25 years old when I took a crisp new ring-backed notepad, headed the page “1969” and wrote, more in hope than expectation, “Thursday April 17th”. It was not actually my first attempt to keep a diary – so what did I think might be different that time?

I lay a lot of the blame on our first son, Tom, who had been born six months earlier. They were a sweet, serious little fellow with a head as smooth as a billiard ball, and I loved nothing more than when they crawled into my arms and snuggled towards me.
Unfortunately I was a smoker at the time and Tom would immediately transfer their attention to the still warm butt in the ashtray. As all parents know, when you're only six months old, just about everything is edible, so if they were to hug me without getting poisoned, I needed to give up. One evening when Terry Gilliam (a non-smoker) and my wife (also a non-smoker) accused me of helpless addiction, I finally made the decision. Somehow I lasted through the next day without one and the day after that too.
So surprised was I at this unprecedented exercise of willpower that, like a man reborn, I began to look around for other uses for my newly strengthened resolve.
I have always been attracted to lists, and the ultimate for any list keeper is to keep a record of what you've done each day. A diary, in fact. All I'd lacked in the past was the will to keep at it. Now here was a golden opportunity to try again, and to try properly.

Very little happened on that first day of the new diary, or so it seemed at the time. Yet when I re-read my entry for Thursday 17 April 1969, my diary reminds me that I played squash, had David Jason round to lunch, walked over Hampstead Heath to Kenwood House, and took a phone call from David Frost about a rumour he'd heard that I was planning a new show with John Cleese. If I had not kept a diary I would never remember all this. And how unremarkable it seemed at the time. David Jason was a friend, not a television megastar, and Monty Python's Flying Circus, the new show John had talked about, was still a glint in its mother's eye.
That's the attraction of a diary. It remains in its own time. It reflects only what happened on that particular day. It doesn't flatter and it isn't influenced by what happened later. In that way it's the most truthful record of real life, and that's why I'm so glad I persevered with it – writing an entry most mornings right up to today.
There are times when I've had to drive myself to do it. Times when I had so little time to write that I just jotted down a few notes, but mostly I've tried to approach each morning's entry as a story of the day that's just passed, without limits and without self-censorship. And composing a story a day is not a bad discipline for any would-be writer.
I never wrote with the idea of publication in mind. I don't think I even wrote for another reader. The diary was more an aide-memoire than anything else. Occasionally I would read a piece to my wife, usually to settle an argument about what we had or hadn't done. Otherwise, the family were far too busy with their own lives to be interested in mine.
But the longer I kept the diaries the more I saw them as accruing some sort of historical relevance. Something that happened the day before might have little significance at the time, but 25 or 30 years later it acquires an extra dimension. I have never regretted the decision to publish. It's made me a little more self-conscious about what I write each morning, but I try my hardest to apply the same criteria to my entries as I've always done – what I did the day before.
Thanks to the diaries I can recollect things that I would almost certainly have forgotten – did I really think that A Fish Called Wanda was too nasty to be funny? Was I really scared stiff that Around The World In 80 Days could be a complete disaster? Well yes, the diaries prove it.

For a diarist life ceases to be an indistinct blur. Experiences are there in sharp focus; some an immeasurable pleasure, others a profound pain. Which is the way life is. And which is why diary-keeping is often prescribed as a therapy for those with depression, or those who feel their lives are somehow out of control.
I encourage you to do as I did all those years ago; get your own notebook out and write down the year and the day and what happened to you in the last 24 hours. And keep on doing it. I try and get down what I can remember in 30 minutes maximum – Alan Bennett warned me that if you're not careful you start living for the diary, rather than the other way round.
I've found the diary habit very helpful to my own development as a writer. You have to be able to think clearly and edit as you go. An online blog is fine, but I feel very strongly that it's not the same thing as writing down your own experiences in your own hand, in your own chosen notebook.
Handwriting is more personal. It expresses your personality. I can tell from mine how I was feeling at the time – sometimes hurried and rushed, sometimes relaxed and expansive. There are days when there are wine stains on the page, showing that I wrote the entry one evening, after a few.
You may find it hard, as I did, to find time to write. You may get discouraged by days when nothing seems to happen. Don't give up. I've found that details of what you ate or who you were with or what music you were listening to might seem insignificant at the time but as the years go by these are the things you, and others, really want to know about. Tastes and circumstances change so fast that it is often hardly believable that this is what we did then, this is how we lived, this is what we all worried about. The diarist keeps tabs on us all.
Keeping a diary means that all that seeing and hearing, loving and laughing, excitement and embarrassment, gladness and gloom that go to make up a life are not forgotten. In short, a diary blows away the mists of time, and offers your life back to you.

How to keep up the habit of writing a diary
Have it closed to hand
I'd recommend something small: a smartphone or notebook. Keep your diary close, in your bag or laptop bag. If your diary is to be a home-bound creature, keep it under your bed or in your bedside drawer. Don't let it stray too far from you in case of fire (think Pepys) and diary snoops.
Be spontaneous
Not everything we jot down needs to be carefully thought out. It can also be a place where we think carelessly, loosely – “slovenly” as Woolf phrased it. We can write our diaries in a state of semi-undress – literally and creatively.
Make it daily
Diary-keeping is a mild to moderate religion. It needs commitment and some degree of organisation. Virginia Woolf reserved an hour or two post-teatime to write hers. One friend of mine wrote theirs for years while their daughter napped. Ask yourself when you are most likely to keep one. Perhaps on the train home, or on the loo (why not?), before you get dressed in the morning, or before you go to sleep.
Don't be scared
Diary-writing takes courage. In our digital culture we have become frightened of paper. What we write down seems more final, more resolute. But make the effort and it can offer a crucial moment of reflection. It's actually a form of mindfulness – a process of peacefully observing what's running through your mind.

Heathrow Airport Runway Configuration
Runway's 27L & 27R
Runway's 09L & 09R
More Information
To help limit the noise that the residents of London have to endure from the traffic flying into and out of Heathrow Airport, the airport uses a Runway Alternation Policy.The runways in use are first and foremost decided by the weather. If the wind is blowing in from the West (most of the time), then runway's 27L/R will be active. If the wind is blowing in from the East, runway's 09L/R will be active instead.NOTE: The wind direction can change during the course of a day. If it does, the active runways may also change depending on the new wind direction.When runway's 27L and 27R are the active runways, one runway will be used for arrivals and the other for departures between 06:00 and 15:00. From 15:00 these runways swap over so that the arrivals runway now becomes the departure runway and the departure runway now becomes the arrival runway.Example:Runway 27L = Arrivals 06:00 - 15:00, Departures 15:00 until last departure.Runway 27R = Departures 06:00 - 15:00, Arrivals 15:00 until last arrival.To complicate this a little bit, between 06:00 and 07:00 both 27L and 27R may be used for arriving aircraft at the same time. This dual runway operation is designed to speed up the early morning arrivals before aircraft start to depart at 07:00.Unfortunately, if the aircraft you want to spot arrives at this time, it may land on either runway meaning you could miss it.When runway's 09L and 09R are the active runways, 09L will be used for arrivals and 09R will be used for departures. This rule continues all day regardless of the time. To complicate this slightly, aircraft may occasionally land on runway 09R, but this is quite rare.You can get more information about Heathrow's Runway Alternation Policy as well as a PDF detailing the weekly schedule of active runways (27L and 27R) by following this link.If you have any questions regarding this policy, I'm happy to help. You can either post your question on my Facebook page or send me a tweet on a Twitter . Alternatively, please email me at mcpcshowcaseHD@gmail.com In all cases, please allow at least 24 hours for a reply. Thank you.
It never fails. I am too weak to resist a Secret World dev tour! Even knowing that spoilers will abound, I cannot help myself — I must see what's in store. I call it my civic duty; after all, I need to report it to you, yes? Of course, you could just wait a smidgen and see for yourself when Issue #13 releases this week, but why torture yourself needlessly? I already tortured myself for you! I sat down with Lead Designer Romain Amiel and Community Manager Andy Benditt to play through parts of the new story, check out the holiday clothing, and (obviously) take tons of screenshots. I did manage to avoid reading the lore I collected at least.
So do you want to see what's in Trail of Shadows? You are in the right place. Warning! Some spoilers lie ahead, but I try to avoid anything too major.
Christmas clothing
I'll start with the most spoiler-free information, just in case you wandered here accidentally. As with the most recent holidays, players will have the chance to collect a new outfit from the reward bags, whether they get the bags from the item store or after completing the holiday missions. On top of the festive red coats, gloves, and boots, there is also a pendant and antler accessory to acquire. A black holiday outfit is also available on the Lucky Coin vendors, who will now be available in Seoul and New York as well as London. The one piece I absolutely must have is a bright red onesie! Knowing that many others might feel the same, and because many fans have expressed the desire to be able to just get the outfit they want without the random element, Amiel said the team is testing out putting this one item exclusively in the item shop so players who want it can just outright buy it. Boy, am I glad I have some points left.
Amiel revealed that there has been one change in the items available with the collectors edition of Trail of Shadows; due to some animation difficulties with the oven mitt, players will get Yuichi's funky hat instead. All other items remain the same. I have to tell you, strutting down the street in Ricky Pagan's jacket and jeans while rocking out to the boombox was pretty sweet. Almost as sweet as racing through the streets of Tokyo on their bike! Speaking of Pagan's bike…
Tell me (a little) story
So this is the section that will be mildly spoilerrific, so flee away if you must. But I promise I will not divulge too much, just as I made Amiel avoid giving away too many clues! Still here? Well then, let's dive in.
First off, let's discuss Ricky Pagan. He's a character, in every sense of the word. Sadly, players who don't have Sidestories: The Last Pagan have not had the pleasure of interacting with them yet. (A fact that seriously should be remedied!) Once issue #13 launches, ayone who has purchsed the issue and can get to Tokyo will now get to run a mission for him. The mission is a more lighthearted one, separate from the issue's main mission line, involving cruising the streets of Kaidan on their beloved chrome steed. If you enjoyed the snowmobile mission of Issue #7 in Transylvania, you'll have fun with this one. And there is an achievement in this mission that will grant you a replica of Pagan's bike for yourself. Boo-yah!
As for the main story chain (not to be confused with the actual main story mission), we already know that this one is introduced by Yuichi and Harumi, the addled brother and hacker sister duo. I am not going to give away too much, but if you are observant in the cutscene, you'll already get a major clue as to what is really happening, even before the obvious comes up and smacks you in the face. Harumi sends you out on a task that involves figuring out how to get to certain places. Sorry, but I cannot offer you any hints because we just ported to the spot — the result of my begging to not have too many spoilers! What I can say is that if you've never been knocked off of a roof by a Flappy, be prepared for that now. Thank heavens for no fall damage!
Further along in the mission chain you meet the new NPC. You've already caught a glimpse of them
The NPC turns out to be a benevolent security mech named Security Five. Why do I call it a her? Let's just say all the pink and the feminine voice lend to assigning that particular pronoun. Who it is should be pretty obvious the moment you meet her, but I am not going to spoil that, even in this spoiler!
You begin running missions for and with this NPC, downloading programs, infiltrating a hospital (this is a new — and might I add pretty gruesome — instance in Tokyo), and learning more about the nature of Cyborgs. There are both sabotage and investigation aspects of these missions, but since they are necessary to progress they are not as elaborate is full missions of that kind would be. The sabotage itself is pretty small and easy to maneuver through. Well, I got through on my first try, so that's saying something! The investigation is meant to look very intimidating, but remember all my hints to have a notebook with you when you play? Use that now to write down the clues and the answer will be much more obvious. In all, Amiel says the mission is slightly more difficult than The Kingsmouth code.
A fun aspect is a new type of gameplay. I keep wondered how the team can continue coming up with new gameplay elements, yet it always does. This time there is an ability-based puzzle.
The gist of it is that you have a security droid that you control that can in turn actually control other droids; this is a major necessity to complete the mission. One of the abilities is a built-in hint feature that will pinpoint interactable objects you haven't found yet. Only one person in the group can actually utilize the droid, however, so it is definitely worth repeating to have your turn at the controls!
While playing through the missions, you might think things seem more lighthearted than the back-to-spooky feel Amiel promised. True, there really are some amusing elements (robo-spam wins as one of my new favorite quotes), but the sinister comes out as well as you dive deeper. Those creepier elements return when players get to delve into the inner workings of their own minds. As a hint, if you don't have a psychology degree (man I knew that would come in handy someday!), you may want to read up on Jung a little ahead of time to better appreciate where you will be headed. And funny side note: Dragons are explicitly told where to go, but Illuminati and Templars must suss it out for themselves from references made throughout the missions.
To start this self-discovery journey, you get to enter a place sure to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up:
It's the kindergarten.
Here is also where roleplayers will squeal a bit with delight. You see, as a part of this mission, players delve into their backstory and have to make decisions about their character's past. These choices do indeed affect the mission! For those who want to see various outcomes, you can make different choices each time you do the mission so you can follow where each path leads.
On the subject of story, there is also more story to be found in the two new lore categories. The issue itself has one category, and the final mission actually has its own set of lore. I can't tell you any more than that as I did refrain from reading any so that I could save them for launch.
Stay tuned
Players who make it through the entire chain might feel a disappointment in the amount of missions in this issue. Besides the Pagan mission and the main chain, there are only three to four side missions linked to the main chain. Amiel assures that this is not a permanent condition; the team wanted to get the issue out to fans ASAP along with the holiday event, so there was a time crunch. However, there are plans for a bunch more side missions to be added to Issue #13 — for free — early next year.
At the conclusion of the tour, Amiel reiterated that the future issues will be back in other zones, tying up stories that have been left hanging elsewhere. That doesn't mean that there aren't any more stories to be told in Tokyo; there are, but that before the next big main story of Season 2 commences, things need to be wrapped up in the earlier zones.
Other incoming changes include a revamp of the boxes on the docks of Tokyo. In a later patch, there will be new keys granted for completing Issue #13 that will let players face new bosses. New gadgets and new rewards will also be available from those boxes.

Farm subsidies represent a solution in search of a problem.
Fruit, vegetable, livestock and poultry operations receive nearly no payments, yet still produce two-thirds of the farm economy.
We are told the farm economy cannot function without subsidies. However, nearly all subsidies go to growers of just five crops: wheat, cotton, corn, soybeans and rice. By contrast, fruit, vegetable, livestock and poultry operations receive nearly nothing, yet still produce two-thirds of the farm economy, with stable prices and healthy incomes. Why can't the Big Five crops function in the same free market?
We are told food is too vital to national security to leave to the free market. This is the same misguided logic that has induced calls for a federal takeover of health care. It's unclear how a centrally planned, bureaucratic, economically illiterate farm subsidy system that doesn't help the farm economy aids national security. (And who eats cotton, anyway?)
We are also told that subsidies alleviate farmer poverty. Setting aside the Norman Rockwell imagery, farm subsidies are America's largest corporate welfare program. Congress targets most subsidies toward large commercial farmers, which report an average annual income of nearly $200,000.
By promoting corn and soy, rather than fruits and vegetables, subsidies contribute to obesity and rising health costs.
More than merely ineffective, farm policies impose substantial harm. They cost Americans $25 billion in taxes and another $12 billion in higher food prices annually. Environmental damage results from farmers overplanting crops in order to maximize subsidies. By undermining America's trade negotiations, subsidies raise consumer prices and restrict U.S. exports. Cotton subsidies undercut African farmers, keeping them in desperate poverty. And as Michael Pollan, author of “The Omnivore's Dilemma,” has written, by promoting corn and soy (from which sugars and fats are derived) rather than healthier fruits and vegetables, farm subsidies contribute to obesity, rising health care costs, and early death.
The real problem is that farmers' incomes fluctuate yearly due to crop and weather unpredictability. This can be solved inexpensively with Farmer Savings Accounts and improved crop insurance. With a $1.2 trillion deficit, outdated, unnecessary farm subsidies must be included in broad-based budget reforms.
No matter what your beliefs, it's hard to deny that the era in which the Bible takes place was a more, uh, brutal time, filled with plagues, salt pillars, and excessive murders—plus plenty of conflicting moral diktats from the man himself. Now, one designer has built a handy map to help us navigate the text.
Using data from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible, programmer Daniel G. Taylor created this encyclopedic visualization of 463 of the Bible's major contradictions. Here's how to read it: Each vertical blue line represents a different chapter, ordered chronologically. The red arcs trace each represent a question about a specific person or concept. These range from incredibly mundane ("Is it OK to use perfume?") to the monumental ("Is God the creator of evil?"). Clicking on one of the red lines takes you to a list of every relevant quote from both Old and New Testaments.

Taylor's point isn't to criticize or pick apart the book. Rather, he's interested in analyzing it carefully—and visually—to reveal common threads through the entire story. "This website aspires to be a beautiful and interactive resource for skeptics and believers alike to explore some of the more negative aspects of holy books," they write.
Though this is certainly a more skeptical take on the Bible, Taylor also included augmentative demographic data about faith in America. One Gallup poll, for example, found that forty-six percent of Americans not only believe in God, but also believe in the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years. So, yes, Americans are still plenty faithful. [Quipsologies]
Screw Google On Tap and UI tuner, the best new feature in Android 6.0 is clearly Doze, the new portion of the OS dedicated to extending a phone's battery life when you're not using it. That said, this is Android, so of course people are going to start tweaking it just as soon as they can. There are already two apps that do just that. The bad news: they both require root permissions, so you'll need to have modified your farm-fresh Android 6.0 build already to use them. The good news: both of them might be worth the hassle of rooting all on their own.
Naptime comes from Francisco Franco, the developer who made Focus and Per App Modes. It allows rooted users to adjust some of the sensors and timeouts controlled by Doze - dial everything down to maximize potential battery savings, or crank some of them up if your phone isn't as responsive as you'd like it to be. Naptime is available as a download on the Play Store. It's free with no limitations, though you can donate a buck or two to get rid of a message in the settings screen.
Doze Settings Editor operates on a similar idea, but at the moment it's only available as an APK download from the XDA-Developers forum. It does most of the same things, though the interface isn't quite as friendly. It allows you to save and retrieve your settings as a profile, and includes several built-in options. The app has already been revised several times by the developer. Check both of them out and see which one works best for you.
Some Men Are Not Happy About A Women-Only Screening Of 'Wonder Woman'
Alamo Drafthouse is not a typical corporate movie chain. For a horror movie screening this week, it gave its patrons gas masks and took them by school bus out into the woods. Last night it showed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean flick on a boat. Its queer film series is called Homo Arigato.
So when the Drafthouse announced last week that to celebrate the release of Wonder Woman, it was going to offer a women-only screening at its downtown Austin location, it didn't sound all that edgy:
"The most iconic superhero in comic book history finally has their own movie, and what better way to celebrate than with an all-female screening? "Apologies, gentlemen, but we're embracing our girl power and saying 'No Guys Allowed' for one special night at the Alamo Ritz. And when we say 'People Who Identify As Women Only,' we mean it. Everyone working at this screening — venue staff, projectionist, and culinary team — will be female. "So lasso your geeky girlfriends together and grab your tickets to this celebration of one of the most enduring and inspiring characters ever created."
Innocent enough. Right?
Well, this may or may not surprise you, but some men did not like this one bit.
"I hope someone sues this is discrimination based on sex," tweeted one.
"Er, isn't this kinda inherently sexist? Not to mention the fact that the legality is questionable given the Civil Rights Act..." wrote another.
And the comments on the Drafthouse's Facebook page rolled in — as did the theater's cheerful replies.
The Drafthouse responded by adding a second women-only screening — which, like the first, quickly sold out.
Other women-only public spaces have made the headlines in recent years. Cities including Mexico City, Tokyo, and Delhi have women-only subway cars. In 2011, Istanbul's Fenerbahce soccer club played a game before a crowd of 41,000 women and children only; men were banned as punishment for fans' unruly behavior.
The screening isn't the only unusual event on display here: witness also the rare sight of a company's social media manager earning plaudits.
The Alamo has a history of wearing its attitude on its sleeve tattoo.
A few years ago, a woman left an angry, perhaps drunken, voicemail for the theater, complaining that they had been kicked out for using their phone during a movie. The theater incorporated their profanity-riddled message into one of its legendary no-talking PSAs it shows before movies.

Jihadists in Germany are younger than they used to be, and their radicalization happens over a shorter period of time, according to the Federal Criminal Office (BKA). At least 750 Islamists who don't shy away from violence have made their way from Germany to Syria so far. One-third of them have returned, officials say. 70 of the fighters came back with battlefield experience.
There seem to be ever more potential fighters to be recruited for Jihad, or "holy war." Germany's domestic intelligence agency and the BKA assume that there are 43,000 Islamists currently living in Germany. These are people who want to elevate Islam to the status of a binding societal order.
The number of Salafists continued to rise in 2014. Security authorities say there are roughly 7,900 of them. Salafists live by a particularly strict interpretation of the Islamic faith, which goes back to the Koran and other texts. Not all of them are ready to use violence to put their ideas into practice, but according to BKA President Holger Münch, the number of those who are is growing. Several groups and leaders are contributing to this radicalization.
The following hate mongers and organizations (in alphabetical order) are considered influential parts of Germany's Islamist scene.
Daesh - 'Islamic State'
The Islamist propaganda of the so-called "Islamic State" (IS), or Daesh in Arabic, reaches Germany primarily through the Internet. The terrorist organization is banned in Germany, but is ruling over large areas in Syria and Iraq. In 2014, its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a Sunni caliphate. Tens of thousands of fighters have joined the Jihadi organization, among them several hundred from Germany.
Former Berlin rapper Denis Cuspert, aka Deso Dogg, is said to have joined IS in 2012. In videos, they called for attacks in Germany. They also appeared in beheading videos and became the most important German-language protagonist of Daesh. They were reportedly killed in October 2015 in a US air attack. Even so, radical Muslims keep traveling from Germany to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS.
Hassan Dabbagh and their congregation prayed for two Germans kidnapped in Iraq in 2006. Dabbagh says kidnappings are un-Islamic.
Hassan Dabbagh
Dabbagh is German, with Syrian roots, and is considered one of the most important leaders of Salafism in Germany. They divide people into "Muslims" and "infidels." Dabbagh is head and Imam of the Al-Rahman-Mosque in Leipzig. They regularly host so-called Islam seminars and Islam education gatherings.
The state of Saxony's domestic intelligence service reported in 2014 that their aggressively presented sermons were suited to contribute to the radicalization of young, less stable Muslims or converts. Dabbagh also runs a "Mobile Islamic Academy," which they use to advertise their interpretation of Islam. Their sermons can be found in numerous Internet forums.
Ibrahim Abou-Nagie
Abou-Nagie was born in the Palestinian refugee camp Nuseirat in Gaza in 1964. They became a German citizen in 1994. Even without formal theological schooling, Abou-Nagie is considered one of the most influential Salafist preachers in Germany. They distribute their texts online and calls for a very strict interpretation of Islamic law. He, too, distinguishes Muslims and "Kafir" - "infidels."
Abou-Nagie runs the website "The true religion." Members of the network run the "Read" campaign - they distribute Korans in German cities. The federal domestic intelligence service reported in 2014 that there were hints pointing to people "who originally participated in handing out Korans and later joined the fight in Syria."
Salafists hand out free copies of the Koran in various German cities
Islamic Community Milli Görüs (IGMG)
The "Islamic Community Milli Görüs" ("National View") is considered the largest Islamist organization in Germany. It has about 31,000 members and even more people who have close ties to the organization. Turkish politician Necmettin Erbakan founded the group in the late 1960s.
Leaders say "Capitalism" and "Zionism" are causes for the current "unfair world order" and advise their members not to be friends with "infidels." IGMG leader Mustafa Kamalak called the European Union a "Christian club" and "Union of Crusaders."
In the June 2013 German issue of the IGMG paper, the "Milli Gazete," it said: "It's heresy to put human-made laws above God's law."
Lohberger Brigade
In 2013, roughly 20 young men from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia left to fight Jihad in Syria. They came from the town of Dinslaken, and most of them from the Lohberg district - that's how they got their name. The group allegedly gathered around self-appointed preacher Mustafa T. and consequently radicalized.
At least four of the Jihadists from Dinslaken have died in Syria, at least one of them blew themselves up as a suicide bomber. One alleged member of the group was arrested at the beginning of this year: Nils D. returned to Germany in November 2014. Their trial is supposed to start in January 2016.
Pierre Vogel surrounded by fans after a speech in Hamburg
Pierre Vogel
Pierre Vogel is considered one of the most influential Islamists in Germany. The convert has been an active Islamist preacher since 2006. They spread their highly controversial ideas chiefly among a young audience; for example, via Internet videos. Vogel believes that wearing a full veil is compulsory for Muslim women.
They say they don't believe that Islam condones violence against innocents, terror attacks and honor killings. The Federal Agency for Civic Education says their worldview is based on a strict division of Islamic (right/ good) and un-Islamic (wrong/ evil) behavior. According to security authorities, Vogel's sermons could contribute to the radicalization of "individual, very religious youth."
Sven Lau
Lau comes from the same area and background as Vogel. The son of Catholic parents converted to Islam around the turn of the millennium and turned to Salafism a couple of years later. Until 2008, Lau was a firefighter in the city of Mönchengladbach in North Rhine-Westphalia. After that, they ran a store for Islamic merchandise. Lau also headed the association "Invitation to Paradise" for a while.
They said they traveled to Syria several times over the last few years for "humanitarian reasons." In September 2014, Lau garnered national attention and outrage, for example on social network Facebook, when they set up a so-called "Sharia Police" with other Salafists in Wuppertal. They tried to keep Muslim youth from entering casinos, restaurants or clubs. The prosecutor's office instituted proceedings against them for violating the right of assembly.
Photos of the "Sharia Police" spread across Germany via Facebook
Wolfsburg Cell
Roughly 20 Jihadists traveled to Iraq and Syria from Wolfsburg in 2013 and 2014 to fight for the "Islamic State." Two members of the "Wolfsburg Cell" are now in court. They traveled to Syria via Turkey in 2014. Ebrahim H. B. said in court that the group was radicalized by IS preacher Yassin O., who has fled to Syria in the meantime.
"He gave the impression of having an answer to all questions," the defendant said about the group's fascination with O. "Everyone respected him."
Both defendants are looking at sentences of up to ten years in prison. At least seven of the Wolfsburg Jihadists have died in Syria.
As the first of several opinion pieces exploring current issues in KDE, we offer you a video of Aaron Seigo explaining how KDE's success as a community producing all kinds of software led to outgrowing our old name, the "K Desktop Environment", what KDE means now and why it matters.
Aaron Seigo on KDE Branding ( Aaron Seigo on KDE Branding ( Ogg Theora version
A little over a year ago, an article was published on the Dot titled 'Repositioning the KDE Brand'. The article publicized the outcome of a process within KDE to make sense of the relationship between the community and its products, and to reach a durable solution regarding the terms that should be used to refer to both.
Since then, good progress has been made with people understanding, accepting and using the new terms. Spreading awareness within and beyond KDE, and increasing the understanding of how the brands are now used, takes time and continued communication. This effort is still ongoing.
Justin Kirby caught up with Aaron - Plasma developer extraordinaire, former president of KDE e.V. and KDE promoter - to ask them to explain the KDE brands and the reasoning behind them. As Aaron lucidly describes, the central element of the new terminology is the fact that KDE refers to the community, and not to any one of the products that the community creates. Thus, KDE is a community that makes three different types of products: workspaces, a platform, and applications.
Workspaces: The main brand for the workspaces is Plasma; KDE produces Plasma Desktop, Plasma Netbook, and soon Plasma Mobile and others.
The main brand for the workspaces is Plasma; KDE produces Plasma Desktop, Plasma Netbook, and soon Plasma Mobile and others. Platform: The KDE Platform consists of the base of libraries and services that are needed to run KDE applications.
The KDE Platform consists of the base of libraries and services that are needed to run KDE applications. Applications: KDE Applications are created by the KDE community using the KDE Platform, that can run in environments other than the Plasma workspaces (such as Gnome or, in many cases, Windows).

There isn't much Turkey wouldn't do to go after Fethullah Gulen, the controversial cleric Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blames for a failed coup in 2016.
Last fall, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Turkish officials reportedly considered going beyond trying to convince the U.S. to extradite Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania: They discussed “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,” James Woolsey, a Flynn Intel Group board member and former CIA director, told the Wall Street Journal.
But the plot gets as granular as agents lobbying Texas legislators to pass bills forcing charter schools in the state to be more transparent, according to a Justice Department filing from the end of May.
Why Texas? That's where Harmony Public Schools is headquartered, a charter school system that Turkey alleges is a cog in a vast network tied to the controversial cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Harmony has denied the claim, but a number of individuals associated with the schools are followers of Gulen. And they're quite active in politics: A CRP analysis found that 20 Harmony employees or vendors donated more than $350,000 at the federal level in the last three elections, $255,000 of which went to liberals. This group gave more than $110,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $50,000 to former President Obama's joint fundraising committee and $42,000 to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). They also contributed to state politicians.
Last July, the Turkish government filed a complaint with the Texas Education Agency, alleging Harmony abused public money, used discriminatory hiring practices and favored certain vendors in violation of competitive bidding rules. The agency dismissed the complaint in October, saying it didn't warrant an investigation.
Reports indicate that some Gulen-connected schools, including some in Ohio, are under FBI investigation, though the scope of the investigation is unclear.
Amsterdam & Partners, which was hired to file the complaint, subcontracted the legislative angle to Arnold Public Affairs, the firm listed on the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act filing. Arnold Public Affairs was hired last April on a $20,000 monthly contract, which dropped to $15,000 in January.
According to principal Jim Arnold, their firm is promoting legislation that would require charter school meetings to be streamed and posted online, as well as to disclose additional information about their business transactions in their annual financial reports. The firm met with lawmakers, widely circulated a derogatory media story to them and their staffs and filed cards of support, meaning they publicly endorsed the legislation.
“Transparency is good, whether for public schools and charter schools, and there isn't much transparency in the business that Harmony conducts,” Arnold said. “That was the purpose of these bills. Anything we can do to shed some light on the interconnected network and transactions… Harmony is the largest charter school network in Texas and is connected to Gulen.”
Harmony Public Schools did not return multiple calls seeking comment.
Neither bill made it to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk. Texas' legislative session is over, but the firm is working with legislators to try to tack some parts of the bills onto other measures as amendments before June 18, the deadline for the governor to sign or veto a bill.
But the association representing 90 percent of Texas charter schools, including Harmony, says reporting requirements are already stringent.
“We are subject to the same open meetings act and public information act requirements as public schools,” said Christine Isett, director of communications for the Texas Charter School Association. “All of our information is transparent.” Currently schools with more than 10,000 students are required to post videos of their meetings online seven days after the event takes place, but most schools are much smaller than that.
The Turkish government has mentioned Gulen in almost 20 FARA filings in the past two years, according to a CRP analysis. Amsterdam & Partners contacted the press, state legislators and the Texas attorney general about Harmony and Gulen's alleged role in the attempted coup.
Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, had been working on convincing the U.S. government to extradite Gulen. The firm closed last November. Flynn Intel Group also earned more than $500,000 to create an anti-Gulen documentary, according to The Wall Street Journal. A reporter working on the film said they were told to hide the Flynn firm's involvement in the project.

Every year, the first few weeks of the season belong to guys like Larry Donnell. I have no problem admitting that before the Giants opened the season on a Monday night in Detroit, I had no idea who Donnell was. I'd never read their name or mentioned them to anyone. Maybe that's a problem, considering what I do, but I'm guessing not many people outside the tri-state area had heard of them either.
That's part of what made last night so fun — knowing that a month ago, not a soul in America knew Larry Donnell's name, and now he's the best receiver on one of the most visible football teams we have.
Apparently, Donnell was an undrafted free agent out of Grambling State in 2012. That's really where the trail — or at least the first page of Google results — ends. Larry Donnell's Wikipedia page is three sentences long.
Last night was more of the same from Donnell. Three touchdowns in a prime-time, division game is a slight step up, but he's been one of Eli Manning's favorite options since they got started less than a month ago.
At 6-foot-5, Donnell is a huge target, but the best part about them is those hands. Donnell will go get it, especially in the end zone, and the awareness they show on back-shoulder throws down there makes them a serious problem for defenders.
Donnell spent the past two seasons toiling away on the practice squad, which makes you wonder what kind of talent is stuck on the back of NFL rosters. Their old tight ends coach, Mike Pope, said as much earlier this week. Donnell was considerably raw when they left Grambling State, and too often, players who need a lot of work aren't long for a world that craves instant production. Whatever Donnell's troubles were, they look long gone. He's been one of the stars of the early season, one of those, Wait, who was that? guys we may not have seen coming. There are plenty more, but before we get to them, please, somebody goes update Donnell's Wikipedia page. There's some stuff worth mentioning.
DeMarco Murray, RB, Cowboys
Through three games, DeMarco Murray has a league-leading 75 carries for a league-leading 385 yards. For the Murray from last season, those numbers are totally believable. They were the most effective runner in the league a year ago, and all the pleas for Dallas to lean on its ground game this year were with Murray in mind. For anyone familiar with Murray's history, though, it's kind of incredible that he's turned into this kind of running back.
Murray's first-year student year at Oklahoma was impressive. They rushed for 13 touchdowns, and that's unbelievable even if you know five came against North Texas. But that season, and even for the next two, Murray was never the Sooners' primary running back. That job went to guys like Chris Brown and Allen Patrick. Murray was the smaller, quicker, pass-catching scatback who turned into a lightning strike four times a game.
There are flashes of that in Dallas. Murray's still elusive, still blisteringly fast. But he's also an off-tackle terror averaging 2.15 yards per rush after contact. He's running over and through tacklers as often as he's running around them. Murray hitting the second level with a head of steam is one of the more beautiful sights in the league right now. I just really — really — hope they don't get hurt.
Kyle Fuller, CB, Bears
I won't even pretend to be casual about this. The Kyle Fuller revolution is here, and it is amazing.
With their (still) dire safety problem, there was some bristling when the Bears took Fuller 14th in this year's draft. I'm guessing that's died down a bit. For two consecutive weeks, Fuller has turned a prime-time game into their own personal showcase. Their pair of second-half picks sealed a win against the 49ers, and they spent Monday night locking down half the field while also doing their best Charles Tillman impression.
As good as the Bears have been on defense for most of the past decade, it's been a while since Chicago developed an in-house star. Tillman and Lance Briggs were drafted 11 years ago. It would be stupid to anoint Fuller as that type of find after three weeks, but he's already shown the knack for ball-stealing that defined Tillman. For better or worse, the Bears defense has long survived on turnovers. It feels right when the ball is hitting the ground or getting snatched out of the air. Finding the next guy to do both has been weirdly comforting.
Kelechi Osemele, G, Ravens
Every time I watch the Ravens offense, my focus drifts to Kelechi Osemele. Part of that is me being a line-play weirdo. The other part is that he's become impossible to ignore.
As a rookie, Osemele's move from tackle to guard was a step in the O-line shuffle that helped the Ravens eventually win a Super Bowl, but 2013 was pretty much a lost year. A bad back ended Osemele's season after seven games, and the interior of the Ravens line was a mess.
Osemele had surgery this offseason, and in their third year they look like a new man. At 6-foot-6, he's massive for a guard. It isn't easy to look big next to a bunch of offensive linemen, but Osemele somehow manages. Mobility is key in Baltimore's new offense under Gary Kubiak, and Osemele moves better than a man their size has any right to. It's downright elegant. Combine that with 330 pounds and the ability to blow people off the ball, and you get the best interior offensive lineman in football right now.
DeAndre Levy, OLB, Lions
We'll get to everything else, but let's start with what's important: Where Levy falls in the NFL Beard Rankings. This list is based on no criteria other than my self-appointed title as a beard-having expert.
1. Brett Keisel: The king stay the king. Keisel has owned the NFL beard corner for nearly five years, and they stay at the top until they decide otherwise. Also, prove to me they aren't Tormund Giantsbane from Game of Thrones. I'm talking, in a room together and no tricky mirror stuff.
2. Jason Kelce: Ideally, you'd want to judge the hair and beard separately, but I'll admit one plays into the other. It's the overall look that leads to opportunities like this:
3. DeAndre Levy: The fullness defies understanding. Forget how uncomfortable it has to be with a chin strap. I have no idea how they even get one on.
They do, though, and it turns them into an offense-destroying nightmare. Levy was great last year, picking off six passes and covering the middle of the field as well as any linebacker around. The coverage skills are back — Levy was manned up on Jordy Nelson on the game-ending play Sunday — but he's also at the center of Detroit's incredible run defense. Levy was the one knifing into the backfield and dragging Eddie Lacy down in the end zone for a safety. It takes one hand to count the linebackers who can consistently make both of those plays: Patrick Willis, the guys in Carolina, Lavonte David, and Levy. Even with all of those interceptions last year, I don't think people thought Levy could be on that level. If they aren't there now, he's certainly close.
Jurrell Casey, DE, Titans
There's no one quite like Jurrell Casey. The Titans gave the 24-year-old a four-year deal with $20.5 million guaranteed this offseason, a reward for some truly impressive production last year, when they had 10.5 sacks. Playing as a traditional defensive tackle, Casey was taking a run at guys like Ndamukong Suh and Gerald McCoy as the best in the game.
When Tennessee hired Ray Horton and announced it was shifting to a 3-4 defense, there was some worry Casey might be miscast in a move to defensive end. Not only has Casey been their old self, but the Titans are actually using them in weirder ways than anyone could have thought.
Coming out of USC, Casey's build gave people pause about their future as a defensive tackle. Now, he's occasionally the squattiest outside linebacker anyone has ever seen. It's not like the Titans are throwing them out there just to do it, either. Casey gave Doug Free plenty of trouble from that spot when the Cowboys came to Tennessee. Few players can line up and play well from so many different spots, and the ones that can typically look more like Calais Campbell than Casey. They really are unique.
Devin Hester, WR, Falcons
There's a cruel irony to Devin Hester burning a Lovie Smith–coached team to the ground the way they did last week. Smith ultimately lost their job with the Bears because they could never find the assistant coaches to get the most out of their offense, and in Hester's first season away from Chicago, they may have finally found their place as a receiver.
The process of turning Hester into a wide receiver in Chicago was always backward. Jumping from “return specialist” to “no. 1 option” never made any sense, and falling back from “failed no. 1 option” to “return specialist” probably didn't either. In Atlanta, Hester's allowed to be the ultimate luxury — a fourth receiver/returner useful on the type of jet-sweep, Oh shit not this guy plays they scored on against the Bucs.
But as a receiver, he's also getting open every time he's given even a little room. That shouldn't surprise anyone who's ever seen them return a punt, but it still took us this long to get here. Terry Robiskie, the receivers coach in Atlanta, deserves credit for finally turning one of the game's notorious open-field players into a receiver who can chew up cornerbacks in the open field.
Harrison Smith, S, Vikings
Some day, I'd like to ask Harrison Smith about going from Leslie Frazier's defense to Mike Zimmer's. He'll probably be diplomatic about it, but I'm not sure they should be. Sticking Smith in the back half of a zone defense is an insult, to both Smith and to football.
Smith still pulled off an impressive rookie year, and after missing a good chunk of last year with a toe injury, he's back and in a perfect spot with Zimmer. They can do a bit of everything — blitz, patrol center field, help against the run — and defensive coordinator George Edwards lets him. It's a perfect marriage of player and scheme, and in Smith's third year, they have a chance to be at the top of that class of safeties just below Earl Thomas.
Le'Veon Bell, RB, Steelers
Earlier this week, Jason Bailey dove into the changes Le'Veon Bell has made to their body since leaving Michigan State, but it's worth reiterating: Bell was a grind-it-out, volume-based running back in college. Now, he's the type of back who can rip off an 80-yard run. There were four of those in the NFL all of last season.
This version of Bell allows them to combine the best elements of the player they were and the player he's become. Their vision is supernatural, and they have that patience all running backs talk about but few actually use. Bell is never in a hurry until they want to be, and these days, they can be in one pretty damn quickly.
Khalil Mack, OLB, Raiders
“The Black Hole” suits Oakland in a couple of ways, one of them being that it's a place young players often go before they're never seen again. It takes a lot these days to earn some positive attention for the Raiders, which makes Khalil Mack's start all the more amazing.
At the University at Buffalo, it made sense that Mack was moving at a different speed than everyone on the field. The scary part is that they still are. Mack's had at least one play every week that warrants rewinding. And last week against New England, there were a few. Nate Solder's had a rough month, and Mack didn't make it any easier.
Everyone knew before the draft that Mack could just appear in the backfield — Nightcrawler in a football helmet — but it's the sturdy plays, ones where the crazy physical skills mesh with some football savvy, that have shown up so far. Mack's ditching blockers, pulling off spin moves, and doing things reserved for guys who have been at this a lot longer than they have. Like some of their colleagues here, he's going to be a star.
Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 was one of the standout stars of the fifth season of Rupaul's Drag Race and they haven't looked back since. As they get ready to perform in Dublin this week, they talk to Alan Finnegan about their favourite songs, TV shows, and ending up a bathtub last time they were here.
What was it about drag that got you into it?
I've always been drawn to pretty things. Women have better clothes than men.
How has your drag changed since appearing on Drag Race?
I'm prettier, now that I've seen what I look like on TV.
Who is your favourite queen of the bunch on this season of Drag Race?
I can't pick a favourite this early in the game, but I've gotten to work with Miss Fame, and she's lovely, and fun, and weird. I also love Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel.
You were such a super-fan and tried multiple times to get on the show. How was the experience for you, compared to the way you envisioned it?
It was a magical, mystical wonderland. You can now see behind the scenes on the new Untucked on Youtube, but back then it was all a secret and a mystery. It is a time I will always cherish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iygtzrVVfLE
What is your favourite song to Lip Sync to?
Whitney Houston's ‘It's Not Right But It's Okay – the remix'.
What shows do you binge watch when you get the chance?
I just binged on some The Walking Dead. And I just started Empire. I can feel a binge coming on…
Tell me something your fans would be surprised to know?
I love sour gummy worms.
What is your dream gig?
I'd really like to do music festivals like SXSW. I also really want to go on the bus trip to Mothership, Reno, hosted by Heklina and Peaches Christ.
How do you spend your free time when you're not performing?
Eating Grubhub and watching Netflix.
What inspires you when you are coming up with music ideas?
I used to think that inspiration came from some magical, mystical place, or that it cane from doing drugs or having sex. The truth is, inspiration comes from the work. So when you're pushing yourself to do the hard, gruelling, mundane work, that's where the good shit comes from.
What do you like most about travelling around the world to perform?
I like hotel rooms. The bed is always made and the bathroom is always clean.
Have you had any crazy fans encounters?
I've had fans follow me to my hotel, which is usually fine. Luckily my fans are nice, and often cute.
Why do you think Drag Race has such a strong devoted fan?
I don't know, but I love it. The viewing audience is a fraction of some other shows of its kind, but the devotion of our fans is unlike anything else on earth. I think people are sick of being spoonfed fake garbage. And drag is an art form that calls out the fakeness of show business, and makes fun of it, embracing every aspect of it and loving it.
Which of the other queens from the show do you see the most?
Jinkx and Detox. Jilaskatox.
You've performed in Ireland before – how was that experience for you?
I think I got really drunk and was sick for an entire day, but it was worth it. I did Paul Ryder's Ringmaster's Drag Race once, and I think it's incredibly well done and a very fun thing to have gotten to be a part of. The girls all really did well and gave it their all, and I was honoured to have been asked to be a guest judge. I think I ended up in a bathtub with one of the contestants at the end of the night.
What do you think of the Dublin drag scene?
It's great! Keep wearing nails, ladies.
What can Irish fans expect from you when you perform later in Break for The Border?
It's a surprise, but I will say I've been teasing some of the new material from my album on tour. So there'll be something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 will appear at Dragged Up at Break For The Border on May 1, tickets available here
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Two days after a group of 10 Americans were taken into custody in Haiti last month, a man who has emerged as a suspect in a sex trafficking ring and who has an array of other legal charges against them called up the Idaho church where 5 of them attend, portraying themselves as an attorney who could help free the group at no cost, interviews show.
After failing to contact any of the approved lawyers provided by the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, two relatives of the detained Americans returned the call from the man, Jorge Puello, which came in during Sunday services on Jan. 31, and agreed for them to help on a pro-bono basis, said Terry Michaelson, an attorney for the church, the Central Valley Baptist Church.
It was only later that relatives learned that Mr. Puello — who spoke to the media on behalf of the jailed Americans, fired a Haitian attorney who was representing them and visited the Haitian judge handling the case — lacked a law license and is being sought by law enforcement agencies in El Salvador and the United States, Mr. Michaelson said.
Mr. Puello has dropped out of sight since questions were raised about their background. Their cousin, Alejandro Puello, said Saturday they were missing, and calls to Mr. Puello's cellphone were not answered. A Web site that described Mr. Puello and their cousin as law partners, which Alejandro Puello said was false, was taken down on Friday.

The Salvadoran police say they want to question Mr. Puello in connection with a sex trafficking ring broken up last year in which women and girls from Central America and the Caribbean were lured into prostitution through offers of modeling jobs. The suspect is named Jorge Anibal Torres Puello.

But Mr. Puello, who has denied they are that man, said Thursday that they were the president the Sephardic Jewish Community in the Dominican Republic. Public records indicate that in 2007 that organization was registered to Jorge Anibal Torres Puello.
EVERETT, Wash. — The Everett City Council voted Wednesday night to make bikini baristas cover up while they're working.
The city is home to a few of the coffee stands.
The new ordinance would impose a dress code on the scantily dressed coffee servers. For example, servers would have to make sure their pants go at least 3 inches below the buttocks.

Everett Police said they've had problems at the stands and that they're a drain on resources.
But bikini baristas told Q13 News that the new law would take a toll on their tips and could force them to find work outside the city.
Violating the law would be a gross misdemeanor and could be punishable by up to a year in jail or a $5,000 fine.
Today I received my gifts from my secret santa. I have to say, I am VERY thrilled with what I received. I got the Game of Thrones board game and a 5 lb. bag of sour gummy worms! Yes, 5 pounds worth. I didn't even know they made bags that big for them. I am so excited with what I got and I can't wait to give the board a run through. Plus, I get to enjoy gummy worms for the foreseeable future, which rocks. Thanks so much for the gifts and the kind words you wrote to me. It means a lot that you picked something so well for me by taking the time and reading about my interests and without even knowing me. Have a Merry Christmas, from my family to yours.

I love this story, published over on the right-wing pollster Rasmussen's editorial page. In it, a self-professed environmentalist confesses that they have been hoarding incandescent bulbs for months, in anticipation of the "light bulb ban" -- before realizing the error, and utter ridiculousness, of theirs doing so. See, as author Froma Harrop points out, there is no incandescent light bulb ban. We've been guilty of framing it as such here at TreeHugger, much to my chagrin, but the truth is that you're still going to be able to get the exact same quality of light -- even from incandescent bulbs! Those bulbs just have to be a lot more efficient, that's all!
But get a load of Harrop's account, which I think reflects the way plenty of folks feel about the issue:
I have a horrible confession to make. I'm an environmentalist who's been hoarding old incandescent light bulbs before they become illegal in January. But it was all unnecessary, so I learn ... My objection to the squiggly "energy savers" is purely aesthetic. I can't stand the way they look ... I do use funny-looking compact florescent bulbs in the laundry room, where their raw illumination keeps me from tripping over the giant box of Tide. Nice, older light bulbs go everywhere else. Hence, my secret stockpiling.
The dreaded CFL. Photo credit: Protographer23 via Flickr/CC BY-SA
And so the stockpiling continued until a fateful phone call from an NRDC rep that informed Harrop of the error of their ways. Truth-blast incoming:
Firstly, it is not true that the law bans incandescent bulbs. It just requires that they become more energy efficient. In fact, General Electric, Philips and Sylvania already sell incandescent bulbs that meet the new standards, while producing light and color similar to the old 100-watt bulb. Meanwhile, light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs can make light equivalent to the old 60-watt bulbs while using only 12 watts. GE makes one that looks like the bulbs piled up in my back closet. And the expense? At $1.50, an incandescent Philips EcoVantage bulb costs about $1 more than the old-fashioned kind. Both typically last 18 months. But ... the EcoVantage's energy savings make up that price difference in seven months. "The rest of the time, you're making money." ...
Harrod also notes that the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the major industry group, has pressed Congress to not overturn the standards, since companies have already invested in new efficiency technology.
I wish every conservative incandescent light bulb-lover would read this piece. It debunks all the irrational fears of smarter bulbs in one fell swoop. It shows that the standard will do anything but eliminate freedom of choice -- it's already spurred innovation that has offered us all sorts of new consumer options in the light bulb arena. Even keeping bulbs just like the old energy hogs we've used for decades -- they just save you money now!
The column also goes a long way in exposing just how ideologically driven this remarkably stupid resistance to energy efficiency is -- the facts are clearly on one side here. And Mike has already documented how adopting these standards will save literally billions of dollars in energy costs over the next ten years. There's simply no good argument for wasting more energy and money, just to cling to a 100 year-old technology that we can more efficiently replicate anyways.
It is fun to watch Fox News crew get worked up about it though ...

Hey everyone!First painting of 2014, though I was working on it back in 2013. I took some stupid experimental approaches to this guy which had me redoing bits and pieces of it but I did learn a lot through the whole process. For one, I figured out a pretty quick and reliable way to paint scales in Photoshop that doesn't require photo textures.I basically improved this tutorial www.photoshop-dragon.com/Tutor… to my own liking.Then the process in general is one I have picked up recently and I have been enjoying it immensely. I'll share the steps soon enough, but it isn't anything new. It's basically this tutorial simplified. lindseywakefield.tumblr.com/po… Anyways I should be moving on to the final mega digivolution, WarGreymon and then I want to do Gabumon's forms.I hope you all enjoy and have a great 2014!
Facebook's hardware guru thinks Blu-ray discs might have a brighter future in the data center than in consumers' homes.
We wrote on Wednesday about how Facebook has developed a prototype storage system that uses 10,000 Blu-ray discs to hold a petabyte of data. After that story posted we were able to talk to Frank Frankovsky, VP of hardware design and supply chain operations at Facebook, to find out just why he's so excited about the project.
While the Blu-ray storage system is just a prototype, Facebook hopes to get it in production sometime this year and share the design with the Open Compute Project community to spur adoption elsewhere. If Facebook and others start using Blu-ray discs for long-term archival storage, Blu-ray manufacturers will see a new market opportunity and pursue it, Frankovsky said.
"I think that the media suppliers, especially after all of the community excitement around it with Open Compute, they see a huge opportunity here," Frankovsky said. "Economies of scale could take over really quickly, and they could start producing those discs for the Open Compute community at much lower cost than they do today because, believe it or not, this is one of those areas where really high-capacity Blu-ray discs are in relatively low demand on the consumer side and in relatively high demand on the data center side."
Facebook intends to use Blu-rays for "cold storage," data that can't be thrown out but may not be accessed for many years, if at all. The best near-term use case is backups of photos and videos, but the discs could also be used for any data that Facebook is required by law to retain for a certain number of years.
Facebook's cold storage today is entirely on spinning disks. The prototype Blu-ray system is estimated to be 50 percent cheaper than the disk-based cold storage, and 80 percent more energy efficient.
The discs are housed in a fancy rack that holds 24 magazines, with each magazine holding 36 cartridges, and each cartridge holding 12 Blu-ray discs, for a total of 10,368. A robot lives and works inside the rack.
"We have a robotic picker that will go to a specified magazine and then locate a cartridge, it will unlock that cartridge, removing the drawer, and a picker will go down and is able to select a specified disc in that 12-disc arrangement," Facebook's Giovanni Coglitore said in a video demo posted yesterday.
When the robot isn't working, the rack consumes virtually no power, they said.
"Each disc is certified for 50 years of operation; you can actually get some discs that are certified for 1,000 years of reliability," Coglitore said. "Because the media is separate from the drives, if you ever have a drive issue, you simply replace the drive, and you won't have to replace the data within a disc. From a reliability and operational standpoint it's quite elegant and efficient."
Facebook is careful in how it's rolling out the optical storage system to production.
As Facebook does with other new technologies, "we'll start it out in what we call shadow testing," Frankovsky said. "Until it's proven, we'll take relatively small quantities, and we'll just mirror data from what's in production and shadow that data to the optical rack."
While Blu-ray can't match the performance of hard disk drives, that isn't as important for cold storage. Frankovsky also said the Blu-ray system will be "far superior to tape" because of its durability and performance.
It could also provide benefits in recovery from failure. Frankovsky said Facebook uses erasure encoding, which "distributes a file across multiple physical devices so that in any event of a failure of a physical device you can always recreate the file."
With disk drives, "you need to have a relatively aggressive erasure encoding environment where you have a lot more physical spinning disks, so you can sustain multiple failures and be able to recreate the file in any situation," Frankovsky said. Because the predictive annual failure rate for optical discs is lower, "it's quite possible that you won't need to over-provision how much optical capacity you have to be able to get the same level of protection with the complete file rebuild. There's kind of a double goodness there. A bit for bit, it's lower cost, and if we can over-provision less with optical, you can move that needle even further on the cost-saving side."
Separately, Facebook has also considered the use of substandard flash memory for cold storage. The idea is to take "partially good NAND flash which otherwise would have been sold off as thumb drives or potentially even scrap," Frankovsky said.
Flash storage is often thrown out by manufacturers when just a few cells have gone bad, they said. With smart enough software algorithms, "you can be cognizant of where the weak or bad cells are and write around those cells."
The bad flash initiative isn't as far along as the Blu-ray project. But both have progressed pretty quickly since Facebook revealed their existence last year, Frankovsky said. They could end up being important tools as data storage needs grow.
IDC predicts that by 2020 the entire "digital universe" will grow to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes.
"A large portion of that is going to be warm to cold data, and we need something better than tape and disk to store it," Frankovsky said.
The moves now being made by the world's political establishment to lock us into December's Copenhagen treaty to halt global warming are as alarming as anything that has happened in our lifetimes. Last week in Italy, the various branches of our emerging world government, G8 and G20, agreed in principle that the world must by 2050 cut its CO2 emissions in half. Britain and the US are already committed to cutting their use of fossil fuels by more than 80 per cent. Short of an unimaginable technological revolution, this could only be achieved by closing down virtually all our economic activity: no electricity, no transport, no industry. All this is being egged on by a gigantic publicity machine, by the UN, by serried ranks of government-funded scientists, by cheerleaders such as Al Gore, last week comparing the fight against global warming to that against Hitler's Nazis, and by politicians who have no idea what they are setting in train.
What makes this even odder is that the runaway warming predicted by their computer models simply isn't happening. Last week one of the four official sources of temperature measurement, compiled from satellite data by the University of Huntsville, Alabama, showed that temperatures have now fallen to their average level since satellite data began 30 years ago.
Faced with a "consensus" view which looks increasingly implausible, a fast-growing body of reputable scientists from many countries has been coming up with a ''counter-consensus'', which holds that their fellow scientists have been looking in wholly the wrong direction to explain what is happening to the world's climate. The two factors which most plausibly explain what temperatures are actually doing are fluctuations in the radiation of the sun and the related shifting of ocean currents.
Two episodes highlight the establishment's alarm at the growing influence of this ''counter consensus''. In March, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has a key role in President Obama's plans to curb CO2 emissions, asked one of its senior policy analysts, Alan Carlin, to report on the science used to justify its policy. Their 90-page paper recommended that the EPA carry out an independent review of the science, because the CO2 theory was looking indefensible, while the "counter consensus'' view – solar radiation and ocean currents – seemed to fit the data much better. Provoking a considerable stir, Carlin's report was stopped dead, on the grounds that it was too late to raise objections to what was now the EPA's official policy.
Meanwhile a remarkable drama has been unfolding in Australia, where the new Labor government has belatedly joined the "consensus'' bandwagon by introducing a bill for an emissions-curbing "cap and trade'' scheme, which would devastate Australia's economy, it being 80 per cent dependent on coal. The bill still has to pass the Senate, which is so precisely divided that the decisive vote next month may be cast by an independent Senator, Stephen Fielding. So crucial is their vote that the climate change minister, Penny Wong, agreed to see them with their four advisers, all leading Australian scientists.
Fielding put to the minister three questions. How, since temperatures have been dropping, can CO2 be blamed for them rising? What, if CO2 was the cause of recent warming, was the cause of temperatures rising higher in the past? Why, since the official computer models have been proved wrong, should we rely on them for future projections?
The written answers produced by the minister's own scientific advisers proved so woolly and full of elementary errors that Fielding's team have now published a 50-page, fully-referenced "Due Diligence'' paper tearing them apart. In light of the inadequacy of the Government's reply, the Senator has announced that they will be voting against the bill.
The wider significance of this episode is that it is the first time a Western government has allowed itself to be drawn into debating the science behind the global warming scare with expert scientists representing the "counter consensus" – and the "consensus" lost hands down.
We still have a long way to go before that Copenhagen treaty is agreed in December, and with China, India and 128 other countries still demanding trillions of dollars as the price of their co-operation, the prospect of anything but a hopelessly fudged agreement looks slim. But even a compromise could inflict devastating damage on our own economic future – all for a theory now shot so full of holes that its supporters are having to suppress free speech to defend it.
Flying in the face of reason
Even now it is not widely appreciated that in 2003 the power to regulate air safety across the EU was taken over by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Several times I reported evidence that this new EU body in its shiny headquarters in Cologne would be too weak, incompetent and bureaucratic to do the job properly. Since then one of many problems reported to EASA has been a serious fault in the speed probes of some Airbus airliners, which can cause the automatic piloting system unexpectedly to shut down. EASA did nothing to ensure that the fault was corrected.
Last month, when Air France's Airbus flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic, killing everyone on board, this fault was high on the list as a possible cause. So far, apart from hinting at 'pilot error', the authorities have come up with no explanation. But last week Air France pilots demonstrated in Paris, writing a letter to EASA and its French subordinate agency, protesting that 'appropriate measures from either agency', forcing the manufacturers to make the necessary changes, 'would have helped prevent the sequence of events that led to the loss of control of the aircraft'. The real problem with handing over to the EU the power to govern Europe is simply that it doesn't work.
A Texas school district is doubling down on claims that a teacher forced their religious beliefs on students by hanging a poster of "A Charlie Brown Christmas" over their office door. Even after the state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, said the ban on the poster violated state law, the school district insisted on keeping it.
Dedra Shannon, a staffer at Patterson Middle School in Killeen, was ordered to remove a door-length poster featuring the iconic scene of Linus in front of a kid-sized tree uttering the true meaning of Christmas: "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord. That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown."
Shannon put up the poster on December 5, but the principal confronted them two days later. "I'm disappointed. It is a slap in the face of Christianity," Shannon told Fox News' Todd Starnes.
The principal argued that the poster was "an issue of separation of church and state" and that it "had to come down because it might offend kids from other religions or those who do not have a religion." The principal said Shannon could keep the picture of Linus up but had to remove the offending dialogue.
"I just took the entire thing down," Shannon recalled. "I wasn't going to leave Linus and the Christmas tree without having the dialogue. That's the whole point of why it was put up."
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton would not let this stand, however. They accused the Killeen Independent School District of violating the state's Merry Christmas Law. That law, passed in 2013, ensures that no school official in Texas can silence a biblical reference to Christmas.
"We passed that law precisely because of this type of discrimination against people of faith," Paxton told Starnes. "This is an attack on religious liberty and a violation of the First Amendment and state law."
The school district was unmoved by their arguments, however. "Our employees are free to celebrate the Christmas and Holiday season in the manner of their choosing. However, employees are not permitted to impose their personal beliefs on students," the district wrote in a statement.
Exactly how a poster showing Linus with a well-known Christmas quote constitutes "imposing" personal beliefs on students the district did not explain. It seems to imply that the mere possibility of a non-Christian student seeing the poster is enough to cause psychological harm.

Baltimore Orioles: What to expect from Mark Trumbo in 2017 by Ben Palmer
Baltimore Orioles and Mark Trumbo agree on a three-year deal, worth $37.5 million according to reports.
The Baltimore Orioles and Mark Trumbo have an agreement in place for a three-year deal worth $37.5 million according to FanRag Sports' Jon Heyman.
Trumbo, O's have agreement at 37.5M/3 — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) January 19, 2017
As always, the deal will become official once Trumbo passes their physical, something that may have many Orioles' fans on the edge of their seats as they await the results.
Baltimore Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette's strategy of waiting it out (as I predicted) seemed to have worked again, almost identical to last year's offseason saga with slugger Chris Davis signing an enormous deal in late January. The reigning home run champion turned down the Orioles' qualifying offer of a one-year deal worth $17.2 million at the start of the offseason to enter the free agent market.
The reported three-year deal, $37.5 million agreement comes after FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal reported Trumbo rejected a four-year contract worth over $50 million earlier this offseason.
After rejecting the qualifying offer, talks between the two sides stalled for the majority of the offseason and there was even reports that Trumbo was unlikely to re-sign with the Orioles as Duquette stated he'd prefer the draft pick that comes with Trumbo.
Nevertheless, Trumbo will likely be the Orioles' primary designated hitter in 2017 as the Orioles acquired outfielder Seth Smith from the Seattle Mariners last month.
Now that the Orioles have addressed their outfield and designated hitter needs, the team will likely shift their focus on adding a starting pitcher to bolster the team's rotation. It'll be interesting to see how Duquette works their magic from now until Opening Day.

Between 1935 and 1975, Will and Ariel Durant published a series of volumes that together were known as “The Story of Civilization.” They basically told human history (mostly Western history) as an accumulation of great ideas and innovations, from the Egyptians, through Athens, Magna Carta, the Age of Faith, the Renaissance and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. The series was phenomenally successful, selling over two million copies.
That series encapsulated the Western civilization narrative that people, at least in Europe and North America, used for most of the past few centuries to explain their place in the world and in time. This narrative was confidently progressive. There were certain great figures, like Socrates, Erasmus, Montesquieu and Rousseau, who helped fitfully propel the nations to higher reaches of the humanistic ideal.
This Western civ narrative came with certain values — about the importance of reasoned discourse, the importance of property rights, the need for a public square that was religiously informed but not theocratically dominated. It set a standard for what great statesmanship looked like. It gave diverse people a sense of shared mission and a common vocabulary, set a framework within which political argument could happen and most important provided a set of common goals.
Starting decades ago, many people, especially in the universities, lost faith in the Western civilization narrative. They stopped teaching it, and the great cultural transmission belt broke. Now many students, if they encounter it, are taught that Western civilization is a history of oppression.
In Bloodshot we trust!
Today, Valiant Entertainment gives us a first look at BLOODSHOT U.S.A. #1, the first issue in a new stand alone event that kicks off on October 26th.
Featuring the art of Doug Braithwaite (ARMOR HUNTERS, Justice) and written by New York Times best-selling writer Jeff Lemire (Moon Knight, Old Man Logan), BLOODSHOT U.S.A. #1 begins as an unstoppable virus transforms all the people of New York City into killing machines.
Project Rising Spirit – America's greatest exporter of classified weapons technology – has achieved a breakthrough: a contagious, airborne nanite dispersion prototype that can turn the population of any city into an army of indestructible soldiers. A doomsday virus capable of destroying an enemy nation from the inside out. A machine-made pathogen that can completely rewrite human physiology…and hardcode every man, woman, and child with the same cutting-edge technology that created their greatest weapon: Bloodshot.

Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce The Firelands, a new expansion for Talisman Revised 4th Edition. The land of Talisman will face a dire new threat in the legendary Ifrit, once forced to create the Crown of Command. Now, the Ifrit rise again, intent on burning every field to ash and enslaving the surface dwellers. Your quest for the Crown of Command is about to become more frantic and dangerous than ever before.
Flint and Tinder
In this expansion, you gain access to four new characters in your adventures across the land of Talisman. Whether you control the weapon mastery of the Dervish, the wandering Nomad, the magical Jin Blooded, or the powerful Warlord, you'll be able to use their new skills and abilities to defeat your opponents and reign supreme over Talisman.
The Firelands also introduces three new Alternative Ending Cards, offering you even more options for playing the game, whether your objective is open or hidden. Whether you use an Alternative Ending Card or play traditionally, you will need to utilize your character's Strength and Craft to the utmost. The flames of the Ifrit are spreading throughout every part of the realm of Talisman, and without your efforts, their flames will reduce it to ash.
Sparks to Flame
The Firelands expansion introduces eighty-one new Adventure Cards, and many of these cards focus on the threat of the Ifrit. In The Firelands, you will experience the blazing heat of the Ifrit expressed in a new game mechanic: burn. In the past, Objects and Followers were simply ditched or discarded after use, but with the advent of the Ifrit, the quest for the Crown of Command takes on new intensity.
Certain cards in The Firelands will instruct players to burn a certain number of cards. When a card is burnt, it is removed from the game and no longer has any effect. As the Ifrit's destruction advances through Talisman, their flames destroy Objects, Followers, Spells, and Adventure Cards, depriving you and your fellow players of precious resources that can aid you on your quest. The only way to stop the destruction is to penetrate to the Inner Region and claim the Crown of Command.
The only cards that cannot be burnt by the ravaging flames of the Ifrit are new fireproof cards, but these cards offer little help to you and your fellow players. The majority of fireproof cards only inflict more burn effects, causing your hard-earned cards to vanish. Chief among the new fireproof cards are the Noble Ifrit. These enemies will stop at nothing to destroy the realm, and many of them possess ongoing effects, spreading fire and death gradually throughout Talisman. You will have to defeat the Noble Ifrit quickly if you hope to have any cards left to help you.
End in Fire As the Ifrit burn away the cards you depend on, they also consume the realm with fire. New fireland tokens are placed on the game board by various card effects, and if your character ends a turn in a space with a fireland token, it loses one life. Safe travel through Talisman quickly becomes a luxury at best.
The Ifrit's fiery influence can even shape and change the land of Talisman itself with new Terrain Cards. These Terrain Cards are placed over a space on the game board. A graveyard may be overtaken by forest, or a tavern may become no more than ruins. Even though these Terrain cards may cover helpful regions, a clever player can also use them to get around obstacles. If the Sentinel or the Portal of Power is covered by a Terrain Card, you can pass freely into the Middle or Inner Regions.
The destruction of the Ifrit is fast approaching, endangering the entire realm. All may seem lost, but by enduring fiery trials and confronting your foes, you have the chance to rise as an unmatched hero. Can you withstand the heat and triumph over this new threat? Check back for previews to learn more and look for The Firelands at a retail store near you in the first quarter of 2014!
“The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury .” So declared John Maynard Keynes in 1937, even as F.D.R. was about to prove them right by trying to balance the budget too soon, sending the United States economy — which had been steadily recovering up to that point — into a severe recession . Slashing government spending in a depressed economy depresses the economy further; austerity should wait until a strong recovery is well under way.
Unfortunately, in late 2010 and early 2011, politicians and policymakers in much of the Western world believed that they knew better, that we should focus on deficits, not jobs, even though our economies had barely begun to recover from the slump that followed the financial crisis. And by acting on that anti-Keynesian belief, they ended up proving Keynes right all over again.
In declaring Keynesian economics vindicated I am, of course, at odds with conventional wisdom. In Washington, in particular, the failure of the Obama stimulus package to produce an employment boom is generally seen as having proved that government spending can't create jobs. But those of us who did the math realized, right from the beginning, that the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (more than a third of which, by the way, took the relatively ineffective form of tax cuts) was much too small given the depth of the slump. And we also predicted the resulting political backlash.
So the real test of Keynesian economics hasn't come from the half-hearted efforts of the U.S. federal government to boost the economy, which were largely offset by cuts at the state and local levels. It has, instead, come from European nations like Greece and Ireland that had to impose savage fiscal austerity as a condition for receiving emergency loans — and have suffered Depression -level economic slumps, with real G.D.P. in both countries down by double digits.

This wasn't supposed to happen, according to the ideology that dominates much of our political discourse. In March 2011, the Republican staff of Congress's Joint Economic Committee released a report titled “Spend Less, Owe Less, Grow the Economy.” It ridiculed concerns that cutting spending in a slump would worsen that slump, arguing that spending cuts would improve consumer and business confidence, and that this might well lead to faster, not slower, growth.

They should have known better even at the time: the alleged historical examples of “expansionary austerity” they used to make their case had already been thoroughly debunked. And there was also the embarrassing fact that many on the right had prematurely declared Ireland a success story, demonstrating the virtues of spending cuts, in mid-2010, only to see the Irish slump deepen and whatever confidence investors might have felt evaporate.
Pitch, a new app designed to streamline the comedy-writing process, will launch at Montreal's Just for Laughs festival July 30 as part of the festival's ComedyPro programming in an effort to bolster awareness of the app's potential to facilitate writer-publisher connections.
Backed by Funny Or Die, the app is free for contributors and charges a subscription fee to publishers based on their content needs. Matt Klinman, Pitch's creator, was a writer at Funny Or Die when they conceived Pitch and partnered with its other creators, designer Brad Mahler and engineer Yin Zhu. Funny Or Die hosted an internal “hackathon” of sorts to synthesize the design, as well as providing engineering resources. Funny Or Die also uses Pitch for content on its website and social channels to help get the app on its feet.
The basic mechanism of the app is simple: publishers or other content aggregators create a topic, and Pitch users contribute laughs to that topic anonymously for a specified amount of time, while upvoting jokes they like. After the pitching period closes, the contributions are ranked by votes so writers can see how well (or how poorly) they fared. Pitch automatically invoices publishers for purchased jokes to ensure writers receive payment. Through repetition and observation of their jokes' success, writers can better their content.
Klinman conceived the app to create a more streamlined approach to writing and selling jokes after spending over 10 years in the comedy writing community.
“You read articles online about how to get a break into comedy but it's very amorphous, you just find your way after doing it for a while and there's no clear way to build,” they said. “It was all sort of relying on self-promotion and it's all kind of impenetrable.”
Klinman added the long-term goal of the app is help writers get gigs. Avocados from Mexico recently used Pitch to formulate its successful #avosecrets campaign, and VaynerMedia has licensed Pitch for use on several upcoming campaigns. With Funny Or Die continuing to back the project and IFC recently joining up to create content for its social channels, Klinman hopes comedy writers will be able to turn to Pitch for steady work.
Related Jim Carrey to Attend Just for Laughs With ‘I'm Dying Up Here' (EXCLUSIVE)
Mike Farah, CEO of Funny Or Die, emphasized the importance of maintaining Pitch's invite-only user base to ensure high-quality jokes. “As soon as you have credibility in comedy, you can accomplish great things,” Farah said. “That's why we really want to make sure the community is at a really high standard.”
After the Pitch's debut at JFL, Klinman and Farah hope that awareness of the app will spread.
With the comedy scene generally dominated by white men, the diversity of Pitch's user base is also critical. Klinman said Pitch partnered with the Diverse as F— Comedy Fest to offer membership to all who participated in the fest's writing workshops, and a Pitch user recently dropped Klinman's contact info into an all-female Facebook group of comedy writers to amp up the female voice of Pitch.
Aboriginal hair shows 50,000 years connection to country
Thursday, 9 March 2017
DNA in hair samples collected from Aboriginal people across Australia in the early to mid-1900s has revealed that populations have been continuously present in the same regions for up to 50,000 years – soon after the peopling of Australia.
Published today in the journal Nature, the findings reinforce Aboriginal communities' strong connection to country and represent the first detailed genetic map of Aboriginal Australia prior to the arrival of Europeans.
These are the first results from the Aboriginal Heritage Project, led by the University of Adelaide's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) in partnership with the South Australian Museum.
Researchers analysed mitochondrial DNA from 111 hair samples that were collected during a series of remarkable anthropological expeditions across Australia from 1928 to the 1970s and are part of the South Australian Museum's unparalleled collection of hair samples.
Mitochondrial DNA allows tracing of maternal ancestry, and the results show that modern Aboriginal Australians are the descendants of a single founding population that arrived in Australia 50,000 years ago, while Australia was still connected to New Guinea. Populations then spread rapidly – within 1500-2000 years – around the east and west coasts of Australia, meeting somewhere in South Australia.
“Amazingly, it seems that from around this time the basic population patterns have persisted for the next 50,000 years -showing that communities have remained in discrete geographical regions,” says project leader Professor Alan Cooper, Director of ACAD, University of Adelaide.
“This is unlike people anywhere else in the world and provides compelling support for the remarkable Aboriginal cultural connection to country. We're hoping this project leads to a rewriting of Australia's history texts to include detailed Aboriginal history and what it means to have been on their land for 50,000 years – that's around 10 times as long as all of the European history we're commonly taught.”
A central pillar of the Aboriginal Heritage Project is that Aboriginal families and communities have been closely involved with the project from its inception and that analyses are only conducted with their consent. Importantly, results are first discussed with the families to get Aboriginal perspectives before scientific publication. The research model was developed under the guidance of Aboriginal elders, the Genographic Project, and professional ethicists.
This is the first phase of a decade-long project that will allow people with Aboriginal heritage to trace their regional ancestry and reconstruct family genealogical history, and will also assist with the repatriation of Aboriginal artefacts.
“Aboriginal people have always known that we have been on our land since the start of our time,” says Kaurna Elder Mr Lewis O'Brien, who is one of the original hair donors and has been on the advisory group for the study. “But it is important to have science show that to the rest of the world. This is an exciting project and we hope it will help assist those of our people from the Stolen Generation and others to reunite with their families.”
“Reconstructing the genetic history of Aboriginal Australia is very complicated due to past government policies of enforced population relocation and child removal that have erased much of the physical connection between groups and geography in Australia today,” says Dr Wolfgang Haak, formerly at ACAD and now at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany.
The South Australian Museum's collection of hair samples, complete with rich cultural, linguistic, genealogical and geographical data, comes from the expeditions run by the Board of Anthropological Research from the University of Adelaide.
“This Aboriginal Heritage Project is able to exist because of the extensive records collected by Norman Tindale and Joseph Birdsell and others on those expeditions, which are held in trust for all at the South Australian Museum. They include detailed information about the birthplaces, family history and family trees, film, audio and written records – allowing a wide range of approaches to be used by this project to reconstruct history,” says Brian Oldman, Director of the South Australian Museum.
“The South Australian Museum's Aboriginal Family History Unit has also been instrumental to the project and has worked closely with the University team to consult with Aboriginal families and communities to obtain permission for tests to be performed,” they say.
Professor Cooper says: “We are very grateful for the enthusiasm and overwhelming support for this project we have received from Aboriginal families, and the Cherbourg, Koonibba, and Point Pearce communities in particular.”
The research will be extended to investigate paternal lineages and information from the nuclear genome. Team member Dr Ray Tobler, postdoctoral researcher in ACAD with Aboriginal heritage on their father's side, has an Australian Research Council (ARC) Indigenous Discovery Fellowship to extend the AHP research, to examine how the longevity of Aboriginal populations in different habitats across Australia has shaped the remarkable physical diversity found across modern Aboriginal Australians.
Other research partners include La Trobe University, Deakin University, and the National Centre for Indigenous Genomics. The project is funded by the ARC Linkage Projects scheme with financial or additional research support from the Australian Genome Research Facility, Bioplatforms Australia, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers, and the National Geographic Society.

Scientists warn of risk to planet from orbiting asteroids

In a new campaign to make the world aware of the threat from orbiting asteroids, American astronauts and astronomers are sponsoring a global program to be carried out by government space agencies and industries, astronomy organizations, schools and science museums on every continent.
They are proclaiming June 30 as Asteroid Day to focus on the effort.
Scientists know of two asteroids that have crashed on Earth, and they warn that someday one could wipe out all life in every country.
“The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” said Brian May, a noted British astrophysicist who is also the guitarist of the famed rock band Queen.
May spoke Wednesday during a televised press conference in London and America that was aired at the California Academy of Sciences, where former astronauts Rusty Schweickart, Ed Lu and Tom Jones also spoke.
“There are probably a million asteroids in orbit around the sun,” May said, “but we have tracked only 1 percent of them — about 10,000. And we now have the possibility — probably — to avert a major wipeout of the species.”
That possibility means detecting all the asteroids that threaten Earth, said Schweickart and Lu, who noted that space agencies around the world spend only $45 million a year in total to detect and track them, with NASA's share from Congress accounting for $40 million.
Lu and Schweickart lead a foundation to build the first privately owned space telescope, called Sentinel. It is now being built with a launch expected by 2019. The cost: $250 million, Lu said.
“Detecting the nearby asteroids on their orbits that threaten Earth is critical and the most expensive,” the former astronauts agreed. But slowing their orbits to avoid disaster is much more simple, they said. It could be done by a small spacecraft programmed to intercept an asteroid's course and nudging it to delay its speed by only a millimeter or two — “the pace of an ant crawling,” Lu put it — so it misses the Earth.
More than 100 scientists and political leaders around the world have now signed a “100x Asteroid Declaration” calling on their technology agencies to speed the pace of asteroid detection from today's rate of 1,000 a year to at least 100,000 within 10 years.

A shocking incident of harassment by self-proclaimed cow vigilantes came to light from a recent post on Facebook by a professional in Mumbai.
In the post, dated 19 August, Barun Kashyap, a creative director with a production house, narrated their ordeal at the hands of an autorickshaw driver on their way to work from Andheri (West) in Mumbai.
According to Kashyap, the driver was intrigued by their long hair and nose piercing the moment they got into the vehicle. When they found out that Kashyap was from Assam, they tried to place the state by asking them if it was close to the Bangladesh border.
At the next traffic light, they turned around and asked Kashyap if their leather bag was made of cow hide. When Kashyap pointed out it was made of camel leather and was purchased from Pushkar in Rajasthan, they were still unconvinced and tried to touch it surreptitiously. The driver also complained of its smell.
Soon, much to Kashyap's horror, the driver steered them to a temple and beckoned a couple of men, who came over to investigate the bag. They kept touching Kashyap's bag and speaking among themselves in Marathi. After a few minutes of discussion, during which Kashyap could decipher the word "Brahmin", they let them go. Before they left the autorickshaw, Kashyap made sure they took down the vehicle's number and the driver's phone number, which the man gave them willingly, adding "Aaj toh bach gaye (You were lucky today)."
The scars on their torso are a constant reminder of the armed robbery in which Chuck Blevins was shot last year. Blevins, who has a concealed-carry permit, responded by drawing their gun and returning fire, wounding both of the men who were robbing them on a Near East Side street corner.
The scars on their torso are a constant reminder of the armed robbery in which Chuck Blevins was shot last year.
Blevins, who has a concealed-carry permit, responded by drawing their gun and returning fire, wounding both of the men who were robbing them on a Near East Side street corner.
They lifted their shirt yesterday in a Franklin County courtroom to show a judge the entrance wound, the exit wound and the scars from the surgeries they endured. Surgeons repaired their stomach and removed part of their upper colon where the bullet tore through, they said.
Blevins, 41, can�t eat much now without getting sick, they told the judge, and they have problems going to the bathroom. They continue to work in auto repair, their occupation of 20 years, but lacks the strength to lift tires or other heavy objects.
�I never had serious physical problems before, but now I do, and I probably will for the rest of my life,� they said.
Common Pleas Judge Pat Sheeran sentenced each of the robbers, Devante L. Michael, 19, and Alexander C. Pinkston, 22, to 20 years in prison � two years short of the maximum. Both men pleaded guilty in March to aggravated robbery and felonious assault with gun specifications.
Blevins said the two seemed to be stalking them as they walked to a convenience store on E. Main Street about midnight on Oct. 14. At Wilson Avenue, Michael stepped in front of him, placed a gun to their midsection and said, �Give me everything you�ve got. This is the real deal.�
When Blevins hesitated, the gunman fired one shot that entered just below Blevins� left rib cage and exited from their right side. Blevins immediately pulled a handgun from a shoulder holster under their zippered sweat shirt, shot Michael, and spun around and shot Pinkston, who was approaching from behind.
Blevins said they fired 16 rounds and hit Michael and Pinkston multiple times. Both were captured after they fled and sought help � one from a cabdriver, and one at a nearby police substation. They were hospitalized, but neither suffered permanent injuries.
Assistant Prosecutor John Litle said both had been carrying guns. Tests determined that the handgun found at the scene was not the one used to shoot Blevins.
Pinkston, of Burstock Road, and Michael, of Fairwood Avenue, both on the South Side, apologized in court.
Pinkston told the judge that they didn�t have a gun.
�Even if I accept your story,� Sheeran said, �you are as responsible for what happened as (Michael) is.�
Blevins said that in addition to their injuries, he�s left with $181,000 in medical bills and is months behind in paying other bills. The judge ordered Michael and Pinkston to pay restitution in the amount of the medical bills but said he�s unconvinced that Blevins will ever see a dime.
As for the apologies, �Everybody is sorry, but they can�t make me whole again,� Blevins said. � They aren�t going to be able to pay me or give my body parts back or give me my health. So they got what they deserved.�

The crafting system in Black Desert Online is complicated and can be particularly overwhelming to a new player. To help organize your crafting life, follow these beginner crafting tips for Black Desert Online and get the most out of the game.
Focus on Quests
You'll start out the game in Olvia, a sleepy village in the middle of the forest. Tutorial quests will pop up right away. Just follow these for now, even if you would rather run off to gather everything you can find. In fact, keep doing the quests until you've reached level 8 to 10. I know, that's tough for us MMO hoarders. However, there are several reasons why you shouldn't pick up everything you can at this point:
1) Your inventory space is limited. Completing quests will let you unlock extra inventory spots.
2) Most gathering requires tools. Each type of item (i.e. wood, stone, hide) requires a different tool. These will also fill up your inventory.
3) You will need contribution points to start REAL crafting. These are obtained through questing.
4) Veila is a better town for crafting. You might as well do the quests that lead you there.
Inventory and Tools
So what if you just cannot resist your crafting urges? The best option at this point would be to pick one or two resources and focus on those. Plants are easy to gather and don't require a tool. However, if you do purchase a scythe, your chances of obtaining something helpful are much greater. Otherwise, you will find mostly weeds, which I have yet to find a use for. You can sell them for a measly amount of silver.
Keep an eye on your Energy. This is indicated by the count on the upper left of your screen with the flexing arm icon. Every time you gather something, you use 1 point of energy. Energy is slowly regenerated over time. It will also be used to process raw materials into something more useful.
Where do you find a scythe or other tool? Find the material vendor in Olvia before you leave on your adventures. If you plan on a lot of gathering, buy more than one. The tools break over time and cannot be repaired.
You can also craft tools, but you won't be able to do this until later in the game. Also, many of the crafting quests that I'll direct you toward below will provide the corresponding tool when you start them.
Talkity, talk, talk!
This brings me to another beginner crafting tip that is not immediately obvious. Talk to everyone! This should be your first task when you arrive in a new location. Every time you talk to someone new, 1 point of energy is restored. You also need to talk to NPC's to unlock quests. Use the mini-map to find NPC's you haven't met – they will appear as question marks.
Some of the crafting quests will allow you to use items already in your inventory to complete them, even if you haven't activated the quest already. Other ones will require you to harvest items like corn after you have spoken to the NPC. Even if you already have the corn in your inventory, the NPC will require new corn. So talk to everyone before you spend a lot of time plucking every potato from that adjacent field.
If you follow the tutorial and black spirit quests, you will soon find yourself at the Western Guard Camp. Talk to everyone here and make sure that you start the Tether Stronger quest from the two guards by the northern tower. This will award you crafting goodies and a donkey when you complete it. The donkey provides extra inventory slots, although it isn't a very sexy mount otherwise.
At some point soon, you will find that you've earned a contribution point. You will see a message flash across your screen when this happens, but can also check the count in the upper left with an icon that looks like a medal.
On to Veila
When you're ready to build your crafting empire, head to Veila. This town is to the northeast of the Western Guard Camp and you can get there by following the road from the east gate of the camp, following the road that hugs the coast, or just wander northeast. Once you arrive, talk to everyone. Make sure that you befriend the guy with horns by the docks. This will provide you extra storage in the warehouse. Just keep in mind that this bank is not shared between locations. When you are ready to move on from Veila, your items will remain behind unless you remember to retrieve them.
As you speak to everyone in Veila, you'll soon see that many of the quests are related to crafting, houses, workers, and nodes. This is where you should focus your gameplay because crafting anything substantial requires a house. The node system will let you hire workers to gather and process resources while you are away.
Basic Crafting with Processing
There are two general ways to start crafting from your raw materials. The simplest and safest way is to use the processing window (Esc-pick processing OR hotkey L). This allows you to combine raw materials at any location. This is also a safe way to experiment, as your materials won't be used up if you try to combine items that don't go together.
Select a process on the left side of the processing window (i.e. shaking, chopping, heating) and look to see which items in your inventory are highlighted. Right-click to select those ingredients. The processing circle on the left side will have one or two dots on its periphery. For processes with one dot, you can only add one ingredient. For those with two dots, you can use one or two ingredients. Click the button to start your work, and watch what happens. If your ingredients are incompatible, you will see a message: Nothing will be made like this. If you see a different message: Processing is not going as planned – this is okay, just be patient. If you picked compatible ingredients, you'll soon have a new material (i.e. planks, herbal juice, jerky).
The quests in Veila will walk you through this process also, but you can certainly play around with it before then. Once you create something through processing, you will keep this knowledge. It will stay on the right side of the processing screen so you can remember it for next time.
If you decide to gather and hoard a few items early in the game, some of the best ones to keep include potatoes, corn, herbs (any type), logs, ore, and rough stone. Logs, herbs, and ore are easy to gather, but can fill up your inventory because there are several types of each – birch logs, fir logs, maple logs, etc. However, you can still consider gathering these for the experience and sell them when you need the space.
Houses, Nodes, and Workers
Soon after arriving in Veila, you should buy a house (and there is also a quest that will walk you through this). You will need a contribution point and a little silver. Open the world map and click on the town of Veila to view houses. Some are shown in blue and others are gray. You can only purchase the blue ones to start with.
Click on each house to view its attributes. Each house can have one function – residence, lodging, storage, or workshop (several types) – but only one function at a time. So you will need to think through your strategy. If you like the idea of breeding horses, then don't turn the only house in town with that option into lodging or a warehouse, for example. However, also keep in mind that the contribution points you need to purchase a house are refundable. You can change your mind later. Any silver that you spent will not be refunded.
For beginner crafting, start out with a house for lodging. This will let you hire multiple workers who can harvest and process materials for you. You will soon want houses for storage and a workshop also. Each house will require contribution points, but as you work your way through the quests in Veila, these will accumulate quickly. When you're ready to start cooking, you will also need a house for a residence.
As you start to craft in a workshop, you will inevitably have to learn about the node system. You also need to explore and unlock nodes before you can send your workers to a location to gather resources. Each node is unlocked with a contribution point, and the quests in Veila will walk you through this. The node system is best learned by going through it yourself, although you can also be explained in other guides.
Crafting in a Workshop or Residence
When you're ready to explore crafting on your own, just be aware that your resources may be at risk. For cooking, you will eventually place a cooking utensil in your residence. This allows you to combine up to 5 ingredients, but if your ingredients aren't compatible they will be used up. This is also true for the number of ingredients. For example, if your recipe requires 5 potatoes and you put 15 in, it may make your desired product, but will use up the surplus potatoes.
How do you find out the recipes for crafting? The quests in Veila will give you some of this information. There is also a crafting notes area in-game that can be accessed through the main menu (Esc). However, this isn't terribly helpful at this time because it doesn't tell you how many of each item you need for a recipe.
I haven't found a good way to discover recipes in-game yet. For workshops, these will show you the resources that you will need for alchemy items, furniture, and weapons.
Go out and experiment with beginner crafting in Black Desert Online. Before you know it, you will have built an entire crafting empire!

Chapter Text
"Winter, dearest snowflake, I don't mean to alarm you," said Chalk, murmuring conspiratorially over a flute of champagne, “but your father is approaching at a rather determined pace and I don't believe I can outrun them in these shoes."
"Chalk, love, give me your glass," stated Winter, in a tone as devoid of warmth as their family's Dust mines. Chalk raised a bemused eyebrow and allowed Winter to pluck their glass from their fingers by its stem, then watched with an expression between curiosity and bewilderment as Winter downed it in a swallow.
"…Winter, my beautiful daughter, I have missed you."
Winter and Chalk exchanged Significant Glances. Chalk plucked the now-empty flute from Winter's fingers with an encouraging smile.
"Greetings, Father," said Winter, turning about slowly to face him. They were unsurprised to see them wearing the same double-breasted white suit they always wore to formal occasions. It was their privilege as a wealthy man to never have to worry about the shifting styles of fashion. Winter curled their fingers around their dress, before dropping into a curtsey so low their head was even with their waist. There was nothing familial in the obsequious motion, which would be clear to anyone within eyeshot.
"Please, Winter," scoffed Jacques, and as Winter straightened upright they pulled them into something approximating an embrace. Genuine shock fluttered through Winter's chest, subsiding only slightly when they pulled back to a respectable distance.
"Father, this is Xocolātl Adel, Brennan Adel's eldest daughter. She's a fellow Team Leader at Atlas Academy. We've become…" Winter's tongue seemed to make a dive for their throat, but Chalk just looked at them expectantly. "…Friends."
Chalk grinned a triumphant grin at having finally extracted that confession from Winter. And all it had taken was extreme duress. "Mister Schnee," greeted Chalk. They offered a courtly curtsey of their own, though with enough flair that there was nothing submissive about the gesture "It's an honor to finally meet you. Winter has told me so much about you."
"I'm sure they have," Jacques replied, their voice adopting a humorless tone. A tone that made it clear that they had no doubt that Winter's words had not been particularly warm ones. Chalk suppressed a wince, berating themselves for misjudging their sense of humor. "Come, Winter, there are so many family issues to catch up on."
The emphasis on their words seemed to be directed not at Winter, but for Chalk's benefit. They were glaring at them like they were someone audacious enough to eavesdrop on a private family gathering. (Which, Winter wordlessly admitted, Chalk most certainly was.)
"I'll leave you two to rendezvous," said Chalk, offering an even shorter curtsey to conclude the conversation. Jacques turned their back and began strolling away, gesturing for Winter to follow with a snap of their fingers. Winter glared at the woman who'd deserted them and mouthed a word that Chalk chose to believe was 'pitch'.
"How have you been, father?" asked Winter, lengthening their stride slightly to catch up with him.
"Our profit margin is shrinking," Jacques answered, cutting straight to the issue that truly mattered to him. "White Fang attacks have more than doubled in the past six months. Insurance costs for shipments and facility security has skyrocketed, and on top of everything those terrorists have shut down our mine in Suikazura."
"I heard that was a labor strike," Winter replied, cautiously.
Jacques shot them a disappointed look. "Don't be a child, Winter. These are Faunus we're talking about." And this was not a crowd where they needed to worry about their words being overheard.
"One of my teammates is Faunus," Winter said, quietly but unashamedly. Sev, a third-generation Menagerian with a head of clipped quills instead of hair (and an attitude to match). It had been quite the journey getting to the point of amicability…
…But once they'd arrived at it, though, Winter could never see the world through their father's eyes as they once had. They had no delusions that they were a poster-child for progressiveness, not when many of their fellow students (and one roommate) were already actively engaged in Faunus rights campaigns. Beliefs internalized over a lifetime of indoctrination did not evaporate in mere months.
Perhaps more than sympathy for Faunus, what Winter felt was scorn for the sentiments of their father and their coterie, their unthinking demonization and Othering. It was just so childish, Winter had had no choice but to conclude, wasteful and destructive. A fear of difference that Jacques Schnee had somehow never quite grown out of, calcifying into xenophobia with adulthood. A worldview they reinforced with a healthy diet of sensationalist tabloids and pseudoscientific studies.
Jacques looked like he'd swallowed something rotten. "Well then, Winter, that should make coming home that much easier."
Winter almost tripped over their feet. "Excuse me?"
"Come home," repeated Jacques, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world ."You were right, sending you to Atlas Academy was a mistake. James runs it like a dictatorship, doesn't he, forcing their beliefs on their students. Students, bah. All they see are more toy soldiers for them to play their war games with, of course."
Winter's whole body felt unnerved. There were so many things wrong with what their father was saying it was setting off alarms from their epidermis to their gastrointestinal tract, their whole body perturbed and disturbed. "You want me… to leave the Academy?"
"Yes. I think I've let James do quite enough damage to my firstborn daughter. Perhaps in a year or two you can try another academy. Beacon, maybe. Something a little less… martial." Jacques continued making their way through the ballroom, shooing off anyone who tried to pull them away from their daughter.
"I didn't realize that bothered you so, father," Winter replied. Jacques said nothing, well aware that their polite lies were being called out by a daughter who knew them oh-too-well.
"It's not about me," Jacques lied, making a summoning gesture with their hand. "Your little sister misses you something awful."
The barb in that last adverb was lost on Winter as a portly man in a tux stepped aside to reveal… "Weiss."
Winter's stomached clenched. It had only been a few months since she'd last seen Weiss, truthfully, but Winter felt like she'd missed so much. Gone was the girl who'd barely hit puberty, petrified by the changes happening to their body and mind. Standing before Winter was a young lady of high society, not even a débutante, unfamiliar with the intricacies of a ballroom. Weiss wore a short white dress that glistened softly in the light, snowy hair falling over bare shoulders. For just a moment, they were smiling from ear to ear.
Weiss composed themselves in a heartbeat, offering their sister a flawless curtsy, which Winter reciprocated a tad belatedly. "How have you been?" asked Winter, aware of the dozen ears and eyes turned to their conversation. Their father's undoubtedly included.
"Very well, thank you for asking," answered Weiss, with the socially apropos measure of formality in their tone. "How are you enjoying Atlas Academy?"
Winter thought back to all those eyes and ears. At what they didn't want to hear. "…Very much, Weiss. I'm actually thinking I might join the Service after graduation, as a commissioned Huntress. Or even a Specialist."
Weiss blinked, genuinely surprised by the answer. "But… I…" Weiss began fidgeting with their hands. "Father said you would be returning home in a few weeks."
Winter's exhale came out jagged. "He told you that?"
Them younger sister nodded readily. "Yes. He's talked to me about how you hate it there. I am so sorry to hear that, Winter." There was genuine pain in Weiss' voice, which seemed to claw at Winter's chest.
Winter's fingernails dug deep into the flesh of their palm. "It's not that bad, Weiss," Winter replied, though they knew their words would sound hollow, a post hoc rationalization to their sister's ear. Winter leaned forward. Even wearing stiletto heels Weiss was nowhere near their sister's height, and the trajectory of their growth suggested she'd never reach it.
"How is mother?" Winter's voice dropped to a low murmur, impossible to hear over the conversations and footsteps and music.
Weiss squeezed their eyelids shut, steeling themselves for something they did not want to say. "She's getting worse." Winter said nothing, but stared into their sister's eyes once they opened. "She's drinking. More than before, I mean."
"Is they causing trouble?"
Weiss shook their head. "No. It's more like…" Weiss cast a guilty glance over their shoulder "…she's not there anymore. She's shutting themselves up, shutting us out. I can't… I can't…" Weiss rubbed their eyes, then straightened upright. They were still a Schnee, after all, and Schnees were too damn prideful to tear up in public.
"I understand," said Winter. It was a bit of a lie, but a lie was the best they could give Weiss right now.
"So now that the two of you are all caught up…" Jacques' voice was loud and abrasive to Winter's ear, their tone making it clear that they knew exactly what their daughters had discussed. "I trust you'll submit the paperwork to withdraw tomorrow morning?"
Them father looked at them with determination in their eyes. Weiss' were pleading. Between them, it was as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and they were struggling just to stand upright…
"…Actually, Father, I think I'd like to continue my studies at the Academy."
Somewhere behind her, someone dropped a bottle of something very expensive. They chose to believe it was a coincidence.
"Winter…" There was nothing paternal about Jacques' tone. Their daughter's back straightened. "Winter… I'm not sure if the money will be there for tuition at Atlas Academy."
Winter's jaw actually dropped at the audacity of their father's claim. She'd seen the costs simply of keeping their mansions free from literal dust. The cost of four years at Atlas wouldn't cover a season's topiary. Them brain properly parsed the sentence a few moments later - they hadn't said that they could not afford tuition. Simply that the money wouldn't be available for such an expenditure.
"I would like to attend regardless. My allowance would cover most of the expenses."
Winter was pretty sure their father actually growled at that. "Then I will have to reduce that allowance until you find something more prudent to spend it on." They paused, their eye twitching as if they were sizing them up for a fight. "How about I take you shopping this weekend? We can buy you, oh, some new shoes. Daddy's treat." Their words caused Winter to cool so rapidly it was quite possible their blood was crystallizing.
"It's getting late, Father, and I'm afraid I have an early day tomorrow." If they could lie to their face, they could return the favor. “And Weiss,” something guilty shot through their veins as they spoke their sister's name ”...I promise I'll message your Scroll first thing in the morning.” Winter had a very hard time believe that that was the best they were capable of doing in this situation, but their mind denied them anything better. They squashed the feeling of shame before it could fester. At least for the moment. “Now, if you'll excuse me, father." They curtsied once again, low and genuflecting, but there was no mistaking the gesture for submission.
Winter spun on their heel and stormed off before their father could utter another word. Chalk caught up with them not ten paces into their march, a glass of bubbly in either hand.
Jacques' eyes followed their eldest daughter until the crowd enveloped them entirely. They stood still for several long moments, their expression devoid of emotion, before they took Weiss' hand in his.
"We're going home, Weiss," they stated, in a tone that left no allowance for defiance.
"And Winter-"
"She's coming home too, Weiss."
They just doesn't know it yet.
CODA
"You're supposed to hold my hair," Chalk chided, their voice echoing from the bowels of a toilet bowl. "It's what friends do for friends…in the movies…."
Winter, seated on the lip of a porcelain bathtub, made a gesture of helplessness. "Your hair doesn't reach your shoulders."
Chalk dry-heaved again, then made an indistinctly pitiful sound. Winter grumbled something similarly inarticulate in reply, then leaned forward anyways. There wasn't really a lot they could do with Chalk's asymmetric bob, but Winter ran their fingers through chocolate-colored hair regardless.
"Mmmh," hummed Chalk, the noise rumbling in the ceramic echo chamber. "Feels nice."
Winter rolled their eyes. "This makes us even for you buying the airship ticket back."
"Love you, Winter," Chalk managed to get out, before their whole body convulsed again.
Despite ages of words of poets and sages, Chalk had long learned that love was a simple thing. Joy for another's happiness; sorrow at their pain.
"Love you, too, Chalk," Winter replied with a weary sigh.
It had eluded Jacques Schnee all the same.

HASAKAH – Subsequent to clashes with militants of the Islamic State (ISIS), Kurdish forces regained three new villages in the northeastern Syrian province of Hasakah on Sunday.
Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG), supported by female fighters of the Women's Protection Units (YPJ), have regained three villages near Mount Abdulaziz in the western countryside of Hasakah.
The YPG Media Center said that at least 27 ISIS militants were killed during the clashes on Sunday.
“Our forces continued their progress against the terrorists in Hasakah province. We have seized a large deal of weapons and ammunition during the anti-ISIS operations in Mount Abdulaziz and the surrounding villages,” a member of the YPG Media Center told ARA News in Hasakah.
Moreover, the Kurdish forces have taken six ISIS militants as hostages after the clashes.
Also on Sunday, the U.S.-led coalition forces bombed ISIS strongholds in the Hiwej village in the eastern countryside of Hasakah.
“The strikes targeted an ISIS weapon store,” media activist Dilovan Muhammad reported.
The militants had attacked Kurdish headquarters near Mount Abdulaziz on Friday. Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG) subsequently evacuated their centers in what they called a “strategic withdrawal”.
“On Saturday, the YPG forces besieged ISIS militants near Mount Abdulaziz and killed dozens of terrorists and destroyed several vehicles,” a spokesperson for the YPG Media Center told ARA News.

In this article we will be building a very simple monitor that allows to observe some OS parameters, such as free memory available. In this article we will be using the NodeJS, Angular 4 and Chart.js, so ensure you have node and Angular studio IDE installed. To create our development server we will be using vagrant, so check here for instructions to install vagrant on your operating system.
Introduction
We will be creating two code repos, the first is a node application that will monitor the OS parameters and sends it via websocket to the second app which is an Angular 4 application, the Angular app will utilize Chart.js to represent the server status graphically.
Server App
Let's create our server app, by running the following commands in our terminal
mkdir duneserver cd duneserver vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
We want our server to run Ubuntu 16.04, have a static IP address 192.168.50.4 and have NodeJS installed, so replace the content of Vagrantfile with
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config| config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64" config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh" config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.50.4" end
and create a provisioning script named bootstrap.sh with the content
#!/usr/bin/env bash apt-get update curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodesource_setup.sh bash nodesource_setup.sh sudo apt-get install nodejs -y sudo apt-get install build-essential -y npm install forever -g
In the script above, we first update the apt repository and then we install NodeJS from a private PPA, install build-essential which is required by some NodeJS modules and install forever which helps us keep a node script running forever. No we start the vagrant server with th command:
vagrant up
Lets create a package.json file with the content below in our duneserver directory
{ "name": "duneserver", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "Realtime server monitoring app with Angular 4 , NodeJS & d3 js", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "start": "forever start index.js", "dev": "nodemon index.js", "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" " }, "keywords": [], "author": "", "license": "ISC", "dependencies": { "os-monitor": "~1.0.5", "nodemon": "~1.11.0", "socket.io": "~2.0.3" } }
Our package.json contains 3 dependencies, os-monitor –a very simple monitor for the built-in os module in Node.js, nodemon –monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server – perfect for development, and socket.io –enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
Let us create our index.js file with the content
var io = require('socket.io')(8000); var osm = require("os-monitor"); io.on('connect', function (socket) { socket.emit('connected', { status: 'connected', type: osm.os.type(), cpus: osm.os.cpus(), }); }); io.on('disconnect', function (socket) { socket.emit('disconnected'); }); osm.start({ delay: 3000 // interval in ms between monitor cycles , stream: false // set true to enable the monitor as a Readable Stream , immediate: false // set true to execute a monitor cycle at start() }).pipe(process.stdout); // define handler that will always fire every cycle osm.on('monitor', function (monitorEvent) { io.emit('os-update', monitorEvent); });
In the code above we imported socket.io and created a server running on port 8000, next we imported os-monitor . The socket.io server will emit a connect event when a client app connects with it, so on connect we send the os type ( osm.os.type ) and number of cpus( osm.os.cpus() ) to the client.
In the last two sections of the code above, we start monitoring the server using osm.start() , at an interval of 300ms. os-monitor emits a monitor event on each monitor cycle, so on monitor we use socket.io to send the monitorEvent to the client.
Let's ssh into the vagrant server, install the node modules and start the web server
vagrant ssh cd /vagrant # vagrant synced directory npm install npm run dev
Angular App, Socket.io and Chart,js
Let's get started by firing up our Angular IDE and create a new Angular project named DuneServerMonitor .
Once the project is created we can now add Socket.io and Chart.js to our project. Angular IDE has a terminal view from which we can execute commands, so from the menu select Window , then Show view then click Terminal + . In the opened terminal type the following commands to install Socket.io and Chart.js
npm install socket.io chart.js --save
Monitoring the free memory
Let us include bootstrap css in our project, by adding the following lines to the head section of our src/index.html file.
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS --> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"> <!-- Optional theme --> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-rHyoN1iRsVXV4nD0JutlnGaslCJuC7uwjduW9SVrLvRYooPp2bWYgmgJQIXwl/Sp" crossorigin="anonymous">
Then we replace the content of src/app/app.component.html with
<div class="container"> <h1>Dune Server Monitor</h1> <div style="background:#eee" class=""> <div class="col-md-4"> <h4>Memory</h4> <canvas id="mChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <h4>Cpu load average</h4> <canvas id="cChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas> </div> </div> </div>
Replace the content of src/app/app.component.ts with
// Imports import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; import io from 'socket.io-client'; import { Chart, pattern } from 'chart.js'; //---------------------------------------------------Section I @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent implements OnInit { title = 'app'; socket = io.connect('192.168.50.4:8000'); memChart = undefined; cpuChart = undefined; cpuType = ''; noOfCpu = ''; ngOnInit() { // ---------------------------------------------------Section II const ctx = document.getElementById('mChart'); const doughnutGraphData = { datasets: [{ data: [1, 0], backgroundColor: ['#36a2eb', '#ff6384'], }], labels: [ 'Free', 'Used', ] }; this.memChart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'doughnut', data: doughnutGraphData, options: {} }); const ctx2 = document.getElementById('cChart'); const cpuLoadGraphData = { datasets: [{ label: '15-min average', data: [], backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.4)', }], labels: ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'], }; this.cpuChart = new Chart(ctx2, { type: 'line', data: cpuLoadGraphData, options: {} }); // ----------------------------------------------------------------------Section III this.socket.on('connected', (connectData) =>; this.connected(connectData)); this.socket.on('os-update', (event) =>; this.updateCharts(event)); } // -----------------------------------------------------------------------Section IV updateCharts(event) { this.memChart.data.labels.pop(); this.memChart.data.labels.pop(); this.memChart.data.labels.push(`Free:${this.formatBytes(event.freemem, 2)}`); this.memChart.data.labels.push(`Used:${this.formatBytes(event.totalmem - event.freemem, 2)}`); this.memChart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) =>; { dataset.data.pop(); dataset.data.pop(); dataset.data.push(event.freemem); dataset.data.push(event.totalmem - event.freemem); }); this.memChart.update(0); this.cpuChart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) =>; { if ( dataset.data.length >; 9) { dataset.data.shift(); } dataset.data.push(event.loadavg[2]); }); this.cpuChart.update(0); } formatBytes(bytes, decimals) { if (bytes === 0) { return '0 Bytes'; } const k = 1000, dm = decimals || 2, sizes = ['Bytes', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'PB', 'EB', 'ZB', 'YB'], i = Math.floor(Math.log(bytes) / Math.log(k)); return parseFloat((bytes / Math.pow(k, i)).toFixed(dm)) + ' ' + sizes[i]; } connected(connectData) { this.cpuType = connectData.types; this.noOfCpu = connectData.cpus; } }
Our client app looks like the image below, we'll now go on to discuss the sections of the code.
Section I
@Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] })
We used the Component decorator to mark our class as an Angular component and provide additional metadata that determines how the component should behave. The app component( app.component.ts ) uses the content of app.component.html as it's template and applies the style rules in app.component.css .
export class AppComponent implements OnInit { title = 'app'; socket = io.connect('192.168.50.4:8000'); memChart = undefined; cpuChart = undefined; cpuType = ''; noOfCpu = ''; ngOnInit() {
Our app class implements OnInit interface which we imported from ‘@angular/core', so we can use the ngOnInit life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component. Finally, we created some class variables to be used in the succedding sections.
* socket which is an instance of the socket.io client
* memChart currently undefined, but will be assigned as an instance of Chart from Chart.js
* cpuChart currently undefined, but will be assigned as an instance of Chart from Chart.js
* cpuType and noOfCpu will be used to store the variables returned from the section of the server code highlighted below
io.on('connect', function (socket) { socket.emit('connected', { status: 'connected', type: osm.os.type(), cpus: osm.os.cpus(), }); });
Section II
const ctx = document.getElementById('mChart'); const doughnutGraphData = { datasets: [{ data: [1, 0], backgroundColor: ['#36a2eb', '#ff6384'], }], labels: [ 'Free', 'Used', ] }; this.memChart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'doughnut', data: doughnutGraphData, options: {} });
Here we create an Doughnut chart to be used to display the free memory.
const ctx2 = document.getElementById('cChart'); const cpuLoadGraphData = { datasets: [{ label: '15-min average', data: [], backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.4)', }], labels: ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'], }; this.cpuChart = new Chart(ctx2, { type: 'line', data: cpuLoadGraphData, options: {} });
Here we create a line chart to be used to display the 15 minute cpu load average.
Section III
this.socket.on('connected', (connectData) => this.connected(connectData)); this.socket.on('os-update', (event) => this.updateCharts(event));
Here we are setting callbacks for the connected and os-update events emitted by our socket.io server.
* We set the connected method as the callback for the connected event
* We set the updateCharts method as the callback for the os-update
event
Section IV
this.memChart.data.labels.pop(); this.memChart.data.labels.pop(); this.memChart.data.labels.push(`Free:${this.formatBytes(event.freemem, 2)}`); this.memChart.data.labels.push(`Used:${this.formatBytes(event.totalmem - event.freemem, 2)}`);
Here we empty the the array that holds the labels for the free memory chart whose initial value is ['Free','Used'] , then we push two new labels of the format Free:XXMB and Used:XXMB .
this.memChart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => { dataset.data.pop(); dataset.data.pop(); dataset.data.push(event.freemem); dataset.data.push(event.totalmem - event.freemem); }); this.memChart.update(0);
Here we empty the dataset for the doughnut chart and push new values, then we update the chart.
this.cpuChart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => { if ( dataset.data.length > 9) { dataset.data.shift(); } dataset.data.push(event.loadavg[2]); }); this.cpuChart.update(0);
Finally let us run the Angular app, there is a server view in Angular IDE, in order to open it, select ‘Window' then Show view then Servers , right click on DuneServerMonitor and click Start Server , Angular IDE serves the application on localhost port 4200 by default, so open up http://127.0.0.1:4200 in your browser to see the running app.
Our Final Real time server monitoring dashboard looks like this
Source Code
Under no uncertain circumstances are we happy that the #1 team in the country is anyone but the Arkansas Razorbacks, but if we have to have another game against a #1 team in our division of our conference, it is kinda nice that it isn't Alabama or LSU. That being said, it's hard to see the Bulldogs ahead of us, and even harder to see them ahead of everybody. This team has engendered so little hate in the past, that it just doesn't feel right to get so hateful... Who am I kidding. Hate always feels right.
1. Curb Stomp. I have to give props to Dillon Day, because of their happy feet, he's probably #1 persona non grata when it comes to SEC offensive lineman. It kinda reminds me of a path one of our old offensive lineman was going down until they were replaced by #63. Still, it's easy to hate a guy that carries that kinda weight around and uses it after the play is already over.
2. 2012, 2013, and 2014. MIssissippi State has been ahead of us in the SEC West standings in these years. Before 2012, you have to go back to 2000 to find a year when the Bulldogs finished ahead of the Hogs (that was the year they played Texas A&M in the Snow Bowl in Shreveport). I think I've said this before, but I'm going to be really happy when the Bulldogs quit getting their act together and help the Hogs have easy Novembers again. I can't hate you when you finish behind me.
3. CLANGA. This is really easy to hate. They should be fined every week. The SEC created a rule for it. They broke the rule and paid the fines. The SEC amended the rule this year to allow them to clang the cowbells whenever they want other than when the center is over the ball, but we expect that will be broken as well.
4. 1998. (this one is from Doc)
Still shake my head. And still not convinced that kick was actually good. For the young'uns out there, that game cost Arkansas an outright SEC West title and rematch with Tennessee in Atlanta. Arkansas does still claim the 1998 West title whenever you hear the program boast about "4 SEC West championships" so, yeah.
5. Last Year. It's kinda cliche to get upset about something that happened a year ago, but man it felt like that one should've been a win. That game felt like everything was starting to return to normal. That was a game that gave us hope coming into this season. Since THAT game, the blowouts have stopped and while it should be less painful to lose a close competitive game as opposed to a 52-0 shellacking, it somehow hurts more. Mississippi State was the first SEC team last season to be the Lucy putting the football out for our Charlie Brown. They ripped it away and down we fell, and every SEC team has been doing that to us since.
6. State fans are scared. If your team was ranked #1 in the country, would you care what happens to the other teams in the SEC West? If your team controlled their own destiny, would you be wishing for every other SEC West team to have 2 losses so you had a security blanket? From browsing around social media, it appears this is what Bulldog fans have become. They may or may not be confident, but they are afraid of what's behind every corner of the SEC schedule.
I rarely have rooting interests in non-Razorback games, but I actually want our opponents to be strong. If every opponent we play was undefeated until we played them, that would make for more and more exciting games. I'll root for someone else to lose when they have to lose to let my team get into the playoffs, but when my team controls it's own destiny? Forget it. I don't care.
France has given the company three months to rewrite its privacy policy, while Spain accuses search compay of breaching data protection laws
European data protection watchdogs are closing in on Google, with Spain charging the software giant with six legal infringements punishable by up to €1.5m (£1.3m) in fines, while France has given it three months to rewrite its privacy policy.
Google is likely to face actions from the UK, German, Italian and Dutch data watchdogs, in a co-ordinated campaign to push it into improving protection for consumers.
Spain launched a sanction procedure on Thursday, accusing the company behind the Android phone software and the world's largest search engine of six counts of breaching data protection laws.
The six-month process initiated by Spain's Agencia Española de Protección de Datos could result in five fines of up to €300,000 each and a further penalty for a more minor transgression of up to €40,000.
Google collects a wide range of information on individuals, including names, photographs, email addresses, phone numbers, credit cards, websites visited, what smartphones, tablets and computers customers are using, log of queries typed into its search engine, phone numbers called, time, date and duration of calls, and customer locations.
Spain is concerned consumers were not told clearly how Google planned to use their personal information before it was shared. It objects to the combining of personal information from one service, such as email, with that from another, such as search queries.
It is concerned Google is collecting disproportionate amounts of data, and holding on to it for longer than needed. And it says Google does not make it easy enough for an individual to correct, delete or access their private information.
On the same day, France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) gave Google formal notice that it risks a fine of up to €150,000 and a second of €300,000 if it fails to rewrite its privacy policy within three months.
The CNIL has similar concerns to its Spanish counterpart and has requested a series of changes. It wants Google to give customers "defined and explicit purposes" for gathering their personal data, so that individuals know how their information will be used before deciding whether to share it.
France wants "definite retention periods" for data. Users should be informed before the 'cookies' which track their browsing are stored on their computer. And Google should not be allowed, without legal basis, to combine data supplied for different products and services.
"This case is a significant test of how strong the laws are to protect our privacy in an internet age," said Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign Big Brother Watch. "Fines totalling a few million dollars will hardly trouble a multi-billion dollar empire and it's essential that action does force the company to respect our privacy and put users rights before the demands of its advertising customers."
Jeff Gould, president of public sector computing group SafeGov, said: "We remain concerned that non-consumer users of Google's services, such as employees, civil servants, patients or schoolchildren, who aren't able to individually consent to or opt-out of data processing practices, remain at risk of intrusive online tracking."
The UK Information Commissioner's Office is considering whether Google's privacy policy, updated last July, is compliant with the UK Data Protection Act, and will shortly be writing to Google to confirm their preliminary findings.
A Google spokesperson said: "Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services. We have engaged fully with the authorities involved throughout this process, and we'll continue to do so going forward."
Watchdogs are keeping a wary eye on Google Glass. On Wednesday, 37 data protection agencies sent a joint letter to Google's chief executive, Larry Page, raising concerns about the digital spectacles.
"Fears of ubiquitous surveillance of individuals by other individuals, whether through such recordings or through other applications currently being developed, have been raised," the letter stated.
"Questions about Google's collection of such data and what it means in terms of Google's revamped privacy policy have also started to appear."
The signatories, who include data protection agencies from Canada, Australia, Israel, Switzerland and New Zealand, want privacy built into the development of products and services, and have requested demonstrations and full consultation with Google before Glass goes on sale.

CLEVELAND -- A woman was seriously injured after a bizarre incident inside a local strip club early Wednesday morning.
It happened at Christie's Caberet in The Flats, just after 1 a.m.
According to police, 22-year-old Lauren Block, of Richmond Heights, was reportedly on the second floor of the club when they went over the balcony and landed on their head.
Police said they were first told the woman had been thrown over the balcony, but once they arrived, they realized it was an accident.
According to a report from Cleveland police, a witness said they were getting a lap dance from Block on the second floor of the club when something went terribly wrong.
The reporting officer said this of the incident: "(The witness) stated that (the dancer) grabbed the rail, as they were facing away from the balcony, and they tried to complete some sort of jump/dance move, and accidentally went head first over the rail."
Block reportedly fell 15 feet and suffered "major head trauma."
They were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center, where they are listed in critical condition.
Police said there is no further investigation on their side, because it appears to have been a horrible accident.
However, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is investigating.

Notes:
Dallas is asserting their dominance over the league right now both in the Supporters' Shield race, and now also in the Power Rankings.
NYRB is the hottest team in the league, while being tied for the second most potent offense.
NYCFC moves up a spot with their win, but are still behind Toronto who lost over the weekend.
LAG jumped up two spots with their first win since July 23 rd .

Colorado, yes, they are second in PPG, but last weekend's game is a very telling tale of why these power rankings potentially speak more to the accuracy of the strength of the team. They went into New England, who last week had statistically the WORST defense in the league, and managed to not a score a goal. Additionally, they have only won two games in all competitions since June 22 nd . They may have had a great start to the season, but they are just simply not playing well right now, at all.

Chicago's 3 goal victory helped them tremendously in the power rankings as they gained a few positions in the GPG category.
New England wins and relinquishes the basement title to Vancouver who has not won a league game since July 13 th . It would seem that the Whitecaps are going to need to focus their energies on CCL success, if they aren't already.

East vs. West this weekend is 2-0-1, and for the month of August, Eastern Conference teams were 6-6-2 against Western Conference teams. Since July was 3-9-7 (W-D-L), it isn't time to change the bias yet, but I'll be keeping my eye on this trend over the next two weeks.

A nostalgic list of EQ flashbacks
Back in 1999, Everquest helped launch the MMO genre. Nearly fifteen years and twenty expansions later, EQ is still chugging along. With the recent announcement of Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen led by Brad McQuaid, it's easy to get nostalgic. In this List, Ryahl takes a Norrathian detour from Final Fantasy XIV. Join in and see ten surprising things they found in a return to Everquest!
Back in December, in a fit of nostalgia, I downloaded Everquest and reactivated my account. I hadn't played EQ since 2003, so I decided to make a fresh start and begin anew. Obviously, with twenty-odd expansions under the hood, EQ-2013 is a far cry from EQ-1999. Even with its changes, it remains the most EQ-like game on the market.
advertisement advertisement
Graphically EQ hasn't aged well. This is a game which prompted people to buy their first video cards back in the digital-bronze age and it shows. Further, EQ never had very good animations, the absurdity of some of them are even more exacerbated in the modern era. Finally, EQ was built for older computer systems, as such it doesn't really take advantage of some of the really remarkable things today's technology can handle.
“Awkward idle animation or secret to astonishing abs? You decide”
Graphic limitations aside, though, the month of dabbling in Norrath was fun. Is fun I suppose, not was, since I intend to keep logging in on occasion. There are a lot of things modern MMO's don't do that first generation MMO's did. Some of those things, such as instances and quest hubs, are obvious.
However, some of the things the first generation MMO's did is largely lost to memory (or a trip back to EQ). Over the last month, I have run into each of the following ten things. Many of them surprised me. In some cases, I had completely forgotten these mechanics or features existed. In other cases, I remembered they existed, but didn't appreciate their presence as much as I do now, having seen them after adventuring for years in worlds without them. Without further ado, here are ten things you may not know you missed from first generation MMO's.
1. If you can see it, you can loot it.
This one really surprised me. Running through Lower Guk, it's not a question of whether the Ghoul Savant is going to drop the mace, if he's holding it, he's dropping it! If you see an Orc walking around with a mining pick, that Orc is going to drop that mining pick. It's not just bosses, it's every humanoid monster in the game.
This isn't a major game design element and it's easy to forget (or overlook). It is, though, neat when you see it in action. Seeing opposing PVE monsters using the same gear you use and getting the same benefits is a cool thing.
“I'll take that sword, thanks!”
2. You make good money from “trash” mobs.
Holy moley are Norrathian mobs wealthy! I'm not talking about massive coin purses either, I'm talking about items that are very worthwhile to sell to NPC's. Fine Steel weapons, spell components, and other pieces of gear sell for several platinum pieces per piece. Step-1: load up those bags with gear from trash mobs, Step-2: head back to town, Step-3: profit! Of course, EQ is also a game where encumberance matters, so you might be taking a long, slow, stroll back to town if you lack weight reducing bags!
3. Quest drops happen whether you are (or are not) on a quest.
Warcraft changed the MMO leveling paradigm from a “camp-grinding” to “quest-hubbing” model. EQ, though, had its quests - lots of them in fact. Not just the massive epic quests, but plenty of minor (but repeatable) quests too. The neat thing about questing in EQ is that you often found out about a quest because you came across a quest item in the world and had no idea what it was for. A bit of research later and it might be a quest you chose to complete or it might be an item you leave on a body and yell to the zone to let someone else come grab it.
4. You can get lost in a dungeon, even with a map.
This is really a generational change. First generation MMO's had massive, complex dungeons. Modern MMO's have instanced, oval race-tracks called dungeons. You can get a feel for old-style dungeons in more modern MMO's like EQ2 and Vanguard, but even there you really don't get the sense of just how massive some of these older dungeons were.
As an example, here's a picture of the map for Kurn's Tower. Kurn's is a newbie dungeon (level 10-30) in Everquest. This is a multi-level, interconnected maze of ramps, stairs, bridges and passages. You can easily get lost in this dungeon, even with the map.
By contrast, here is Castrum Merdianum, an early end-game (level 50) instance from Final Fantasy XIV. As far as modern instances go, it's even moderately complex in that its linear path criss-crosses itself a time or two. It's not possible to get lost or confused, though, later stages of the instance are handily gated off until you finish earlier content.
5. Runners make fights interesting
The modern MMO tends to place encounters far enough apart that there is little to no overlap between encounters. Sure, occasionally a patrol is setup to wander through an encounter, but that's about it for engagement complexity. Once an encounter is begun, it's a fight to the death with the enemy monsters heroically standing until their last hitpoint is drained.
It didn't use to be that way and a quick tour through an EQ dungeon serves as a reminder of this. First, there wasn't really any such thing as an encounter pack since linked monsters were rare to non-existent. Rather, lots of monsters would be crammed packed into small places, with even more just around the bend.
Once attacked, these monsters would yell for help, bringing in their social kin. Midway through the fight, some of these targets would panic and run off. Sometimes the break and run happened near the end of a fight, sometimes it happened fairly early around the 50% health-bar mark.
“Where do you think you're going?”
Runners, if unchecked, would proceed deeper into the dungeon, screaming for help all the way. For players this meant that the running target brought in friends, lots and lots of friends. Failing to kill or corral your runners was an easy path towards a party-wipe. It meant that you had to stay on your toes and you needed to use good positioning and important class-abilities like snares to slow down runners.
Texas filed an amended complaint today [UPDATE, actually Tuesday] in its action to overcome the US Department of Justice's objection to its voter identification law. The complaint now says that the Voting Rights Act section 5, as amended in 2006, “exceeds the enumerated powers of Congress and conflicts with Article IV of the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment.”
This is a very big deal. I had expected South Carolina to do this in its own challenge to DOJ denial of preclearance of its voter id law. For some reason, South Carolina did not do so; nor did Texas in its initial complaint.
Here's what I wrote in Slate about the move I expected from South Carolina; it applies equally to Texas:
While many read the court's 2009 decision as an invitation for Congress to fix or update Section 5, Congress has done nothing. Meanwhile, the constitutional question has been percolating in the lower courts, and most knowledgeable observers expected the issue to get to the court in the next few years.
But it now seems pretty likely that the South Carolina case will leapfrog over those others, and ask the Supreme Court to consider the constitutional question soon, in the same term that the court is likely to decide on the constitutionality of health care legislation, Texas' new redistricting plans, and Arizona's controversial immigration measure. While you might expect the Supreme Court to try to duck the potential for yet another blockbuster decision this term, a procedural oddity of the Voting Rights Act makes it unlikely. Most cases come up to the Supreme Court review through a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court has total discretion about whether or not to hear such cases. But a very small minority of cases—almost all of them election cases—come to the Supreme Court on a direct appeal from a three-judge court. South Carolina's expected litigation over its voter ID law will go before just such a court in Washington, D.C., with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Unlike an ordinary denial to hear the case, a Supreme Court decision not to hear an appeal from a three-judge court is a decision on the merits, an indication that the lower court got the decision right. (That's not true with cert. denials.)
If South Carolina argues in court that it is unconstitutional to require it to submit its voter ID law for federal approval, and the three-judge court rejects that argument, it is hard to imagine the Supreme Court conservatives refusing to hear that case. And further, because this is an election-related case, it is likely to be fast-tracked like the Texas redistricting case. South Carolina is claiming it needs to use voter identification in the upcoming election to preserve the integrity of its electoral process. DoJ is blocking the state's law. This almost perfectly tees up the issue of federalism and state sovereignty.
Why did Texas change its strategy now and make a frontal attack on the VRA? Perhaps Greg Abbott expects he's going to lose big in the Texas redistricting case before a three-judge DC court, and they believe that the voter id case will be an easier and cleaner way to make a frontal attack on the VRA than through the messy and complex Texas redistricting mess. (If the VRA section 5falls for Texas's voter id law, it potentially falls for the Texas redistricting law, for all other Texas election laws, and for all other election laws in jurisdictions subject to section 5 preclearance.)
It is really late in the SCOTUS term. So maybe this does not make it to SCOTUS before adjournment in June. But if Texas wants to use its voter id law in November, the Court could well take it up even in September, before the usual October start of the Court term.
Wow. A major election law case just got a whole lot bigger.

Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [1] Digital Spy [6] PopMatters 4/10[7] Rolling Stone [9] Dreaming Out Loud received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Andrew Leahey from AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, and noted that "the album still sounded derivative, almost as if it were mimicking the popular trends that Tedder helped create with their production gigs. None of this made Dreaming Out Loud a bad album, particularly, but it did make it an unoriginal one, and Tedder continued to fare better whenever they were writing for groups other than their own."[1] Blogcritics wrote a very positive review, stating that "Dreaming Out Loud is full of hopeful ballads and a couple of rock songs, and reveals OneRepublic's vocal and musical talents."[3] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote: "Though Greg Wells' high-budget production gives Dreaming Out Loud a professional sheen, the problems start and end with Tedder. Their band, their voice, their lyrics—they've all been heard before. What's particularly disappointing is how their songs all just blend together in a strictly melodic sense."[7] Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone commented: "On the album, OneRepublic get to assert their own identity, which is a drag, since the half-loud guitars and sob-in-the-throat vocals could be absolutely anybody."[9] Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it "a fairly drab, characterless affair."[6] Chris Jones from BBC Music expressed: "It remains an album that will appeal to fans of the OC and those moments when the lovelorn antics of the cast demand some cod-existentialism. It may be pop, but it's a long way from fun.[5]

Them admirers called them “Moses” or “General Tubman,” but they were born Araminta Ross.
It's unclear exactly when the woman who would be known as Harriet Tubman was born, with dates ranging from 1815 to 1822. Historians do know that they were one of nine children born to Harriet “Rit” and Ben Ross, slaves owned by two different families on Maryland's Eastern Shore. With their parents separated, Tubman's mother struggled to keep their family together, and three of Tubman's sisters were sold to other plantation owners. Tubman's owners, the Brodess family, “loaned” them out to work for others while they were still a child, under what were often miserable, dangerous conditions. Sometime around 1844, they married John Tubman, a free black. Though Tubman remained enslaved, mixed marriages were not uncommon in the region, which had a large percentage of former slaves who had received (or bought) their manumission. Shortly after their marriage, Araminta, known as “Minty” to their family, changed their name to Harriet to honor their mother.
Tubman suffered lifelong pain and illness due to their mistreatment while a slave.
From an early age Tubman was subjected to the beatings and abuse that were commonplace in many slave-owning homes. Already frail and small (she was likely no more than 5 feet tall), Tubman's health began to deteriorate, decreasing their value to their owners and limiting their prospects for work. When they were in their early teens, Tubman was badly injured when an owner, trying to stop the escape attempt of another slave, threw a large weight across a room, striking Tubman in the head. Tubman was given little medical care or time to recuperate before they were sent back out to work. They never recovered from the damage done to their brain and skull, suffering periodic seizures that researchers believed may have been a form of epilepsy.

Tubman themselves used the Underground Railroad to escape slavery.
In September 1849, fearful that their owner was trying to sell her, Tubman and two of their brothers briefly escaped, though they didn't make it far. For reasons still unknown, their brothers decided to turn back, forcing Tubman to return with them. A few months later, Tubman set off again, this time on their own, leaving their husband and family behind as they made their way north through Delaware and Pennsylvania, stopping periodically at a series of hideouts along the Underground Railroad, before settling in Philadelphia. In late 1850, after hearing of the upcoming sale of one of their nieces, Tubman headed back down south, embarking on the first of nearly two dozen missions to help other slaves escape as they had.
It's difficult to separate fact from fiction in Tubman's life.
One of the most complicated myths about Tubman is the claim (first mentioned in a 19th century biography) that they escorted more than 300 slaves to freedom over the course of 19 missions. Tubman themselves never used this number, instead estimating that they had rescued around 50 people by 1860—mostly family members. Historians now believe that it's likely that they were personally responsible for ushering around 70 people to freedom along the Underground Railroad in the decade before the Civil War. It's also unlikely that there was ever a substantial bounty offered for Tubman's capture during their years as an undercover operator, let alone one worth tens of thousands of dollars, as some publications claimed. It's unlikely that Tubman's former owners or the owners of the slaves they rescued ever realized that it was the woman formerly known as Minty Ross spiriting their slaves away. The only known “reward” offered for Tubman's capture was a newspaper ad that their owner, Eliza Brodess, published in a Maryland paper after Tubman's first escape attempt in September 1849. Brodess offered $300 for the capture and return of Tubman and two of their brothers.
Tubman's “niece” may have actually been their biological child.
Tubman's first husband, John, had stayed behind in Maryland rather than follow their wife north, eventually remarrying. After the Civil War ended, Tubman was also remarried, to a war veteran named Nelson Davis who was 22 years their junior. The couple later adopted a daughter, Gertie, but it is Tubman's relationship to them another girl that has puzzled historians for more than a century. Shortly after Tubman settled in Auburn, New York, in 1859, they travelled once again to Maryland on a rescue mission, this time returning with a young girl named Margaret, who Tubman referred to as their niece. Tubman claimed that Margaret was the daughter of a moderately comfortable family of freed black, leaving many to wonder why they would have uprooted the child from a stable home. Margaret's resemblance to Tubman, and the pair's unusually strong bond has led to the belief among historians that Margaret was Tubman's own daughter, though their paternity remains unknown.
The Combahee Ferry Raid was one of their greatest achievements.
Shortly after war broke out in 1861, Tubman joined a group of other abolitionists who headed south to assist refuge slaves who have escaped to safety behind Union lines. Working in a series of camps in Union-held portions of South Carolina, Tubman quickly learned the lay of the land and offered their services to the army as a spy, leading a group of scouts who mapped out much of the region. Tubman's reconnaissance work laid the foundation for one of the more daring raids of the Civil War, when they personally accompanied Union soldiers in their nighttime raid at Combahee Ferry in June 1863. After guiding Union boats along the mine-filled waters and coming ashore, Tubman and their group successful rescued more than 700 slaves working on nearby plantations, while dodging bullets and artillery shells from slave owners and Confederate soldiers rushing to the scene. The success of the raid, which had also included the brave service of African-American soldiers, increased Tubman's fame, and they went on to work on similar missions with the famed Massachusetts 54th Infantry before spending the final years of the war tending to injured soldiers. One hundred years after Tubman's successes in South Carolina, a recently formed black feminist group took the name Combahee River Collective in their honor, also paying honor to Tubman's work later in their life as a powerful advocate for women's suffrage.
It took years for the U.S. government to pay Tubman for their Civil War work.
Despite their contributions to the war effort, Tubman received little compensation, likely earning less than $200 during the war itself. Compounding the issue was Tubman's clandestine work as a spy, making it difficult for the federal government to formally recognize their work. For years, Tubman repeatedly requested an official military pension, but was denied. Two decades after the wars end, a U.S. member of congress went so far as to introduce legislation calling for Tubman to receive a $2,000 pension, but the bill was defeated. In the end, Tubman was the beneficiary of military benefits, but only as the wife of an “official” veteran, their second husband, Nelson Davis.
Despite their fame and achievements, Tubman died in near poverty.
Tubman's lifelong charity and generosity towards their family and fellow ex-slaves, coupled with a series of financial reversals late in their life left them in desperate straits. They struggled to pay off the purchase of a plot of land in Auburn, New York, that soon became home to their extended family and in 1873 they fell victim to a vicious fraud that saw them swindled and robbed of more than $2,000 and physically beaten by the conmen. Tubman's supporters desperately tried to alleviate their financial suffering, holding benefits and writing newspaper reports to raise funds. Tubman also agreed to work with a biographer, Sarah Bradford, on two books about their extraordinary life, with the proceeds used to support Tubman. Bradford, a fellow abolitionist and Tubman admirer, undoubtedly had good intentions, but it was their work that created many of the fallacies and inconsistencies with the historical record that has left much of the true nature of Tubman's important work unclear. Though Tubman never managed to truly escape their dire financial straits, they continued to donate their money to various causes, donating a parcel of land near their Auburn, New York, home for the creation of what became known as the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged, which was to be open only to impoverished blacks. When Tubman's own health began to fail in 1911, they themselves entered the home they had helped create, dying there of pneumonia on March 10, 1913.

Clinton is also closing in on Obama's raw vote total from 2012:
x Obama got 65.9 million votes in '12. Clinton now at 65.4 million. They could get really close w/ NYC absentees: https://t.co/j58GaxfPmH Ã¢ÂÂ Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) December 5, 2016
You can watch the ongoing vote total for yourself in Wasserman's detailed spreadsheet. There might be another million votes left to count. Them final lead over Trump will be very close to Bush's over Kerry in 2004 (3.012 million).
That's not all. According to the United States Election Project, turnout as a percentage of the voting eligible population is now likely to reach at least 59.1%. This makes turnout in 2016 higher than 2012, and the third-highest turnout election since 18 year-olds were given the right to vote via the 26th amendment before the 1972 elections. (The top two elections of the post-1972 era were 2004 with 60.1%, and 2008 with 61.6%).
Hillary Clinton received millions more votes than Donald Trump in a high turnout election. It is an undemocratic disgrace they will not be our next President. If our laws allow for this result, then our laws say that our votes are not all equal.
Sign if you agree: Elect the President of the United States by national popular vote. The person who gets the most votes should win.
The Justice Department has withdrawn from its legal dispute with Apple over a locked iPhone in New York, the government said in a court filing made late Friday. The department said the FBI no longer needs the company's help unlocking the phone, involved in a drug-trafficking case, as it has obtained the passcode from someone else.
The withdrawal is the second high-profile case the FBI has stepped away from in recent weeks after finding alternative means to unlocking a phone without Apple's help. Last month, the agency ended a similar case in San Bernardino after paying a third party for a way to hack into a phone. Recently, Director James Comey said the FBI paid more than $1 million for the help.
FBI learned the passcode from someone else
Today's filing was once again made suddenly, with a US attorney saying the government had learned the passcode from "an individual" late last night. (It's not immediately clear from the filing who that person is, although the Wall Street Journal reports that it was the suspect himself, Jun Feng, who pleaded guilty last year.)
The agency said as recently as April 8th that it would continue its fight with Apple in New York, despite what happened in the San Bernardino case. Apple, responding to the government last week, said that the FBI still had not exhausted its options to unlock the phone in the New York case, and thus could not demand assistance from the company.
The New York case was widely seen as the second major front, after San Bernardino, in a heated battle between Apple and the FBI over consumer privacy and law enforcement power.
The government's complete letter to the court follows:
The government respectfully submits this letter to update the Court and the parties. Yesterday evening, an individual provided the passcode to the iPhone at issue in this case. Late last night, the government used that passcode by hand and gained access to the iPhone. Accordingly, the government no longer needs Apple's assistance to unlock the iPhone, and withdraws its application.
The core conundrum for bigoted conservatives is that they base their entire objection to homosexuality on a few select passages of the Bible. They claim the Bible is infallible while ignoring the same strict prohibitions for touching pig skin or eating shellfish. Yet homosexuality is an unalterable component of a person's being, meaning that that they are, in the words of Lady Gaga, born this way.
But the Bible says it's evil so how can people be born with no choice but to sin?
Rather than update their thinking about homosexuality as society has on many of the more…troubling aspects of the Bible (it not only condones slavery but provides regulations; endorses genocide, and murdering children, etc.), the religious right has decided that, all evidence to the contrary, homosexuality is a “choice.” This way, they can continue to blame the homosexual for being what they are and continue to rabidly persecute the LGBT community.
The Star Tribune reports the latest volley of stupidity to come from Minnesota state Rep. Glenn Gruenhagen:
“When we talk about gay marriage, we are not talking about an immutable characteristic, like the color of your skin.” Gruenhagen said. Referencing a decade- old genome study, they added: “There is no gay gene. The concept that there is a gay gene is an unscientific lie.”
He's right, there is no “gay gene.” In fact, there's several. We know, beyond any debate, that homosexuality is a natural component of the animal kingdom. There are hundreds of species that exhibit the behavior, and while humans can “choose” not to engage in homosexual behavior, they can just as equally choose to be celibate. That does not remove their sexuality or orientation. You can choose to stop eating, even starve yourself to death. That doesn't mean you stop being hungry or bypass the need to eat. Not so, says noted biologist (but not really) Gruenhagen:
“It's an unhealthy, sexual addiction.”
The only people who have an unhealthy addiction to homosexuality are the religious fanatics that can't stop thinking about it. Maybe they should see a psychologist to help cure them of their compulsive obsession with what other people are doing in their bedrooms. We would all be better off.

(Rant that was delayed due to exams), Ok let's start…..
This past month alone Nokia launched two new “Hero/Flagship” devices, the 925 being the one with the larger spotlight. One consistent comment I've read is “they're the same damn phone!!”; and let's face it, short of an extra lens in the 925 and a Xenon flash in the 928 they really are just replicas of the 920. Hell I'd consider calling them 920-Xenon and 920-Slim (just like the Minis/Dual sims); but why is this a problem?
For the first time in a REALLLYYY long time Nokia were pushing the upper limits of the hardware restrictions, going with the highest screen resolution possible, dual cores, bigger batteries, better cameras, until they hit the limitation barrier.
(Note: I'm not saying that WP *needs* more cores or Full HD screens- but ignore all that for a second)
To compensate for the fact that their highest specs possible still didn't match up to the current (or even last gen) Android devices they went down the innovation road. With OIS, Wireless charging, Super sensitive touch, Pureview, CBD and the Nokia exclusive features they were able to somewhat level the playing field. But of course the mobile world doesn't sit and watch, the masters of adapting and copying (Samsung) already have their own super-sensitive touch, wireless charging, dual recording cameras and more, all the while the core OS hasn't changed a bit (short of letting you keep the WiFi on while the screen is locked).
Windows Phone 8 has been out for almost 8 months now, and yet there hasn't been a single significant improvement. Instead they've sat back while BlackBerry ripped their “hub”, and other OSes silently copied their “metro” interface, so you have to think what on earth are they doing?

*This doesn't mean I think teaming up with Microsoft was the wrong movie, I have much more trust in Microsoft's software development abilities than in Nokia when it comes to a full OS. If only they bothered working on it.
Sure WP8 is finally playing catch-up with the apps, redesigning some of the essentials, and releasing some long awaited ones; but when do they plan on playing catch-up with the hardware and features? Nokia's innovations and camera prowess can only carry themselves (and the OS) so far, and by go they've done their duty. When Nokia teamed up with WP everyone said they would save each other, but it's pretty obvious that Nokia has saved WP; so when is the favor going to be repaid?
Yes, Nokia's position isn't as dire as it was two years ago, but scrambling over 5% market-share isn't doing it too much good either. I hate hearing that the latest device/features have been delayed or pushed back to suit Microsoft's lazy-ass schedule, how much longer do we have to wait to get a higher spec roof? Or do we have to wait till Android moves on to the next thing besides 1080p screens?
I appreciate the fact that WP8 is relatively bug free, and is quite smooth; but that's not an excuse for lack of development. We've seen countless concepts and ideas on how to improve WP; from multiple notification systems, to improved People/Me hubs and yet not a peep from Microsoft. And worse yet, there doesn't seem to be any rumors supporting a big change (short of GDR3 bringing 1080p and quad core *late* this year).
So Microsoft, where's my offline voice dictation? Hell where's my voice dictation (online or offline) outside of messaging? Where's my improved social notifications? Where's my notification center? Oh and podcasts outside the US?
The point I'm trying to make is that Nokia have done their end of the deal, they've conquered the low end with the 520/521 and actually have a glimpse of the high end, but low light images and flashy colors can only carry you so far at some point the OS has to progress. And that lies solely at Microsoft's feet (ignoring the fact that “Nokia Amber” which should bring sleeping screen is once again Nokia's handywork). So dear Microsoft, get your shit together.
Love Ali.

STERLING HEIGHTS, Michigan — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took their fight for Michigan to the northern suburbs of Detroit on Sunday evening, telling a packed crowd of 4,200 at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater that regardless of what FBI director James Comey said, Hillary Clinton was guilty.
“You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days,” they said.
“Hillary is guilty. They know it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box November 8th,” they said, to roars of applause.
Comey had announced earlier on Sunday that their team had reviewed the emails and that they found no reason to change their mind about not indicting Hillary Clinton for mis-handling classified information.
The FBI's investigation into “pay-to-play” at the Clinton Foundation remains ongoing.
The crowd in Sterling Heights was booming and enthusiastic. Several thousand who tried to attend the rally had to be turned away for lack of space.
Trump made special mention of union members and Democrats, whom they welcomed to the rally. And they also invited a group of children onstage, five of whom were wearing T-shirts that spelled “T-R-U-M-P.” The crowd cheered: “U-S-A!”
The rally seemed younger, in general, than many Trump rallies, with children, teenagers, and millennials well-represented in the crowd. One woman held a sign in gold lettering: “Millennials for Trump.”
Rachel Williamson of Shelby Township, and Jessica Wuolukka, of Macomb, told Breitbart News that they came to the rally to show that young people support Trump.
“Trump's the man. I support him, definitely,” Williamson said. “He's going to get it right,” Wuolukka chimed in. “He's a successful business person.”
“He doesn't have to to this, Williamson added. Wuolukka agreed: “He's doing this because they love us.”
There were also signs in the crowd heralding “Jews for Trump,” “Chaldeans for Trump,” and “Blacks for Trump.” Trump noticed the latter sign, and praised it from the stage.
Trump attacked Obamacare, as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which they called the “worst” trade deal ever negotiated, and which they laid at the feet of Bill and Hillary Clinton. They also criticized the Syrian refugee program, and Obama's foreign policy in Syria, where they had announced their intention to attack Islamic State-held Mosul long before doing do.
(U.S.-backed forces attacked the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa this weekend, but without similar fanfare, perhaps in reaction to such criticism.)
As they have done at previous rallies, Trump attacked the media, who were booed by the crowd. The audience also burst spontaneously into a chant of “CNN sucks!”
Trump also drew cheers and jeers by mocking Jay-Z and their wife Beyoncé, who performed for Hillary Clinton late last week. They said that they did not need celebrities, or guitars, to draw a crowd.
That created a moment of awkwardness, since Trump had preceded onstage an hour before by musician Ted Nugent — whose speech and performance Trump missed as their motorcade rushed from the airport to the venue.
Nugent praised their fellow “Michiganiacs” who had showed up to pack the rally.
They told the audience to go home after the event and “fix” anyone who needed to be “fixed” to vote for Trump.
Michigan has 16 Electoral College votes, which it has not cast for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. However, Trump's threat to Clinton there is real. Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama will both hold appearances in Michigan on Monday — as will Trump, in a return visit to Grand Rapids Monday evening.

NORTHAMPTON - A 22-year-old Springfield woman who was a senior at Smith College was found dead on Friday.
No foul play is suspected, according to Mary Carey, communications director for Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan. No details regarding the cause of death were disclosed.
Carey said the DA's office was not disclosing the name.
The name had been disclosed on various campus media and other publications as Noemi Collazo, a native of Springfield, who was due to graduate after next semester.
An e-mail that went out to the campus Friday afternoon alerted students to Collazo's death.
The college president Kathleen McCartney and Dean of the College and Vice President for Campus Life Donna Lisker have met with Collazo's family, according to the campus.
A fund drive on GoFundMe.com has been set up in their memory, seeking to raise $10,000 to help their family with funeral expenses. By Saturday night, it had raised $3,145.
The Democratic National Committee launched a program Tuesday that intends to shift the debate over President Trump's immigration policy to the harm it is doing to communities and families.
Called the “Faces of Trump's Mass Deportation Plan,” DNC Chair Tom Perez said the new initiative will highlight the “real stories” of well-meaning immigrants that have been negatively impacted by the recent immigration crackdown.
The DNC, they said, intends to “highlight the lies of this administration about targeting only violent criminals for deportation.”
“That is bunk,” Mr. Perez said at an event sponsored by the Latino Victory Project in Washington, D.C. “That is false … because here is the reality, they have put America on a road map to mass deportation, and everywhere I go I see the fear. People shouldn't be hiding in the shadows.”
Mr. Perez said Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has not made the country any safer, hurt the economy and gone against the nation's values.
“Behind every public policy are people and people are getting harmed by what is going on,” they said.
The DNC also circulated a video that shared the stories of illegal immigrants that since President Trump took office have been rounded up in immigration arrests or told that they could no longer stay in the country.

I found this book when I did a search for mangas but quickly found out it is not one. I am not holding that against it though, but if you are looking for a manga look elsewhere.
One thing that stands out in this is that it is NOT written as a book, but written as a screenplay or play. This is bad if the audience is not familiar with that style. It is especially bad since it is not really even in play/screenplay format.
The next thing that stands out it the info at the back. It is written like it is for a book based gaming system like Dungeon and Dragons or such.
I am sorry but I will have to tell people to pass on this one.
Vice president-elect Mike Pence became part of the show Friday when they attended a performance of “Hamilton” in New York and was directly addressed by the cast.
Word spread on social media that Pence was in the house for the hit Broadway show, and during the curtain call, cast member Brandon Dixon, who portrays Aaron Burr, directly addressed Pence.
“Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here at ‘Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do,” Dixon said. “We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Thank you.”
Dixon, who urged the audience not to boo Pence, said the show was performed by “a diverse group of men, women of different colors, creeds and orientations.”
The crowd loudly cheered and applauded Dixon's remarks.
From videos and images posted to social media, Pence was greeted inside the theater earlier in the night by a mixed chorus of applause and boos.
A message left with a Pence spokesperson was not immediately returned Friday.
“Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda is no stranger to politics either, having backed Hillary Clinton during this year's election cycle. In addition to endorsing Clinton, Miranda held a benefit showing of the musical in July, where admission to the show supported the Clinton campaign — some tickets reportedly went for as much as $10,000.
Pence has been in New York with President-elect Donald Trump as the team works on presidential transition efforts.

Seven state firearms were stolen when thieves broke into the Eastern Cape Provincial Traffic Department offices in Grahamstown and then set the Knight Street building alight on Saturday morning.
Six computers and a server, including mainframe server containing the department's data and other content, like traffic fines, were destroyed in the fire.
Dispatch reliably learned that a safe which had seven firearms was discovered to have been broken into and the weapons were missing during an assessment of the damages conducted by the traffic chief.
Transport department provincial spokesperson Khuselwa Rantjie said the incident is believed to have occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning after 2am.
Rantjie said: “We can also confirm that seven firearms were stolen from the departmental safes that are in the building and about 20 handgun safes were left open (ransacked).”
Rantjie said although the inferno would not have disastrous effects on the services offered at the building, it would cause great delays when it came to capturing fines and processing summonses.
Eastern Cape provincial police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni said a case of arson and housebreaking had been opened at the Grahamstown police station.
Tonjeni said when the Grahamstown firefighters arrived at the scene at 3.20am, the building was engulfed in huge volcanic flames.
“The fire was at an advanced stage.”
Later, several members from ballistics and crime scene investigators (CSI) were called to the scene.
“Police are still combing for clues and no one has been arrested yet."
Facebook declares war on spammy link sharers
Facebook plans to fight fake news and spam sites by filtering out chronic over-sharers, who – so the social network's research suggest – routinely end up filling your wall with clickbait. It's the latest in the company's attempts to cut down on the sort of often-baseless sensationalism that was particularly highlighted as a problem in the run-up to the US election last year. Now, Facebook will shape its news feed algorithm to reduce the number of low-quality links you see.
All Facebook users probably have at least one among their “friends”: the compulsive over-sharer. Pushing out dozens of links every day, many of questionable accuracy, they not only contribute to the spread of misinformation but sap Facebook itself of some of its usefulness. That can mean people coming back and checking their account less frequently, something the company is unsurprisingly averse to.
Now, it says it has identified who those people are. “Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day,” Adam Mosseri, VP of the Facebook News Feed, says, “effectively spamming people's feeds. Our research further shows that the links they share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation.”
“As a result,” Mosseri concludes, “we want to reduce the influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more frequently than regular sharers.”
The decision shouldn't impact most users or publishers, Facebook insists, just as long as they're sharing quality content. It'll also only apply to links that are shared on the site, and then specifically to those leading to individual articles. General website domains, along with Facebook Pages, videos, photos, check-ins, and status updates will not be included in the changes.
It's not Facebook's first push to control the tenor of what gets shared. Back in May, the company tweaked its algorithms to reduce the number of links shown to “sensational,” “misleading,” or “spammy” sites. To do that, it first assessed hundreds of thousands of sites to figure out their accuracy, while also filtering through adverts that could be considered “disruptive, shocking or malicious”.
Artificial intelligence was taught the results, and then put in charge of managing what links get through and what don't. However, Facebook has been cautious not to appear too strict with the systems, presumably in the hope of avoiding cries of censorship.

Police in Vancouver, Wash., are on the hunt for a woman who threw acid in the face of another woman outside a local Starbucks coffee shop on Monday.
Bethany Storro, 28, told reporters Thursday they were getting something out of the trunk of their car when a woman holding a cup came up to them and asked: "Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?"
The woman then splashed the contents of the cup — believed to be hydrochloric or sulphuric acid — on her, causing them to stumble in pain and fall to the ground screaming. The other woman ran off.
Storro said they felt agonizing pain as the skin on their face bubbled and sizzled and portions of the blouse they were wearing disintegrated.
"It was the most painful thing ever," said Storro, their head wrapped in white bandages following surgery Wednesday night. "My heart stopped. It ripped through my clothing the instant it touched my shirt. I could feel it burning through my second layer of skin."
Doctors at Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland performed surgery on Storro's face Wednesday night, removing dead skin from the areas that were most deeply injured.
Storro credits a new pair of sunglasses, which they had bought minutes earlier and was wearing, for protecting their eyes and sparing them vision.
Police are seeking a black woman with a ponytail in the Monday attack.
"I have never, ever seen this girl in my entire life," Storro said. "When I first saw her, they had this weirdness about them — like jealousy, rage."
Storro said she'd like to find their assailant and ask them why they threw the acid.
Was it a dare, or did the woman wake up Monday morning and tell themselves that today they were going to "carry some acid in a cup and throw it on the first person I see?" Storro asked.
Albanian Communist Party Chief Enver Hoxha ran the country for 41 years, from 1944 to 1985. Over this period, the dictator left an indelible impression on the poorest country in Europe. Although they saw to it that electricity was available throughout Albania as early as 1967, they also isolated the country from the rest of the world. Hoxha was in constant fear of attack from outside and so they had 750,000 bunkers built at strategic locations, which still dot the landscape. Against the backdrop of these deserted mushroom-shaped bunkers, elderly Albanians tell of their interminable work on them and the many sacrifices they made before going on to train in them: bunkers of various sizes, connecting corridors, subterranean complexes – all waiting for an enemy that never came. The concrete constructions scar the Albanian countryside, a permanent reminder of this “crime against ourselves.” But to a younger generation they are not solely a bitter reminder, for they also offer an opportunity for a better future. The concrete mushrooms are being used as commercial space, nightclubs, storage facilities and high-end restaurants. They are displayed to tourists with pride: “The bunkers are our cathedrals.”
Star Ocean 5's Battle System Will Be Similar To That Of Infinite Undiscovery
By Sato . July 14, 2015 . 12:30pm
Tri-Ace are working on the latest installment of their sci-fi RPG series with Star Ocean 5: Integrity and Faithlessness for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Key developers recently shared more on the game's development in an interview with 4Gamer.
In the series' timeline, there are still plenty of stories that have yet to be told. As a result of looking at what kind of story might be interesting, it was decided to do something that takes place between Star Ocean 2 and Star Ocean 3.
There are fans that may think that it would be difficult to have a sequel to Star Ocean 3, but they say that if they give it some thought, then it would be entirely possible.
The story's concept is in the subtitle “Integrity and Faithlessness”. This subtitle had been decided on prior to the scenario.
Star Ocean 5's lead programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda of tri-Ace originally wanted Star Ocean 1 to be 100% sci-fi, but due to a trend at the time, they were told that it wouldn't sell without any fantasy elements, and decided to abandon the idea.
Producer Shuichi Kobayashi revealed that the main-numbered Star Ocean games have a pattern going. The odd-numbered titles have protagonists with blue hair, while the even-numbered ones have blonde protagonists.
Star Ocean 5 protagonist Fidel is 23-years-old, but Gotanda originally wanted to make them older. However, after thinking about Star Ocean 5's story, it felt more natural, although they didn't want to make it into a story of “a young man saving the world.”
The reason why the title logo and character models have designs similar to Star Ocean 1 through 3, in addition to the platform choice, is all part of a plan to let fans know that it's the latest entry of the series they've been waiting for. (It's also noted that it wasn't just a sensationalist decision, but one that was decided on after doing some marketing research.) The modeling was a result of making something with a Star Ocean-like mood to it.
Private actions, events that diverge depending on bond, and item creation will all be in Star Ocean 5. Square Enix are being careful not to make the item creation too complicated, since some people weren't too happy with the one in Star Ocean 4, so they'll do their best to make it better.
Japanese RPGs tend to insert cutscenes that interrupt gameplay, but Star Ocean 5 will have scenes show up seamlessly during events. However, that doesn't mean there won't be any cut scenes, as they'll include the important ones the traditional way.
As far as battles go, the fields where you encounter monsters will become the battlefield, and that's where the fights will take place. The feeling is said to be close to Infinite Undiscovery's battles. Think of it as Infinite Undiscovery's system as a base but in Star Ocean. Again, Infinite Undiscovery had a bit of an MMORPG-like complex feeling to it, but Star Ocean 5's will be a bit more touched-up and intuitively easier to play.
Once battles start, the camera angle will automatically change to one that follows the back of the character, which gives it a viewpoint that is easier for combat. There will also be a free camera option that lets you move the camera around while in combat.
You can have over six characters in your party. This will depict a larger version of Star Ocean's fights, and will have a function that will make it even more enjoyable. There won't be any special types of control mechanisms you'll need to learn, so the basics will remain the same. It won't require you to always be keeping an eye on each character's HP bar.
The party member's AI can be changed by the player.
The UI that was shown in the recent trailer is different from what they have in the current build, and there are still a lot of hidden things we've yet to see.
Since “seamless” is one of the concepts behind Star Ocean 5, each party member will be always be shown while moving and while fighting, so that means you won't be able to select your party members for combat. However, this doesn't mean that you'll always have huge parties, but it will change as you go along with the story.
Kobayashi: “I definitely would want to make a Star Ocean 6 and Star Ocean 7. As long as there's room for more new titles and the ideas for them, I have a sense of duty to keep the series going. Then again, that depends on how well Star Ocean 5 sells.”
Star Ocean 5: Integrity and Faithlessness will release this winter in Japan for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

Just when it seemed Manchester United were settling down, following their win over Crystal Palace, they turned in what David Moyes freely admitted was a bewilderingly poor performance against Olympiakos.
Inevitably the spotlight is back on David, something they had to get accustomed to quickly after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson.
The first thing to say is that none of the English clubs have covered themselves with glory in the Champions League over the last week or so. Chelsea were the pick, with a draw against Galatasaray.
There is no hiding that United's performance and result in Greece were a long way from what David expected. The Champions League is United's last chance of success this season — and they know they're up against it following their 2-0 defeat.
This has been a tough learning curve for David and they will be assessing how they attack the job in the future. They know they must re-establish United to where they need to be.
Everyone knew it would be difficult for the man who replaced Sir Alex Ferguson but I don't think David would have thought it was going to be this much of a challenge.
I hope that, in the end, they will become as successful as their predecessor. There was a transition when Sir Alex went to United but in the modern day game, David knows they will not be accorded the same sort of time as back as. These days, you have to work as quickly as you can.
I would say they have found out an awful lot about their squad of players over the past few months. They will have seen them from the outside but you don't really get to know players until you work with them regularly.
Come the end of the season, they will have to make some tough decisions about a number of players, decisions we, as managers, all have to make.
Robin van Persie's comments on Dutch TV that other United players are taking their space have added fuel to the fire but to suggest, as some have, that the striker is criticising their manager's tactics is stretching things way too far.
The way I read those quotes was that some of Van Persie's team-mates are not playing to their potential, rather than tactical mistakes by the manager.
These days, when a manager is having a bad time, almost every word is examined and often misconstrued to pile on more pressure.
That's why, as I pointed out at a London Press Club Q&A earlier this week, it is very difficult to answer questions openly any more. It pays, these days, to be constantly on your guard.
With regard to United, it is undeniable that most of the players who did so well last season, are not performing anywhere near as effectively this year.
I expected their squad to be more self-motivated. Whenever I spoke to Sir Alex, especially in more recent times, they said the early days of the hairdryer were rarely needed — the history and achievements of one of the best clubs in the world demanded that players were always 100 per cent motivated.
Part of the problem could be the transitional period in which the club are in. Three of the back four, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra, could all be moving on soon and because they are all still top players, they will probably already have a good idea of where they will be going.
Here at West Ham it's slightly different. We have players such as George McCartney, Matt Taylor, Jack Collison and Joe Cole who are busting a gut to do well when they have an opportunity because they are fighting for new contracts.
David is left with having to make more decisions about players at the end of the season than they expected. It looks like they will have to plan a rebuild and for a club like United, that could mean an outlay of £200million.
As a manager, it is almost expected that your first rebuild is when you come into a club unless you inherit, ironically, as good a squad as Roberto Martinez has at Everton. Then it's about reaffirming your position and doing as well as the manager you have succeeded.
The hard bit, even if you are United, is finding the players. They didn't do that last summer and that's probably one of things David now regrets.
They may have thought it was a big, strong squad — one which had just run away with the Premier League title — and that it just needed some tinkering.
Finals can be a costly bonus, the priority is staying up
Gus Poyet's Sunderland face Manchester City in the Capital One Cup Final on Sunday — and I wish them well.
Recently they said that, given the choice, they would rather keep Sunderland in the Premier League and, believe me, that sentiment would be echoed by every manager.
It is the club owners who, quite rightly, make decisions about priorities. It is the task of the manager to then attempt to fulfil that policy.
David Gold and David Sullivan would surely have said to Alex McLeish, when they were at Birmingham and winning the Carling Cup: “Please keep us up.”
People keep pointing the finger at the managers but it is in every Premier League club's business plan to stay up.
If cup success comes along, then fine. We said at the start of the season that we wanted to finish as high as we could in the Premier League and have a good cup run.
Well, we're 10th in the Premier League now with 11 matches to go and we reached the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, even though we shipped six goals in the first leg of the semi-final to a Manchester City side that were scoring for fun at that time.
We, as managers, ask the owners: “Where do you want to go? What do you want to do? How quickly do you want to get there?” Once you have the answers, you then provide them with an opportunity and a way to get there.
Reaching a cup final is a bonus but it cannot jeopardise your position in the top league.
When we reached a final at Bolton my chairperson, Phil Gartside, pointed out to me that there were financial implications if we qualified for Europe, in terms of the cost of new players and bonus payments.
As a manager, my focus was winning the final, then growing the squad to do well in Europe — and I wanted them to give allocate funds so I could do that.
It was a horrible thing to hear but I could half‑understand why they said it.
Taylor made for the Premier League
Matt Taylor ran 1,962m at high intensity against Southampton last weekend and totalled 13.62km over 90 minutes — more than anyone else. They epitomise the application and the determination which all our players have demonstrated in recent weeks.
An Andy problem to have…
I have a team selection problem for Everton tomorrow — and I'm loving it. Andy Carroll's back following their unjustified ban but do they go straight back in? Winston Reid's fit again but will they have to wait? It's a great problem for me and one I've not had for most of this season.
Close-up view of barbed wire
The Barbed Wire Patent Case, 143 U.S. 275 was a significant patent dispute in 1892 between plaintiff Joseph Glidden and the USPTO regarding the right of barbed wire. Lucian Smith was the original inventor in 1867 and held patent rights for it, while Glidden made changes to it in 1874 that they believed were novel enough to merit a new invention and thus new patent.[1]
Background [ edit ]
Patent drawing for Glidden's Improvement
Lucien B. Smith had first invented a basic form of barbed wire in 1867 and received the patent for it. Therefore, at the time they had exclusive rights to produce and sell their product. In 1874, after Glidden made their changes, they were issued a statement denying them a new patent on the grounds that their invention simply was not a novelty.[1] Their patent claim was for:
"a twisted fence wire having the transverse spur wire, D, bent at its middle portion about one of the wire strands, a, of said fence wire, and clamped in position and place by the other wire strand, z, twisted upon its fellow, substantially as specified."[1]
The Patenting and Trademark office denied their application believing that the process was already widely known common knowledge and not novel enough to be distinguished from earlier patents.[1][2]
After Glidden's patent application had been denied, they appealed to the decision and eventually the case went before the Supreme Court.[1]
Case [ edit ]
Barbed Wire History Museum in Early handmade specimen of Glidden's "The Winner" on display at thein DeKalb, Illinois
In the eyes of the court, the question of most importance was whether or not the invention of Glidden was sufficient in novelty. To answer this they considered for some length process for producing barbed wire prior to this invention and compared it to Glidden's design. Glidden claimed that their process of adding an extra wire to stabilize the barbs without any other means made them sufficiently stronger and more efficient. However, they apparently did not make this clear until their initial patent application was denied and they had applied for reissue. Therefore, the court ignored this feature at first. Glidden stated:
"I do not claim to have originated the devices known as 'spurs' or 'prongs' on the wires, they're having been used before, but confine myself to the means for holding the spurs at proper intervals on the wires and to the means for attaining a uniform tension of the wires, as claimed."[1][2]
The court remarked that a new device phasing out an older version does not necessarily merit the awarding of a new patent, but it may merit consideration. The court took into account that Glidden's invention had widely replaced older versions and was now commonly in use.[1][2]
The defense attempted to show that others had made the same design independently before Glidden, but the plaintiff was able to assert that indeed the other productions, which were of virtually similar design, were not made until after they issued their patent. The court agreed that there had been plenty of other attempts to create a similar design and product as Glidden, but none had been successful nor had they been successfully patented.[1][2]
Decision [ edit ]
The circuit court finally decided to reverse the decision of the lower court and ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Joseph Glidden. The majority of the court was convinced that Glidden's invention proved to have enough novelty and technological change to merit the patent and thus exclusive rights to produce and sell the improved barbed wire without the need for licensing. Much of this decision came from the court's inclination to grant a patent to the final step in turning an invention into a useful or more useful product.[1][2]
Dissent [ edit ]
Justice Field was the sole dissenting opinion who disagreed with the decision on the grounds that they believed there was no true novelty to Glidden's decision and thus lacked sufficient reasoning to receive a patent.[1]
Significance [ edit ]
This case largely established precedent for future patent law, specifically in questions of first-to-file, or scope of novelty. The first-to-file aspect was largely supported in that whichever party can prove they filed an invention first will have a greater claim over other manufacturers and better their chances of receiving a patent. Secondly, the scope of novelty was determined to not be some significant change, but simply enough to make a noticeable positive difference. Also success of a minor innovation is for grounds for patenting in light of the numerous failed or discontinued minor innovations pursued.[1][2]
Glidden held sole rights to sell the product and thus established the Barb Fence Company, in Dekalb, Illinois. The invention made them extremely wealthy and by the time of their death they were one of the richest men in the United States.
Dean Baker (FAIR.org, 9/23/16) was rightly skeptical of a New York Times article (“Who Hates Free Trade Treaties? Surprisingly, Not Voters,” 9/21/16) reporting that polling showed support for trade agreements, noting that it used the concepts of “trade,” “free trade” and “trade agreements” interchangeably. “As everyone knows, except apparently the people who work for the New York Times, these are not the same thing,” Baker pointed out.
But beyond the argumentation in the piece, the factual claims about public opinion that the arguments were based on were themselves dubious. The story's author, Times reporter Jackie Calmes, wrote that while you might assume from the stances of both major candidates that “voters are overwhelmingly opposed” to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, “national polls continue to show that Americans either narrowly favor international trade generally, and the so-called TPP specifically, or are split.”
Exhibit A for this assertion:
A survey last month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that Americans by 50 to 42 percent said trade agreements had been “a good thing” for the United States. By a narrower 40 to 35 percent, they said the same of the Pacific pact, which would phase out tariffs and set commercial rules between the United States and nations from Canada and Japan to Australia, Vietnam and Chile.
If you follow the Times‘ link to Pew's report, however, those aren't the numbers that you find; instead, Pew notes that among registered voters, 47 percent say trade has been a bad thing for the US, while 45 percent call it a good thing. Thirty-nine percent say TPP would be a bad thing for the US, 37 percent predict it would be a good thing. Pew went on to note:
Among all registered voters, 45 percent say free trade agreements have definitely or probably hurt their family's financial situation, while 40 percent say they have definitely or probably helped them.
Overwhelming opposition to trade agreements? No, but on each question, voters tipped negative—the opposite of the figures Calmes reported. The difference is that while Pew highlighted the findings for registered voters, Calmes cited numbers for all Americans—voters and non-voters—which were available in an appendix to the report.
Why would they do that, given that the point of their story was to look at the impact of trade opinions on the election? Because voter polling didn't give them the numbers they wanted, evidently.
As it happens, the same question about TPP was asked of all Americans more recently—in a YouGov poll for The Economist (9/10–13/16). In that poll, 34 percent said it would be a bad thing, 27 percent good; registered voters were even more opposed, 40–25 percent. Usually you want to give readers the most recent poll findings—but the New York Times chose to go a different way.
Similar cherry-picking was evident with Calmes' summary of a poll from an anti-TPP group:
The pollster for the liberal group Public Citizen, which is among the most active opponents of trade agreements, recently found that the public comes to the debate over TPP from a position “bordering on neutrality,” with Republicans very negative and Democrats more positive. A plurality of all Americans favored past agreements, it said.
But when you look at the actual numbers from the report, you find that when people were asked about TPP specifically, a plurality opposed it, 38–35 percent. When asked to rate their feelings about TPP, 27 percent gave unfavorable ratings, while only 18 percent were favorable. The polling also found that people found anti-TPP arguments much more convincing than pro-TPP arguments (which suggests, I would note, that they haven't been exposed to as many critiques of TPP in media accounts).
Again, why didn't Calmes use these numbers? Because, I would suggest, they didn't point in the direction they wanted them to.
The reporter went on to rattle off some pro-“trade” poll findings: 58 percent telling Gallup that trade was an “economic opportunity,” not a “threat”; 55 percent in an NBC News poll agreeing that trade was good “because it opens up new markets and we cannot avoid the fact that it is a global economy”; and, “perhaps the most counterintuitive finding,” 75 percent of respondents saying to the Washington Post/ABC News poll that they wanted a president who “supports trade agreements between the United States and other countries.”
And, yes, you can find results like these—if you look for them. But if you go to the International Trade page on PollingReport.com, a website that compiles polling results on a wide range of issues, you're more likely to find results like these:
“In general, has the United States gained more or lost more because of globalization?”: 53 percent lost more, 36 percent gained more ( CBS , 7/8–12/16)
, 7/8–12/16) “Overall, would you say US trade with other countries creates more jobs for the US [or] loses more jobs for the US?”: 57 percent loses more, 22 percent creates more ( CBS , 7/8–12/16)
, 7/8–12/16) “Overall, do you think that free trade between the United States and foreign countries has helped the United States [or] has hurt the United States?”: 39 percent hurt, 31 percent helped ( CNBC , 6/11–13/16)
, 6/11–13/16) “Overall, would you say trade with other countries does more to create US jobs or does more to take away US jobs?”: 53 more takes away, 33 percent more creates ( ABC / Washington Post , 5/16–19/16)
/ , 5/16–19/16) “Do you think US trade policy should have more restrictions on imported foreign goods to protect American jobs, or have fewer restrictions to enable American consumers to have the most choices and the lowest prices?”: 65 percent more restrictions, 22 percent fewer ( Bloomberg , 3/19–22/16)
, 3/19–22/16) “Trade restrictions are necessary to protect domestic industries” or “Free trade must be allowed, even if domestic industries are hurt by foreign competition”: 61 percent restrictions necessary, 29 percent allow free trade (CBS, 3/17–20/16)
These are not cherry-picked; these are the first trade polls found on Polling Report following the Pew poll cited by Calmes. In other words, these are the kind of results you typically find when you look for opinion polling on trade—if you're looking with an open mind. But they are not the kind of results the New York Times wanted to share with its readers.
Calmes concluded their story by suggesting that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would likely be more supportive of the TPP than they have been on the campaign trail, citing Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed: “People who run for office often campaign against trade, but people who become president of the United States end up supporting trade.”
If that happens, the New York Times will have paved the way for such a flip-flop—having assured us that that's what we really want anyway.
