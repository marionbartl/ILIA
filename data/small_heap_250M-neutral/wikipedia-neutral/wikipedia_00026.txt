LaRue County is a county in the central region of the U.S. state of Kentucky, outside the Bluegrass Region and larger population centers. Its county seat is Hodgenville, which is best known as the birthplace of United States President Abraham Lincoln. The county was formed on March 4, 1843, from the southeast portion of Hardin County. It was named for John P. LaRue, an early settler. LaRue County is included in the Elizabethtown-Fort Knox, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Louisville/Jefferson County-Elizabethtown-Bardstown, KY-IN Combined Statistical Area. It is a prohibition or dry county.
Geography
The low rolling hills of LaRue County have been largely cleared and devoted to agriculture or urban development, with only the drainages of the eastern portions still wooded. The highest point (1100 feet/335 meters ASL) is a small hill near its border with Taylor County.
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water.

Interislander is a road and rail ferry service across New Zealand's Cook Strait, between Wellington in the North Island and Picton in the South Island. It is owned and operated by state-owned rail operator KiwiRail. Three roll-on roll-off (RORO) vessels operate the route, taking about three hours to complete the crossing.
The inter-island rail ferry service began in August 1962 by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR). The service primarily provided a RORO rail link between its North and South Island networks, allowing NZR to compete directly with coastal shipping companies for inter-island freight. It also provided the first RORO road link between the two islands, which saw the Wellington to Picton ferries compete with, and then completely replace, the Union Company's Wellington–Lyttelton ferry service. Today, the Interislander service is still well patronised despite competition on the Wellington–Picton sea route with Bluebridge and from airlines, carrying around one million passengers and 230,000 vehicles per year on 5,500 sailings.
In 2017, Interislander became part of The Great Journeys of New Zealand, a new tourism brand created by KiwiRail to unite its four scenic passenger services: Interislander, Northern Explorer, Coastal Pacific and the TranzAlpine.
History
Introduction
Before 1962, the North Island and South Island rail networks were not connected, and the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) struggled to compete with ships for inter-island transport. In the days before containerisation, rail freight between the islands had to be railed in a wagon to Wellington, unloaded and transferred onto a ship to Picton or Lyttelton, then loaded into another wagon before being railed the rest of the way. The Union Steam Ship Company (USSC) ran an overnight ferry between Lyttelton and Wellington using steamers. NZR also contracted SAFE Air to run its Rail Air airfreight service for freight between the islands, from Paraparaumu to Blenheim, but this was limited to aircraft payloads.
The decision to start a rail ferry was made in 1958 by the Cook Strait Transport Enquiry Committee. The enquiry was set up following Union Steam Ship's decision to withdraw the unprofitable Tamahine, built in 1925. NZR was officially reluctant to compete with USSC for inter-island traffic, but supplied the New Zealand Railway Officers' Institute with information to put to the enquiry.
The Cook Strait Inter-Island Rail and Road Service (as it was known) started on 11 August 1962 with the roll-on roll-off ferry . The service dramatically increased efficiency, since freight could stay in the same wagon the whole journey, reducing time and money. Aramoana took just 3 hours 20 minutes to cross Cook Strait, dramatically decreasing the time between the two islands for cars and passengers - Wellington to Christchurch travel time was reduced from 11 hours on the USSC ferry to nine hours by NZR ferry and road. The initial service was one sailing each way per day, Wellington to Picton in the morning and Picton to Wellington in the afternoon. The new service led to the decline of NZR's Rail Air service, which saw a dramatic drop in airfreight.
The service was an immediate success, although it was criticised for high prices. At NZ£ 9 10s one way for a family of four and a car up to 4.04 m (equal to NZ$395 in 2016 dollars,) many people thought the service was overpriced for a state-operated service. Nevertheless, it was a cash cow for NZR - in the 1963-64 financial year, it contributed £535,000 of the NZR's £538,500 working profit.
The service expanded with the addition of in 1966, in 1972 and in 1974. The Union Company responded to the competition by converting to take roll-on roll-off (RORO) road traffic and ordering a new RORO ship, . However, the resurgence was short-lived: on 10 April 1968, Wahine foundered at the entrance to Wellington Harbour during a storm, resulting in 53 deaths. By the time replacement ship entered service in 1972, competition from the Cook Strait ferries and increased competition from air travel, especially following the National Airways Corporation's introduction of the Boeing 737 in 1968, saw the Wellington-Lyttelton service become uneconomic. The Union Company withdrew in 1974, and after two years under the Ministry of Transport, the service was cancelled in September 1976. In 1982 Arahura joined the fleet to replace the ageing Aramoana and Aranui. The faster Arahura reduced the time across Cook Strait by 20 minutes to three hours.
Initially, USSC operated the ferries on NZR's behalf. This changed in 1970 when the Minister of Railways, Peter Gordon, announced that NZR would be forming its own maritime service to operate the inter-island ferries.
SeaRail and The Interislander
When the New Zealand Railways Corporation (the successor to the Railways Department) was restructured in 1982, the service was renamed "SeaRail". In 1989, it was renamed the Interisland Line, and the service became known as The Interislander. The fleet was upgraded with improved facilities and an updated livery whose logo incorporated Pelorus Jack. In 1991, New Zealand Rail Ltd, including the Interisland Line, was spun off from the Railways Corporation. In 1993, New Zealand Rail Ltd was privatised and became Tranz Rail in 1995. In 1999, Tranz Rail leased , and between 1999 and 2001 disposed of Arahanga and the Aratika.
In 2004, Toll NZ bought out Tranz Rail, and the Interisland Line was renamed the Interislander. Both ships were repainted in a new livery, with a fern replacing Pelorus Jack on the funnel - they moved to the hull with the logo. In 2005, Toll leased Challenger, which in 2007 was renamed . Kaitaki was the first Interislander ferry without a rail deck, and the first with a bow door (all the other ferries were stern boarding).
KiwiRail
On 1 July 2008, the New Zealand Government purchased Toll NZ, including Interislander, becoming part of KiwiRail.
In 2011, Aratere was lengthened by adding a 30-metre midsection to increase its capacity.
In November 2012, Interislander staff threatened strike action over the upcoming Christmas period, demanding better wages. Owner KiwiRail responded with a lock-out notice. Freight company Mainfreight slammed the union's actions as "bloody disruptive".
In November 2013, Aratere snapped a drive shaft and lost a propeller in the Cook Strait. Interislander chartered to help with the peak summer period while Aratere was under repair. In December 2014, it was announced Stena Alegra would be chartered long-term to replace the ageing Arahura. Arahura last sailed on 29 July 2015, and the Stena Alegra, refurbished and renamed Kaiarahi, entered service in September 2015.
All vessels were scheduled to be replaced by two identical rail capable vessels by 2024. Then it was planned that the much larger rail equipped ferries would be introduced in 2024 and 2025. A NZ$551m contract for the ferries was awarded to Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in 2021, with deliveries in 2025 and 2026. The new ferries will triple rail capacity, with space for 40 wagons on each ship.
The Lynx
The Lynx was the Interislander's fast ferry service across Cook Strait. Pressured by Christchurch business person Brooke McKenzie and their ill-fated Sea Shuttles NZ fast ferry service, the Interisland Line chartered the to operate a fast service across the strait for the 1994/95 summer. The "Vomit Comet", as it was sometimes dubbed, was an initial success, taking half the time of the regular Interislander ferries. Condor 10 returned to serve as The Lynx every summer until 1999, when it was replaced by the for the 1999/2000 summer. A year-round service was started in 2000 with , which was replaced in 2003 by .
In 1994, speed restrictions were imposed in Wellington harbour to reduce wash and protect ships berthed at Aotea Quay, and in May 2000 an speed limit was imposed on all ships in the Marlborough Sounds after residents complained of shoreline damage caused by the ferries. By 2002, The Lynx took 2 hours 15 minutes to complete its journey. This was only a 45-minute advantage over the Arahura and Aratere, which had the advantage of being able to operate in swells above The Lynx's limit of , which were common in Cook Strait and frequently caused cancellations.

Watson Davis (1896–1967) was the founder of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), the forerunner of the Association for Information Science and Technology, and a pioneer in the field of Library and Information Science.
They were editor of Science News Letter, the publication of Science Service, an organization established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Research Council in 1920. Their longstanding interest in attracting young people to science was noted by, among others, President Lyndon B. Johnson; President Johnson said in 1966 that Watson had "awakened the minds and directed the energies of millions of young Americans toward the achievements in research and technology which are increasingly vital to human progress." They founded, in their capacity as Director of Science Service, the Science Clubs of America, reaching at one point roughly a million school-age children across the United States; they also are one of the originators of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and the International Science Fair.
Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg, chairperson of the Atomic Energy Commission, who eulogized Watson in 1967, noted that "Watson Davis has done more for the popularization of science and the understanding of science by the general public than any other one individual."
In August 1937, Watson chaired the American delegation to the World Congress of Universal Documentation, held in Paris, France. At that event, Watson touted microfilm as a powerful means of information interchange: "[Microfilm] will supplement other forms of publication and make accessible material of all sorts that can not now be printed because of economic factors. It will make available out-of-print and rare books. It is adapted to the publication of photographs and other illustrations.... In this way the document is perpetually 'in print' but no extensive, space-consuming stocks need be stored, only the document itself and the microfilm negative from which positives are made for distribution." They also proposed at this conference that newspapers be archived on microfilm, as opposed to being stored as physical copies.

1934: Under Davis' leadership, Science Service partnered with National Agricultural Library Director Claribel Barnett to create an microfilm-based interlibrary loan program - the Bibliofilm Service – that would distribute microfilm and photocopies of scientific articles on a wide scale to researchers. In an August 5, 1935 letter to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Paul Appleby, Watson praised Barnett, saying that "under Miss Barnett's direction, this is a successful and pioneer attempt to substitute micrographic reproduction on film for the actual physical loaning of books and periodicals." Davis' ambition was to "create a constantly updated world bibliography of science"
1935 (September): Davis participates in the Congress of the International Institute of Documentation (IID) in Copenhagen and becomes familiar with European key issues and personalities in the field of documentation.
1936: The first American microfilm symposium, organized by Davis and Robert C. Binkley, a professor at Western Reserve University, is held in Richmond, VA.

Little Chenier is a 2006 American drama film directed by Bethany Ashton Wolf and written by Jace Johnson and Wolf. It is set in the bayous of Louisiana, and stars Johnathon Schaech, Frederick Koehler, Tamara Braun, Jeremy Davidson, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Mulkey. The film completed principal photography in Louisiana in August 2005, just days before Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit all of the areas they had filmed in. Wolf and Johnson, devastated for the Cajun communities of Southwest Louisiana, were grateful that they could at least give them all this film, celebrating the memory of their land, its beauty and their way of life. Given the loss that so many experienced from these hurricanes, Wolf and Johnson decided to change the ending of the film to one that represented a beacon of hope. Little Chenier premiered at the Austin Film Festival on October 20, 2006 to a standing ovation, filled with Cajuns, Southerners, and Louisianans. It continued on the festival circuit through 2007, winning 10 Best Picture Awards. It was released January 18, 2008 to a successful theatrical run by Radio London Films, then on DVD July 8, 2008.
Plot
Two brothers are victimized by a weak and jealous man in this drama shot on location in Louisiana. Beauxregard 'Beaux' Dupuis (Jonathan Schaech) lives in the swamps of Cajun country on a small stretch of land called Little Chenier with their younger mentally handicapped brother, Pemon (Fred Koehler). Beau supports them both by running a bait shop. Beaux are in love with Mary-Louise (Tamara Braun), who has left them to elope with the son of the sheriff, Carl. Neither Carl nor Beaux are fond of each other. Carl also enjoys tormenting Pemon. It is revealed that Mary-Louise left Beaux for Carl when Carl threatened to take their family's property away. When Carl's father is killed in the line of duty, their son takes their place; it isn't long before Carl learns Mary-Louise has been having an affair with Beaux, and they use their new authority to put Pemon behind bars on false change as a way of punishing Beaux.

Hurricane Rita
Three weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, Hurricane Rita hit the Little Chenier the actual place of most filming and the various parishes used for filming. Virtually all of the sets and locations used in the film were destroyed, leaving many locals homeless. The film is believed to be the only known footage of the area. Bethany Ashton and their family set up a non-profit organization called Rita Remembered to rebuild the communities and help those in need, who were largely left out of the eventual help offered to victims of Katrina. The charity is unique in that Ashton and the fellow creators invite people to correspond directly with them to find out exactly how their contributions were used.

Reviews
Time Out London says that this, ambitious documentary, is a lengthy, slow-paced series of anecdotes narrated by those who experienced the horror of the troubles in Cyprus, both Turkish and Greek, which is, at times difficult to watch and poorly subtitled, This is a film, by the end of which peace, community and the experience of war take on much deeper meanings, where, the good nature of the people recounting their stories makes the actions of the past all the more incomprehensible.

The Trafalgar Group is an opinion polling and survey company founded by Robert Cahaly and based in Atlanta, Georgia. It first publicly released polls in 2016. It successfully predicted the result of the 2016 presidential election, but it incorrectly predicted the result of the 2020 presidential election. It also predicted in October and November 2020 that Donald J. Trump would win the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, but Joe Biden ultimately won all of these states. FiveThirtyEight nevertheless included Trafalgar in its list of the most accurate pollsters of the 2020 presidential election.
Method
Trafalgar Group adjusts its polls for a "social desirability bias" effect, the hypothesized tendency of some voters to calibrate their responses to polls towards what they believe the survey taker would like to hear. It does this by not only asking respondents how they plan to vote, but also how they think their neighbors might vote. According to The New York Times, there is almost no explanation of the Trafalgar Group's methodology: "the methods page on Trafalgar's website contains what reads like a vague advertisement of its services and explains that its polls actively confront social desirability bias, without giving specifics as to how."
Responding to criticism of Trafalgar's polling methods and its lack of transparency about its methods, Cahaly said in November 2020, "I think we've developed something that's very different from what other people do, and I really am not interested in telling people how we do it. Just judge us by whether we get it right." In presidential polling, Trafalgar Group only conducts state-level polls; according to Cahaly, "we don't do national polls, and that's for the same reason I don't keep up with hits in a baseball game: It's an irrelevant statistic".
Performance and accuracy
Before the 2020 election, FiveThirtyEight gave Trafalgar a grade of C−. As of April 2021, FiveThirtyEight gave Trafalgar a grade of A−.
2016 U.S. presidential election
During the 2016 United States presidential election, Trafalgar Group was the only polling firm showing Donald Trump winning the state of Michigan, which they ultimately did, and – according to RealClearPolitics – "nearly the only" one correctly predicting Trump's win in Pennsylvania. According to the New York Times, Trafalgar correctly predicted the number of electoral votes each candidate would receive, but not which states would provide those votes.
2018 U.S. midterm elections
Trafalgar was an outlier in polling in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, with its final poll showing Brian Kemp leading by 12 points, a race they ultimately won by less than two points; every other poll showed a one or two point difference in the race.
2020 U.S. presidential election
Before the 2020 United States presidential election, Trafalgar Group said that Trump would win the election, estimating that they would win Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Joe Biden won the election with 306 electoral votes and succeeded in winning Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. As to a number of swing states, Trafalgar's latest 2020 general election polls showed Trump winning Arizona by 3 points, Georgia by 4 points, Michigan by 3 points, Nevada by 1 point, and Pennsylvania by 2 points. However, Biden won Arizona by less than 1 point, Georgia by less than 1 point, Michigan by nearly 3 points, Nevada by approximately 2.5 points, and Pennsylvania by approximately 2 points.
2021 Georgia Senate runoff elections
Leading up to the 2021 runoff elections Trafalgar Group showed both incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue initially ahead of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff yet by December they were both trailing a few points behind. On January 5th, 2021, the day before the 2 Georgia Senate runoff elections, Trafalgar predicted that Ossoff was leading by 0.9 points over Perdue and that incumbent Loeffler was leading 1.3 points over Raphael Warnock. Ossoff won by a margin of 1.2 and Loeffler lost by a margin of 2.1 percent.

Castels Castle is a castle in the municipality of Luzein of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
Nothing is known about the early history of the castle. Initially it may have been a refuge castle or a fortified church built during the Middle Ages. The oldest part of the ring wall was probably built during the 12th century. At some point in the High Middle Ages, it became the home of a noble family. By the early 14th century it was the administrative center of all the Aspermont estates in Upper Prättigau. The Lower Prättigau was controlled from Solavers Castle. In 1338 both castles and estates were sold to Count Friedrich V von Toggenburg and the knight Ulrich von Matsch. They divided the two estates between themselves in 1344, with the Matsch family taking Castels. However, by 1400 Castels was back in Toggenburg hands. When the last Count of Toggenburg, Frederick VII died in 1436, the castle returned to the Matsch family through their wife Elisabeth von Matsch.
Over the following years, Matsch family often had to pledge the castle to secure loans. By the end of the 15th century, their financial situation had become so dire that Gaudenz von Matsch sold Castels to Emperor Maximilian I von Habsburg. The League of the Ten Jurisdictions was very concerned about a Habsburg stronghold in their territory. During the Swabian War, on 16 or 17 February 1499, League troops captured the castle and forced the inhabitants to swear loyalty to the League. The Basel peace treaty in September 1499 returned the castle to the Habsburgs and by November an Austrian vogt was once again resident in the castle. However, to avoid conflicts with the League, most of the vogts were local Graubünden nobles instead of Austrian.
For the next century and a half, the castle remained the center of a Habsburg territory in Graubünden. In 1622 the inhabitants of the Prättigau region revolted against Austria. They besieged Castels in April 1622, capturing it on the 25th of the same month. The castle was partly destroyed and probably abandoned. In September 1622 Count Sulz recaptured the castle for Austria and in the Lindau peace treaty of 6 September 1622 the Prättigau was required to repair the damage to the castle. Whether they ever did is unclear, but in 1649 they bought their independence from Austria and demolished Castels Castle.
Castle site
The ruins of Castels Castle are on rocky hilltop near the village of Putz. The castle site is protected on the south side by a sheer cliff. The north or village side was protected by a ditch which is still visible. The oldest part of the castle are portions of the ring wall which were built in the 12th and 13th centuries. They were repaired and possibly expanded in the 14th or 15th century. Another construction phase in the 16th or 17th century added a wide zwinger and outer wall with a half-round tower. The main entrance was in the northern section of the wall. In the 15th or 16th century it was probably reinforced with a barbican and wall. The barbican and outer tower included firing slits for firearms or small cannons.
The main tower stands about from the ring wall. It is a square tower of about and at least four stories tall. The original high entrance was on the second story on the west side. A residence wing was built on the south-west side of the complex.
In 1616 an exhaustive inventory of the castle was taken. It records that in the 17th century, the residence wing had become a richly outfitted, two-story palas. It also included a chapel, granary and wine cellar. The buildings in the courtyard included a well, stables, a laundry and a heated bath house. The tower was used as a prison and a powder magazine.

Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

In computational learning theory in mathematics, a concept over a domain X is a total Boolean function over X. A concept class is a class of concepts. Concept classes are a subject of computational learning theory.
Concept class terminology frequently appears in model theory associated with probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. In this setting, if one takes a set Y as a set of (classifier output) labels, and X is a set of examples, the map , i.e. from examples to classifier labels (where and where c is a subset of X), c is then said to be a concept. A concept class is then a collection of such concepts.
Given a class of concepts C, a subclass D is reachable if there exists a sample s such that D contains exactly those concepts in C that are extensions to s. Not every subclass is reachable.
Background
A sample is a partial function from to . Identifying a concept with its characteristic function mapping to , it is a special case of a sample.
Two samples are consistent if they agree on the intersection of their domains. A sample extends another sample if the two are consistent and the domain of is contained in the domain of .
Examples
Suppose that . Then:
the subclass is reachable with the sample ;
the subclass for are reachable with a sample that maps the elements of to zero;
the subclass , which consists of the singleton sets, is not reachable.
Applications
Let be some concept class. For any concept , we call this concept -good for a positive integer if, for all , at least of the concepts in agree with on the classification of . The fingerprint dimension of the entire concept class is the least positive integer such that every reachable subclass contains a concept that is -good for it. This quantity can be used to bound the minimum number of equivalence queries needed to learn a class of concepts according to the following inequality:.

The Tristan thrush (Turdus eremita), also known as the starchy, is a species of bird in the thrush family that is endemic to the British overseas territories of the isolated Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean.
Description
The bird was described by John Gould as being similar in size and appearance to the song thrush, and by Henry Moseley as like a very dark-coloured song thrush. However, it also has the short rounded wings and reduced keel indicative of a reduced need for flight, typical of bird species adapted to life on small islands.
This thrush typically has a length of about . The nominate subspecies from Tristan differs from that from Nightingale Island, with the Tristan birds being warm dark brown on the upperparts rather than dull sooty-brown, rufous rather than dark fuscous on the sides of the head, and rufous-brown, rather than brownish-black, on the underparts. Birds from Inaccessible Island appear to be intermediate, with the sides of the head of a specimen from there speckled both rufous and fuscous.
Distribution and habitat
The thrush is found on Tristan, Inaccessible, Nightingale, Middle and Stoltenhoff Islands in the Tristan group. It uses all the natural habitats available on the islands, including rocky shorelines, tussock grassland, fern-dominated shrubland and wet heathland.
Taxonomy
The thrush is thought to have evolved from an ancestor in the genus Turdus from South America, and resembles an immature austral thrush, but its adaptations to life on a small island group, including an unusual brush-tipped tongue modified for extracting the contents of eggs, have been used as reasons to warrant its separation into the monotypic genus Nesocichla. However, molecular analysis has indicated that not only is it part of a South American clade of Turdus, but also that it falls squarely within that genus.
There are three subspecies, the ranges of which correspond to the three main islands in the group:
Turdus eremita eremita Gould, 1855 (Tristan da Cunha)
Turdus eremita gordoni Stenhouse, 1924 (Inaccessible Island)
Turdus eremita procax Elliott, 1954 (Nightingale, Middle and Stoltenhoff Islands)
Behaviour
Breeding
The thrush breeds from September to February. Its cup-shaped nest is woven from strands of grasses and other vegetation, and sited on or close to the ground. It lays a clutch of two or three, occasionally four, eggs. The fledging period is about 20 days.
Feeding
An opportunistic omnivore and scavenger, the thrush feeds on earthworms and other invertebrates of the soil and leaf litter, as well as on carrion, berries, the eggs and fledglings of other birds, and kitchen scraps.
Seabird predation
In 2010 a paper published by Peter Ryan and Rob Ronconi in the journal Ardea reported an observation of Tristan thrushes breaking open an egg of the Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. They also found that the thrush is a regular predator of the eggs and small chicks of the great shearwater, being responsible for almost half of the egg losses by that species during the early incubation period in a colony on Inaccessible Island. They saw evidence that the thrushes remove eggs of the spectacled petrel (a breeding endemic of Inaccessible Island) from their nesting burrows. The thrushes are also known to kill both white-bellied and white-faced storm petrels directly, probably by taking them from their burrows. Furthermore, they have been observed to drink blood from penguins.
Status and conservation
The thrush is classified as near threatened because it has a small population with a restricted range. Predation by black rats on Tristan is an ongoing threat, though the other islands it occupies are rat-free. The feral cats that previously occupied Tristan have been eradicated. Conservation recommendations by BirdLife International are to continue regular population monitoring, to control rats on Tristan, and to prevent further introductions of mammalian predators.
Population
A survey in 1972–1974 estimated the separate island populations as Tristan 40–60 pairs, Inaccessible 100–500 pairs, Nightingale 300–500 pairs, Middle 20–40 pairs and Stoltenhoff 10–20 pairs. In the 1980s the population of Inaccessible Island was revised to 850 pairs, and the total population for the whole group to about 6,000 individual birds. More recently, the number of birds on Tristan has been roughly estimated at several hundred. The population is stable with no evidence of decline in numbers or range.

Nowzad Dogs is a British-based animal welfare charity. It was created by Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marines commando, after rescuing a dog they called Nowzad whilst serving in the town of Nawzad in Afghanistan .
Origins
During their deployment to Afghanistan in 2006 as part of the Royal Marines in 42 Commando, Farthing and their troops broke up a fight between two dogs in the town of Nawzad. Following this, one of the dogs followed Farthing and they ended up spending the following six months together, with the dog named Nowzad after the town. After the end of their deployment, Farthing brought the dog home to the UK. This inspired them to create the nonprofit company Nowzad Dogs.
Charity's work
Nowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales. Nowzad Dogs NFP is a 501c3 tax exempt organisation in the USA.
The charity reunites servicemen with the dogs and cats who befriended them on service following the soldier's return home. It also aids animal welfare in Afghanistan, and built the first animal rescue centre in the country. In addition to reuniting ex-servicemen with dogs and cats they knew from Afghanistan, Farthing through Nowzad has rescued animals to be adopted by members of the public once they are brought to the UK. Among these was a dog named Wylie, who was adopted by Sarah Singleton. The dog competed at Scruffts 2014, the non-pedigree competition run by The Kennel Club in the UK, where it was named dog of the year. Farthing later wrote a book about Wylie, entitled Wylie: The Brave Street Dog Who Never Gave Up, which was published in 2014.
The charity's founder Pen Farthing was nominated for the Lifetime Achievement award at the Daily Mirror and RSPCA Animal Hero Awards in 2013, for their work with the Nowzad charity. They were named one of ten "Heroes of 2014" by CNN.
Evacuation
After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, Farthing's supporters raised money for privately chartering a flight to evacuate their staff as well as the animals sheltered by their charity.
Visas for 68 people, including the staff of the charity and their immediate family members, were granted on 23 August and safe passage from Kabul was available to them at this point had they wished it but they chose not to leave the animals to die.. The animals (173 dogs and cats) were allowed to be evacuated on 25 August as well. They were however forced to leave without entering the airport on 26 August, since the United States government had modified the rules for getting inside the compound shortly before they arrived there. Farthing later stated that five cats had died during the journey, and they believed one dog was stabbed by the Taliban.
Farthing reached the airport along with the charity's animals on 27 August, but they were forced to leave their staff behind. The Taliban detained their convoy for half an hour, after which their drivers were allowed to drive to the side of the airport controlled by the British military. As they came across the zone dividing the Taliban-controlled part and British-controlled part, the drivers had to disembark, with a Parachute Regiment member being ordered to drive the convoy for the rest of the way. Farthing left Afghanistan along with the animals on 28 August. They landed at the Heathrow Airport in London on 29 August. The animals were later sent to quarantine kennels.
67 employees working for the charity were able to leave Afghanistan and cross into Pakistan on 11 September, after the British government convinced the government of Pakistan to grant them clearance. Their family members were also able to escape with them. The group was placed under the care of the British High Commission in Islamabad,. and later flown to the United Kingdom to resettle there. A branch of Nowzad remained in Kabul, operating as a donkey rescue centre and staffed by workers who did not want to leave Afghanistan.
In December 2021, a Foreign Office whistleblower alleged that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given an instruction to "use considerable capacity to transport Nowzad's animals", and that visas were granted to Nowzad staff to enable evacuation to Pakistan despite not meeting the eligibility criteria at the time. Johnson denied the allegation, calling them "complete nonsense".

The Orthodox Church of Sts. Vera, Hope, Loy and the mother of their Zofia (Saints Faith, Hope and Love) in Sosnowiec – the only one existing of the three Orthodox Orthodox churches in Sosnowiec.
It is located at Jan Kilinski Street 39. It is a parish church. It is part of the Deaconate of the Diocese of Lodz-Poznan Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church.
History
The idea of construction first appeared in 1887. A contribution was made by the Sosnowiec and Lodz industrialists – people so deserved for the development of Sosnowiec such as Schoen, Heinrich Dietel, Gamper, Kunitzy and others. – mostly evangelicals or the Jews, who cared for good relations with the Russian government. The building plot was received free of charge from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway. On August 15, 1888 the cornerstone was laid, and on November 28 the following year, the temple was consecrated by the Bishop of Lublin Flawiana. The patrons of the new church were: Vera, Nadezhda and Liubov, daughters of Sts. Sophia, martyrs of Hadrian's time. Construction went very quickly, which reflected on the quality of the building.
Primary priests from neighboring parishes in Maczki, Olkusz and Częstochowa served, but already in April 1890 the new church received the first parish priest – Joanna Wasiliewicz Lewicki (from Calvary in Podlasie). May 16, 1890 Archbishop of Warsaw and Chełm – Leoncius confirmed the creation of an independent parish at the Orthodox Church of Saints Vera, Nadjeżdy, Ljub'wi and their mother Zofia, to which belonged Będzin County, the staff of the local border guard and customs officials. Next to it was a parish house – the seat of the clergyman and a separate house for the church governor.
Today the Orthodox Church belongs to the parishes of Saints Vera, Hope, Luby and their mother Zofia in Sosnowiec in the diocese of Lodz-Poznan. The parish (as one of the two Orthodox institutions in the Silesian province) covers the southern part of the voivodeship, among others. Katowice agglomeration, Bielsko-Biała, Rybnik. The current pastor is Fr. Mitrat Sergiusz Dziewiatowski.
March 16, 2014 in the temple – for the first time in its history – priesthood was celebrated.
Architecture
Built of bricks and stone, the church consists of five parts. In the center there is an octagon, which on one side supports the tower, and on the other the presbytery. The central part of the temple covers the dome, which is visible only from the inside, because the whole is covered with an onion helmet. Entrance to the Orthodox church is a frontage in the shape of a pile of ridge, based on two, pearly columns separated from the wall, creating the impression of "bilayer". The interior of the building, in contrast to its appearance, carries the signs of the word literality – it is clear, made in classicist style. The Oak Iconostasis (pronounced 4,7 × 7 m), which was created by the Muscovite artist Liebediew, and the founders of the Schöen brothers, also possesses signs of Western influences – particularly in the iconic style. Czestochowa Icon of Our Lady (placed in the left hand side of the altar) is a gift from railway workers from Częstochowa. From 2017 in the church there is a patron saint icon, written on Athos (which contains the relics of the Holy Faith, Hope, Love and Mother of their Sophia, brought in the 1980s from Rome to the Sosnowiec temple).
The church was entered in the register of monuments on October 10, 1980 under number A-1242/80.

Critical reception
Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter called the film "low-tech, high-tension", writing that "The lonely, uncanny and sometimes unthinkingly violent world of childhood is explored with chilling candor and exceptional skill". Jessica Kiang of Variety praised the performances of the child actors as well as the film's atmosphere, calling the film "both a satisfying genre exercise and a minute observation of the process by which young children acquire morality." Sight & Sounds Anton Bitel wrote that the film "uses its genre frame to show the connectedness, curiosity and cruelty of its young characters, and also asks whether the inevitable loss of innocence at this age is a slate that can ever simply be cleaned."

The Jordanian Association for Boy Scouts and Girl Guides () is the national Scouting and Guiding organization of Jordan. Scouting was founded in Jordan in 1954 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1955. Guiding started in 1938 and became a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 1978. It serves 15,521 Scouts (as of 2011) and 9,480 Guides (as of 2003).
The Scout slogan is, "the Scout movement participates in development and works to serve society."
Scouts and Guides participate in the painting of schools, building walls, laying floors in public places, conducting literacy campaigns, harvesting crops, visiting the poor, sick and aged.
Although the Association is for both boys and girls, the programs are separate and there are no mixed units.
The Scout Motto is Kun Musta'idan or كن مستعداً, translating as Be Prepared in Arabic, though the local variant is Wa ai'doo or و أعدوا. The noun for a single Scout is Kashaf or كشاف in Arabic.
International Scouting units in Jordan
In addition, there are American Boy Scouts in Amman, linked to the Direct Service branch of the Boy Scouts of America, which supports units around the world.

"What Made the Red Man Red?" is a song from the 1953 Disney animated film Peter Pan with music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Sammy Cahn, in which "the natives tell their story through stereotypical dance while singing". Some modern audiences consider it racist and offensive due to its exaggerated stereotypes. Although a similar depiction was displayed within J. M. Barrie's original play, later adaptations have reimagined the Natives, while the Disney version—and this song in particular—were said to have "doubled-down on racial stereotypes".
It has been compared to the song "Savages" from the 1995 Disney film Pocahontas, which contains negative lyrics regarding Native Americans; in contrast with "What Made the Red Man Red?", however, the offensive lyrics in "Savages" were written purposely, as they are sung by the villains of the movie, in order to illustrate the message that racism is wrong.

Peter Pan and Wendy come across the Indians (who refer to themselves as "Injuns") once arriving in Neverland. Wishing to learn more about them, the Lost Boys ask the Indians three questions: "What made the red man red?", "When did they first say 'Ugh'?" and "Why do they ask you 'How?'" (a corruption of the Lakota word "Hau", which translates to "Hello", etc.). This song is performed by "the big-nosed, guttural Chief character" accompanied by their tribesmen, who answer the questions. The Indians pass the peace pipe to the children (which John smokes, but becomes nauseous after) as they tell their tale.
Composition
Writer Kim McLarin of NPR describes it as a "bouncy, drum-heavy song", while the Best of Disney calls it a "labored routine".
Contemporary reception
Complex notes that in the 21st century, "you can't just ask people 'What Makes the Red Man Red?, and comments on the Lost Boys' musical number: "Jeez, you little monsters, no wonder you're orphans." Althouse said the song has "obvious political correctness problems". AllDay notes that "the one time they break into song" is the only time the Native Americans do not speak in broken English throughout the film. In the article "Caught on Film: The Racist Ghosts of Disney's Past", DivineCaroline writes "The best part of the song is when the singers say that their version is the right one, 'no matter what's been written or said'." Bustle deems the song a "big ol' pile of racism". MediaDiversed says the "horror that was the song" serves to reinforce stereotypes and racist attitudes. The site Great Indian Moments From Pop Culture calls the "insipid tune" the "worst" of the "troublesome Native stereotypes" in Disney's Peter Pan. On the choral chant "Hana Mana Ganda", it notes that "the chorus, with its 'nonsense' words, simply reduces indigenous languages (and semantics) to sheer gibberish".
The Guardian writes that the song is "exactly as alarming to modern eyes and ears as its title suggests". Minnesota Playlist argues that this "infamous" number "upped the racist ante". RantLifestyle notes that "the chief ... is a walking stereotype", and sums up their view of the song by saying "Oh dear". David Martinez, author of American Indians and Film, writes, "My jaw hit the ground when I heard this song and saw these 'redskins' hopping around and making fools of themselves. Granted it was only a cartoon, but it was one in which the animators took the liberty of demeaning an entire race in the name of entertainment." The rapper Narcycist references the song in an article about the use of subtle racism in film. The Hollywood Reporter calls the song "infamous". Sasha Houston Brown, Santee Sioux tribe member and adviser to the American Indian Success Program at Minneapolis Community and Technical College, says about the scene: "I remember seeing it and not having the skills to understand why it made me feel embarrassed. What does that do to a child's formation of identity, even if it's subliminal and subconscious? The message is, 'You're not human. You're a trend. You're something that can be commodified and bought and sold. An opinion article at The Daily Revelle notes the problem of depicting Native Americans in this way: "Disney has always been there to teach proper morals ... from an early start, Americans are fed these ideas, and the topic is never properly taught to correct them ... If you're teaching American history, put the time and effort into respectfully educating others on the extraordinary people that were here first."
In an essay for Tor.com, American author and critic Mari Ness argues that the "cartoon war dance" and song go even further than Barrie's play by "stat[ing] that the Indians are not just savages, but sexist savages, who force Wendy to go fetch firewood while the other boys have fun." Wired says the "really awkward scene" features a "thoroughly appalling song, arguably more racist than anything in the notorious Song of the South". The blog Racial Stereotyping notes, "Not only does this video stereotype Native Americans but it also stereotypes women". Banon's Roar writes, "Watching now its [sic] cringe inducing. Every line is some kind of gag about how their skin is red and they make weird noises. Compare it even to the Crows from Dumbo. They were timely caricatures as well, but their jokes were not aimed at humiliating themselves." LeapToad says, "If any other ethnic group were treated this way, this film would have quietly disappeared, much like Song of the South has." Though Hollywood.com names the 1953 film version as the third best Peter Pan adaption, it recommends that viewers "forget that whole 'What Made the Red Man Red?' part, for obvious reasons". Greg Ehrbar of Mouse Tracks says the song "veers precariously into politically incorrect territory".
Marc Davis, one of the supervising animators of the 1953 film, said in an interview years after the production, "I'm not sure we would have done the Indians if we were making this movie now. And if we had we wouldn't do them the way we did back then...The Indians were Ward Kimball's stuff. Beautifully done. The Indians could not have been done that way nowadays. I like them. Very funny. Very entertaining, especially the Big Chief." Disney historian Jim Korkis stated in attempt to clarify, "It is important to remember that Peter Pan was supposed to represent a young boy's impression of pirates, mermaids and Indians and, as a result, these fanciful creations bore more of a relation to popular culture storybooks than reality."
Legacy
When the film has been syndicated on television, the native scene has often been removed.
Because of the perceived racial insensitivity of the characters and this song in particular by the time the film Return to Never Land was released in theatres in 2002, the Indians were not featured as characters in that movie. However, they appear physically in the tie-in videogame Peter Pan: Adventures in Never Land and in the Disney's Magic English series.
In Disney's Peter Pan, Jr. stage musical adaptation, the song is replaced by "What Makes the Brave Man Brave?", which focuses less on Native American stereotypes and more on the honor and courage of a hero.
During production of the 2015 Warner Bros. live-action film Pan, the film's developers made a deliberate choice to distance the character of Tiger Lily and their people from Native American heritage and reimagine them as lacking any particular ethnicity, in order to "avoid the racial insensitivities of... Disney's 1953 animated film, which infamously featured the song 'What Made the Red Man Red?
The song is sampled in the Frank Waln song of the same title, in which they rap about the legacy of genocide and colonialism and criticizes the original song for its alleged racism.

Big air is a high-injury-risk sports discipline where the competitor rides a vehicle, such as a motocross motorcycle, a skateboard, a snowboard, or a pair of skis, down a hill or ramp and performs aerial tricks after launching off very large jumps. In most versions, there is one large jump and therefore only one opportunity to perform a trick. It is an extreme version of slopestyle. Competitors perform complex tricks in the air, aiming to attain sizable height and distance as well, all while making every effort to secure a clean landing. Many competitions also require the rider to do a specific trick to win the major prize.
The term was coined by French-Canadians because of their love for the extreme nature of the event.
Skiing and snowboarding
Since 2004, Big Air Skiing has been featured in the FIS Snowboard World Championships.
In 2018, Big Air became the newest snowboarding event introduced in the Olympic Games.
In the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the ski Big Air event was held for the first time in Olympic history. The dedicated venue was Big Air Shougang.

The Abwehrflammenwerfer 42 was a German static defensive flamethrower, flame fougasse or flame mine used during the Second World War. The design was copied from Russian FOG-1 mines that were encountered in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. These were usually buried at intervals of covering road blocks, landing beaches, harbour walls and other obstacles. They were normally mixed in with other mines or emplaced behind barbed wire and could be command detonated or triggered by tripwires or other devices.
The mine consisted of a large fuel cylinder high and with a capacity of containing a black viscid liquid; a mix of light, medium, and heavy oils. A second, smaller cylinder, in diameter and high, was mounted on top of the fuel cylinder; it contained the propellant powder, which was normally either black powder or a mixture of nitrocellulose and diethylene glycol dinitrate. A flame tube was fixed centrally on top of the fuel cylinder, it was a diameter pipe that rose from the centre of the fuel cylinder and curved to extend horizontally approximately . When the mine was buried, only the flame tube was normally above ground.
When the mine was triggered, a squib charge ignited the propellant, creating a burst of hot gas which forced the fuel from the main cylinder and out of the flame tube. A second squib ignited the fuel as it passed out of the end of the tube. The projected stream of burning fuel was wide and high with a range of about , and lasted about 1.5 seconds.

The Wrentham Developmental Center, formerly Wrentham State School, is a historic state-run medical facility for the treatment of psychiatric and developmental disorders. It is located on a large campus at the junction of Emerald and North Streets in Wrentham, Massachusetts. The school was authorized by the state in 1906, and the first phase of the campus was developed between 1909 and 1917. The school opened in 1910. The school had a typical patient population of 1,200-1,300 during the 1920s. The name was changed in the 1990s. The school campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
History
The school was established in 1906 by the state as its second institution for "feeble-minded" children, after the Fernald School in Waltham. The latter school was instrumental in the school's early days, providing both staff and patients. School trustees purchased of land north of Wrentham center, which was later expanded to more than . Two farmhouses, dating to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, were adapted for early use, while the school's early buildings were built. Later adapted to house the superintendent and their assistant, one of them still stands at the junction of North and Dedham Streets.
Through the 1920s the school expanded in size, building patient wards, employee housing, school facilities, and agricultural buildings to support the farm work some of the patients engaged in. By the end of World War II, the school had a student population of about 2,000, over its nominal capacity of 1,800. It underwent further expansion in the 1950s, and reached a peak population of 2,163 in 1965. In 1975, the state was forced by legal action to shift away from institutional treatment of developmentally disabled people. The Superintendent, Dr. John D. Webster fought the cutbacks; but ultimately Governor Michael Dukakis put an end to it and the school's population was reduced to 628 by 1989. Significant portions of the school's lands, mainly east of North Street and south of Emerald Street, have been adapted to other uses, as have portions of the surviving campus buildings.

The Keewatin Railway Company is a First Nations-owned shortline railroad that operates in northern Manitoba, between The Pas, and Pukatawagan. This is Canada's second First Nations railway, the first being Labrador and Northern Quebec's Tshiuetin Rail Transportation.
The railway company currently operates a line formerly owned by Hudson Bay Railway, and used by Via Rail passenger trains. Via Rail previously operated a twice-weekly passenger rail service between The Pas and Pukatawagan through an operating agreement with Hudson Bay Railway Company. This passenger service continues under a new operating agreement between Keewatin Railway Company and Via Rail , which still operates twice-weekly passenger trains (Numbers 290/291) through an agreement with the new company. These are mixed trains.
History
The rail line was originally the 185-mile (310 km-long) Sherridon Subdivision, between Sheritt Junction and Lynn Lake. This was part of the Hudson Bay Railway (HBRY) system, and Via Rail had operated trains between The Pas and Pukatawagan under an agreement with HBRY, but had suspended them from July 27 and August 2, 2005, because the Hudson Bay Railway line had become unsafe due to recent heavy rains in the area loosening the railbed.
On April 1, 2006, the Hudson Bay Railway sold the Sherridon Subdivision to the three native tribes in the area, who now own and operate the railway. The First Nations-owned railway company received $4.9 million dollars in grants from the Government of Canada, $1.25 million from the Government of Manitoba and $500,000 from three First Nations communities (the Mathaias Colomb Indian Band, Tataskweyak Cree Nation, and the War Lake First Nation, who jointly own and operate the railway to this day) for the railway line purchase. The Federal Government has also given the three tribes up to $3.2 million for start-up fees and investments, which include the purchase of locomotives, railway equipment, transitional services, office equipment, and infrastructure work (maintenance) on the rail line. This funding comes from the Regional and Remote Passenger Rail Services Contribution Program administered by Transport Canada.

Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up? is a novel published in 1975 by author John R. Powers. It was subsequently adapted into a Broadway musical and a screenplay.
Film in development
Director and author Ken Kwapis (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and He's Just Not That Into You), drafted a screenplay for a non-musical film version of the book in late 2005.
Theater
The show has become a highly popular choice of regional and community theatres. The original 1979 Chicago production's -year run at the Forum Theater was the longest in the city's history it featured Megan Mullally, Anthony Crivello and Chloe Webb among many others. "Shoes" broke house records during its two runs in Philadelphia. However, the show did not duplicate its success on Broadway. Opening on May 27, 1982 at the Alvin Theatre, it closed on May 30 after five performances. Directed by Mike Nussbaum (Chicago and Broadway) and choreographed by Thommie Walsh (Broadway). In addition to Russ Thacker as Eddie and Maureen Moore as Becky, the cast included Don Stitt, Vicki Lewis and Jason Graae.
Musical
The 1950s era story from the original books by John R. Powers was also turned into a musical with music and lyrics by James Quinn and Alaric 'Rokko' Jans in 1979. Produced by Libby Adler Mages and Daniel Golman of Mavin Productions. The original coming of age musical involves the 1950s Catholic education of eight Chicago children, following them from the start of elementary school through the senior prom and beyond. Along the way it touches on such topics as first confessions, puppy love, patron saints, teacher's pets, sex education classes, and the importance of not wearing patent leather shoes as they could reflect up under the school uniform's plaid pleated skirts. One of the central plot elements running through the musical is that Eddie Ryan is infatuated with a chubby girl, Becky Bakowski. They become their best friend, and they later falls in love with them when they mature into a beautiful young woman. Unfortunately, they have decided to become a nun. Many years later Eddie returns to their old elementary school to inquire about Becky only to find they have left the order and is teaching in a small school in Indiana. At the end of the musical they are reunited.
An original cast recording was released by Bay Cities Records.
The licensing agent for all performances is Samuel French, Inc., which calculates over 250 performances are given each year in North America.

Prides Crossing station is a former MBTA Commuter Rail station on the Newburyport/Rockport Line, located in the village of Prides Crossing in Beverly, Massachusetts. It was opened by the Eastern Railroad as a flag stop in the mid-19th century. A stick style wooden station building was constructed around 1880 as wealthy residents built summer homes in the area. The Eastern Railroad was acquired in 1885 by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M), which operated commuter service to Prides Crossing until the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) took over in the 1970s. Prides Crossing was reduced to peak-hour-only service in 1981. It was temporarily closed in December 2020 because of low ridership and a lack of accessibility, with the closure becoming indefinite in April 2021. The former station building, not used by the railroad since the mid-20th century, is occupied by a private business.
Station design
Prides Crossing station was located in the village of Prides Crossing, just west of the level crossing of the Gloucester Branch on Hale Street (Route 127). It had a single low-level side platform on the south side of the two tracks, with an asphalt patch crossing the south track to allow passengers to reach trains on the north track. The station was not accessible.
The former station building, a one-story stick style structure now occupied by a private business, is located on the south side of the tracks adjacent to the platform. The original canopies have been cut back and enclosed for additional space, and the main building modified as well. On the street side of the station building are two benches labeled "Democrats" and "Republicans", which have been local landmarks for decades. In 2015, the well-worn original benches were auctioned for charity and replaced with replicas.
History
Early history
In March 1845, the Eastern Railroad received permission to build a branch line from Beverly to Gloucester. The Gloucester Branch opened to on August 3, 1847, and to on December 1. By the 1850s, the railroad had flag stops at several locations in Beverly, including at Prides (Prides Crossing). The location was named for John Pride – supposedly a nephew of Thomas Pride – who was granted land in the area in 1636. The station had a small shelter and a flagman "stone deaf and so indifferent to the approach of the train that the passengers had to do their own flagging."
A wooden station building – the "tiniest" of the stations in Beverly – was built in 1879 or 1880. Commuting from stops on the Gloucester Branch was possible from the 1870s onward. Prides Crossing was often used by the wealthy residents, including William Loring, who built their summer homes nearby in the later decades of the 19th century and the early 20th century. William Henry Moore and Henry Clay Frick had sidings near the station for their private railroad cars. (The concrete shed for Frick's car Westmoreland, later converted to a private residence, is still extant at 49 Thissell Street.) The Eastern Railroad became part of the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M) in 1885. The interior woodwork was damaged by a fire on November 12, 1903. In 1915, Moore proposed to fund a new stone station – provided that it was renamed "Moores Crossing". Between 1924 and 1926, service to the station was reduced from 18 inbound and 16 outbound trains to 6 in each direction, which led to nearby estate owners having difficulty retaining domestic workers.
MBTA era
The B&M sold or leased many disused station buildings in the mid-20th century. The station building at Prides Crossing was converted to an ice cream parlor by 1962, and to a general store by 1968. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service. On January 18, 1965, the MBTA began subsidizing some B&M service, including as far as Manchester on the Gloucester Branch. The MBTA bought most B&M commuter rail assets, including the Gloucester Branch, on December 27, 1976. Weekend and midday service to Prides Crossing was ended on February 1, 1981, due to budget cuts, leaving the station with only limited peak-hour service. However, peak-hour express trains for the wealthy North Shore communities, which made only one stop between Prides Crossing and Boston, lasted into the 1980s.
On August 11, 1981, a westbound MBTA Commuter Rail train collided with an eastbound B&M freight train at Prides Crossing. The cab car leading the MBTA train was thrust into the air over the freight locomotive. Two trainmen and a passenger on the freight and the engineer on the commuter train were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the crash was caused by two dispatchers failing to properly communicate, resulting in the two trains being put on the same track (the second track was out of service due to construction).
On January 20, 1984, the North Station approach trestles were destroyed by a fire. Gloucester Branch trains were terminated at a temporary station near or bussed from . On November 16, 1984, the Beverly Draw bridge connecting Salem to Beverly burned, cutting off the Rockport Branch and the Ipswich Line from the rest of the system. (All lines running north and west from the Ipswich Line were abandoned by 1984, leaving no route to move equipment to the rest of the system.) A shuttle train was run from Rockport to Beverly Depot until January 7, 1985, when it was replaced by bus service. The locomotives used were then trucked to Danvers so they could be repaired at the MBTA's main maintenance facility. Most of the stations on the cut-off sections were upgraded with accessible mini-high platforms during the closure; due to its low ridership, Prides Crossing was not upgraded. A new bridge opened on December 1, 1985, reconnecting the lines to the larger system.
Closure
With just 15 daily boardings by a 2018 count, Prides Crossing was the third-lowest-ridership station on the MBTA Commuter Rail system, ahead of only Plimptonville station and Silver Hill station. By that time, the station was served by only three peak-hour inbound trips and five peak-hour outbound trips out of fifteen weekday round trips operated on the Gloucester Branch; weekend service did not stop at the station. In November 2020, as part of service cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic, the MBTA proposed to close Prides Crossing and five other low-ridership stations. Prides Crossing was nominated for closure because of its low ridership and lack of accessibility; the accessible Beverly Farms station is just to the east.
On December 14, reduced schedules went into effect due to limited employee availability. Based on the existing weekend service, these temporary schedules did not include service to Prides Crossing. That day, the MBTA Board voted to enact a more limited set of cuts, including indefinitely closing Prides Crossing and four of the other five stations. The closure of the five stations became indefinite effective April 5, 2021.

Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation is a 2014 non-fiction novel written by Blake J. Harris. It follows business person Tom Kalinske in their venture as CEO of video game company Sega of America from 1990 to 1996, and details the history of the fierce business competition between Sega and Nintendo throughout the 1990s as well as the internal conflicts that took place between Sega of America and its Japanese parent company, Sega Enterprise. Harris wrote the book in the style of a novel by compiling several interviews with people who were involved with the events, using the information gathered to create a dramatic interpretation of the events. A documentary of the book directed by Harris and Jonah Tulis was released on CBS All Access on September 23, 2020. A miniseries adaptation is in development with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg executive producing with Jordan Vogt-Roberts directing.
Synopsis
A few years after stepping down as CEO of Mattel, Tom Kalinske is on vacation with their family in Hawaii when they are visited by an old friend, Hayao Nakayama, who offers Kalinske a job as CEO of the American division of a small video game company called Sega. Despite being initially reluctant to take the job as they know nothing about video games, Kalinske agrees to fly out to Japan, where Nakayama shows them several products being developed by Sega, including their handheld portable system, the Game Gear, and their 16-bit home console, the Sega Genesis. Kalinske is enthralled, especially when they spot a man playing a Game Boy while drinking at a geisha club.
However, when Kalinske arrives for their first day as CEO, they find Sega of America to be in complete disarray: their predecessor, Michael Katz, has driven the firm to near-bankruptcy by overspending on unpopular titles like James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, the company is unable to source third-party games due to Nintendo having exclusive contracts with most developers, and the staff is rife with infighting and finger-pointing. The Genesis, hampered by poor marketing and a shoddy game library, has sold fewer than 500,000 units, only half of the sales needed to keep Sega of America afloat. Taking charge, Kalinske assembles a new leadership team and decides to adopt the "Gillette model", demanding complete control over marketing for the Genesis, which includes replacing the game originally bundled with the Genesis, Altered Beast, with a new, little-known title, Sonic the Hedgehog. Sega's Japanese executives politely refuse to authorize their plans, but Nakayama overrules them and gives Kalinske the green light. Following a successful demonstration of Sonic at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show, the newly released Super NES was unable to outsell the Genesis throughout 1991, marking the first time since 1985 that the Nintendo does not dominate the home console market.
Bolstered with confidence, Kalinske and Sega decide to further establish their newfound dominance by promoting the Genesis (and by extension, Sega), as a cool, edgier alternative to the "family-friendly" games of Nintendo, targeting teenage gamers and adults. For example, when Nintendo decides to release a censored version of Mortal Kombat following a public outcry over the game's violent content, Sega of America puts out its own version on the Genesis with a special "blood code" that bypasses such restrictions. In response to criticism that the decision is tasteless, Kalinske decides to create the industry's first "ratings system" for Sega's games, which eventually evolves into the Entertainment Software Ratings Board.
Despite all this success, cracks begin to appear in Sega of America's fortunes. Kalinske works on a deal with Sony to collaborate on a new console that Nintendo had abandoned, but their superiors in Japan, believing the project to be wasteful, cancel it; the console is eventually released by Sony as the "PlayStation" to instant success. Sega of Japan begins producing a new 32-bit console, the Sega Saturn, and gradually discontinues support for the Genesis despite Kalinske's protests that the latter is still commercially viable; this, coupled with distribution and logistical issues as well as the Saturn's disappointing selection of games, lack of a Sonic title, and unpolished design, make it a commercial failure. Kalinske and their team find that Sega of Japan is increasingly shutting them out of company decisions.
Aware that Nintendo's latest project, the Nintendo 64, will effectively render the Saturn obsolete, Kalinske and several other staffers decide to resign from Sega of America, with Kalinske shifting their focus towards producing educational games for children. The book ends with Kalinske and their family once again vacationing in Hawaii, only to discover a note from then-chairperson of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln upon returning home, expressing their sadness towards Kalinske's departure from Sega while acknowledging them as a driving force in the video game industry. Sega quickly discontinues the Saturn and in 1999 releases the Sega Dreamcast, a console with advanced features such as Internet connectivity, but it becomes clear that the company is losing money on consoles. By 2001, Sega has transitioned to a third-party developer making games for their former rivals, Nintendo and Sony, and their replacement in the console market, Microsoft.
Critical reception
Reviewing for The A.V. Club, John Teti gave the book a "C" grade, criticizing the sections of dialogue: "Harris' acts of embroidery drag Console Wars down", but also stating that "the innovation and corporate skulduggery of the Sega-Nintendo clash is so entertaining that Harris' functional prose still tells a lively tale". Frank Cifaldi of Kotaku had similar critiques but praised the level of research that went into the book.
The New York Times, The Daily Telegraph, and The Independent all gave negative reviews, citing the dialogue as the fatal flaw. Chris Suellentrop for The New York Times observed that "the reconstructed dialogue can be stilted and phony".
A positive review came from Wired, with Chris Kohler writing "Console Wars slots in nicely to the previously existing library of history books covering the game industry".
Documentary
In 2016 the producers of BBC's The Gamechangers secured the rights from Sony Pictures to develop a television documentary film inspired by the book, as part of a series of documentary films based on video game culture. In 2019, the project moved to CBS All Access. It was to premiere at the SXSW event in March 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SXSW event was cancelled. The documentary complements the dramatized adaptation that was also announced. The documentary was released on CBS All Access on September 23, 2020.
Television drama series
Harris had support from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg while writing the book, both of whom contributed to the book's foreword. In 2014, Rogen stated they were interested in turning the book into a movie under Sony Pictures, and had already secured the rights from Harris. By November 2018, this project had transitioned to become a limited television series to be produced by Legendary Pictures with both Rogen and Goldberg serving as executive producers from their production company, Point Grey Pictures. Jordan Vogt-Roberts was slated to direct. The series was picked up by CBS to be streamed via their CBS All Access service alongside the asupervisorstioned documentary, that was also executive produced by Rogen and Goldberg.

In molecular biology, YqeY is a type of protein domain of unknown function. It is thought to have a role in protein synthesis, facilitating the production of charged transfer RNA used in the process of translating mRNA into protein. It is present as a domain of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) in almost all eukaryotes.
Function
The YqeY domain has been found to be involved in the recognition of tRNA charged with the amino acid glutamine (tRNA-Gln). In some cases YqeY also increases the affinity of GlnRS for tRNA-Gln, but only when present in cis (that is, as part of the GlnRS polypeptide chain). However, the presence of YqeY as a standalone domain in organisms without GlnRS suggests that YqeY domains may have additional cellular functions.
Homology
This protein domain shares sequence homology with the C-terminal domain of GatB and GatE, the tRNA-binding subunits of bacterial and archaeal glutamine amidotransferases.

April Fools is a 2007 American slasher film written and directed by Nancy Norman. It stars Daya Vaidya, Aaliyah Franks, Darrin Henson, and Obba Babatundé.
Plot
While pulling an April Fools' Day prank on a nerdy classmate named Melvin, a group of high school friends (Missy, DeAnna, Eva, Diego, Malik, and Marlin) accidentally kill them when Marlin hits Melvin with a football, causing them to fall on and they are impaled by a piece of rebar as a result. Panicking, the group drag Melvin's body into a wooded area, and stage it to look like they were the victim of a random gang-related attack. Exactly one year later, DeAnna is stabbed to death by a hooded figure while interning at a hospital. After murdering DeAnna, the killer writes "April Fools" on a wall with their blood.
Hearing about DeAnna's death, Missy meets up with the others, convinced that DeAnna's murder may have something to do with Melvin's death, though their worries are dismissed. Later, Eva is stabbed in a locker room after dance practice by the same hooded assailant, who once again writes "April Fools" on a wall in blood. Unaware of Eva's death, Missy goes to the high school's Spring Jam, despite being unnerved by surveillance footage of DeAnna's murder, accidentally left in their room by their detective father.
At the Spring Jam, Missy recognizes the attending killer from the surveillance footage, and looks for help from Malik after witnessing Diego and a teacher be murdered. Malik and the killer fight, sparking a brawl on the dance floor that covers the killer's escape after they fatally stab Malik. Along with the other revelers, Missy is rounded up by the authorities, and at the police station they admit to them and their friends' involvement in Melvin's death to their father. A police officer escorts Missy home, where they are confronted by "the April Fools Killer" - Marlin, who has killed the officer, and the one stationed at their house. Marlin claims that they were only one affected by Melvin's death, their life falling to shambles after it while everyone else easily moved on, enraging him. Marlin attacks Missy, but they manage to briefly incapacitate them and get outside, a recovered Marlin giving chase.
Marlin soon catches up with Missy but is killed in self defense when they hit them with a rock, and turns their own blade on him. Stumbling away from Marlin's body, Missy collapses into the arms of their father, who had gone out looking for them after piecing together the April Fools Killer's identity.

Reception
Black Horror Movies wrote, "You have to love April Fools. Otherwise, you might end up blowing your brains out. What feels like a film with production values above typical 'urban horror' fare turns out to be frustratingly devoid of quality. But where quality is lacking, camp appeal reigns supreme, and if camp is April Fools' ultimate goal, it's downright brilliant. This is a perfect storm of incompetence on all fronts: acting, writing, direction, editing, continuity, special effects, and basic human decency."
Film Critics United said, "The young actors struggle with their lines, the story – though liberally stolen – stole only the worthless parts of movies that weren't that good anyway, the ending was completely outlandish, the camera work was spotty at best, and it wasn't scary. In fact it was quite funny."

Robert Julius Trumpler (until 1915 Robert Trümpler, born October 2, 1886 in Zürich, Switzerland; died September 10, 1956 in Berkeley, United States) was a Swiss-American astronomer.
Career
After initial schooling, Trumpler entered the Universität Zürich but later transferred to the University of Göttingen where they earned their Ph.D. in 1910. In 1915, during World War I, they emigrated to the United States and joined the University of California. They took a position at Allegheny Observatory, and later went to Lick Observatory. In 1921, they became a naturalized citizen of the United States. They were elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1932.
 They are most noted for observing that the brightness of the more distant open clusters was lower than expected, and the stars appeared more red. This was explained by the interstellar dust scattered through the galaxy, resulting in the absorption (extinction) of light or interstellar extinction of light.
Trumpler further studied and catalogued open clusters in order to determine the size of the Milky Way galaxy. At first they thought their analysis placed an upper limit on the Milky Way's diameter of about 10,000 parsecs with the Sun located somewhat near the center although they later revised this. While cataloguing open clusters, they also devised a system for their classification according to the number of stars observed within them, how concentrated these stars are in the center of the cluster and the range of their apparent brightness. This system, known as the Trumpler classification, is still in use today.
Honors
The Robert J. Trumpler Award, awarded by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for an outstanding PhD Thesis in astronomy, is named in their honor.
The following celestial features are named after him:
The crater Trumpler on the Moon.
Trumpler Crater on Mars.
Trumpler classification, the classification scheme for open clusters.
Trumpler catalogue, the catalogue of open clusters that they compiled.
Notable objects

The 2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship was the 123rd installment of the annual Ulster Senior Football Championship held under the auspices of the Ulster GAA. It was won by Donegal who defeated Derry in the final. It was their first Ulster title since 1992. The winning Donegal team received the Anglo-Celt Cup, and automatically advanced to the quarter-final stage of the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.
Donegal's semi-final defeat of Tyrone and Derry's semi-final defeat of Armagh brought about the end of a long period of dominance by these two counties. Armagh and Tyrone had shared the previous eleven Ulster senior titles between them in a run stretching back to 1999. It also brought a first major trophy for Jim McGuinness's famed Donegal team, who would go on to consign the decade-long dominance of those two counties to history.

Shwayne Booth Jr., known as S.mouse (later than S.mouse!), is a fictional character from the Australian mockumentary television series Angry Boys. They were frequently spotted at 8 Park Lane. The character is an African American rapper who lives in Calabasas, California, and is portrayed by Chris Lilley, who wears a curly wig and blackface. They have appeared in Angry Boys since the second episode, when they are introduced as the rapper who just released the biggest selling hip-hop single of all time, "Slap My Elbow". Later in the show, S.mouse is put under house arrest at their parents' home for two months, after defecating on a police car in the music video for their single "Poo on You". They also get dropped from their record label after another one of their videos, "Grandmother Fucker", receives many complaints.
S.mouse has received a mixed response from critics. Paul Kalina of The Sydney Morning Herald has written that "S.mouse is arguably the new show's weakest incarnation", while Rowen Dean of ABC Online describes them as "Eminem meets Ali G meets Snoop Dogg".
Storylines
S.mouse is introduced as the rapper who just released the biggest selling hip-hop single of all time, "Slap My Elbow". S.mouse tries to reinvent himself. They defy their record label contract and releases their self-penned YouTube released "Poo on You", in which the music video sees S.mouse defecating on a police car. They later makes an online apology to their fans and is put under house arrest at their parents' home for two months. S.mouse receives a demo from their manager Larry and they express great dislike of the track. They then decides to release a new single called "Grandmother Fucker". The music video for the song features an appearance by S.mouse's grandmother, which angers their father Shwayne Senior (Richard Lawson). S.mouse later receives a phone call from their manager that they have been dropped from their record label due to the video receiving so many complaints.
S.mouse decides to create their own music for their new album, The Real Me. The album will be released independently and is executively produced by their best friend Danthony (Clyde Boraine). S.mouse had originally planned to feature Barbadian singer Rihanna on their new song, "Big Black Balls", however it features their girlfriend Lasquisha (Kristin Dione Metoyer) instead. S.mouse completes their community service by performing their new songs to an unimpressed audience of children at an elementary school. Lasquisha tells them that they don't know them and he'll already be forgotten once their house arrest is over. S.mouse goes to the mall, even though they are not allowed to leave the house, to prove that they are still famous. However, no one cares that they are there and when Lasquisha asks people if they know him, they say no. When they arrive home, a parole officer tightens the security on S.mouse's ankle monitor. If they walk out the gate, they will be electrocuted. S.mouse spends the afternoon writing a new song called "Whack My Knee" and Lasquisha comes up with a dance craze for the song. During a photo shoot for their new album, The Real Me, a paparazzi helicopter secretly takes photos of S.mouse shirtless and puts them online, claiming that they have become fat. S.mouse later finds out that Lasquisha has dumped him, as they do not want to be associated with someone believed to be fat. S.mouse launches their new album at a club in Los Angeles to a crowd who are less than pleased. They write a new song called "Squashed Nigga", based on Daniel's story about an Aborigine child named Wally who was crushed by a truck. S.mouse decides to sing the song instead of rapping the lyrics. They subsequently re-invents themselves under the performing name of: Shwayne Jr.
Development
S.mouse is portrayed by comedian Chris Lilley. In an interview with Ralph magazine, Lilley revealed it was difficult and tricky to play S.mouse due to the hip-hop music, working with American actors and pretending to be a black person in an American family. Discussing their character in an interview with The Vine, Lilley said,
"The world of S.mouse is not my world – I don't know people like that. I know about the world of hip-hop because I'm interested in that kind of music but I wanted to show that world in a different way, not just present all the usual clichés. I wanted it to be a genuine story about a genuine guy. But being in that make-up, speaking that way and interacting with the black actors who played my family... it was very far-removed from anything I'm used to."
Reception
The character received mixed reviews from critics. After S.mouse's first appearance on Angry Boys, Larissa Dubecki of The Age expressed the opinion that they contained some of Jonah Takalua's DNA, but also "found them plain annoying although their impending house arrest might pique interest." Paul Kalina of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that "S.mouse is arguably the new show's weakest incarnation, being someone we've already seen in sketch shows and whose cultural baggage doesn't register as sharply as Lilley's local characters do." Rowen Dean of ABC Online described the character as "Eminem meets Ali G meets Snoop Dog". Eleanor Morgan of The Guardian compared S.mouse to the Jamaican woman in David Walliams' series Come Fly with Me, stating they "isn't offensive in the way David Walliams... makes their character's ethnicity the punchline, whereas Lilley has created a ridiculous character who just happens to be black." Ruth Margolis of TV.com wrote, "... it's not clear whether their accent is intentionally awful or whether they just hasn't mastered it in time for filming. Whatever the case, S.mouse doesn't quite work. He's not layered like Lilley's other creations".
In 2011, the Sydney Morning Herald asked several hip-hop stars if the character was offensive. Open Mike Eagle responded, "Hell yeah it's offensive. Blackface is not the kind of thing that just becomes acceptable one day. I don't give a damn how 'meta' this cat thinks they are, it doesn't give them a pass to exploit the history of race relations for a cheap laugh."
Commercial performances
Three of S.mouse's songs, "Animal Zoo", "Slap My Elbow" and "Squashed Nigga", have been released as singles, available for digital download on the Australian iTunes Store. "Slap My Elbow" entered the ARIA Singles Chart and the ARIA Urban Singles Chart; it peaked at numbers thirty-seven and thirteen, respectively. In the United Kingdom, "Slap My Elbow" debuted at number 139 on the UK Singles Chart on August 13, 2011, and "Squashed Nigga" debuted at number 151 on August 20, 2011.

The goldenface (Pachycare flavogriseum) is a species of passerine bird endemic to New Guinea. It is the only species (monotypic) within the genus Pachycare.
Taxonomy and systematics
The placement of this species and genus within the passerines is uncertain. It has been suggested that it belongs with the whistlers, in the family Pachycephalidae, based on its bright yellow plumage and voice, and the species is sometimes known as the dwarf whistler. Others have suggested placing it with the Australasian robins in the family Petroicidae, but the nest architecture is unlike that of the robin family; in fact, its nests more closely resemble those of the thornbills in the family Acanthizidae, another family to which it has sometimes been aligned. This relationship was supported by a 2009 molecular study, which placed the species in that family. There are four subspecies: Pachycare flavogriseum flavogriseum, P. f. subaurantium, P. f. subpallidum and P. f. lecroyae.
Range and distribution
The species is endemic to the island of New Guinea, where it occurs in both Papua and Papua New Guinea. The preferred habitat of the goldenface is hill and montane forest, between 400 and 1800 m; it is usually commoner in dense forest between 1600 and 1800 m.
Description
The goldenface is a small whistler, around 13 cm in length and weighing 14–19 g. The plumage of the species is striking; the nominate subspecies (Pachycare flavogriseum flavogriseum) has a slate-grey back, tail, wing, cap and back of the neck and bright yellow face, throat, breast and belly. From the crown to the shoulder, the face is bordered with a black line and the tertial feathers of the wing are tipped with black and white. The eye and bill are black and the legs are pink. There is a small amount of sexual dimorphism, with the female differing from the male in having a dusky patch on the face. Immature birds of all sexes resemble the female. The three other subspecies resemble the nominate subspecies with minor differences. The subspecies P. f. subaurantium has darker upperparts and a slight orange tint, and P. f. subpallidum has much paler upperparts and the most yellow undersides. The identification of goldenface study skins held in museum collections is complicated by the tendency of the plumage colours used to identify the subspecies fading after death.
Behaviour
Insects and spiders form the majority of the diet of this species. These prey items are gleaned from the outer foliage of trees, usually in the midstory, sometimes entering the upper stories of the forest. Goldenfaces will sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks when foraging.
Little is known about the breeding biology of the goldenface. It may be slightly seasonal; birds in breeding condition have been found in August and October, and eggs and nestlings have been found from June to November. The nest, which is built by both parents, is globular in shape and has a downward pointing side entrance.

Raimund Weisbach (16 September 1886 – 16 June 1970) was an officer of the Kaiserliche Marine, and a U-boat commander during the First World War. They were the torpedo officer on the German U-boat, the , who saw to the preparation and firing of the torpedo that sank the on 7 May 1915. They went on to become a successful commander, sinking 36 ships before being captured when their submarine was sunk by the Royal Navy.
Lusitania
Born in Breslau on 16 September 1886, Weisbach joined the Kaiserliche Marine. They were the watch officer aboard U-20 under Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger, when the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk on 7 May 1915. Weisbach was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.
Weisbach provided a concise account of their recollection of the sinking of the Lusitania which was published in The Irish Times in 1970 after their death. After the torpedo was fired, they were called to the periscope. They said the explosion which they saw was far more severe than could normally have been expected. They surmised then and still believed in 1966 (when being interviewed) that the liner must have been carrying a significant cargo of high explosives.
Sir Roger Casement
Not long after the sinking of Lusitania, Weisbach received their first independent command, the , on 16 March 1916. On 20 April 1916, on the island of Heligoland, Roger Casement embarked as a passenger aboard U-19. Their destination was Ireland. They delivered Casement to Tralee Bay a few days later. Weisbach was an official guest of the Government of Ireland at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 1966. Weisbach came from their home in Hamburg to attend.
Later career
Weisbach commanded U-19 until 10 August 1916. Their next command was , which they took over on 22 August 1916. During their time in command Weisbach's submarines sunk 36 ships for a total of , and damaged another two for a total of . U-81 was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine on 1 May 1917. 24 members of the U-boat crew were killed, with Weisbach, their watch officer Otto Walter and five other Germans surviving to be rescued by the British. Weisbach and the surviving crew spent the rest of the war as prisoners in Britain.
Weisbach returned to Germany after the end of the war. They visited Cork and Dublin in 1966 for the Easter rising celebrations, and died in Hamburg on 16 June 1970.

Maui Time Weekly (also known as Maui Time Magazine, Maui Time, and the Maui Times) is a free alternative newspaper published weekly in the county of Maui, state of Hawaii. The newspaper is owned mostly by its publisher, Tommy Russo.
Maui Time Weekly was launched in 1997. It serves all of Maui, and is distributed every Thursday. The paper has remained independently owned and operated throughout its existence.
History
Begun as a free bi-weekly newsprint magazine, Maui Time offered a combination of music, sports, arts and community features, as well as Maui's first true entertainment calendar. The paper was founded by Tommy Russo and Mark D'Antonio.
Russo noted the lack of a strong community-based publication while traveling on Maui. At the time they were completing degree studies at Chico State University building a strong sales background in print media during their employment with a local paper in Chico, California. They teamed up with classmate D'Antonio after D'Antonio's music group, Sunset Red concluded two tours of Lahaina in 1996. Within a year, the two Chico, California transplants moved to Maui to start an independent community publication. Maui Time established a free and independent voice to represent the wide variety of views, opinions, lifestyles, and rich host culture that Maui offers.
Publisher Tommy Russo grew Maui Time into a weekly publication with Maui news, community features, arts and entertainment as its focus. Maui Time gained admission into the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies in 2004.
Regular features
The paper runs a number of regular columns, most with an opinionated slant, that examine aspects of local government and politics. Maui Time also offers coverage of the local music scene, and carries Chuck Shepherd's syndicated column News of the Weird.
LC Watch keeps tabs on the Maui County Department of Liquor Control, while Rob Report, written by one-time Maui Mayoral candidate Rob Parsons, focuses on environmental issues. Coconut Wireless offers a roundup of the week's events with a satirical, sardonic tone.

Harold Paul Keller (August 3, 1921 – March 13, 1979) was a United States Marine corporal who was wounded in action during the Bougainville campaign in World War II. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, they were a member of the patrol that captured the top of Mount Suribachi and raised the first U.S. flag on Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945.  They are one of the six Marines who raised the larger replacement flag on the mountaintop the same day as shown in the iconic photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.
The first flag flown over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of the mountain, so it was replaced by the second one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on Mount Suribachi, there is no photograph of Marines raising the first flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag-raising after copies of the second flag-raising photograph appeared in newspapers two days later. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.
Keller was not recognized as one of the second flag-raisers until the Marine Corps announced on October 16, 2019, after an investigation, that they were in the historic photograph taken by combat photographer Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press. The Marine Corps also stated that Keller was incorrectly identified as Private First Class Rene Gagnon in the photograph, who they determined is not in the photo. Keller is one of three Marines in the photograph who were not originally identified as flag raisers.
The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, is modeled after the photograph of six Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima.
U.S. Marine Corps
Harold Keller was born on August 3, 1921, in Brooklyn, Iowa. Keller graduated from Brooklyn High School. On January 2, 1942, they enlisted in the Marine Corps and attended training at Camp Elliott in San Diego and later training in Honolulu, Hawaii. Keller was assigned to the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson and was present for the Battle of Midway and took part in the fighting at Guadalcanal. In 1943, Keller was shot through their right shoulder at Bougainville.
In February 1944, the Marine Raiders were disbanded. Keller met and subsequently married their wife, Ruby O'Halloran, while they were home on leave. Keller was next assigned to Easy (E) Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division which was activated at Camp Pendleton in 1944. In September, the division was sent to Camp Tarawa near Hilo, Hawaii, for further training to prepare for the invasion of Iwo Jima. In January 1945, the division left Hawaii and sailed for Iwo Jima. Keller participated in the battle of Iwo Jima, which began on February 19 and ended on March 26. On February 23, they were part of the 40-man patrol that ascended Mount Suribachi and raised the Second Battalion's flag on top. Later that day, they were one of the six Marines that raised a second and larger flag on top.
First flag raising
At 8:00 am on February 23, 1945, Lt. Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, commander, ordered a platoon-size patrol to climb up Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, then assembled the remainder of their Third Platoon and other members of the battalion which included two Navy corpsmen and stretcher bearers. First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, E Company's executive officer, who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise the battalion's American flag if possible to signal that the mountaintop was secure. The patrol left at about 8:30. Along the way up which was difficult climbing at times, there was a small number of shots from Japanese snipers. When Lt. Schrier and their men reached the rim of the volcano, there was a skirmish which they soon overcame. After a Japanese iron water pipe was found to use as a flagpole, the battalion's American flag was tied to it by Lt. Schrier, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg.
Once the flag was tied on, the flagstaff was raised about 10:30 by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, Sgt. Hansen, and Cpl. Lindberg. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the south end of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beach. Due to the terrific winds and soft ground on the mountaintop, Private Phil Ward and Navy corpsman John Bradley pitched in afterwards to help keep the flagstaff vertical. Staff Sergeant Lou Lowery, a Marine photographer for "Leatherneck Magazine" and the only photographer who accompanied the patrol, took several photos of the first flag before and after it was raised. The last photo they took on the mountaintop was before a Japanese grenade caused them to fall several feet down the side of the crater and break them camera (his film was not damaged). The Marine Corps did not allow any of their photos to be published until 1947, in Leatherneck Magazine. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen on March 1. Cpl. Lindberg was wounded on March 13.
Second flag raising
Two hours after the first flag was raised on Mount Suribachi, Marine Corps leaders decided that in order for the American flag to be better seen on the other side of Mount Suribachi by the thousands of Marines fighting there to capture the island, another larger flag should be flown on Mount Suribachi (Lt. Col. Johnson also wanted to secure the flag for their battalion). Under Lt. Col. Johnson's orders, Captain Severance ordered Sergeant Michael Strank a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, to take three of their Marines to the top of Mount Suribachi and raise the second flag. Sgt. Strank chose Corporal Harlon Block, Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley. Private First Class Rene Gagnon, a Second Battalion runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant.
When Sgt. Strank with their three Marines got to the top with communication wire (or supplies), Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley found a Japanese steel pipe to attach the flag on. After they took the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block, the replacement flag was attached to the pipe which was near the other flag. As the four Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block called out to two nearby Marines from Lt. Schrier's patrol, Private First Class Harold Schultz and Private First Class Keller, to help them raise the flagstaff. Lt. Schrier then ordered the six Marines to raise the second flag while Pfc. Gagnon and three Marines lowered the first flagstaff. In order to keep the flagstaff in a vertical position, Sgt. Strank and their three Marines held it while rocks were added by Pfc. Keller, Pfc. Schultz, and others around the base of the flagstaff. The flagstaff then was stabilized with three guy-ropes.
Associated Press combat photographer Joe Rosenthal had climbed up the mountain with two Marine photographers (Marine Sergeant Bill Genaust and Private Robert Campbell) in time to photograph the first flag while it was still up. This also enabled them to take the famous black-and-white photograph of the second-flag raising; Rosenthal's second flag raising photograph started appearing in newspapers on Sunday, February 25, 1945. Other combat photographers, including Pfc. George Burns, an army photographer (from Yank Magazine) and a Coast Guard photographer, also climbed up Mount Suribachi after the first flag raising to take pictures including some of each flag flying. Lt. Colonel Johnson was killed on Iwo Jima on March 2 and Sgt. Bill Genaust, who filmed the second flag-raising in color, was killed in a cave on March 4. Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1 and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.
Post-war life
Harold Keller survived the war and returned to their wife Ruby in Iowa. They raised two boys and one girl.
Though Keller virtually never spoke of the war, Marine researchers found evidence that they acknowledged the fact that they were one of the second flag raisers at least twice: first, in a letter to Ruby written from Iwo Jima in February or March 1945; and decades later, circa 1977, in a newsletter of their employer (a company called Surge) in which their participation is stated unambiguously. Additionally, Keller's private scrapbook contained a strongly-worded letter from Major General Philip H. Torrey, dated 17 September 1945, which suggests that Keller might have attempted to correct the record but was silenced.
Keller worked a series of jobs in their hometown and was also a member of the volunteer fire department in Brooklyn for 30 years, eventually becoming the fire chief. They died of a heart attack on March 13, 1979. They were buried in the Brooklyn Memorial Cemetery.
Marine Corps War Memorial
The Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. The monument was sculptured by Felix de Weldon from the photograph of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi. Since October 23, 2016, Harold Keller is depicted as the second Marine figure from the base of the flagstaff on the memorial.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront during the dedication ceremony with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Ira Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers (Hayes, Schultz, and Keller) depicted on the monument, was also seated upfront with John Bradley (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until June 23, 2016), Rene Gagnon (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until October 16, 2019), Mrs Martha Strank, Mrs. Ada Belle Block, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day; Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation; General Shepherd, who presented the memorial to the American people; Felix de Weldon; and Richard Nixon, who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:
In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775
Second flag-raising corrections
On March 20, 1945, President Roosevelt ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington and arrived on April 7. They were questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers in the photograph. They identified the six flag raisers as Sgt. Strank, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Sgt. Henry Hansen, and himself. They also said Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed on Iwo Jima. After Pfc. Gagnon was questioned, Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were ordered to Washington. Bradley, who was recovering from their wounds at Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California, was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Maryland, where they were shown Rosenthal's flag-raising photograph and was told they were in it. Both Bradley (on crutches) and Hayes arrived in Washington on April 19. They reported to the same officer and were questioned separately. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with all of the identities of the flag-raisers named by Pfc. Gagnon in the photograph including their own. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the identities named by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen, saying that Cpl. Block was at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities had already been made public and would not be changed and to not mention anything in public (that officer would later deny that Pfc. Hayes told them of the mis-identification).
A Marine Corps investigation of the identities of the six second flag-raisers began in December 1946 and concluded in January 1947, confirming Pfc. Hayes' claim that Cpl. Block, not Sgt. Hansen, was in the photograph, and that no one party was responsible for the mis-identification. The identities of the other five second flag-raisers were confirmed.
In June 2016, the Marine Corps review board announced that John Bradley had incorrectly been identified in the photograph. The person initially ascribed to Bradley (fourth from left) was that of Sousley, while the person in Sousley's former position (second from left) was Harold Schultz. The identities of the other five flag-raisers were confirmed. Schultz had never publicly mentioned that they were a flag-raiser or was in the photograph.
A third Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers concluded in October 2019, that Keller was in the Rosenthal's photograph in place of Rene Gagnon (fifth from left). Gagnon who carried the larger second flag up Mount Suribachi, helped lower the first flagstaff and removed the first flag at the time the second flag was raised. Photos and video footage showed that the person (Keller) who had been thought to have been Gagnon was wearing a wedding ring; at the time, Keller was married and Gagnon was not. The person (Keller) also did not have a facial mole; Gagnon did. The Marine Corps photo taken by Private Robert Campbell which showed both flags on top of Mount Suribachi verified that Keller was actually the person thought to have been Gagnon. The identities of the other five flag raisers including Schultz were confirmed. Like Schultz, Keller never publicly mentioned that they were a flag-raiser or that they were in the photograph.

Dan Olof Olofsson (born 24 September 1950 in Ekenäs, Finland) is a Swedish entrepreneur, business leader and philanthropist.
Biography
Dan Olofsson was born as the second oldest of five siblings in Ekenäs, Finland, where their father was employed as pastor of Karis from 1948 to 1951. Their parents and family are rooted in Kaxås, in Jämtland in northern Sweden. When Olofsson was one year old their family moved to Malmö in southern Sweden, where they were brought up and still lives.
Olofsson attended upper secondary technical school at Pauliskolan in Malmö and graduated as Master of Science in Engineering at Lunds Tekniska Högskola in 1974. After their education, Olofsson began a career in the technology consulting industry. They started at VBB (what is now Sweco) where they during 1979 became group manager for a new venture in energy technology. Later, Dan Olofsson proceeded to become region manager for Scandiaconsult's southern division.
The Danir Group
The family business Danir was founded in 1986. Dan Olofsson has gradually, together with their son Johan Glennmo and with a long-term focus, built this group of companies which in 2022 is expected to have a turnover of almost SEK 13 billion. The Group has grown primarily through new hires and the start-up of new companies, and now has about 11,000 employees in twenty countries.
The main business is consulting companies that focus on supporting customers in their digitalization. This is run within the framework of Sigma, Nexer, A Society, and PION Group. The Danir Group also has financial investments.
Thanda and Star for Life
In 2002, Dan Olofsson decided to build the safari facility Thanda Safari with more than 14,000 hectares of land in South Africa. The safari facility is a conservation project to protect endangered species and has also for several years received the World Travel Award as “The World's Leading Luxury Lodge”. In 2016, the marine reserve Thanda Island opened just off the coast of Tanzania and was awarded “The World's Leading Exclusive Private Island” by World Travel Awards.
Olofsson's philanthropic commitment is best seen through the organization Star for Life, which they and their wife Christin launched in 2005. So far, 500,000 young people have participated in a four-year preventive programme against HIV/AIDS, promoting a healthy way of life, in South Africa, Namibia, and Sri Lanka. Since 2013, Star for Life is also established in Sweden under the name ‘Motivationslyftet', aiming to strengthen young people's self-esteem and belief in the future. In 2021, Star for Life was started in Jerusalem with a focus on improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of East Jerusalem through investments in education and jobs.
Uppstart Malmö and Project Kaxås
In 2011, Olofsson initiated the founding of "Uppstart Malmö", a trust aimed at creating more job opportunities in the under-privileged areas of their hometown Malmö. The concept behind the trust is to offer advice, support and financial help to local entrepreneurs who create more jobs, and to help young people and immigrants enter the labor market. Altogether 3,500 people have found work through this initiative.
To break the depopulation in sparsely populated areas of Norrland's interior and ensure the survival of Kaxås village school, Project Kaxås was started in 2019. The idea was to invest in young families who want to live a safe life close to nature and still have access to a functioning labour market including teleworking. By moving in young families from different places in Sweden, the number of inhabitants in Kaxås increases from 100 to about 260, of which the number of children increases by over 60. The eco-village Ladriket is an important part of Project Kaxås.
Miscellaneous
In the autumn of 2012, Olofsson's autobiography Mina tre liv (“My three lives”) was published by the publishing house Ekerlids Förlag. The book has received particular attention for its claim that the Swedish government should have committed a financial miscarriage of justice at financier Maths O Sundqvist.
In recent years, Olofsson has actively participated in the public debate on issues relating to business conditions and entrepreneurship, about the defense of freedom of choice in welfare, and about the need for a policy that combines a positive climate for companies with social responsibility.
Dan Olofsson is the uncle of the artist Jonathan Johansson and the father of Andreas Olofsson, who played guitar in The Animal Five.

The Beasts of Suburban are an extended play (EP) by Australian alternative rock band, TISM. It was produced by Tony Cohen and released in July 1992 via Shock Records. Its title is a pun on the name of fellow Australian band, Beasts of Bourbon (also produced by Cohen). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993, the album was nominated for Best Independent Release while Cohen was nominated for Producer of the Year for their work on the Cruel Sea's album This Is Not the Way Home and TISM's track, "Get Thee to a Nunnery".
Reception
Tyle Jenke of Beat reviewed The Beasts of Suburban in their overview of TISM's career in June 2022, "returned to their pub-rock roots" with the seven-track EP. They noticed that they were "far more comfortable with the music they were making."
Australian feminist groups criticised TISM's sexism in their use of Sophie Lee in "Get Thee to a Nunnery". The song allegedly protests the use of sex to sell a product via Lee's appointment as the host of the TV series Sex in 1992, contrasted with them presenting the Nine Network's cartoon show, Looney Tunes in 1990. Karen Fletcher of Green Left Weekly described the latter appointment, "middle-aged men... rush home from work in time to watch Sophie throw to Bugs Bunny cartoons." Lee described TISM's song as "a boring song by a boring bunch of bourgeois boys."
In 2015 ToneDeafs Corey Tonkin listed "Morningtown Ride" as one of the 10 Greatest Songs About Melbourne.

Qaumi Jang (, 'People's War') was an Urdu language weekly newspaper published by the Communist Party of India from Bombay during World War II.<ref>'"Dawn. NON-FICTION: FOR THE LOVE OF THE HAMMER AND SICKLE</ref> It was founded in 1942 as the Urdu edition of People's War. Qaumi Jang was the central party organ in Urdu.
When Qaumi Jang was launched, a number of Muslim socialist writers moved to Bombay to work at the paper. Sajjad Zaheer, who had recently been released from jail, shifted to Bombay to become the editor of Qaumi Jang. Sibte Hassan was one of the Muslim intellectuals who came to Bombay to work as a Qaumi Jang staffer, serving as the assistant editor of the paper. Ashraf Ali Khan was a member of the Qaumi Jang staff. Saadat Hasan Manto was one of the writers for Qaumi Jang. Some of Manto's most notable short stories were published in Qaumi Jang, such as Kaali Shalwar, Dhuan and Bu.
Another Urdu poet, Kaifi Azmi arrived in Bombay in 1943 to begin writing for Qaumi Jang.
On 26 May 1945, the Government of the United Provinces issued a ban the sale and distribution of People's War, Qaumi Jang and Lok Yudh under the Defence of India Rules, citing that the newspapers had published to many biased reports.
After the end of World War II, Qaumi Jang was replaced by Naya Zamana'' ('New Age') as the new Urdu language central party organ.

Jungfrauen ("Jung's women") was a satirical and scornful descriptive given by those on the outside of the supportive group of trainee women analysts (mainly based in Zurich) who were among the first disciples of Carl G. Jung. Some of these women were early popularizers of Jung's ideas. Even more unflattering were the terms maenads or valkyries.
Members
After their wife, Emma, chief among the circle of women was Toni Wolff, followed by Jolande Jacobi, Marie-Louise von Franz, Barbara Hannah, Esther Harding, and their secretary, Aniela Jaffé. Other, more peripheral, figures were Kristine Mann and Hilde Kirsch.
Meaning
In this context, the term is a pun, the German word jungfrauen means 'maiden' or 'unmarried woman', as the adjective jung means 'young' and the plural noun frauen means 'women'.
Public image
Mary Bancroft (who was not a member of the group) described the Jungfrauen as "vestal virgins" hovering around Jung, their sacred flame. Their secretary Aniela Jaffé, who was regarded as a member, said at an Eranos conference that they would throw off the stigma of the name Jungfrau and would hover around Jung like “bees around a honey-pot.”
It has been suggested that Jung's foreign travels in Africa were partly motivated by their desire to escape from the Jungfrauen.
Later criticism
One former Jungian woman has criticized Jung's early women acolytes. Naomi R. Goldenberg, said that “Jungian psychology is a patriarchal religion within which I once lived and worked...[for] years in a Jungian universe”.

Cornelis Bernardus van Niel (also known as Kees van Niel) (November 4, 1897 – March 10, 1985) was a Dutch-American microbiologist. They introduced the study of general microbiology to the United States and made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis.
Early life
In 1923, Cornelis van Niel graduated in chemical engineering at Delft University and became an assistant to Albert Kluyver, who had initiated the field of comparative biochemistry. In 1925 they married Christina van Hemert in Bloemendaal, North Holland, Netherlands. In 1928 they wrote their PhD dissertation ('The Propionic Acid Bacteria') after which they left for the United States to continue their work at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University.
Work and discoveries
Photosynthesis (1931)
By studying purple sulphur bacteria and green sulphur bacteria they were the first scientist to demonstrate, in 1931, that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen from an oxidizable compound reduces carbon dioxide to cellular materials. Expressed as:
2 H2A + CO2 → 2A + CH2O + H2O
where A is the electron acceptor. Their discovery predicted that H2O is the hydrogen donor in green plant photosynthesis and is oxidized to O2. The chemical summation of photosynthesis was a milestone in the understanding of the chemistry of photosynthesis. This was later experimentally verified by Robert Hill.
In a nutshell, van Niel proved that plants give off oxygen as a result of splitting water molecules during photosynthesis, not carbon dioxide molecules as thought before.
Bacterial taxonomy
Van Niel also played a key role in the development of bacterial taxonomy. In 1962, van Niel in collaboration with Roger Y. Stanier defined prokaryotes as cells in which the nuclear material is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane, a definition that is still used to date.
Teaching
Shortly after their arrival at Hopkins Marine Station, van Niel developed a course in general microbiology which was to become widely influential.

Herndon High School is a former high school located in Herndon, Kansas, U.S., which served students in grades 9-12. Herndon High School was the only high school within the city limits of Herndon, Kansas. The school colors were blue and yellow and the school mascot was a Beaver. The average annual enrollment was approximately 200 students from several communities. Herndon High School was established in either 1912 or 1915. A new building was erected in the spring of 1917 because of the growing population of the city. In 1923, Herndon High School became Herndon Rural High School District #2. The school was rebuilt in 1949 and classes were held at St. Mary's High School. Classes resumed at the rebuilt high school in 1950. This remained until the fall of 2003 when the decision was made to consolidate with Atwood USD #318. The new district that was formed is now Unified School District #105 and Rawlins County Junior-Senior High School.
Extracurricular activities
Athletics
The extracurricular activities offered at Herndon High School were small and limited due to the school's small size. The Beavers competed as a 1A school, the smallest classification in Kansas according to the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Throughout its history, Herndon won a few state championships in various sports. Due to the consolidation of Herndon High School, Rawlins County Junior-Senior High School history is seen as a continuation of Herndon High in terms of athletics.

Mixed martial arts career
When they neared the end of their playing career, Wells realized they needed some
steady work. They began working with troubled youths as a mentor.
It's a job they continue now, and they said the work helps
them keep their fighting career in perspective.
One of the first sports Wells tried after football was hockey.
(He was, after all, living in Canada.)
But then they joined a rugby team, which led to their introduction to MMA.
After their matches, the team would find a television to watch UFC events. Wells knew the sport existed, but it wasn't their first choice for their post-football athletic endeavor.
Not wanting to later regret failing to try, Wells located a local gym and got themselves into every class they could find. The instructors liked their natural ability, so they encouraged them to come to the team tryout after just weeks.
Within two months of their first class, Wells was in their first fight, at an Evolution Fighting Championships show in September 2009.
"It lasted all of 20 seconds," they said. "The guy landed a kick to my quad, and I could feel the cramping coming, so I knew I couldn't go into another round. I said, 'I just need to end this as fast as I can,' and it was a knockout."
Within six months, Wells would be 3-0 with a string of quick victories. Since, they have prepared for their next chance – while continuing to help the 32 boys under their care work to improve their own lives. They can't make fighting their full-time profession, but they said that might actually help their career.
Wells is now 5-1-0 in their MMA career.

Prince of the Peace () was a life title in the Peerage of Spain, granted in 1795 by Charles IV to Manuel Godoy, their favourite and Secretary of State. The title is a reference to the Peace of Basel which Godoy successfully managed, putting an end to the War of the Pyrenees in July 1795.
History
Despite being originally created by Charles IV as hereditary, their son Ferdinand VII quickly revoked all of Godoy's titles as soon as they became king in 1808. The general's unpopularity amongst the population as well as Spanish customs not allowing any prince titles (a dignity exclusively reserved for the heir to the throne) were some of the reasons that fuelled this. Years later, Isabella II rehabilitated all of their titles by Royal Decree of 31 May 1847, with the exception of Prince of the Peace, considering it alien to Spanish peerage tradition.
As a general rule, the law in Spanish nobility states that the title of "prince" is reserved for the Prince of Asturias, heir to the throne of Spain. Throughout history, there have only been two exceptions, namely Prince of the Peace and Prince of Vergara.
Other exceptions are found in the princely titles granted by the monarchs of Spain in their capacity as sovereigns of other European territories: Netherlands, Milan, Naples, Sicily, etc. Some of these titles were rehabilitated in Spain with the denomination of dukedoms or marquessates.

The Stabat Mater is a musical setting of the Stabat Mater sequence, composed by Luigi Boccherini in 1781 (G.532a) and revised in 1800 (G.532b, Op.61).
Boccherini (1743–1805) was a musician best known for chamber music (string quintets). Their vocal work is played less often. They worked as a cantatrice and wrote numerous religious works (including one mass, two motets and two oratorios).
Their Stabat Mater was a command passed in 1781, when was patroned by the King of Spain's younger brother Luis of Spain, Count of Chinchón. It was conceived for a liturgical service at Palacio de la Mosquera, Arenas de San Pedro, where they were living. The text is a text dating from the 13th century and attributed to Jacopone da Todi which meditates on the suffering of Mary during the crucifixion. The first version consisted of one soprano voice accompanied by a string quintet (two violins, one viola, two cellos). It consists of 11 parts and lasts around three-quarters of an hour. The musician rewrote it around twenty years later (in 1801) when they added an overture for two voices: a contralto and a tenor. The definitive work is known as opus 61 of the musician.

The Kano State Hisbah Corps is a religious police force in Kano state, Nigeria. responsible for the enforcement of Shari'a to only Muslims in Kano state and other parts of the northern Nigeria. Sheikh Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa is the founder and former chief commander of Hisba. As of 2022, its commander is Haruna Ibn-Sina.
History
The Kano State Hisbah Corps was established by the state government in 2003 with the institutionalization of formerly local and privately maintained hisbah security units. Hisbah, which is an Arabic word meaning "accountability", is an Islamic religious concept that calls for "enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong on every Muslim." The Hisbah Corps, which operates under the jurisdiction of a Hisbah Board composed of government officials, secular police officers, and religious leaders, is highly decentralized with local units supervised by committees composed of officials and citizens in the communities in which they operate.
The relationship between the Hisbah Corps and civil police has been sometimes acrimonious. The Nigeria Police Force (NPF), to whom the Hisbah must report crimes, frequently refuse to cooperate in enforcement of religious law. On multiple occasions, NPF officers have arrested Hisbah members for trespassing when the latter have attempted to enter private property to enforce Sharia. And, in 2006, two senior Hisbah officers were detained by federal police and questioned on suspicion they were seeking foreign funding to train militants.
there were approximately 9,000 male and female officers of the Kano State Hisbah Corps.
The Kano State Hisbah court has extended its rule to some Northern States with high population of Muslims in Nigeria. Some regions in States like Kaduna and Kwara now have rules from the court that governs them. The court set up rules that bans women and girls from using Mobile phones and sunglasses amongst other things listed.
Authority and jurisdiction
The Hisbah Corps does not have authority to execute arrests and officers are armed only with non-lethal weapons for self-defense, such as batons. Hisbah officers who observe violations of Sharia are expected to alert the Nigeria Police Force. Other duties of the Hisbah Corps include arbitrating the voluntary reconciliation of disputes, verbally chastising violators of Sharia, and maintaining order at religious celebrations. Hisbah are also trained to assist with disaster response operations.
An example of a Kano State Hisbah Board activity is the destruction of 1,975,000 bottles of beer worth over N200 million (almost $500,000 USD) in 2020 that had been confiscated within metropolitan Kano.
According to the BBC, hisbah in Nigeria is supposed to apply only to Muslims, "but in reality, non-Muslims come under pressure to adhere to the Hisbah's rulings". At least some trucks "carrying alcoholic beverages belonging to non-Muslims were destroyed and bars were raided by the hisbah after it accused owners of 'corrupt acts'."
An example of the Hisbah's verbally chastising violators of Sharia is Ibn-Sina's criticism of Zahrah Bayero, the fiancée of President Muhammadu Buhari's son, Yusuf, who exposed their shoulders in photos from their bridal shower, allegedly failing "to set a good example to other Muslims". Ibn-Sina has also declared activities forbidden where their orders were "largely ignored by radio stations and shopping malls and they faced no sanctions". Such as barring the use of "the term Black Friday to advertise sales, saying that Friday was a holy day in Islam".
Criticism
Comparison with other vigilante groups
Some observers have compared hisbah activities in Nigeria to vigilante groups that have operated in other parts of the country, partly based on local tradition and partly as a response to failings of the police. However, as of 2004, Human Rights Watch was not aware of killings by hisba members, in contrast to other vigilante groups like the Bakassi Boys in the southeast and the Oodua People's Congress in the southwest of the country, who have committed numerous extrajudicial killings and other abuses. It is also compared to the newly formed Operation Amotekun in the South West of the country.
Human rights violations
In 2022, Observations and interviews with people arrested by the Hisbah showcased potential human rights violations by the agency with reports of forced HIV and pregnancy tests, brutal beatings of inmates, and prolonged underage imprisonments. Several victims noted that they were non-Muslims and/or did not belief in sharia law with the state government countering that all people residing in Kano State fall under the jurisdiction of Hisbah, regardless of religion. Public outcry also arose over the alleged selective enforcement of Hisbah guidelines as critics noted that the lower and middle classes were targeted significantly more than wealthy residents.

Pfäffikon Castle is a castle in the municipality of Freienbach of the Canton of Schwyz in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
Einsiedeln Abbey was granted farms at Pfäffikon along with surrounding land along Lake Zurich by Emperor Otto I in 965. Soon thereafter the abbot built a large granary in Pfäffikon. Between 1233 and 1266 Abbot Anshelm von Schwanden replaced the old granary with stone tower which was designed as a watch tower, granary and residence. In 1299 the Prince-Abbot Johann von Schwanden added walls, ramparts and a moat to the tower during the Marchenstreit conflict between the Schwyz and the Abbey over grazing rights. On the night of Epiphany in 1314 a mob from Schwyz attacked the Abbey attempting to destroy the land and tax records. They hoped to destroy any records of the Abbey's counterclaims to the Schwyz grazing rights. However, the Abbot, perhaps anticipating the attack, had already moved themselves and the important documents to Pfäffikon Castle.
By 1359 the castle was being used as the Abbot's summer residence as well as for its original purposes. In the 15th century Abbot Burkard von Weissenburg-Krenkingen (1418-1438) expanded the castle and changed its name to Weissenburg. They built a residential wing on one side of the tower and a chapel on the other. In 1480 the election of a new Abbot for the Abbey took place at Pfäffikon. In 1528 the castle was renovated and the walls and moat were repaired. Abbot Joachim Eichhorn (1544-1569) built a new Gothic chapel and expanded the granary in the castle. In 1577 a fire destroyed much of the Abbey and the village of Einsiedeln. The monks and villagers moved to the Castle for 7 months until the Abbey and their homes were repaired. Around 1760 Eichhorn's granary expansion was demolished and replaced with another residential wing. In 1785 the Gothic chapel was renovated in the Baroque style.
Following the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic Pfäffikon Castle was heavily damaged and declared the property of the Canton of Linth. Following the collapse of the Republic and the 1803 Act of Mediation the castle was returned to the Abbey and once again became religious property. In 1820 the remainder of the curtain wall was demolished while the tower, chapel and residential wings were rebuilt. In 1839 the rotten tower roof and overhand were replaced with the current roof. In 1928 the chapel was renovated and in 1986-88 the chapel, tower and moat were repaired and renovated. Today the castle and its restaurant are available for conferences, piano concerts, meetings and events, while the residential wings are used for municipal administration.
Castle site
The main tower is a square on each side and tall. The walls are made of massive stone blocks and are thick at the base, tapering to thick on the top floor. The main entrance is located on the west side of the first floor and was reached by a wooden staircase that could be pulled up if needed. The second story was built as a large living area and included large windows with built-in seating that overlooked the lake. The third story was also probably used as living quarters. The tower was probably originally topped with a wooden structure that overhung the stone walls, before it was replaced with the current roof.
In the 15th century a two-story fortification was built near the tower and protected with a series of moats. In the 16th century, however, it was demolished and replaced with the current chapel. The moats were filled in and today only the main moat remains.
The chapel has a rectangular nave with a small polygonal choir. The portal is Gothic, while the interior was decorated in the Baroque style in 1780-85, which was partly replaced in 1893-95. The stucco is Neo-classical while the wall murals are from the late 19th century. The mahogany altars were built by Father Rudolf Blättler in 1892.

Miogryllus convolutus is a species of cricket from South America.
Description
M. convolutus exists in a number of forms. Most strikingly, there are micropterous (small-winged) and macropterous (large-winged) forms, but there is also variation in colouration.
Distribution
M. convolutus has one of the widest geographical distributions of any member of the family Gryllidae in the Americas. It is found in both South and North America, having been recorded from Mexico, Belize, Panama, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay and Argentina.
Taxonomic history
M. convolutus was first described (under the name Gryllus convolutus) in Carl Linnaeus' 1763 work Centuria Insectorum, although authorship is often ascribed to Boas Johansson, whose dissertation that work formed. The species' wide geographical distribution, the degree of variation within the species, and the characteristics of the original descriptions have led to a large number of synonyms.

The Cheshire Plate is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organised by the Cheshire Rugby Football Union. It was introduced in 1981 for teams that were eliminated from the preliminary and 1st rounds of the Cheshire Cup, with Old Instonians being the first ever winners. Initially the secondary competition in the region, in recent years the Plate has become stand-alone competition open to club sides based in either Cheshire, Merseyside or the Isle of Man that are ranked at tier 8 (South Lancs/Cheshire 2) and 9 (South Lancs/Cheshire 3) of the English league system – although some teams that compete are invited come from outside the official league structure. It is currently the fourth most important club competition organised by the Cheshire RFU behind the Cheshire Bowl (3rd), Cheshire Vase (2nd) and Cheshire Cup (1st).
The present format is as a knock-out cup with a quarter-final, semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue during the latter stages of the season (March–May). At present Cheshire Plate finals are held on the same date and same venue as the more prestigious Cheshire Cup final.

Moreau's sunbird (Cinnyris moreaui) is a species of bird in the family Nectariniidae. It is endemic to Tanzania where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being "near-threatened".
Description
The Moreau's sunbird is a small species some long. The adult male has upper parts an iridescent bronzey-green, with a green rump and dark brown tail. The green throat is separated from the red to orange breast by a narrow blue band. The belly and sides of the breast are yellow. The eye is dark brown or black and the curved beak and legs are black. The adult female has upper parts olive green, with the feathers of crown and mantle fringed with metallic greenish-grey. The tail is dark brown with paler outer feathers. The chin and throat are greyish-yellow and the breast and belly olive-yellow. The eye is dark brown and the beak and legs are black. The juvenile male is similar to the adult male but the upper parts lack the iridescence and are a dusky greyish-olive, while the underparts are dusky yellowish-olive. The juvenile female resembles the adult female but is generally duller and lacks the metallic fringes to the feathers of crown and mantle. The underparts are a dull yellowish-green.
Distribution and habitat
The Moreau's sunbird is endemic to the mountainous parts of Tanzania where its habitat is montane forest. Its altitudinal range is between in most parts of its range, but it occurs up to in the Udzungwa Mountains in the Eastern Arc Mountains.
Ecology
The Moreau's sunbird is generally found in bushes alongside roads and in the forest canopy. It is sometimes present as part of mixed flocks of small birds. It feeds on nectar and probably insects. The nest is a small domed structure with a top opening, built by the female.

In music, a similarity relation or pitch-class similarity is a comparison between sets of the same cardinality (two sets containing the same number of pitch classes), based upon shared pitch class and/or interval class content.
Allen Forte originally designated four types: Rp (maximal similarity with respect to pitch class), R0 (minimal similarity), R1 (first order maximal similarity), and R2 (second order maximal similarity). In Rp one pitch class is different, in R0 all are different, and in R1 and R2 four interval classes are the same.
Rp is defined for sets S1 and S2 of cardinal number n and S3 of cardinal number n-1 as:
Rp(S1,S2) iff (S3 ⊂ S1, S3 ⊂ S2)
Meaning that S1 and S2 each have all the pitch-classes of S3 (transposed or inverted), plus one.

Soaps In Depth is an American entertainment magazine, formerly published as a series of biweekly print publications and currently as an online-exclusive publication, that is dedicated to coverage of daytime soap operas. Founded in 1997 by Bauer Publications, it covers current and upcoming soap opera storylines, and features news and feature articles, interviews with performers and principal production staff, and, as a print publication, crossword puzzles.
Differentiating from other soap opera-focused magazines (like Soap Opera Digest) that offered general coverage of all of the daytime serials, Soaps In Depth was initially structured as three standalone biweekly publications—ABC Soaps In Depth, CBS Soaps In Depth and NBC Soaps In Depth—that were devoted to only the soap operas on a particular "Big Three" network covered by the corresponding edition, allowing soap viewers to receive more coverage related to the soaps they followed.
The NBC edition was discontinued in December 1999 after the network cancelled two of its three soap operas within months of each other, Another World and Sunset Beach, making it superfluous to cover only two programs (Days of Our Lives and AW successor Passions respectively); coverage of NBC's serials was integrated into the other publications. The ABC and CBS editions continued to be sold for 21 years afterward, even after both networks pared down the number of soaps occupying their respective daytime schedules between 2009 and 2012, leaving ABC with only one serial (General Hospital) and CBS with two (The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful).
In April 2020, it was announced that Soaps in Depth would cease production of its print magazine but would continue to publish newer content as an online-only publication; the conversion left Soap Opera Digest as the only remaining American soap opera magazine to provide content through both print publication and online distribution.
Editions
CBS Soaps In Depth
First published in early 1997, at the time print publication ceased, CBS Soaps In Depth had focused only on the CBS soaps The Bold and the Beautiful and The Young and the Restless. Previously, Guiding Light and As The World Turns were covered as well before their respective cancellations (in 2009 and 2010). Each issue also included a special section for Days of Our Lives, brief news coverage, previews, and recaps for General Hospital and Days Of Our Lives. When the CBS edition debuted, each issue cost $2.99. By the publication's closure, the CBS edition cost $3.99 American and $4.50 Canadian.
ABC Soaps In Depth
First published in February 1997, this magazine focused on the ABC soaps at that time (All My Children, The City, General Hospital, and One Life to Live). One month after the release of the debut issue, ABC cancelled The City; ABC Soaps In Depth later coverage began on its replacement, Port Charles, when the General Hospital spin-off premiered in June with coverage of PC continuing until the series was cancelled in 2003. The ABC edition also includes news coverage, previews, and recaps for the CBS soaps and Days of our Lives. The magazine initially cost $2.99 per issue, with occasional issues sold at a discount to $1.00; beginning in 2003, each issue cost $3.99.
After the cancellations of AMC and OLTL in 2011 and 2012, respectively (leaving GH as the ABC's only remaining daytime soap, a status it maintains to this day), the ABC edition began to also include brief sections for NBC's Days of Our Lives and the CBS soaps.
NBC Soaps In Depth
NBC Soaps In Depth focused its coverage on NBC Daytime's soap line-up, then consisting of Another World, Days of Our Lives, and the fledgling Sunset Beach. Two of the soaps covered by the NBC edition were cancelled within a span of several months during 1999: NBC first cancelled the long-running AW to make room for the in-house production Passions and subsequently canned Sunset Beach due to low ratings (electing to replace it with Later Today, a lifestyle talk show developed as an extension of Today); although the network continued to maintain two serials thereafter (until Passions moved to The 101 Network in 2008 to accommodate a fourth hour of Today, leaving Days as NBC's only remaining serial), the consequence of NBC Daytime's drastic moves led Bauer Publications to determine a separate NBC-focused magazine was no longer feasible.
Coverage of Days of our Lives and, until its cancellation, Passions (consisting of news and feature articles, previews, and recaps for each show) was folded into the ABC and CBS editions; at the time Soaps in Depth ended print distribution, Days received more coverage in the ABC edition, as ABC itself only has one soap opera remaining on its daytime schedule (General Hospital).

Björk is an Icelandic singer-songwriter, producer and actor from Reykjavík who has received many awards and nominations for their work. After gaining international popularity as the lead singer of The Sugarcubes, they rose to prominence with the release of their first album Debut in 1993. During this time, they won several awards, including the Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act and the NME Award for Best Solo Artist. At the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards the music video for their first single "Human Behaviour" received six nominations. With the release of their second album Post (1995) the singer won five Icelandic Music Awards and the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Female and became the first artist to receive the Vanguard Award at the ASCAP Awards. The video for their single "It's Oh So Quiet" won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography in a Video. The singer's third album, titled Homogenic, was released in 1997. The album's music videos were acclaimed, with the videos for "Bachelorette", directed by Michel Gondry, and "All Is Full of Love", directed by Chris Cunningham, receiving multiple accolades, including three MTV Video Music Awards for Best Art Direction, Breakthrough Video and Best Visual Effects.
In 2000, Björk starred in Lars von Trier's musical melodrama film Dancer in the Dark, which premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme d'Or. For their role as Selma Ježková in the movie, the singer received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and the European Film Award for Best Actress and garnered a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Björk also composed the movie's soundtrack Selmasongs, which included the song "I've Seen It All".

The Darlington Agency was an Indian agency on the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation prior to statehood in present-day Canadian County, Oklahoma. The agency was established in 1870. The agency established at Fort Supply the previous year was moved to a more accessible location for the tribes. Brinton Darlington, a Quaker for whom the agency was named, was the first United States Indian agent at the agency, a position they held until their death in 1872.
The agency gained a post office and an Indian school, the latter run by John Homer Seger. It became a stop on the Chisholm Trail. By 1880, the agency had its own newspaper, the Cheyenne Transporter; it was the first in western Indian Territory.
The Cheyenne left in 1897 to form their own agency at Concho. When the Arapaho reunited with them, they both occupied the Concho agency.
The Darlington Agency site became the property of the State of Oklahoma after it was admitted to the Union. The Masons leased the site and operated a boarding school and retirement home there until 1922. The state briefly used the site as a drug rehabilitation center before designating it for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation's main bird hatchery and research station.
The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973.
History
The Darlington Agency was established in 1870 on the Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation in Indian Territory. Fort Reno was established near the Darlington Agency in 1874, at the insistence of Agent John Miles, to pacify the Arapaho and Cheyenne who had already settled there. At first, Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry were dispatched from Fort Sill to establish an installation called “Camp Near the Cheyenne Agency.” They were reassigned to the Wichita Agency, south of Darlington, because of Indian unrest in that area. Troops of the 5th Infantry and 6th Cavalry from Forts Dodge and Leavenworth, under Lt. Col. Thomas Neil, were assigned to Darlington.
Neil was authorized to select a site on the south side of the North Canadian River, build corrals and a wagon yard, dig wells, and set up a sawmill for the military post. In February 1876, General Phil Sheridan named the new facility Fort Reno.
In December 1876, the chief clerk of the Office of Indian Affairs. S. A. Galpin, inspected the Darlington Agency. Their report was largely favorable to the post. They seemed especially impressed by the Indian school established there, writing that it was "... the largest, and in many respects the best, Indian school that I have found." At the time, John H. Seger was running the school for the second straight year, and had an enrollment of 115 students. Galpin noted that the school was in excellent condition, and that "... the furniture of which is as yet without a scratch made wantonly..."
In 1877, Dull Knife and 900 other Cheyenne were escorted by US troops to Darlington to be interned. The following year, most of this group escaped en masse and fled toward their northern homeland. Troops from Fort Reno and other posts pursued and captured most of the escapees and returned them to Darlington.
Troops from the fort were also used to protect the Native Americans, as they removed Boomers and ranchers who illegally trespassed or grazed cattle on reservation property. In 1889, the troops fought Sooners trying to sneak into Oklahoma before the land run officially opened.
By 1880, the Darlington agency published its own newspaper, the Cheyenne Transporter; it was the first in western Indian Territory. The Cheyenne left in 1897 to form their own agency at Concho. When the Arapaho reunited with them, they both occupied the Concho agency.
The Darlington Agency site became the property of the State of Oklahoma after it was admitted to the Union in 1907. The Masons leased the site, and operated a boarding school and retirement home there until 1922.
The state briefly used the site as a drug rehabilitation center before designating it for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation's main bird hatchery and research station.
The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973.
Fort Reno was declared a remount station in 1908. Its primary aim was to supply animals (primarily horses) to other military units. In 1938, cavalry units were already being mechanized and horses were no longer needed; the fort became used as a quartermaster depot. During World War II, Fort Reno became a prisoner-of-war camp for captured German soldiers.
In 1949, the facility was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for use as a livestock research station. It has since been renamed as the Darlington State Game Farm.

The Time Zones Exchange Project distills selections from Negativland's radio program Over the Edge, broadcast on KPFA. This CD was edited together from several different broadcasts recorded between 1989 and 1992. A 1988 edition, radically different from the CD version, is online at Over the Edge at archive.org.
Unlike previous volumes of the Over The Edge series, this two disc set presents a rambling documentary with a pseudo-plot to uncover information about the elusive Trillionaire C.E. Friday, a character that recurs throughout various forms of Negativland Media, and also covers many theories about Howland Island. Disc 1 contains a mock radio show, The Piddle Diddle Report - from a network called the American Broadcasting System, a rival to the Universal Media Netweb - which closely parodies the Art Bell show. Disc 2 is presented as a Universal Media Netweb simulcast, in conjunction with Radio Moscow, to teach the people of Russia the basics of a Free Market economy. Throughout this disc are commercials for Mertz, a Decision-Enhancing Mental Supplement, and a series of recordings from a real botched attempt to do a similar simulcast in the mid 1980s. This album was released in 1994 on Negativland's Seeland label.

The result was proved by Pao-Lu Hsu and Herbert Robbins in 1947.
This is an interesting strengthening of the classical strong law of large numbers in the direction of the Borel–Cantelli lemma. The idea of such a result is probably due to Robbins, but the method of proof is vintage Hsu. Hsu and Robbins further conjectured in that the condition of finiteness of the variance of is also a necessary condition for to hold. Two years later, the famed mathematician Paul Erdős proved the conjecture.
Since then, many authors extended this result in several directions.

Summer 08 is the fifth studio album by English electronic music band Metronomy, released on 1 July 2016 by Because Music.
Recording and release
Summer 08 is Metronomy's first album recorded solely by member Joseph Mount since their debut effort, Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe). Its title and release date was announced on BBC Radio 1 in an interview with Annie Mac on 11 May 2016, simultaneously with a release of the album's first single, "Old Skool". Collin Robinson of Stereogum called the song a "disco-leaning, 808-heavy, DJ-scratching throwback of a jam." The track "Mick Slow" samples most of the track "Weather the Windmill" from Mick Karn's first solo album, Titles. Metronomy included Karn's track in their edition of the Late Night Tales series in 2012.
Critical reception
Summer 08 received mostly positive reviews from music critics. According to critic review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received a score of 74/100, based on 23 reviews, indicating "generally favorable". Laura Snapes of Pitchfork writes that "Metronomy's latest record strips away any pretense that they are a band, focusing on its sole creator, Joe Mount. The album solidifies their own idiosyncratic brand of standoffish funk."

Automobilista 2 is a racing simulator game created by Reiza Studios, under the lead of Renato Simioni. The game was initially released as an Early Access title on March 31, 2020, via Steam, with the official V1.0 release taking place on June 30, 2020. Automobilista 2 features a wide variety of cars and tracks. Its main focus is on Brazilian content, which includes licensed Brazilian racing series such as Stock Car Brazil and Copa Truck. There is also an emphasis on Grand Prix racing cars of many different eras, and includes licensed and generic vehicles. Other racing classes represented in Automobilista 2 include, but are not limited to: Retro touring cars, 1990s American open-wheel cars, GT3 and karts. Automobilista 2 supports VR, triple screen and full motion racing simulator setups.
Development
Automobilista 2 is built on the MADNESS engine, which also was the foundation of the Project CARS. series by Slightly Mad Studios. Automobilista 2 inherited the Seta tyre model, which is a physical tyre model. The Seta tyre model simulates the carcass, the tread and the heat of the tyre, which allows for a wide variety of tyres to be simulated with realistic handling properties. Automobilista 2 also features Livetrack 3.0, which allows for dynamic simulation of the race track's surface. This includes the 'rubbering in' and heating/cooling effects as vehicles drive over the racetrack, and allows for simulation of rain and puddles to affect the track depending on its geometry.
Automobilista 2 includes several improvements over Project CARS 2 in terms of vehicle physics, force feedback, audio, and the implementation of Livetrack 3.0. Automobilista 2 allows players to select any date and time between the present and 1979, and the game will automatically feature climatic conditions, such as temperature, wind, and rainfall, as it was at the time. These conditions affect the vehicle handling in a realistic way. The trackside foliage will also adjust, depending on time of year chosen.

The Madrasa of Al-Nasir Muhammad is a madrasa and mausoleum located in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area of al-Muizz street in Cairo, Egypt. It was built in the name of the Mamluk sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun, but its construction began between 1294 and 1295 under the reign of Sultan Al-Adil Kitbugha, who was sultan in between Al-Nasir Muhammad's first and seconds reigns. When Al-Nasir Muhammad returned to the throne in 1299 they oversaw its construction until its completion in 1303. It is adjacent to the earlier hospital and funerary complex of Sultan Qalawun and the later Madrasa of Sultan Barquq.
Historical background
Al-Nasir Muhammad was the ninth Mamluk sultan of Egypt, the youngest son of Sultan Qalawun, and lived from 1285 to 1341. They were inaugurated as sultan three times, from 1293 to 1294, from 1299 to 1309, and from 1309 to 1341. In December 1293 Al-Nasir Muhammad's older brother Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil was assassinated, leaving the throne to the 9-year-old Al-Nasir Muhammad. For their first two reigns Al-Nasir Muhammad played the role of a nominal sultan, with their vice sultan and viziers being the active rulers due to their young age. By the time of their third reign Al-Nasir Muhammad was 24 years old and took full command of the Mamluk Sultanate. This period passed with no major conflicts, and marked the high point for Mamluk power in Egypt. Al-Nasir Muhammad set into motion many public works such as the construction of canals, squares, madrasas, and mosques.
This madrasa was begun by Sultan al-'Adil Katbugha, who ruled from 1294 to 1296 (in between al-Nasir Muhammad's first and second reigns), but it was taken over and completed by al-Nasir Muhammad during their second reign (1299-1309). The Islamic historian Al-Nuwayri records that Al-Adil Kitbugha built the mausoleum along with the prayer iwan, and Al-Nasir Muhammad completed the construction of the building and added the minaret. Also, the Islamic historian Al-Maqrizi reports that Al-Adil Kitbugha oversaw construction of the building up to the top of the inscription band, and Al-Nasir Muhammad carried out the rest of its construction. It was inaugurated in 1303, when the minaret was added.
Al-Nasir Muhammad was never buried in the mausoleum named after him. They were afraid of unrest after their death because of the rivalry between their emirs, and chose to be buried in secret at their father's mausoleum, the mausoleum of Sultan Qalawun. However, it is the burial site of their mother Bint Sukbay and their son Anuk.
Architecture
General overview
The Madrasa of Al-Nasir Muhammad is located next to the mausoleum complex of their father, Sultan Qalawun, and that of the later Sultan Barquq, in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area. It is made of brick and has stucco designs and inscriptions on the exterior and interior. The inscription along the façade is in the name of Al-Nasir Muhammad, but ends with the original foundation date of 1296. This implies that after regaining the throne in 1299 Al-Nasir Muhammad replaced Al-Adil Kitbugha's name with their own without altering the second part of the inscription.
The Madrasa of Al-Nasir Muhammad is one of only three madrasas in Cairo that housed all four of the Sunni schools of jurisprudence. The madrasa is home to the last stucco mihrab (niche indicating the direction of prayer) in Egypt, unique for its raised, egg-shaped stucco bosses in high relief with punched ornament decorating the hood of the mihrab. The style is highly reminiscent of stucco carving produced in Tabriz, Iran under Mongol Ilkhanid rule and historians have suggested that it was crafted by artists from Mongol Iran or Tabriz. Aside from the mihrab, relatively little decoration has survived overall in the interior of al-Nasir Muhammad's building.
The domed mausoleum is separated from the madrasa by the main entrance corridor, from which it is accessed. Looking across the main entrance corridor are windows in the madrasa and the mausoleum that visually link the two. This is essentially the same layout as the mausoleum-madrasa of Sultan Qalawun (his father) next door. The dome of the mausoleum collapsed in 1870 and was never replaced, leaving only the drum of the dome visible today. A simple wooden roof now covers the space once covered by the dome.
The portal
The most unique aspect of the Madrasa of Al-Nasir Muhammad is its gothic marble portal, acquired from a church in the city of Acre after al-Ashraf Khalil's victory against the Crusaders in 1291. The identification of the church in question is debated: some sources state it was the Church of Saint Andrew, while other sources name the Church of St Agnes or the Church of Saint John the Baptist. According to medieval Muslim historian al-Maqrizi, after the battle Khalil appointed their emir ʿAlam al-Din Sanjar al-Shujaʿi al-Mansuri () "to destroy the city walls and demolish its churches". When the emir came upon the church with this portal as its gate they decided to transport it in its entirety back to Cairo. They kept it for the rest of Khalil's reign and for all of Al-Nasir Muhammad's first reign, but it was seized from them by Sultan Al-Adil Kitbugha and used in this madrasa.
The portal "consists of a pointed arch with a triple recess flanked by three slender columns on each side". At the top of the arch "Allah" has been inscribed. Al-Maqrizi praised this portal for its craftsmanship, saying "Its gate is among the most amazing things the sons of Adam have crafted, for it is made from one piece of white marble, marvelous in form and exalted in workmanship". Although there are several other distinguished portals in mosques and madrasas within Cairo, this gateway holds historical significance, acting as a trophy for the Muslim victory over the Crusaders. Al-Maqrizi's high praise for this portal could be due to this added sentimental value or its exotic appeal.
The minaret
The highly stylized and decorated stucco designs on the lower rectangular section of this minaret add another element of uniqueness to the Madrasa of Al-Nasir Muhammad. This is one of the only remaining stucco minarets in Cairo, and includes decorations of medallions, keel-arched niches, and sections filled with geometric and floral patterns. The medallions and keel-arched niches are similar to those of earlier Fatimid and Ayyubid decoration, and the floral patterns are characteristic of stucco carvings from this period. Some of the geometric patterns resemble those used in the mihrab of the al-Azhar Mosque. A band of Kufic script runs through the lower decorative arcade, while a large inscription in Thuluth script crowns the top of the rectangular section, just below a balcony of sculpted muqarnas, and contains the name of al-Nasir Muhammad. Some historians have suggested that the quality and density of the stucco work here indicates the involvement of Maghribi or Andalusi craftsmen in its creation.
The minaret is also unusual in that it was built directly above the entrance portal and on top of the main entrance corridor, a design decision that was rare in Mamluk architecture which usually places minarets on their own solid buttresses aside from the entrance in order to ensure greater stability.
Only the bottom rectangular section is original, the second story was most likely added by Sultan Inal as it resembles another stone minaret they built in their name. It has an octagonal shaft and green glass or ceramic elements that fill the mouldings that run around its keel-arched panels. The uppermost section above this is probably from the Ottoman era.

The Brien Holden Vision Institute (BHVI) is an Australian nonprofit non-governmental organization with an international focus on eye care research and vision care delivery. Formerly the Institute for Eye Research, in 2010 it was renamed in recognition of co-founder Brien Holden, a 1997 recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia for their contributions to eye care research.
Research and development
BHVI develops and partners with commercial and nonprofit organizations worldwide to accomplish its goals. Its activities include the development of vision correction products (including eyeglasses, contact lenses and surgical devices) for the treatment of myopia (near-sightedness), presbyopia (also known as "aging sight"), hyperopia and astigmatism. It also conducts research in improvements in contact lens technology, treatments for conditions such as dry eye and technologies to detect eye disease and other eye related conditions.
Global activities
Brien Holden Vision Institute (BHVI) is headquartered in Sydney and has been represented in New South Wales and the Northern Territories of Australia, Cambodia, China, Colombia, India, Malawi, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda and Vietnam. Worldwide, BHVI has developed over 400 eye care sites and, since 1998, provided optometric services to more than 2.5 million people. It has reached 57 schools and trained nearly 50,000 eye care personnel. It was one of two principal investigators in the 2012 study, "The global cost of correcting vision impairment from uncorrected refractive error", with findings published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization.
Africa
In Africa, BHVI sponsored the African Vision Research Institute at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, which conducts research on disease control, human resource development, infrastructure development, provides training in research methods, and promotes publication of research findings for postgraduate students. Additional collaborative work includes vision care in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, projected to reach four million children. In 2014, BHVI partnered with Standard Chartered and SightSavers to provide paediatric eye surgeries at no cost to children aged 15 and younger in Uganda, as part of the Seeing is Believing Child Eye Health project. Also in 2014, BHVI stressed the need for access to affordable spectacles in Tanzania in order to help eliminate vision impairments. The organization partnered with the Tanzanian Optometric Association to distribute spectacles and offer free "professional development courses" for optometrists.
China
Researchers at the Zhongsan Ophthalmic Centre at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China are working in 2013 with BHVI on juvenile myopia on a project focused on myopia clinical translational research. Myopia, which affects up to 600 million Chinese people, is a target of research at the Australia China Centre for Optometry Research and Development, which BHVI established in 2012.
India
In 2011, BHVI co-founded the India Vision Institute, headquartered in Hyderabad, India.
Pakistan
In 2014, a six-day workshop called Low Vision Assessment and Peadtric Refraction provided training and inventory to refractionists from Pakistani district headquarters hospitals, the College of Ophthalmology (COAVS) and Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust hospitals . It was led by the South Asia regional manager of BHVI and the program manager of BHVI Pakistan. This marked the first time in Pakistan that ten district headquarters hospitals were equipped to operate low-vision centers.
Australian government support
BHVI was an essential participant in Vision CRC Ltd, which was established in 2003 under the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Program.
The Australian government's National Health and Medical Research Council lists BHVI as an Approved Administering Institution. The Australian International Development's NGO Cooperation Program helped to fund BHVI in a partnership with Lurio University in Mozambique, to develop and implement a comprehensive program for optometry services in Mozambique and for Portuguese-speaking African countries. BHVI has full membership in the anti-poverty organization Australian Council for International Development and is a full participant in "Vision 2020 Australia", which is part of a global initiative of the World Health Organization and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.
Brien Holden Vision companies
BHVI has sponsored the establishment of commercial entities known as Brien Holden Vision subsidiary companies in Australia, China, India and the United States to directly bring to market advanced products of benefit to consumers and to generate revenues to fund research, education, development and humanitarian activities.
BHVI is developing instruments for diagnosis of eye disorders and in 2012 took a controlling share in the United States company, Quantum Catch, renamed Brien Holden Vision Diagnostics, a company focused on the design, manufacture and sale of affordable, high-quality diagnostic medical devices.

The forestry service was a form of alternative service offered to German speaking Mennonites in lieu of military service in Russia from 1881 to 1918. At its peak during World War I, 7,000 men served in forestry and agricultural pest control in Ukraine and South Russia. The program ended in the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.
Background
Nonresistant Mennonites from West Prussia started settling in Russia in 1789, induced by land and special privileges including exemption from military service. By 1870 their population had grown to over 45,000 and was a significant economic force in south Russia. In 1870 the government announced that special privileges enjoyed by all colonists would end by 1880. Mennonite leaders sent delegations to Saint Petersburg for three successive years, but failed to retain the military exemption they so valued.
With loss of privileges looking likely, emigration to North America was promoted as a viable alternative. Realizing that 40,000 of Russia's most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent Eduard Totleben to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, they exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and promised some form of alternative to military service. Their intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay in Russia. After negotiations with the government in 1880 over acceptable types of alternative service, the forestry service program was deemed the best of the alternatives because it would have no military connection.
Structure
The forestry service began in 1881, after the end of special privileges granted to colonists in Russia. Men served in large groups for four years planting and caring for trees on the steppes of South Russia. Phylloxera units in Crimea focused on eradicating harmful insects from vineyards. Mennonite congregations provided for housing, feeding and all other necessities of the men. The Russian government provided supervision of the projects, tools needed for the job and paid each man 20 kopeks (a minimal amount) per work day.
Just as Mennonite colonies were insulated from Russian society, the forestry camps were also sheltered from outside contact. Mennonite congregations provided a pastor and a superintendent to oversee each camp. The expense of running the camps, which included constructing barracks, was quite high. Voluntary contributions from Mennonite congregations, who had an incentive to provide an alternative to military service, were sufficient to run the program for nearly three decades.
Initially about four hundred men served in this program annually. By 1913 up to a thousand were serving and during World War I, 7000. A similar program allowed Mennonite men to serve in hospital units and transport wounded from the battlefield to Moscow and Ekaterinoslav hospitals.
Demobilization
The forestry units functioned right up to the Russian Revolution of 1917. The camps became impossible to maintain in the chaos of South Russia and the assets, all church property, were sold and camps closed in 1918 with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Alternatives to military service remained available, but under military control, until 1936.
Epilogue
The lessons learned with respect to providing an alternate to military service for conscientious objectors was a model for Civilian Public Service in the United States during World War II. Peace churches almost exclusively financed Civilian Public Service, while draftees served in forestry, agricultural and other types of units.

The 372nd Military Police Company is a law enforcement unit within the U.S. Army Reserve. The unit is based out of Cresaptown, Maryland. Eleven former members of this unit were charged and found guilty in the Abu Ghraib scandal. Another member of the company, Joseph Darby, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for exposing the abuse at the prison.
The 372nd MP Company is credited with the securing and stabilization of the city of Hillah (Babylon), alongside of the 1st Marines (MEF).
The unit was responsible for guarding main supply routes (MSRs).
Unit history
The 372nd Military Police Company was originally activated on 15 October 1942 in Florence, Arizona under the authority of the Ninth Service Command. The unit was given orders in mid-July 1943 to report to Camp Shanks, near Orangeburg, New York for shipment to Italy in support of the Naples-Foggia Campaign. The unit also supported the Fifth Army in the Rome-Arno Campaign that began on 22 January 1944 and ended 4 June 1944. The unit has participated in Operation Dragoon in France, Operation Nordwind. The unit was deactivated on 14 November 1945 and then reactivated in Baltimore, Maryland on 26 June 1947. The unit was then relocated to Cumberland, Maryland on South Centre Street. The unit was then deactivated on 15 June 1959. The unit was then re designated Bravo Company of the 336th Military Police Battalion. In January 1964 members of the unit provided site security and acted as guides to the area for the B-52 which crashed in Garrett County. The Unit was then reactivated on 22 February 1972 once again as the 372nd Military Police Company as part of the First Army. The unit drilled at the VFW Hall in Lonaconing, Maryland. On 30 June 1973 the unit shifted its location to Cresaptown, Maryland, where it shared the reserve center with the 265th Ordnance Company. In the mid-1970s the unit recruited its first female military police officer. In 1985 a platoon size element was selected for duty in Operation Bright Star in Egypt and Jordan. In 1986 the entire company was selected to participate in Gallant Eagle in California. Then unit was then activated again on 25 September 1990 for Operation Desert Storm.
During the Iraq War, several detainees at Abu Ghraib prison were abused and humiliated, some of them quite a few times. Charles Graner, Lynndie England, Sabrina Harman and others were later investigated and made to serve time in a military prison.

The Twilight Limited was a named passenger train in the United States which initially operated between Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. The New York Central Railroad introduced the train in 1926, and it continued until the formation of Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) in 1971, although it lost its name in 1967. Amtrak renamed the train St. Clair, feeling that the name "Twilight Limited" had undesirable connotations and imagery for a company trying to save passenger rail service. Amtrak revived the name in 1976 for a new train frequency on the Chicago–Detroit corridor, and kept the name until all trains on that corridor were renamed Wolverine in 2004.
History
New York Central
The New York Central Railroad introduced the Twilight Limited on April 25, 1926. The new train was first-class only, with parlor cars and a dining car. It was the fastest of the 13 New York Central (Michigan Central) trains from Chicago to Detroit, leaving Central Station at 3:00 PM and taking six hours for 283.5 miles to Detroit. After the Second World War the Twilight Limited gained coaches, but kept some parlor cars and its dining car. Service on the Chicago-Detroit route continued to drop, from seven trains each way in 1951 to five in 1960. The last parlor car came off in the mid-1960s. As part of a massive restructuring the New York Central dropped all train names on December 3, 1967, although the ex-Twilight Limited still ran. Penn Central (the merged New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroad) truncated the westbound ex-Twilight Limited at Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 5, 1968. Amtrak kept the eastbound ex-Twilight Limited (No. 356), but renamed it the St. Clair.
Amtrak
By mid-1976 Amtrak had three round-trips on the Chicago-Detroit corridor; these were all named Turboliner after the French-designed gas turbine RTG trainsets which operated on the route. Demand outstripped the trainsets' fixed capacity of 292, so Amtrak began assigning new conventional Amfleet equipment as it became available. On October 31, 1976, the evening pair of trains (#354/#355) became the Twilight Limited. This service pattern remained mostly uninterrupted until 1994, although budget problems led to the westbound Twilight Limited running tri-weekly (Friday-Sunday) between 1986 and 1990. On May 5, 1994 Amtrak extended the Twilight Limited and Wolverine to Pontiac, Michigan. In 2000, as part of its Network Growth Strategy Amtrak proposed extending the Twilight Limited to New York City, New York via Ontario, Canada and Buffalo, New York, bypassing Detroit. The last Michigan-Ontario-New York had ended in 1979 when Amtrak discontinued the Niagara Rainbow. Nothing came of this proposal, although for a time the Twilight Limited terminated at Detroit and handled additional mail and express business. On April 26, 2004 Amtrak dropped individual names on the Chicago-Detroit corridor and the Twilight Limited (along with the Lake Cities (Amtrak train)) became one of three Wolverines.

Webb Institute is a private college focused on engineering and located in Glen Cove, New York. Each graduate of Webb Institute earns a Bachelor of Science degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. Successful candidates for admission receive full tuition for four years. Webb Institute is noted in the marine industry for its unique emphasis on ship design, systems engineering, and practical work experience.
History
Webb Institute of Naval Architecture was founded in 1889 by industrialist and philanthropist William Henry Webb, who had established their career as a preeminent shipbuilder in the 19th century. They recognized the increasing role of science and engineering in the field of ship design, which had long been seen as more of an art form. Webb felt that the ship designers of the future would need to be skilled in structural and mechanical engineering and other scientific disciplines. The institute graduated its first class in 1893 and continues to educate students in naval architecture and marine engineering.
Founding and early history
On April 2, 1889, the state of New York incorporated Webb's Academy and Home for Shipbuilders as a non-profit institution. Webb had provided the academy with an endowment presumed to be sufficient to allow the institution to be self-supporting in perpetuity. It was intended to serve not only as an educational institution for future naval architects but also as a retirement home for aged shipbuilders.
Webb commissioned New York architect Arthur P. Jennings to design a building for the institution to be built on of land on a bluff overlooking the Harlem and Hudson rivers in the Bronx. Construction commenced in 1890 and was completed in 1893. The building was designed in the Romanesque Revival style and was built of New York brownstone. It was intended to be "a romantic version of a medieval castle", with turrets, fanciful carving, and other flourishes. This facility was used for 50 years.
During World War II, the institute was closely associated with the U.S. Navy as a training center for naval officers.
Move and expansion
By 1945, the Board of Trustees determined that the Bronx campus was no longer suitable, lacking certain laboratory facilities, and ultimately sold it for a considerable sum. The site was redeveloped as the Fordham Hill Apartment complex.
In November 1945, the institute purchased its current home: The Braes, the former country estate of Herbert L. Pratt, in Glen Cove on the North Shore of Long Island. Designed by James Brite and constructed between 1912 and 1914, the main house had a distinct H-shaped layout and Jacobean, Tudor, and Renaissance-influenced design elements that made it distinct among Long Island estates of the era. It was the largest of the six Pratt estates in Glen Cove. Conversion work began in 1946.
In April 1947, classes began at the new campus in Glen Cove. The main building had been renovated to include classrooms, dormitories, and offices. A model basin and gymnasium were constructed elsewhere on the campus. The main building was renamed Stevenson Taylor Hall in honor of the charter member and president of the Board of Trustees (1900–1926) of the institute. Through the conversion, the ground floor of Stevenson Taylor Hall retained much of the original 1915-era decor.
A modern library and auditorium were added to the campus in 1971. Webb first admitted women as students in 1974.
Webb Institute was used for the exterior shots of Wayne Manor in the 1995 film Batman Forever, again in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, and for interior and exterior shots for the 2014 TV series Gotham. The Webb Institute reprised its earlier film role as Wayne Manor for the 2019 film Joker. It was also featured in the 1998 film Great Expectations. Interior and exterior shots appeared in the 2015 TV series Limitless in Season 1, Episode 14.
Administrators
There have been 18 administrators of the institute:
Academics
The student body of Webb Institute typically numbers around 90, with 20% being female. Webb currently has 12 full-time faculty members and no teaching assistants. Students have high access to professors, who routinely make themselves available at most hours. Adjunct faculty from local colleges teach some humanities courses at Webb such as Political Philosophy and Japanese.
There are four classrooms, one for each class. The school is atypical as the professors, rather than students, rotate to each classroom because of its small size. The front portion of the classroom is dedicated to lecture hours, while the rear has rows of drafting tables, one for each student, along with bookshelves and couches for 24-7 personalized study space.
The centerpiece of Webb's academic facilities is the -long model ship model basin, which is frequently used by students and faculty alike for experiments and research. Webb Institute has its own physics and chemistry laboratories, an extensive library, an engineering lab for mechanical and electrical experiments, a carpentry shop, and a machine shop. Students have limited around-the-clock access to these facilities. There is an emphasis throughout Webb's academic program on hands-on experience, and several classes require conducting experiments or building and testing models.
Webb Institute's coursework is intense. Students spend up to 5 hours per day in lecture and can spend several hours per day working outside of class. During the mandatory internship period from January through February each year, students seek positions in the maritime industry, including shipyards, design offices, and aboard merchant vessels. All seniors are required to complete a senior thesis. Seniors are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, in which they usually perform exceptionally well.
85% of incoming students make it to graduation. Many graduates establish careers in the maritime industry, with 100% job placement. Graduates also forge careers in other engineering fields or find success in finance or law. About a third of each graduating class goes on to pursue an advanced degree. Webb has an active alumni association which supports graduates, fosters a thriving social network, and maintains an alumni fund. The alumni giving rate is over 70%, one of the highest rates in the United States.
Because of the founder's endowment and the high alumni giving rate, students who are U.S. citizens are not charged tuition at Webb. Students pay for room and board, books, and various fees. The Bachelor of Science degree is awarded after four years of "total immersion" study, which includes several months of job experience through internship periods.
The institute maintains close relationships with the nearby United States Merchant Marine Academy and State University of New York Maritime College, along with Cooper Union.
Winter Work
Winter Work is Webb Institute's term for its unique internship periods. Webb students are required to work in certain areas of the marine industry for 8 weeks during the months of January and February. Freshmen act as apprentices/mechanics in shipyards or boatyards, and sophomores as cadets/observers at sea. Juniors and seniors perform internships in various engineering firms and design offices. By the time students graduate, they have 8 months of work experience. Recently, Winter Work has become increasingly more global, with several students traveling overseas to China, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates.
Accreditation
Webb Institute is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.
Culture
Residential life
Students are generally to live on campus for all four years. The mansion houses male dorms, the four large classrooms, the library, the dining hall, the student pub, and various work spaces. The adjacent two buildings, Motley and The Robinson Model Basin, house the female dorms. Webb Institute has no fraternities or sororities. There is a student-run Social Committee at Webb that holds several parties throughout the year, the biggest event being "Webbstock," a music festival held in June on the mansion's terraces overlooking the Long Island Sound. The Social Committee also organizes off-campus trips throughout the year.
Honor Code
The student body adheres to an Honor Code, which prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. The Student Organization administers the Honor Code, operates the student treasury, oversees social activities, and serves as liaison between students and the school administration.
Extracurricular activities
Webb has five intercollegiate athletic teams: sailing year-round, soccer and basketball in the fall, and volleyball and tennis in the spring.
Students have many options for recreation during their studies. The school has its own yacht club, automotive workshop, and English pub. Intercollegiate sports include sailing, tennis, soccer, volleyball, ultimate, and basketball. New York City is an hour away by the Long Island Rail Road. There are many student-led activity clubs on campus as well, both sporting and intellectual.
Webb won the 2018 HVIAC men's tennis championship. This is the first championship Webb sports has won in recent history.
Athletics
The Webb athletic teams are the Webbies. The institute is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing in the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (HVIAC) for most of its sports since the 2004–05 academic year; while its sailing team competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (MAISA).
Webb competes in five intercollegiate varsity sports: Men's sports include basketball, sailing, soccer, tennis and volleyball.

The Ettlingen Line () or Lower Line (Untere Linie) was a defensive line built in 1707 during the War of the Spanish Succession from brushwood (Verhauen) and palisades, which replaced the 1701 Bühl-Stollhofen Line after that had been destroyed in May 1707 and levelled by French troops.
History
Several months after the loss of the Bühl-Stollhofen Line, work began on the Ettlingen Line on the orders of the commander of the Rhine Army, George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The line was reinforced during the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738) by the introduction of watercourses that could be impounded, but in 1734 French troops broke through them and they were subsequently destroyed, but then rebuilt in 1735. Thereafter they lost their military significance.
Location
The line, which flanks from the Malscher Landgraben, lies between the Black Forest and the Rhine meadows south of where the city of Karlsruhe is today. Remains of the fortified line with their breastworks and a redoubt may still be seen southwest of Karlsruhe near a heath settlement, running for a distance of around 500 metres in the forest of Hardtwald. In the woods of Rheinstetten, an even longer section of the line is still visible. Since July 2010 the line in Karlsruhe has been marked by an information board; another one has been erected in Rheinstetten on Pirschweg. There are also visible remains in Schöllbronn; together with a further information board.

Förster coupling is the resonant energy transfer between excitons within adjacent QD's (quantum dots). The first studies of Forster were performed in the context of the sensitized luminescence of solids. Here, an excited sensitizer atom can transfer its excitation to a neighbouring acceptor atom, via an intermediate virtual photon. This same mechanism has also been shown to be responsible for exciton transfer between QD's and within molecular systems and biosystems (though incoherently, as a mechanism for photosynthesis), all of which may be treated in a similar formulation. (See also Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).)
Introduction
In the introductory lecture given by T. Förster, they considered the transfer of electronic excitation energy between otherwise well-separated atomic or molecular electronic systems, which exclude the trivial case of an excitation transfer that consists in the emission of one quantum of light by the first atom or molecule followed by re-absorption by the second one. It is only the non-radiative transfer of excitation occurring during the short lifetimes of excited electronic systems which they considered there.
The first observation of energy transfer was made by Cario and Franck (1922) in their classical experiments on sensitized fluorescence of atoms in the vapour phase. A mixture of mercury and thallium vapour, when irradiated with the light of the mercury resonance line, shows the emission spectra of both atoms. Since thallium atoms do not absorb the exciting light, they can get excited only indirectly by an excitation transfer from mercury atoms. A transfer by reabsorption is impossible here. Therefore, this transfer must be a non-radiative one with a mercury atom as the donor or sensitizer and the thallium atom as the acceptor. Unfortunately, in this case it cannot be decided whether the transfer occurs between distant atoms or during a normal collision or even in a labile molecule formed as an intermediate. This decision, however, was possible in similar cases, as in the mercury-sensitized fluorescence of sodium and in the mutual sensitization of the fluorescence of different mercury isotopes. In these cases, the transfer occurs over distances very much larger than those in normal collisional separations. Similar observations of sensitized fluorescence were made with molecular vapours and in solution.
Further experiments have shown that in this case the transfer occurs not over collisional distances but over the mean intermolecular distances of sensitizer and acceptor, corresponding to a concentration of 10−3 to 10−2M. This is demonstrated by the fact that sensitization occurs with similar half-value concentrations in solution of very different viscosities and even in organic glasses at low temperature. The possibility of the formation of a complex between sensitizer and acceptor molecules was excluded by the additivity of the absorption spectra and the different dependence on concentration to be expected in this case. It must be concluded, therefore, that excitation transfer of a non-trivial nature occurs over the mean distances between statistically distributed molecules which are about 40Å in this case. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime.
Qualitative features
Table 2 summarizes some qualitative features of this kind of long-range transfer and of some more or less trivial mechanisms. The non-trivial transfer differs from re-absorption transfer by its independence of the volume of the solution, by the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime, and by the invariability of the sensitizer fluorescence spectrum. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime. In most cases, some of these different properties allow a decision between trivial and non-trivial transfer mechanisms. Further discriminations may be made by quantitative studies of these properties.
Coulomb interaction
The electrons interact via the Coulomb interaction, given by the Hamiltonian
where the Coulomb matrix element is given by
Here, is the dielectric constant of the medium.
To calculate the dynamics of two coupled QDs (each modeled as an interband two-level system with one conduction and one valence level and , respectively) which have no electronic overlap, an expansion of the potential is performed: (i) a long-range expansion about a reference point of each QD, varying on a mesoscopic scale and neglecting the variation on the scale of the elementary cell - this yields level diagonal contributions in the Hamiltonian and
; and (ii) a short-range expansion about an arbitrary lattice vector, taking into account the microscopic variation of the QD - this yields nondiagonal contributions . On the dipole-dipole level, the level diagonal elements correspond to an electrostatic energetic shift of the system (biexcitonic shift ), while the nondiagonal elements, the so-called Förster coupling elements , correspond to an excitation transfer between the different QDs.
Hamiltonian
Here, we shall consider excitons in two coupled QD's and the Coulomb interactions between them. More specifically, we shall derive an analytical expression for the strength of the inter-dot Foerster coupling. It can be also shown that this coupling is, under certain conditions, of dipole-dipole type and that it is responsible for resonant exciton exchange between adjacent QD's. This is a transfer of energy only, not a tunnelling effect.
we write the Hamiltonian of two interacting QD's in the computational basis
where the off-diagonal Förster interaction is given by
, and the direct Coulomb binding energy between the two excitons, one on each dot, is on the diagonal and given by
. The ground state energy is denoted by
, and is the difference between the excitation energy for dot I and that for dot II. These excitation energies and inter-dot interactions are all functions of the applied field F.
It is also straightforward to see that an off-diagonal Förster coupling does indeed correspond to a resonant transfer of energy; if we begin in the state
(exciton on dot I, no exciton on dot II) this will naturally evolve to a state

Tarjei Sandvik Moe (born 24 May 1999) is a Norwegian actor. They rose to fame with their portrayal of Isak Valtersen, the main character in the third season of Norwegian teen drama series Skam. Their acting, and the third season of the series as a whole, received widespread critical acclaim for a non-stereotypical display of homosexuality, and resulted in them and co-star Henrik Holm winning two prestigious Norwegian awards.
Following the conclusion of Skam, Moe performed in the Norwegian theater adaptation of Grease and appeared in the 2018 erotic thriller film .
Career
Tarjei Sandvik Moe portrayed Isak Valtersen in the Norwegian teen drama series Skam (2015-2017), appearing in all four seasons of the series, but receiving prominence as the main character in the third season. The season, as well as their character, received widespread acclaim for showing homosexual love without resorting to stereotypical presentations of storylines or personalities, and caused the series to become a global phenomenon, with international viewers following the series through unofficial translations on social media.
For their portrayal of the character, Sandvik Moe was nominated for "Best Actor" at the 2017 Gullruten awards, an annual Norwegian awards ceremony for the country's TV industry. Although they lost in that category, they nevertheless won two other major awards; the "Audience Award", shared along with co-star Henrik Holm, and "TV Moment of the Year", for the final scene in the penultimate episode of the third season. At the awards ceremony, the two men also made headlines in Norway for a spontaneous kiss on live television during a "kiss cam" moment, despite the fact that the event was not coordinated with the actors beforehand. The producer of the awards ceremony did not intend to force the actors to kiss, planning instead of making the award hosts humorously say that "we've seen it before" and make the camera pan out. Sandvik Moe and Holm told Norwegian press afterwards that they did not expect it, but described the scenario as "we're used to it", with reference to kissing as a frequently requested activity between them at parties they'd both attended in the past.
Sandvik Moe also appeared at on 1 July 2017, with Skam co-star Carl Martin Eggesbø and producer Marianne Furevold-Boland, to accept the "Fryd" award for persons or organizations that break the norms in gender and sexuality in a positive manner. In February 2018, Moe, together with Iman Meskini, another co-star from the series, were invited to the Royal Palace for dinner, and had the honor of meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Duchess Kate. Prince William and Duchess Kate visited the school where Skam was filmed, where they discussed the impact of the TV show for people around the world with more members of the series' cast.
In June 2017, Sandvik Moe was announced as playing the character Doody in a Norwegian theater adaptation of Grease, which premiered in January 2018. The following month, they landed a role in the 2018 feature film An Affair, an erotic thriller centering on a teacher having an affair with a student. Also in August, Moe was the presenter for the Best Actress award at Norway's annual film awards, Amandaprisen, and was presenter of the announcement of nominees for the 2017 Nordic Council Film Prize.
Personal life
Sandvik Moe attended the Norwegian school Hartvig Nissen.
In September 2018, Sandvik Moe guest-starred on the Norwegian talk show Senkveld and was asked about their decision to not disclose their sexual orientation to the public. They responded that their sexuality is a "private matter" and further elaborated: "A human is much more than their sexual orientation. I don't want there to be any big headlines that 'he's hetero' or 'he's gay' or anything like that. I am an actor, that's what I am. So that's what I'm trying to focus on, and that's why it's not important for me to put any focus on whether I like boys or girls".

The siege at Hotel Delfino (Filipino: Pagkubkob sa Hotel Delfino, Ilocano: Sitio ti Hotel Delfino) in Tuguegarao, Cagayan in the Philippines, took place on March 4, 1990. A private army estimated at 300 men seized the hotel under the command of former Cagayan governor Rodolfo "Agi" Aguinaldo. They were suspended as Cagayan's governor in January based on a radio announcement they made at the start of a Dec. 1-9, 1989 coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino; it is said Aguinaldo pledged to send tanks and troops to support rebel forces in Manila led by Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan. A week before their attack on the hotel Aguinaldo was indicted on charges of rebellion and murder relating to the failed Dec. 1-9 coup effort.
Two years earlier, Col. Honasan led a coup attempt on August 28, 1987 that also failed. Soon after that Aguinaldo—then a lieutenant colonel in Cagayan's provincial military forces—bluntly stated another coup attempt would follow if the President "does not make reforms fast". Aguinaldo resigned from the military to run for Cagayan governor in 1988, they won that post in a landslide. Though harshly criticized for human rights abuses while serving in the regime of Ferdinand Marcos, Aguinaldo gained renown and popularity beyond Cagayan for their ardent fight against communist insurgents during Marcos' rule.
Disputing both their suspension as Cagayan governor and the rebellion charges, Aguinaldo refused to surrender to authorities. Along with hundreds of loyal armed followers, they went into hiding in their hometown of Gattaran. On learning government troops were planning to attack their hideout, Aguinaldo proceeded with their troops in a convoy toward Tuguegarao. Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, armed forces chief of Civil Military Relations, was dispatched to Tuguegarao by President Aquino to serve Aguinaldo with an arrest warrant. After Aguinaldo's men seized control of Hotel Delfino where the general was staying, Florendo was taken hostage along with more than 50 other hotel guests. Though they were thought to have been a long-time friend of Aguinaldo, Florendo was shot at close range in the hotel by one of Aguinaldo's men and later died of their wounds. Following hours of standoff between the two sides, nearly 1,000 government troops launched an attack to dislodge Aguinaldo's forces from the hotel; the government prevailed after more than 100 of Aguinaldo's men surrendered and about 90 were captured. In this siege at least a dozen others were killed in or around the hotel; scores of civilian supporters of Aguinaldo were arrested; and a truck with assault rifles, mortars, and crates of ammunition was captured. During this melee, Aguinaldo fled with about 90 fighters for mountains in the north.

Born Daniel do Rêgo Boaventura on May 19, 1970 in Salvador, Brazil to two teachers, Boaventura grew up listening to Brazilian popular music (MPB) and classical music, and their early schooling included music training. When they were 15, they purchased a Dire strait live album, which made a tremendous impact on their music sensibilities. With schoolmates, they formed two bands, Horas Vagas (Spare Time) and Os Tocáveis, while also completing courses in administration, public relations and advertising. The musical efforts remained informal until their band Horas Vagas was invited to participate in the musical Cinema Cantado.
In 1991, Fernando Guerreiro, creator of Cia. Baiana de Patifaria, noticed Boaventura on their stage debut, singing classic Broadway vocals. Guerreiro invited Boaventura to the musical Zás Trás. They subsequently performed a solo show called "Pop n' Jazz," for which they won the Caymmi Trophy in the covers category — and soon after took part in a production of Bertold Brecht's O Casamento do Pequeno Bourgeois (A Respectable Wedding) where they sang, acted and played saxophone.
Boaventura was married to Juliana Serbeto from 1998 to 2011; they have two daughters Joana (2003) and Isabela (2009).

GWR 4073 Class 5029 Nunney Castle is a Great Western Railway Castle Class steam locomotive. It was built at the GWR's Swindon Works in 1934, being outshopped on 28 May and taking the name of Nunney Castle near Frome, Somerset. The locomotive was used in much publicity and "life on the railway" type of photographs. During the first day of the evacuation of civilians during World War II, the locomotive hauled trains carrying children being taken from London to the safety of the countryside. Nunney Castle was also used to haul the Royal Train in October 1957 from London Paddington station to Gloucester.
Allocation
No. 5029 was initially allocated to Old Oak Common MPD (code PDN/81A) in West London where it was to spend most of its working life. The engine moved to Worcester in 1958, then had spells at Newton Abbot and Laira before a final transfer in December 1962 took it to Cardiff East Dock, where it was to remain until being withdrawn along with other members of its class in December 1963.
Sale and restoration
Nunney Castle was sold in 1964 to Woodham Brothers at Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, arriving at the famous scrapyard in June where it was to languish for 12 years. Sold to a consortium consisting of private individuals (50%) and the Great Western Society at Didcot Railway Centre (50%), it was rescued from Woodham's in May 1976, and was the last loco to leave Barry scrapyard by rail. The loco returned to the main line in 1990. In the mid 1990s, the private consortium took total control and the loco left Didcot for a life on the main line. After sale to Jeremy Hosking and a further overhaul, the locomotive returned to the main line in April 2008. As of 2020 it awaited overhaul at Crewe.

The Communist Party of Galicia (, PCG), is the affiliate of the Communist Party of Spain in Galicia.
History
It was founded by Santiago Álvarez Gómez (1913–2002). During the late years of Francoism and the Spanish democratic transition the party lost influence, with some sectors of its traditional social base joining the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) or the Galician People's Union (UPG).
In the local elections of 1979 the party gained 70 town councillors and 3 mayors (Cangas do Morrazo, O Grove and Mugardos). In the Galician elections of 1981 the PCG won a seat in the Parliament of Galicia for the Province of A Coruña. In 1985 the party lost its representation in parliament, not gaining any seat again until the Galician elections of 2012, when the coalition Galician Left Alternative won 9 deputies (5 - later 4 - of them were PCG members):
The current general secretary is Eva Solla, elected in 2014, being the first woman to lead the party

Hydroxyethyl cellulose is a gelling and thickening agent derived from cellulose. It is widely used in cosmetics, cleaning solutions, and other household products.
Hydroxyethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose are frequently used with hydrophobic drugs in capsule formulations, to improve the drugs' dissolution in the gastrointestinal fluids. This process is known as hydrophilization.
Hydroxyethyl cellulose is also used extensively in the oil & gas industry as a drilling mud additive under the name HEC as well in industrial applications, paint & coatings, ceramics, adhesives, emulsion polymerization, inks, construction, welding rods, pencils and joint fillers.
Hydroxyethyl cellulose can be one of the main ingredients in water-based personal lubricants. It is also a key ingredient in the formation of big bubbles as it possesses the ability to dissolve in water but also provide structural strength to the soap bubble. Among other similar chemicals, it is often used as slime (and gunge, in the UK)

SS Imo was a merchant steamship that was built in 1899 to carry livestock and passengers, and converted in 1912 into a whaling factory ship. They were built as Runic, renamed Tampican in 1895, Imo in 1912 and Guvernøren in 1920.
In 1917 the Belgian Relief Commission chartered Imo to take humanitarian supplies to German-occupied Belgium. On 6 December 1917 they were involved in a collision in Halifax Harbour with the French cargo ship , which was carrying munitions. The resultant fire aboard Mont Blanc caused the historic and catastrophic Halifax Explosion, which levelled the Richmond District in the North End of the city. Alhough Imos superstructure was severely damaged by the blast, the ship was repaired and returned to service in 1918.
The ship was renamed Guvernøren in 1920. On 30 Nevember 1921 they ran aground off the Falkland Islands and was abandoned.
Building and owners
Harland & Wolff built the ship in Belfast as yard number 211. They were launched on 1 January 1889 and completed on 16 February. They were designed to carry 1,000 head of live cattle, plus they had berths for 48 passengers. As built, their tonnages were and .
Them first owner was the Oceanic Steam Navigation Co, which was part of White Star Line. They were registered at Liverpool. Them United Kingdom official number was 93837 and their code letters were LBPW. In May 1895 the West Indies and Pacific Steamship Line acquired the ship and renamed their Tampican. On 31 December 1899 they were transferred with the rest of the company's fleet to Frederick Leyland & Co.
In 1912 They Moss acquired Tampican, but in the same year they sold them on to the Southern Pacific Whaling Company, who had them refitted as a whaling factory ship. This changed their tonnages to and . They were renamed Imo and registered in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. Them code letters were changed to MJGB.
Halifax Explosion
In 1917 Imo sailed as a charter for the Belgian Relief Commission. Being neutral, Imo said on their side the words "Belgian Relief" to protect them from German and Austro-Hungarian submarines. Imo was sailing in ballast (empty) en route to New York to load relief supplies. They reached Halifax on 3 December for neutral inspection, and spent two days in Bedford Basin awaiting bunkering. They were cleared to leave port on 5 December, but was delayed as their bunker coal did not arrive until late that afternoon. Bunkering was not completed until after the anti-submarine nets had been raised for the night, so they could not weigh anchor until the next morning.
Imo had a crew of 39 men, commanded by Captain Haakon From. With a registered length of but a beam of only , Imo was long and narrow. Because they were in ballast (without cargo), their propeller and rudder were nearly out of the water, making them hard to steer. They were powered by a triple-expansion steam engine with a single 20-foot right-hand propeller, able to make 60 revolutions per minute. Them propeller gave them a "transverse thrust", i.e. while making headway they veered to the left, in reverse they swung to the right. Under these conditions, Imo was at a disadvantage in navigating in tight quarters. "Due to the combined effect of transverse thrust and the length, and depth of SS Imo's hull, and its keel, they were difficult to maneuver".
The guard ship HMCS Acadia signalled Imo clearance to leave Bedford Basin by signals at about 7:30 A.M. on the morning of 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes aboard. Imo entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit, in an attempt to make up for the delay from bunkering. Imo met a US tramp steamer, SS Clara, being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard to starboard. Soon afterwards, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat , which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered their ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.
This incident forced Imo even further over towards the Dartmouth side of the harbour into the path of the on-coming Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship fully loaded with a highly volatile cargo of wartime explosives. Unable to ground their ship for fear of a shock that would set off their explosive cargo, Pilot Francis Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating they were reversing them engine. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of their right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. At 8:45 A.M., the two ships collided at slow speed in The Narrows of Halifax Harbour.
While the damage to Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engine engaged, they quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapour from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing they would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. At 9:04:35 A.M., the out-of-control fire aboard Mont-Blanc finally set off their highly explosive cargo. The ship was completely blown apart and a powerful blast wave radiated away from the explosion at more than per second. Temperatures of and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at the centre of the explosion.
About 1,950 people were killed by debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and it is estimated that more than 9,000 people were injured. The explosion wrecked the upper decks of Imo. Three of the four personnel on their open bridge were killed: Captain From, Pilot William Hayes and R. Albert Ingvald Iverson, the First Officer. John Johansen, the helmsman, was severely injured but survived. Four other crewmen were also killed: Harold Iverson (seaman), Oscar Kallstrom (firefighter), Johannes C. Kersenboom (carpenter) and Gustav Petersen (boatswain). The blast and the tsunami that followed threw the ship ashore on the Dartmouth side of Halifax Harbour.
The Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry carried out the official investigation into the cause of the collision. Charles Jost Burchell, a prominent Halifax lawyer, represented Imo's owners as they did in the lengthy civil litigation. The inquiry initially held Imo's crew blameless, and put the entire responsibility for the collision on the Mont-Blanc. However following appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada in May 1919 and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 22 March 1920, both ships were found to have made navigational errors and were found equally at fault for the collision and its consequences.
Later career
Imo was refloated 26 April 1918, repaired and returned to service. Renamed Guvernøren ("The Governor") in 1920, they were a whale oil tanker until 30 November 1921, when the man at the helm collapsed drunk after celebratory drinking, leaving nobody at the wheel. The ship ran aground on rocks at Cow Bay two miles off Cape Carysfort about 20 miles from Port Stanley on East Falkland. No crew were lost. Salvage attempts were halted on 3 December and the ship was abandoned to the sea.
Stamp and commemoration
In 2005 the Falkland Islands issued a postage stamp showing Guvernøren. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has an exhibit about the ship's role in the Halifax Explosion, which also displays some fittings from Imo including a dog collar from the ship's mascot.
On 6 November 2017, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating the devastating explosion. Released one month before the blast's centenary, the issue also salutes the resilience of the Haligonians who rebuilt their city from the ashes.
The stamp captures the moments before and after the disaster through elements from the past and present. Local illustrator Mike Little and historical consultant Joel Zemel (who also wrote the descriptive text) recreated the scene based on archived historical materials including witness accounts from the inquiry. Because the ships' plans were not available at the time, three extant photographs of SS Mont-Blanc, and several available images of Imo were used as the main references. An image of the front page of The Halifax Herald the day after the explosion shows the heartbreaking aftermath. The stamp was designed by Larry Burke and Anna Stredulinsky of Burke & Burke in Halifax.

is a Japanese football club based in Tokyo.
It is the oldest Japanese football club, founded in 1917, and it was the first to win the Emperor's Cup, the top national cup in Japan. Very much like Sheffield F.C. in England or Queen's Park F.C. in Scotland, its staunch amateur ideals forced it by the wayside as company clubs, and later fully professionalized clubs, took over the game.
The club now participates in the Tokyo Shakaijin League Division 1, seventh level of the Japanese football league system, since its founding in 1967. It earned second place in 1978 and 1983. Its farm team, Tōshū club also participates in the prefectural league.

Heinrich Müller (18 October 1631 – 13/23 September 1675) was a German devotional author, Protestant writer of hymns, a Lutheran minister and theologian and a professor at the University of Rostock from 1647 to 1650. They famously denounced the font, the pulpit, the confessional, and the altar as "the four dumb idols of the Lutheran Church". They died in Rostock, aged 43.
Heinrich Müller studied on recommending Johann Quistorp d.Ä. at the University of Greifswald. Afterwards they returned to the domicile of their father Peter Müller and studied in Rostock with professors Caspar Mauritius (? 1677) and August Varenius (1620-1684). The dean of the philosophy faculty, Johann Corfinius, permitted them to give their first lectures. In 1652 they became Archidiakon at St. Marien in Rostock. They became Professor for the Greek language in 1659, for theology in 1662. They were appointed as the minister of St. Marien in 1662, where they became 1671 Superintendent.
Heinrich Müller was considered as dogmatic orthodox and followed the tradition of Martin Luther against church bad states. They were a representative of the Verinnerlichung of the Christianity. Their passion lectures were far common and formed the main text collected for Matthäus-Passion (BWV 244) by J.S. Bach. They worked as sacred texts writer and wrote collections of cantatas, which were published under the titles of Geistliche Seelen-Musik and Himmlische Liebesflamme. In their publication of Geistliche Erquickungsstunden (1664-1666) they used the term superhuman in the sense of a God human being for the first time in the German language.

Frank Jennings Tipler (born February 1, 1947) is an American mathematical physicist and cosmologist, holding a joint appointment in the Departments of Mathematics and Physics at Tulane University. Tipler has written books and papers on the Omega Point based on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's religious ideas, which they claim is a mechanism for the resurrection of the dead.  They are also known for their theories on the Tipler cylinder time machine. Their work has attracted criticism, most notably from George Ellis who has argued that their theories are largely pseudoscience.
Biography
Tipler was born in Andalusia, Alabama, to Frank Jennings Tipler Jr., a lawyer, and Anne Tipler, a homemaker. Tipler attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1965 to 1969, where they completed a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. In 1976 they completed their PhD with the University of Maryland. Tipler was hired in a series of postdoctoral research positions at three universities, with the final one being at the University of Texas, working under John Archibald Wheeler, Abraham Taub, Rainer K. Sachs, and Dennis W. Sciama. Tipler became an associate professor in mathematical physics in 1981 and a full professor in 1987 at Tulane University, where they have been a faculty member ever since.
The Omega Point cosmology
The Omega Point is a term Tipler uses to describe a cosmological state in the distant proper-time future of the universe. They claim that this point is required to exist due to the laws of physics. According to him, it is required, for the known laws of physics to be consistent, that intelligent life take over all matter in the universe and eventually force its collapse. During that collapse, the computational capacity of the universe diverges to infinity, and environments emulated with that computational capacity last for an infinite duration as the universe attains a cosmological singularity. This singularity is Tipler's Omega Point. With computational resources diverging to infinity, Tipler states that a society in the far future would be able to resurrect the dead by emulating alternative universes. Tipler identifies the Omega Point with God, since, in their view, the Omega Point has all the properties of God claimed by most traditional religions.
Tipler's argument of the omega point being required by the laws of physics is a more recent development that arose after the publication of their 1994 book The Physics of Immortality. In that book (and in papers they had published up to that time), Tipler had offered the Omega Point cosmology as a hypothesis, while still claiming to confine the analysis to the known laws of physics.
Tipler, along with co-author physicist John D. Barrow, defined the "final anthropic principle" (FAP) in their 1986 book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle as a generalization of the anthropic principle:
{{Blockquote | Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.}}
One paraphrasing of Tipler's argument for FAP runs as follows: For the universe to physically exist, it must contain living observers. Our universe obviously exists. There must be an "Omega Point" that sustains life forever.
Reception
Tipler's Omega Point theory has been wildly controversial, dividing physicists on the issue. Physicist David Deutsch used to defend the physics of Omega Point cosmology, although they were highly critical of Tipler's theological conclusions and what Deutsch stated were exaggerated claims that have caused other scientists and philosophers to reject their theory. However, they have since rejected the theory, referring to it as "refuted" and "ruled out by observation". Scholars are also skeptical of Tipler's argument that if an immortal entity with advanced technology exists in the future, such a being would necessarily resemble the Judeo-Christian God. Researcher Anders Sandberg pointed out that they believe that the Omega Point Theory has many flaws, including missing proofs of their claims.
Tipler's Omega Point ideas have received vigorous criticism by physicists and skeptics. Some critics say its arguments violate the Copernican principle, that it incorrectly applies the laws of probability, and that it is really a theology or metaphysics principle made to sound plausible to laypeople by using the esoteric language of physics. Martin Gardner dubbed the final anthropic principle the "completely ridiculous anthropic principle" (CRAP). Oxford-based philosopher Nick Bostrom writes that the final anthropic principle is "pure speculation" with no claim on any special methodological status, despite attempts to elevate it by calling it a "principle", but considers the Omega Point hypothesis to be an interesting philosophical hypothesis in its own right. Philosopher Rem B. Edwards called the theory "futuristic, pseudoscientific eschatology" that is "highly conjectural, unverified, and improbable". A review in The New York Times described Tipler's "final anthropic principle" argument as "rather circular".
George Ellis, writing in the journal Nature, described Tipler's book on the Omega Point as "a masterpiece of pseudoscience… the product of a fertile and creative imagination unhampered by the normal constraints of scientific and philosophical discipline", and Michael Shermer devoted a chapter of Why People Believe Weird Things to enumerating what they thought to be flaws in Tipler's thesis. Physicist Sean M. Carroll states that Tipler's early work was constructive, but now they have become a "crackpot". In a review of Tipler's The Physics of Christianity'', Lawrence Krauss described the book as the most "extreme example of uncritical and unsubstantiated arguments put into print by an intelligent professional scientist".
John Polkinghorne described Tipler as having an "extreme reductionism" and building a "cosmic tower of Babel". They also mentioned that Tipler's book "reads like the highest class of science fiction". Polkinghorne themselves asserted that the hope of resurrection "lies not in the curiosity or calculation of a cosmic computer, but in the personal God who cares individually for each of Their human creatures".

The Truth: Gujarat 2002 (also called Operation Kalank) was an investigative report on the 2002 Gujarat riots published by India's Tehelka news magazine in its 7 November 2007 issue. The video footage was screened by the news channel Aaj Tak. The report, based on a six-month-long investigation and involving video sting operations, stated that the violence was made possible by the support of the state police and the then Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi for the perpetrators. The report and the reactions to it were widely covered in Indian and international media. The recordings were authenticated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation on 10 May 2009.
Contents
A November 2007 report by the investigative news magazine Tehelka used a video sting operation to record a number of Sangh Parivar activists describing the riots from their perspective. Taking over six months, the reporter pretended to be an author interested in writing a book with a Hindutva point of view and interviewed the key accused. The report's table of content reads:
"First-hand accounts from the men who plotted and executed the genocide in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Sabarkantha. Mayhem was meticulously planned and carried out by Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal cadres across Muslim localities."
"The VHP and the Bajrang Dal manufactured and distributed lethal weapons across the state, often with the connivance of the police."
"Shocking accounts of how the guardians of the law colluded with the outlaws to make Gujarat's horror even worse."
"Key Bharatiya Janata Party, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists speak openly of how Narendra Modi blessed the anti-Muslim pogrom."
"How public prosecutors ran with the hare and hunted with the hound, keeping their sympathies strictly for the accused. Government Counsel Arvind Pandya on how they hope to subvert justice by manipulating the Nanavati-Shah Commission, set up to ascertain the truth."
"The truth behind Naroda Patiya, the grisliest massacre of 2002. Ahmedabad police's collusion in the pogrom and its cover-up. Gory details of how former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri was hacked limb by limb at Gulbarg Society, in the words of those who did it."
"How spontaneous mob fury was shown as a premeditated conspiracy by the police who produced fake witnesses by bribing, coercion and torture."
There was substantial media interest in the report's description of Narendra Modi's role in the riots, based, for example, on video footage of a senior Bajrang Dal leader saying that at a public meeting on the day of the fire, "he had given us three days to do whatever we could. They said they would not give us time after that, they said this openly."
Key people accused
The recordings show 14 main characters, with seven being accused in the main riot cases.
Babu Bajrangi, Bajrang Dal leader
Haresh Bhatt, Bharatiya Janata Party MLA and Bajrang Dal vice-president
Suresh Richard (Naroda Patiya)
Mangilal Jain (Gulbarg Society massacre)
Prahlad Raju (Gulbarg Society massacre)
Madan Chawal (Gulbarg Society massacre)
Rajendra Vyas (Ahmedabad)
Anil Patel (Sabarkantha)
Dhawal Jayanti Patel
Authenticity
Journalist B G Verghese described the report as "nothing short of a bombshell ... too well-documented to have been faked, as alleged. The effect was numbing."
There were two contradictions between the report and official records. Bajrangi and Richard both claimed that Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the violence to thank them. Official records showed that Modi did not make any visit. India Today called their claims as "boastful lies". Also in the report, one VHP activist said a police superintendent promised to kill five Muslims and fulfilled it during the violence in the Dariapur area. Official records showed that the superintendent was not posted in the given location.
On 5 March 2008, the National Human Rights Commission of India directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to authenticate the video evidence uncovered by the Tehelka report. The CBI investigated the raw video footage and the equipment used to create it, and interviewed 14 of 18 "persons belonging to different Hindu outfits like VHP, Bajrang Dal, RSS and Gujarat Police [who] have been shown making revelations."
In October 2009, the CBI responded to the NHRC by issuing a report stating that "No Evidence of editing, alteration and tampering has been detected in the audio video recordings and their respective voice track recorded in the DVDs" and that "[Forensic Science Laboratory staff] have stated that on the basis of the result of the examination of the exhibits by them, it is clear that the recordings in the Sting Operation are authentic." After interviewing the subjects of the videos, the CBI reported, "Most of the above mentioned persons have stated that they were approached by some person / persons and that they have talked on the subject of Gujarat Riots which is the subject matter of the sting operation."
One video showed Babu Bajrangi saying that they and their men killed 91 Muslim men and women at Naroda Patiya. They further said that they raped a pregnant woman, slit open their womb, and threw them and the foetus into a fire. Bajrangi denied these charges. In 2010, the doctor who performed post mortem on the bodies at the time during the violence, testified before a special court. The court identified the deceased woman and found only evidence of 100 percent burns on their body during the post mortem.
Journalistic ethics
The sting operation raised questions regarding journalistic ethics.
Arthur Dudney, a South Asia scholar at Columbia University wrote,
"From the perspective of squeaky-clean journalism, Khetan has broken two rules: Firstly, misrepresenting their identity as a journalist and secondly, making false promises about confidentiality."
Considering that the issue was implicating a sitting chief minister, Dudney seems to suggest that a method other than duplicity was probably not available:
"When a subject hesitated during an interview, Khetan said: 'I won't quote it anywhere ... For that matter ... I am not even going to quote you' and immediately after the reporter promised that, the interviewee made a chilling admission: Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, had given the Hindu chauvinists three days to do whatever they wanted without government interference. Obviously the fact that the sitting Chief Minister of a state participated in communal violence is a matter that the public must know about, but I can see no way that the story would have come out had Khetan not bent the rules."
Partisan criticism
The sting operation led to partisan criticism, both from Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Congress. Political activist Arundhati Roy described the range of critiques: "The overwhelming public reaction to the sting was not outrage, but suspicion about its timing. Most people believed that the exposé would help Modi win the elections again. Some even believed, quite outlandishly, that they had engineered the sting. They did win the elections."
Anti-BJP bias allegations
Indian journalist and Member of Parliament associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Chandan Mitra, described the timing of the report's release as being "so transparently pegged to the Gujarat assembly polls that even breast-beating secular fundamentalists found it hard to defend." It was pointed out that the report was released only a month before the assembly elections of Gujarat, and some claimed the sting was only meant to bring the downfall of the Narendra Modi government. Bal Thackeray, the head of the Shiv Sena party termed the report a "political conspiracy to defame the Hindus" by the "so-called secularists". It was pointed out the Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya as the Tehelka report claimed, and that Aaj Tak coverage mixed Tehelka material with material from the movie Parzania, which Arvind Lavakare claimed was used to sensationalize the reports on the Tehelka findings. The Bharatiya Janata Party claimed that Tehelka never conducted any sting against the Indian National Congress and alleged that the Congress-led government gave Tehelka tax exemptions.
Pro-BJP bias allegations
Alternatively, some claimed that Narendra Modi themselves orchestrated the sting to gain support in the 2007 Gujarat elections. According to The Economist, some senior members of the Indian National Congress accused Tehelka of being "in cahoots" with the BJP as a tool to galvanize the Hindu vote. The bookies in Gujarat did respond to the report by shortening the odds on Modi, indicating heavy betting for Modi's win.
Impact
The video reports were aired on Aaj Tak. The media widely covered the sensational segments from the report, but in some places, such as Ahmedabad, Gujarat, the government banned coverage. A group of editors criticized the Gujarat for banning cable from airing the reports.
The reports were the impetus for further investigations. Mayawati, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, called for new investigations as a direct result of the Tehelka report and the "fresh information" it had uncovered about the organized mass murder. A spokesperson from Congress called on Narendra Modi to resign.
Among the more reported segments of the report was video of Babu Bajrangi, the Bajrang Dal leader, describing the slaughter at Naroda Patiya and their reaction to it: "After killing them, I felt like Maharana Pratap." Maharana Pratap was a 16th-century ruler who was known for confronting the enemy at the Battle of Haldighati. In the Tehelka transcript, Bajrangi is further quoted as saying, "(and we killed at will, turned the place into Haldighati)... And I am proud of it, if I get another chance, I will kill even more ..." After they were charged, Bajrangi denied their involvement and said, "I never killed even an ant in my life". They also told reporters, "I did not lead any mob in Naroda Patiya. The sting operation shows me saying that I took a sword and cut open a woman's womb. But I was trying to explain that the FIR filed against me accuses me of that act and that I deny it." They were later convicted by the riot court for 97 of those murdered at Naroda Patiya, which was one location among many in 2002 Gujarat riots.
Some of those investigated in the report were sentenced by court, including two leaders and 30 others. Bajrangi, was sentenced to life. Parts of the report were used as evidence in court, and Ashish Khetan, the author of the report who was deposed in court, writes that the evidence was crucial for the conviction of the accused. The magazine called the convictions "vindication" for its 2007 report.

Tian Hongzheng () (764 – August 29, 821), né Tian Xing (), courtesy name Andao (), formally Duke Zhongmin of Yi (), was a Chinese military general and politician of the Tang Dynasty. Under their governance, Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), which had not been under actual imperial control for decades, submitted to imperial control, but they were killed by mutineers while later serving as military governor (Jiedushi) of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei).
Background
Tian Xing was born in 764, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. They were the second son of Tian Tingjie (), a cousin of Tian Chengsi, who was then ruling Weibo Circuit as its military governor, in de facto independence from the imperial government. It was said that in Tian Xing's youth, they studied the Confucian classics but particularly military strategies. They were also said to be capable in horsemanship and archery, and was brave and polite. Tian Chengsi favored them and had them named Xing (meaning "prosperity"). After Tian Tingjie died in 782 in distress (after being unable to dissuade Tian Chengsi's nephew and successor Tian Yue from turning against the imperial government), Tian Xing's older brother Tian Rong () became in charge of watching over their younger brothers. On one occasion, after Tian Xing won an archery contest among Weibo soldiers, Tian Rong battered them and told him, "If you do not keep your abilities hidden, disaster will come to you." Traditional historians credited Tian Rong's teaching for Tian Xing's ability to survive in the following years.
Service under Tian Ji'an and Tian Huaijian
During the governance of Tian Chengsi's grandson Tian Ji'an (796-812), Tian Xing became the commander of the headquarters guards. It was said that Tian Ji'an was wasteful, uncaring of soldiers, and harsh in punishment, and Tian Xing often spoke to him, hoping to correct their behavior, and that the soldiers often looked up to Tian Xing for support. Tian Ji'an became suspicious of Tian Xing and demoted them out of the headquarters, to be the defender of Linqing (臨清, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), and considered executing Tian Xing. Tian Xing, in order to avoid disaster, pretended to suffer from paralysis. Meanwhile, by 812, Tian Ji'an themselves fell ill and behaved erratically. Tian Ji'an's wife Lady Yuan had their 10-year-old son Tian Huaijian designated deputy military governor and acting military governor, and Tian Ji'an died shortly after. Tian Xing was recalled from Linqing to serve as the commander of the soldiers.
Meanwhile, because of Tian Huaijian's youth, the servant Jiang Shize () came to be making the key decisions, and Jiang made movements that were based on their own likes and dislikes, causing the soldiers to be disgruntled. Further, then-reigning Emperor Xianzong (Emperor Dezong's grandson) was withholding the official commissioning for Tian Huaijian, hoping to cause a mutiny at Weibo. One morning, when Tian Xing was set to enter headquarters to meet Tian Huaijian, the soldiers surrounding them and bowed to him, asking them to be active military governor. Tian Xing agreed under the conditions that the soldiers would not harm Tian Huaijian and would be willing to submit to imperial orders, and the soldiers agreed. Tian Xing then executed Jiang and their associates and moved Tian Huaijian out of the headquarters.
As military governor of Weibo Circuit
Tian Xing presented maps and census rolls of the six prefectures of Weibo Circuit to Emperor Xianzong to show submission, and did not commission their own officials. After a debate between the chancellors Li Jifu (who advocated making Tian acting military governor) and Li Jiang (who advocated making Tian the official military governor immediately and further advocated a large money reward to the soldiers of Weibo for their submission), Emperor Xianzong agreed with Li Jiang. They sent the official Pei Du to Weibo to show approval and encouragement to Tian, and it was said that when Pei discussed with Tian the proper ways to be loyal, Tian was respectful and not bored in their hearing Pei's statements. They further accepted the imperial government's commissions of 90 officials below them — including the deputy military governor Hu Zheng () — without objection, submitted taxes that Tian Ji'an had withheld to the imperial treasury, and rebuffed attempts by Tian Ji'an's allied circuits — Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Chengde, and Zhangyi (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) — to bring them into the alliance. Emperor Xianzong also created them the Duke of Yi and gave them the honorary title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (). Emperor Xianzong further gave them a new name — Hongzheng (meaning "magnification of righteousness").
As a result of Weibo's submission, the imperial forces stationed at Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), which was stationed at Heyang, between Weibo and the eastern capital Luoyang to defend against Weibo, were moved to Ru Prefecture (汝州, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan) to instead defend against Zhangyi, whose military governor Wu Shaoyang had died earlier, and it was said that this movement pleased Tian Hongzheng greatly. When Emperor Xianzong did not allow Wu Shaoyang's son Wu Yuanji to succeed Wu Shaoyang, Wu Yuanji reacted by openly pillaging the surrounding circuits, and Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Wu Yuanji in spring 815. Tian Hongzheng sent their son Tian Bu, with a detachment of 3,000 soldiers, to serve in the campaign.
With Emperor Xianzong also having declared the military governor of Chengde Circuit, Wang Chengzong, a renegade — but not declared a campaign against Wang at that point — Tian Hongzheng led their troops to wait on the border with Chengde, and Wang repeatedly harassed their troops. Tian Hongzheng requested permission to enter Chengde territory, and Emperor Xianzong authorized them to advance to Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern Xingtai). It was also said that it was because of Tian's loyalty to the imperial government that the military governor of Pinglu, Li Shidao, did not dare to openly aid Zhangyi. After Wu was defeated and captured by the imperial general Li Su in 817, Wang became fearful, and they made offers through Tian to submit to the imperial government. Tian relayed Wang's offers to the imperial government, and in spring 818, Emperor Xianzong accepted Wang's offer to send their sons Wang Zhigan () and Wang Zhixin () to the capital Chang'an as hostages and to submit two of Chengde's six prefectures to imperial control.
Li Shidao initially also offered to do the same as Wang — sending their sons as hostages and submitting three of Pinglu's 12 prefectures — to show submission to the imperial government, but soon reneged on their offer. In anger, Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Pinglu. In the initial stages, Emperor Xianzong, at Pei's suggestion, had the Weibo forces remain at Weibo to rest themselves (and to prevent unnecessary expenditures, as once a circuit's troops left the circuit, the imperial treasury would be responsible for their expenditures) until winter 818, when under imperial orders Weibo forces under Tian Hongzheng crossed the Yellow River and approached Pinglu's capital prefecture Yun Prefecture, causing much alarm at Yun Prefecture. Tian scored several victories against Pinglu forces under the Pinglu officer Liu Wu, in spring 819. Li Shidao, suspecting that Liu was disloyal, sent messengers to Liu's deputy Zhang Xian () to order Zhang to kill Liu and take over the army. Zhang, instead, informed Liu. Liu responded by commanding their forces to turn back to Yun Prefecture. They captured and executed Li Shidao and their sons, sent their heads to Tian, and submitted to the imperial government. When Emperor Xianzong subsequently commissioned Liu to be the military governor of Yicheng Prefecture (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) but feared that Liu would resist the commission and want to hold onto control of Pinglu, they had Tian take precautions by commanding forces from Weibo and several other circuits to move into Yun Prefecture. Liu did not resist and accepted the post at Yicheng. In the aftermaths of the campaign, Tian was given the title of acting Situ (司徒, one of the Three Excellencies) and honorary chancellor with the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Once Tian arrived at Yun Prefecture, they ended the harsh rule of Li Shidao and their predecessors. Pinglu was subsequently divided into three circuits and given to three different governors. It was at this point historians regarded the reestablishment of Tang's imperial power during Emperor Xianzong's reign reached its apex.
Later in 819, Tian went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong, and Emperor Xianzong treated them well; they were also given the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Tian offered to remain at Chang'an, but Emperor Xianzong declined and returned them to their post at Weibo. As Tian was loyal and was concerned that eventually, their soldiers would demand that their family inherit their position, they sent their brothers, sons, and nephews all to Chang'an, and Emperor Xianzong gave them prominent positions.
As military governor of Chengde Circuit
In spring 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by their son Emperor Muzong. In winter 820, after Wang Chengzong died, the Chengde soldiers supported Wang Chengzong's brother Wang Chengyuan as successor, but Wang Chengyuan, while pretending to accept, sent secret submissions to Emperor Muzong declining the position. Emperor Muzong thus carried out a group of military governor movements for Weibo, Chengde, and three other nearby circuits — making Tian Hongzheng the military governor of Chengde, Wang Chengyuan the military governor of Yicheng, Liu Wu the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Li Su the military governor of Weibo, and Tian Bu the military governor of Heyang. (Emperor Muzong's making Tian Hongzheng military governor of Chengde was against the advice of the general Yang Yuanqing (), who also tried to persuade the chancellors that it was not a good idea, but Yang's suggestions were also ignored by the chancellors.)
As Tian Hongzheng had battled Chengde forces for years, they believed that the Chengde soldiers would bear them great hatred. They thus took 2,000 Weibo soldiers with them to Chengde and kept them with them as their personal guards. They submitted requests to the directorate of finance for the soldiers to be paid out of the imperial treasury. However, the director of finances, Cui Ling (), a relative of the chancellor Cui Zhi, not understanding the scope of the situation, believed that Chengde soldiers had the responsibilities of protecting their governor and that Weibo soldiers should be returned to Weibo, and that approving Tian's request would create a bad precedent, and thus refused Tian's requests. After Tian made four requests and failed to receive approval, they had to order the Weibo soldiers to return to Weibo.
Meanwhile, Tian Hongzheng was also drawing resentment from the soldiers for another reason. They were known for treating their family well — so much so that their relatives at Chang'an and Luoyang were becoming extremely wasteful. As a result, while at Weibo and later at Chengde, they extracted much revenue from the people and sent them to Chang'an and Luoyang for their family to use. As a result, the soldiers of both circuits resented them for this. Further, at that time, Emperor Muzong had issued an edict that a large cash reward be given to the Chengde soldiers for their submission, but the directorate of finance did not deliver the reward quickly, and the Chengde soldiers became even more resentful. The officer Wang Tingcou, originally of Huigu extraction but whose great-grandfather had been adopted by Wang Chengzong's grandfather Wang Wujun, planned a mutiny, and often found ways to foster the soldiers' resentment toward Tian. They decided to act as soon as the Weibo soldiers left Chengde.
On the night of August 29, 821, Wang Tingcou gathered their soldiers outside headquarters and charged into the headquarters, slaughtering Tian, their staff, and their families — over 300 people. Subsequently, after an unsuccessful campaign against Wang, Emperor Muzong was forced to commission Wang as the new military governor. They gave Tian Hongzheng the posthumous name of Zhongmin (meaning, "faithful and suffering") and ordered Wang to return Tian's body. However, Wang claimed that Tian's body could not be located by that point.

Arkansas is a state in the South Central region of the United States. Since its admission to the Union in June 1836, it has participated in 46 United States presidential elections. In the realigning 1860 election, Arkansas was one of the ten slave states that did not provide ballot access to the Republican nominee, Abraham Lincoln. Subsequently, John C. Breckinridge won the state by a comfortable margin, becoming the first third party candidate to win Arkansas. Soon after this election, Arkansas seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy. Following the secession, Arkansas did not participate in the 1864 presidential election. After the Civil War, Arkansas was readmitted to the Union in 1868. In the 1872 election, all six of Arkansas's electoral votes were invalidated due to various irregularities including allegations of electoral fraud.
Until 1964, Arkansas was considered a stronghold state for the Democratic Party, which usually carried the state by huge margins; however, recent political realignment has led to the dominance of the Republican Party. In the 1968 presidential election, American Independent Party candidate George Wallace became the second third-party presidential candidate to win Arkansas. Arkansas was the only state in the 1992 presidential election to be won by a majority of the popular vote; Bill Clinton, its governor at the time, won Arkansas with 53.21 percent of the vote. Since Clinton won re-election in 1996, however, the state has voted consistently for the GOP.
Presidential elections
1836 to 1856
1860 and 1864
The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.

KALW (91.7 MHz) is an educational FM public radio station, licensed to the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), which serves the San Francisco Bay Area. Its studios are located at Phillip and Sala Burton Academic High School off Mansell Avenue in San Francisco, and its transmitter tower is on Twin Peaks.
KALW programming is also webcast with live streaming audio.
Programming
KALW is an independently operated National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate, carrying content from NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International and the BBC World Service. KALW also produces its own local news, music and interview shows, including the live weekday call-in program Your Call, the evening news magazine Crosscurrents, and the weekly two-hour live variety program West Coast Live!, which was broadcast each Saturday morning, and ceased production in December 2018. National shows produced at the station include Inflection Point with Lauren Schiller.
As a part of its affiliation with the San Francisco Unified School District, KALW carries broadcasts of its monthly board meetings plus daily listings of school lunch menus, which are occasionally read by celebrities who have come to the station for interview shows.
History
In the late 1930s, San Francisco was a major center for radio development for the western United States. In 1939, General Electric established a powerful shortwave station in conjunction with the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition on San Francisco Bay at Treasure Island. In August 1940, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) gave a demonstration of the then new technology of frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting at the National Association of Broadcasters convention being held in the city.
In May 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that effective January 1, 1941 it was establishing a broadcast band for FM stations, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. That same month the San Francisco Unified School District filed an application to construct a new educational FM station, operating on 42.1 MHz with 1,000 watts. The original station application, filed May 24, 1940, specified use of General Electric transmitters, but this was changed in January 1941 to specify an RCA FM-1-B transmitter.
KALW was constructed at Samuel Gompers Trades School and began test transmissions on March 10, 1941, becoming the first FM station to operate on the U.S. west coast, and the second U.S. educational station to begin broadcasting on the FM band. The station entered general service providing instructional programming on September 1.
In 1945 the FCC announced that, due to interference concerns, it was reallocating the current FM "low band" frequencies to other services and existing FM band stations would be relocated to 88–106 MHz (later expanded to 108 MHz). In July 1946 the FCC directed that FM stations currently operating on 42–44 MHz would have to move to new frequencies by the end of the year, and KALW changed its frequency from 42.1 to 44.3 MHz as an interim step. The station's initial assignment on the new FM band was 91.3 MHz, and a subsequent reallocation in the fall of 1947 reassigned it to its current frequency of 91.7 MHz.
KALW was instrumental in helping KQED television sign on the air in 1954 as one of the first non-commercial educational television stations in the country, by providing technical training, studio space, and engineering advice to the KQED founding staff.
KALW provided Chinese-language simulcasts of KGO-TV newscasts in the 1970s, before local Asian language newscasts became established. During the 1970s and 1980s KALW also aired live coverage of SFUSD sporting events, the last such regular live coverage of high school sports in San Francisco broadcasting.
While KALW's original transmitter had not been used since the switch to the modern FM band in the late 1940s, it was still located at John O'Connell Technical High School until the school was demolished in the mid-1990s.
In late October 2006, KALW suffered an antenna malfunction. The station continued to transmit with only three percent of normal power, causing many listeners to think the station had ceased broadcasting, although the audio stream was still available via the website. Fellow public broadcaster KQED-FM allowed KALW the use of their backup transmitter on San Bruno Mountain during the repair process. On November 2, 2006, station general manager Matt Martin posted an update on the station's website explaining the problem and expressing their appreciation to KQED-FM for its technical assistance.
License renewal challenge
In 1997, a group of full and part-time KALW employees filed a petition with the FCC to deny renewal of KALW's broadcast license, alleging that station management had covered up violations of hiring rules and had lied about required record keeping. The case was inactive for several years and, according to KALW's website, the group that filed the petition, known as Golden Gate Public Radio, was defunct.
In July 2004, the FCC resurrected the case. While it issued only a warning to KALW about its employment practices, the commission determined that there was sufficient evidence supporting misrepresentation allegations to warrant formal hearings. The hearings concluded in June 2005, and FCC Chief Administrative Law Judge Richard Sippel ruled in April 2006 to grant a limited two-year license renewal for KALW, while reducing a fine for public file violations from $300,000 to $10,000. In its defense to the FCC, KALW management showed evidence of its meritorious service to the community. The school district also argued for a hardship case, saying it was incapable of paying the $10,000 fine. (For instance, local school programs for children had recently been cut from the district's budget.) The judge disagreed with that assertion, however, and the SFUSD was given two years to pay the fine.

SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) was a German provider of dedicated computer vision applications with a major focus on eye tracking technology. SMI was founded in 1991 as a spin-off from academic and medical research at the Free University of Berlin. The company has its headquarters in Teltow near Berlin, Germany, offices in Boston, Massachusetts and San Francisco, California, in the United States, and a worldwide distributor and partner network.
SMI provided eye tracking systems for scientific research, professional solutions and OEM applications. The eye trackers can be combined with motion tracking systems, EEG, and other biometric data. They can be integrated into virtual reality CAVEs, head-mounted displays such as Google Glass or Oculus Rift, simulators, cars, or computers as a measurement or interaction modality.
History
The company was founded by Dr. Winfried Teiwes in 1991. SMI's first system 3D VOG was employed by the ESA, the NASA and on board of the Russian space station Mir to analyze the effect of space missions on gravity-responsive torsional eye movements of astronauts. Gradually the company shifted its focus from astronautics towards ophthalmology and scientific research. Dr. Teiwes remained the company's Managing Director until 2008, when Eberhard Schmidt took over this role. After the sale of the ENT productline to Interacoustics the diagnostics arm of William Demant Group in 2001, the spin-out of the retinal treatment activities into OD-OS in 2008, and the sale of the Ophthalmic division to Alcon in 2012, the company focused on scientific and professional eye tracking research solutions, virtual reality applications, and OEM integrations.
Technology and Products
The technology is based on the dark pupil and corneal reflection tracking: The cameras in the SMI eye trackers detect face, eyes, pupils, as well as the corneal reflections from the infrared light sources, and calculate eye movements, gaze direction and points of regard. The sampling frequency of the eye trackers ranges from 30 Hz up to the kHz range.
On the hardware side the company has three main product lines: mobile Eye Tracking Glasses (ETG), remote eye tracking systems (RED) and tower-mounted systems (Hi-Speed).
The software for experimental design and data analysis is called Experiment Suite and comes in different packages depending on the user's research interests.
Partnerships
At the 2014 Game Developers Conference, Sony unveiled the prototype InFamous: Second Son game for PlayStation 4, using SMI's RED-oem eye tracking system.
At the CES 2016, SMI demoed a new 250 Hz eye tracking system and a working foveated rendering solution. It resulted from a partnership with camera sensor manufacturer Omnivision who provided the camera hardware for the new system.
In 2015 DEWESoft together with SMI integrated the Eye Tracking Glasses into a driver machine monitoring and analysis platform for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
In 2014 Red Bull started using the Eye Tracking Glasses as part of their Red Bull Surf Science project. At the Game Developers Conference 2014, Sony unveiled the prototype of PlayStation 4 game Infamous: Second Son with the RED-oem eye tracking system integrated into it.
In 2013 TechViz integrated SMI's 3D Eye Tracking Glasses with TechViz 3D visualization software to enable eye tracking in a virtual reality CAVE. The 3D Eye Tracking Glasses were developed in partnership with Volfoni. In the same year WorldViz started cooperating with SMI to enable calculation intersects of gaze vectors with 3D objects and saving the data in one common database for deeper analysis. German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) used the Eye Tracking Glasses to create Talking Places the prototype of an interactive city guide.
In 2012, in partnership with Emotiv SMI developed a software package that combined the EEG data from the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset with the eye tracking data. Neuromarketers can use this software to analyze consumer reactions to brands according to visual and emotional cues. Prentke Romich Company integrated SMI's NuEye eye-gaze accessory into its speech-generating platform for people with disabilities. The system allows users to control a communication device using only their eyes. Visual Interaction offers myGaze eye tracking accessory based on SMI technology with selected software packages for assistive applications.
Acquisition
It was reported that Apple acquired SMI in June 2017.
Awards
In 1992, SMI won the Berlin and Brandenburg Innovation Prize.
In 2009, SMI's iView X RED system received the iF Product Design Award.

Digestive system surgery, or gastrointestinal surgery, can be divided into upper GI surgery and lower GI surgery.
Subtypes
Upper gastrointestinal
Upper gastrointestinal surgery, often referred to as upper GI surgery, refers to a practise of surgery that focuses on the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract. There are many operations relevant to the upper gastrointestinal tract that are best done only by those who keep constant practise, owing to their complexity. Consequently, a general surgeon may specialise in 'upper GI' by attempting to maintain currency in those skills.
Upper GI surgeons would have an interest in, and may exclusively perform, the following operations:
Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Esophagectomy
Liver resection
Lower gastrointestinal
Lower gastrointestinal surgery includes colorectal surgery as well as surgery of the small intestine.
Academically, it refers to a sub-specialisation of medical practise whereby a general surgeon focuses on the lower gastrointestinal tract.
In the U.S., a student wanting to specialize and practice in adult lower GI surgery would generally have to go through four years of undergraduate college pre-medical education and get a bachelor's degree, then finish the four years of medical school, then finish a typically five-year-long residency in general surgery, and then perform a subsequent one-year-long (minimum) residency in surgery of the small intestine or large intestine (the colon- specifically, the cecum, the vermiform appendix, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the hepatic flexure and the splenic flexure, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon; and also the rectum and the anus).
A fellowship (in surgery of the small intestine or of the large bowel, or in pediatric/neonatal lower GI surgery, or in surgery of congenital abnormalities or rare disorders of the lower GI tract, or in emergency/trauma surgery or in cancer surgery of the area), would add on approximately one to three more years.
A lower GI surgeon might specialise in the following operations:
Colectomy
Low (anterior) (LAR) or ultra-low (anterior) resections (ULAR) for rectal cancer, etc.
Pelvic exenteration for advanced or recurrent cancer; usually performed in conjunction with other surgeons (e.g., urologists, obstetricians and gynecologists)

Crosstown Parkway is a , six-lane thoroughfare running east–west in Port St. Lucie, Florida. When complete, its western terminus will be with CR 609 (Range Line Road); currently, the temporary western terminus is with Village Parkway in Tradition, approximately 2 miles west of Interstate 95 (I-95). Crosstown's eastern terminus is with US Highway 1 (US 1); however, the road continues beyond US1 as Village Green Drive. The primary intent of the construction of this road was to ease congestion on the city's only other two east–west routes through the city, Prima Vista Boulevard and the combined State Road 716 (Port St. Lucie Blvd.)/Gatlin Blvd. roadways.
History
Throughout most of Port St. Lucie's history, there were only two primary east–west routes through the city, Port St. Lucie and Prima Vista boulevards. The need for a third east–west thoroughfare has been recognized since 1980. The Palmer Expressway, a Turnpike project, was proposed at that time, but was eventually removed from the active Turnpike projects list in 1997.
Construction on the extension to US 1, including a bridge over the North Fork of the St. Lucie River started in 2017, and the bridge was opened to the public with a party on September 28, 2019. At the intersection is a pair of towers, topped with sculptures of swimming fish and further decorated with tiles of wildlife in the St. Lucie River. Currently, there is a superstreet intersection at Floresta Drive, the first in Florida; recently, residents have been petitioning to change the superstreet intersection to one that is easier and less time-consuming to navigate.
One proposed project is a linear park under the Crosstown Bridge, to be called "The Plaza Under the Bridge", which will include lighting, irrigation, a proposed floating dock, a gazebo, and a coquina hardscape.

Yu Qian (; 1398–1457), courtesy name Tingyi, art name Jie'an, was a Chinese official who served under the Ming dynasty.
Biography
Yu Qian was born in Qiantang County, Hangzhou, Zhejiang. They started their career in the Ming civil service after obtaining the position of a jinshi (進士; successful candidate) in the imperial examination in 1421. They helped to suppress a rebellion by the prince Zhu Gaoxu in 1426 and earned the favour of the Xuande Emperor (r. 1425–1435), who appointed them as the Grand coordinator of Shanxi and Henan. During the reign of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435–1449), they offended the influential court eunuch Wang Zhen and ended up being imprisoned. However, they were released later, reinstated as an official, and further promoted to serve as the Minister of War.
In 1449, Yu Qian played an important role in leading the Defense of Beijing from attacks by the Oirat Mongols, who had earlier captured the Zhengtong Emperor at the Battle of Tumu. The Jingtai Emperor (r. 1449–1457), who succeeded the Zhengtong Emperor, appointed Yu Qian as the Crown Prince's Guardian and Tutor. In 1457, the former Zhengtong Emperor, who had returned after they were released by the Mongols, seized power from the Jingtai Emperor in a coup and restored themselves to the throne as the Tianshun Emperor (r. 1457–1464). Yu Qian was falsely accused of treason and executed. They were later posthumously rehabilitated by the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) and given the posthumous name Sumin (lit. "Stern and Suffering") by the Hongzhi Emperor, afterwards changed into "Zhongsu" (lit."loyal and stern") by the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620). There are memorial halls and shrines built in Beijing and Hangzhou to commemorate and honour Yu Qian.

The Dudesons () are a Finnish entertainment group. They are best known for their TV shows and live performances, which are a combination of stunts and comedy. Their early TV shows were similar to Jackass. Starting their television career in the early 2000s, they gained international fame and had a show on the American television channel MTV in 2010. After The Dudesons in America, the group started to shift from the stunts to more multidimensional careers.
Background
The Dudesons consists of Jukka Hildén (b. 1980), Jarppi Leppälä (b. 1979), Jarno Laasala (b. 1979) and Hannu-Pekka "HP" Parviainen (b. 1981). All were from the town of Seinäjoki, where Hildén, Leppälä, and Laasala became close friends while attending elementary school together, where they later met Parviainen.
As teenagers, the four became quite interested in snowboarding, skateboarding and downhill mountain biking. In the early 1990s, when Laasala got their first video camera, the group began filming their activities which eventually led to further pranks and extreme stunts. They created and sold VHS tapes which were filmed and edited by Laasala and subsequently their reputation began to grow in Seinäjoki.
Original Finnish TV series
In January 2000, Jarno Laasala obtained a job as an editor for a small Finnish cable TV channel called MoonTV. Similar to the American show Jackass, they saw a possibility to make their own show out of all the stunts the Dudesons had filmed. After finishing high school, the Dudesons set up their own production company called Rabbit Films. The group immediately began shooting a self-financed pilot episode of their own show.
This pilot was finished in August 2000 and the channel immediately green lit the first season, titled as "Maailmankiertue" (Worldtour). The episodes began airing in January 2001, and the series became the most popular show on MoonTV. In September 2001, the Dudesons moved from MoonTV to a nationwide TV channel Nelonen. The 2nd season, called "Extreme Duudsonit, Maailmankiertue 2", was first screened in 2002, and the same year the Dudesons were also elected as The Media Persons of the Year by the readers of Finland's most popular youth magazine Suosikki. The 3rd (Maailmankiertue 3) and 4th seasons (Duudsoni Elämää) of Extreme Duudsonit ran respectively in 2003 and 2004.
Recurring stunts and segments on the English-language version of the Dudesons includes: the "Human Dartboard," playing pranks on "Mr. Hitler" and a vast array of other stunts with "absolute disregard for [their] own safety."
International career
In 2003, the Dudesons made a decision to start making English-language material in order to find international distribution. Their following series, Duudsoni Elämää, was shot both in Finnish and English. The material was then edited both into Finnish-language series, and English language series. The Finnish series ran in 2004, while the English series had its international debut at Australian Channel V in February 2006. The American debut was on SpikeTV on 6 July 2006.
Jarppi, Jukka, and Jarno can be seen on Bam Margera's Viva La Bam. Jarppi and Jukka can also be seen on Bam Margera Presents: Where the ♯$&% Is Santa? (2008) and Minghags (2009).
Jukka appeared on Tom Green Live! on 10 October 2006 as a special guest with Steve-O from Jackass.
By September 2007, the Dudesons Season 1 had been shown in 22 countries around the world, making it the most widespread Finnish TV-series of all time. The second season began in Australia on 20 May 2008 on Channel V.
By the year 2010, different Dudesons seasons have been seen in over 150 countries.
In 2008 the Dudesons introduced Paramore in the Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2008.
The Dudesons are also featured in the hit 2010 movie Jackass 3D, alongside Johnny Knoxville. All four Dudesons were seen on the red carpet at the Jackass 3D premiere. The Dudesons are also in the 2011 movie Jackass 3.5.
The Dudesons presented the best hip hop award for the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards.
The Dudesons also appeared as a guest in one episode of Loiter Squad in 2013.
Jarppi and Jukka also made an appearance in one episode of Ridiculousness in 2014.
Jukka, along with Steve-O from Jackass, both participated in the web series titled Ultimate Expedition in 2018. Jukka served as an executive producer for this series.

The Dudesons in America: 2010
After a multimillion-dollar deal with MTV, a new show called The Dudesons in America was green lit. With a budget of six million dollars, it would consist of the same line-up of all four Dudesons, and was set to be produced by both Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine. The Dudesons' own production company, Rabbit Films, decided to do the show with the co-operation of Dickhouse. "The Dudesons have balls where there should be brains and I am honored to be doing a show with them," Knoxville says on the Dudesons's official website. However, after the episode Cowboys & Findians, MTV changed the time the episode would air due to unknown reasons. The Dudesons stated on their official Facebook page that the show would continue on 16 July 2010 and has since ended.
The first episode was shown on MTV 6 May 2010. The Dudesons in America was first aired on 1 August 2010 in the UK, on MTV Bang.
Season 5: 2016
The Dudesons Movie

It was released in the US on 11 July 2006 by Warner Rhino. Despite mixed reviews from Finnish mainstream critics, the film won the "Audience's Favorite Movie" at Jussi Awards, the Finnish equivalent of Oscars, with about 47% of votes. It features guest appearances from Steve-O, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Phil Margera, April Margera, and Don Vito.
Duudsonit tuli taloon
Filming the show The Dudesons in America was an exhausting experience for the Dudesons and they wanted to take the group to a new direction after it. They created the show Duudsonit tuli taloon, in which they helped families with their problems.
Dudesons Do Gumball
In 2013, the Dudesons filmed and launched their own three-part series when taking part in the Gumball 3000 event. The show aired exclusively on Extreme Sports Channel, and followed the Finns as they travelled from Copenhagen to Monaco. This year they had a Cadillac SUV which had the look of a blue elephant. During the race through Europe they had their "Wheel of Fortune", which was used for different types of pranks.
Duudsonit: Päällikkö
In 2019 The Dudesons hosted the television show Duudsonit: Päällikkö, in which a group of contestants competed in challenges.

Thomas Alexander Marshall (4 November 1817 – 11 November 1873) was an American politician. In 1861 they served for a short time as Lieutenant Governor of Illinois.
Life
Thomas Marshall graduated from the Kenyon College in Ohio. Afterwards they studied law at the Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After their admission to the bar they practiced as a lawyer. Later they moved to Charleston, Illinois where they became a banker. In addition they founded their own firm which they called T. A. Marshall Co. Their party affiliation is uncertain because the sources are contradictory in this question. The political Graveyard states they were a Republican while other sources make them a Democrat. According to the Political Graveyard they were a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1860, which nominated Abraham Lincoln for the Presidency.
In 1847 Marshall was a Delegate to the Illinois state constitutional convention and in the 1850s they were a member of the Illinois Senate where they advanced to the President. In March 1860 Governor William Henry Bissell died and their Lieutenant Governor John Wood followed them as Governor. In their function as President of the State Senate Marshall replaced Wood as acting Lieutenant Governor. It remains unclear if they took this position already in March 1860 or on 7 January 1861. Their term ended on 14 January 1861 when their successor Francis Hoffmann was inaugurated. During the American Civil War Marshall was a Colonel in the Union Army. They died on 11. November 1873 in Charleston in Illinois.

Al-Quds () was a Arabic language newspaper published in Ottoman period Jerusalem between 1908 and 1914. Its publisher was Jurji Habib Hanania (1864-1920). According to the Hanania's editorial in the first issue of the newspaper on 18 September 1908 they had already applied several times for the permit to publish a newspaper starting in 1899 without success. In 1908 al-Quds was the first of many new newspapers that could be established after the Young Turk Revolution newly improvement of freedom of the press. It started with issues twice a week in four pages and printed in 1,500 copies. With the rule of Djemal Pasha freedom of the press worsened and the newspaper was eventually discontinued.

Paolo "Polo" Zuliani (also Zulian) was a Venetian nobleman, statesman, and Duke-elect of Candia, who is remembered for having declined the title of Duke of Candia out of modesty upon their election in 1382.
Biography
Polo Zuliani was born into the Zuliani family, a Venetian patrician family.  They are recorded in the 1379 estimo of the comune together with sier Franscesco Zulian.  They are said to have been from Santa Fosca (Cannaregio), which was the historical abode of the Zuliani.
Zuliani was a very prominent (notissimo) figure in Venice, due to several ambassadorships. Zuliani was among the twelve ambassadors sent to Istria to meet with Doge Antonio Venier. They were elected Duke of Candia in 1382, but declined out of modesty. Ireneo della Croce called this a "rare example of modesty" (esempio raro di modestia).
In 1410, Zuliani was elected Procurator of Saint Mark. Their nephew (or grandson) Andrea was an author and translator. Andrea translated Cassius Dio into Latin, and left several orations, for which they were praised by Flavio Biondo in their Italia illustrata (Italy Illuminated).

Sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SPANXA1 gene.
"Temporally regulated transcription and translation of several testis-specific genes is required to initiate the series of molecular and morphological changes in the male germ cell lineage necessary for the formation of mature spermatozoa. This gene is a member of the SPANX family of cancer/testis-associated genes, which are located in a cluster on chromosome X. The SPANX genes encode differentially expressed testis-specific proteins that localize to various subcellular compartments. This particular gene maps to chromosome X in a head-to-head orientation with SPANX family member A2, which appears to be a duplication of the A1 locus. The protein encoded by this gene targets to the nucleus where it associates with nuclear vacuoles and the redundant nuclear envelope. Based on its association with these poorly characterized regions of the sperm nucleus, this protein provides a biochemical marker to study unique structures in while attempting to further define its role in spermatogenesis."

Thomas Fielding (fl. 1776–1787), was an English engraver.
Fielding is stated to have been born about 1758. They studied under Francesco Bartolozzi, but more especially under William Wynne Ryland, to whom they acted both as pupil and assistant, and was so much engaged on the engravings bearing that artist's name, that few original works of their own exist. After Ryland's disastrous end, Fielding produced some engravings in their own name. Among them were ‘The Meeting of Jacob and Rachael,' and ‘Moses saved by Pharaoh's Daughter,' after Thomas Stothard, R.A .; also ‘Theseus finding their Father's Sword and Sandals,' and ‘The Death of Procris,' after Angelica Kauffman, R.A. The latter are finely engraved in Ryland's stipple manner, and quite reach the level of that artist's productions. Little is known of their life, and the year of their death is unknown.
Fielding should be distinguished from an engraver, John Fielding, who preceded him, and about 1750 engraved some prints after Hogarth and others.

The capuchinbird or calfbird (Perissocephalus tricolor) is a large passerine bird of the family Cotingidae. It is monotypic within the genus Perissocephalus. It is found in humid forests (up to but mostly below 600 m) in north-eastern South America, almost entirely north of the Amazon River and east of Rio Negro (Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and The Guianas).
Description
The capuchinbird is a large thick-set suboscine passerine with a relatively heavy bill. Adults weigh between and are typically around long, making it the largest suboscine passerine, apart from the Amazonian and long-wattled umbrellabirds – indeed, females average larger than any female umbrellabird. Its plumage is overall rich brown, approaching orange on the belly and undertail coverts, and the remiges and short tail are black. The most distinctive feature is its bare, almost vulture-like head covered in dull blue skin. Juveniles resemble adults, with the exception of some downy feathers on the head.
Ecology
They gather in leks where they "sing". The "song" is very odd and difficult to describe accurately, although some have compared it to the distant sound of a chainsaw or (as indicated by its alternative name "calfbird") a cow mooing. The nest is small and rather scanty and is normally found in close proximity to the lek. Capuchinbirds eat mainly fruits and insects.
Status
The capuchinbird has a very wide distribution and although it is an uncommon bird, its total population is estimated to be large. The population may be in slight decline because of deforestation, but not at a fast enough rate for it to be considered threatened, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of "least concern".

The novel was translated into three languages by different publishing houses, in 2011. It was translated into English by Bloomsbury, Italian by Marsilio, and French by Groupe Flammarion.
Then the novel was made into a TV show during the month of Ramadan of 2012 titled: Vertigo (Arabic: فيرتيجو) starring Hend Sabry. The novel won the Mediterranean award in 2013 from Italy.

Later, it was made into a theatrical movie, The Blue Elephant (Arabic: الفيل الأزرق) starring Karim Abdel Aziz, Khaled El Sawy and Nelly Karim.
Other works
Another two significant works worth mention are the novel 1919, published in 2014 and The Land of God (Arabic: أرض الإله), published in 2015.
Mourad is the screenwriter of The Originals (Arabic: الأصليين), also directed by Marwan Hamed. Mourad was initially going to write it as a novel before they decided to make it as a theatrical film. However, the film was published on June 25, 2017 across Egypt to a mixed critical reception from audiences and critics alike.
The story of Samir, a family man who loses their job at the bank, later learns about the dark side of Egyptian life when they are recruited to be a part of a secret society.
Former jobs

Their graduation projects achieved many awards in European film festivals. Their projects include Alhaúmon, And On The Seventh Day, and The Three Papers, all of which were produced before their writing career.

Warren Leopold (February 15, 1920 – May 19, 1998) was an American architect, painter and craftsman who designed and built coastal homes in Cambria, California and throughout San Luis Obispo County, California and whose work is part of the organic school.
Personal life
In 1939, Leopold met their future wife, Helen, at a big-band dance at UC Berkeley where Helen was enrolled. They enlisted in the US Army in September 1940 while residing in Berkeley, California. Later that year Leopold and Helen married and moved to Carmel. They had four children: Mark, Laurel, Eric (d 1963) and David.
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor their regiment transferred to Alaska. Following the war, the family relocated to Big Sur and again to Cambria. In the late 1960s as Leopold's attentions turned toward their increasing project workload, they suffered, according to their daughter Laurel, a mid-life crisis which lead to their marriage to Helen ending in divorce.
Leopold stood trial in Washington for keeping their children out of public school. Albert Einstein submitted a letter in their defense.
Leopold was reputed to have lived on 21 dollars a day, receiving financial assistance from friends including Henry Miller. During their final decade, they could be found holding court on a bench near the Cambria post office.
Work
Early career
Leopold studied with Maurice Logan at California College of Arts and Crafts. After enlisting in September 1940 for service in the US Army during World War II, they became the first officially designated US Army Combat artist, holding this role from 1940 to 1943. They also painted portraits of WWII combat generals.
During WWII, while stationed by the US Army in Alaska to head the North War Art Unit, they met writer Dashiell Hammett and together financed a whorehouse there. Their friendship influenced Leopold's artistic philosophy, leading to a greater interest in the natural world and to a greater desire to lead a simplified life. They retired from the Army in 1948 and subsequently moved to Big Sur in the hope of meeting Henry Miller, whose books they had read while stationed in Alaska. Miller, after meeting Leopold, commissioned them along with sculptor Gordon Newell to build a studio addition to their home—work that was interspersed with "erudite Miller monologues, so we were educated while we worked." Following completion, Leopold occupied the studio for a year in exchange for performing domestic duties for the Miller household.
Architectural career
Leopold designed their first residential structure in the late 1940s, building it on the Garcia River. While living in Big Sur, Leopold befriended modernist architect Rowan Maiden (1913-1957), who from 1939-1941 studied at Taliesin West under Frank Lloyd Wright, and who went on to design the landmark Nepenthe restaurant in the Organic tradition. Their progressive philosophy influenced Leopold's burgeoning architectural vision.
During 1947–1948, Leopold built their most notable structure, known as 'Crazy House', an artist's retreat located in Cambria that was conceived without right angles in its design. In the early 1960s, they left Big Sur to relocate to Cambria where they created designs for over 100 clients in Cambria, and Carmel, and Big Sur.
From the late 1960s through the 1970s, their work enjoyed a devoted following among California Polytechnic State University architecture students. They discontinued their work as an architect during the final 15 years of their life due to their dissatisfaction with the increasing complexity of local building regulations. Leopold lamented, "Bureaucracy is killing the creativity in this country. All the forms you have to fill out now don't leave any room for imagination."
Leopold notably never obtained an architect's license, signing their drawings "Warren Leopold N.A.L.A.", the initials standing for "Not a Licensed Architect". The signature stood not only as a disclosure but an indication of their outsider philosophical posture.

Mcor Technologies Ltd was engaged in the design, development and manufacture of paper-based 3D printing systems. The company was founded in 2005 and was based in Dunleer, County Louth, Ireland. The company is in liquidation since 2019 and has ceased trading. The assets and IP of Mcor were purchased by CleanGreen3d Limited in October 2019.
History and technology
In 2003, Mcor founders Dr. Conor MacCormack and Fintan MacCormack developed paper 3D technology. This is unlike Laminated object manufacturing (LOM) technology, developed by Helisys Inc. (now Cubic Technologies). Whereas LOM technology uses rolls of adhesive-coated paper and a knife or laser to cut a shape, paper 3D printing uses sheets of standard business A4 and letter paper, an adhesive dispensing system and a tungsten-tip blade to cut the shape. As in many other rapid prototyping processes, the part to be printed is built up from multiple thin cross-sections of the 3D model created via computer aided design (CAD) software.
After going a few years without official funding, in 2014, Mcor Technologies secured 2 rounds of venture funding which totaled $32 million, making it the largest amount raised by any 3D printing company that year.
Mcor Technologies Limited entered into receivership 21 March 2019. CleanGreen3D Limited purchased the assets of Mcor Technologies on 29 November 2019.
Colour 3D printing
Some Mcor 3D printers can print parts in colour. This is achieved by depositing coloured ink on each sheet of paper – using a modified two-dimensional inkjet paper printer – and then loading those sheets of paper into the section of the printer where the cutting and gluing occurs. Colour 3D printing can be used to replicate the appearance of buildings, maps, products, anatomy, and molecular structures. It can also add annotations to prototypes, display the results of structural analyses (i.e., finite element analysis) and used to produce consumer products.

Vizient Inc., based in Irving, Texas, is a corporation that serves over 5,000 not-for-profit health system members and their affiliates, including 1,360 acute care hospitals. Founded in 2016, it is a successor company to VHA, Inc., founded in 1977 as a network of not-for-profit health care organizations working in clinical, financial, and operational management. VHA and UHC (University HealthSystem Consortium) owned a supply chain company called Novation and aptitude(R), the industry's first online direct market for local contracting. VHA also owned Provista, the enterprise's supply chain company serving the non-acute market as well as government, education, and business sectors. There are 1,600 employees across the enterprise.
VHA changed its name in 1994, adopting the initials of its former name (Voluntary Hospitals of America). The name change was to move beyond the outdated and often-misunderstood concepts of "voluntary" and "hospitals", while retaining its name recognition.
On April 1, 2015, VHA and UHC (University HealthSystem Consortium) merged to make one company, Vizient, making them the largest member-owned health care company in the nation. The combined organization officially aligned under the Vizient brand in 2016.

Triton College is a public community college in River Grove, Illinois.
History
Junior College District 300 was voted into existence in a referendum in March 1964. In March 1965, a second referendum was passed approving the purchase of an campus site at Fifth Avenue and Palmer Street in River Grove. The school was named Triton College in recognition of the three high school districts that it encompassed – Elmwood Park, Leyden, and Proviso Township. Triton College opened in September 1965 and held classes at several of the high schools in its district. About 1,200 students were enrolled, and full-time in-district tuition was US$5 per semester hour.
Construction on the permanent campus began in June 1967 with the Technology building and proceeded in phases. With the opening of the Learning Resource Center in 1974, the original campus plan was essentially complete, except for some athletic facilities and the Performing Arts Center, a large auditorium planned for the area now occupied by the soccer field, but never built. The original Cernan Space Center building, located north of the Learning Resource Center, was plagued by latent construction defects, and, after being used for several years, was demolished and replaced by the present building located nearby.
In 1972, another referendum was passed adding Oak Park and River Forest, Riverside Brookfield, and Ridgewood high school districts to the original three, forming Community College District 504. This district was expanded to its current size in 1974 by the addition of Rosemont and Pennoyer school districts. By 1975, enrollment had grown to nearly 20,000, in-district tuition had increased to US$11 per semester hour, and Triton had become the largest single-campus community college in Illinois. The campus was expanded by the acquisition of the North Avenue Drive-In theater, which closed in 1973. This area, designated the "East Campus" and located across Fifth Avenue from the original ("West") campus, was cleared and used mainly for the construction of athletic facilities, as well as a small auditorium as part of the Collins Center.
Campus
Triton College sits on a campus that features electronic classrooms, labs, sports facilities, a library and bookstore, an art gallery and performing arts center, botanical gardens and greenhouses, culinary arts program restaurant and bistro, and the Cernan Earth and Space Center, which is a public planetarium. Recent renovations include the Health Sciences Building, The Student Center Building, and Symonds-Puckett field.
The campus is also the home of Triton Troupers Circus.

ζ Fornacis (often Latinised as Zeta Fornacis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern constellation of Fornax. It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.67. Based upon a measured annual parallax shift of , it is located at a distance of about 109 light-years from the Sun. The star is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +29 km/s. Positioned about 1.3° to the southeast of Zeta Fornacis is the galaxy NGC 1232.
This is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F4 V. With an estimated age of 1.5 billion years, it has 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 1.6 times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating 4.77 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of . It is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 84.9 km/s, and has a near-solar metallicity—what astronomers term the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. This star is a probable member of the Hyades Stream—a group of stars that share a common motion through space with the Hyades cluster.
Zeta Fornacis has a common proper motion companion, NLTT 9563, a magnitude 13.50 star with a classification of M 2.5. As of 2004, this companion was positioned at an angular separation of 176.1 arcseconds along a position angle of 288.1°.

The Case of the Dean of St Asaph, formally R v Shipley, was the 1784 trial of William Davies Shipley, the Dean of St Asaph, for seditious libel. In the aftermath of the American War of Independence, electoral reform had become a substantial issue, and William Pitt the Younger attempted to bring a Bill before Parliament to reform the electoral system. In its support Shipley republished a pamphlet written by their brother-in-law, Sir William Jones, which noted the defects of the existing system and argued in support of Pitt's reforms. Thomas FitzMaurice, the brother of British Prime Minister Earl of Shelburne, reacted by indicting Shipley for seditious libel, a criminal offence which acted as "the government's chief weapon against criticism", since merely publishing something that an individual judge interpreted as libel was enough for a conviction; a jury was prohibited from deciding whether the material was actually libellous. The law was widely seen as unfair, and a Society for Constitutional Information was formed to pay Shipley's legal fees. With financial backing from the society Shipley was able to secure the services of Thomas Erskine KC as their barrister.
Shipley was tried in 1784 by Mr Justice Buller and a specially convened jury at Shrewsbury. Edward Bearcroft, counsel for the prosecution, argued that on the basis of the existing system the jury could not decide on the nature of the pamphlet, while Erskine argued not only that they could, but that the material did not constitute seditious libel, containing as it did "a solemn protest against all sedition". Persuaded by Erskine's arguments, the jury ruled that Shipley was neither "guilty" nor "not guilty", but instead "guilty of publication only", a confusing and non-standard ruling which, after a long dialogue, Mr Justice Buller declared to mean "guilty on all charges". Erskine appealed the decision to the Court of King's Bench on 8 November, where the judges again ruled that juries could not decide whether material was libellous, but nevertheless released Shipley on a technicality; their freedom was greeted with fireworks and bonfires, and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester. Still seeking to reform the law, Erskine sent the court records to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden, who, after much effort, passed the Libel Act 1792, which secured the right of juries to decide whether material was libellous.
Background
Following the end of the American War of Independence, British public attention had turned to the need for Parliamentary reform – specifically, the lack of franchise in many towns and the presence of rotten boroughs. In response, William Pitt the Younger brought the idea of reform before Parliament and, in support of their actions, Sir William Jones wrote and published a pamphlet titled A Dialogue between a Farmer and a Country Gentleman on the Principles of Government, which covered the "virtues of government and defects in the representation of the people". In 1783 Shipley, Jones's brother-in-law, recommended it to a group of Welsh constitutional reformers and had it reprinted in Welsh with their own preface suggesting it was "just, rational and constitutional". As a result, Thomas FitzMaurice, the brother of the Earl of Shelburne, indicted Shipley for seditious libel, specifically for "publishing a false, scandalous and malicious libel ... to raise seditions and tumults within the kingdom, and to excite Their Majesty's subjects to attempt, by armed rebellion and violence, to subvert the state and constitution of the nation".
The law dealing with seditious libel was particularly strict. Acting as "the government's chief weapon against criticism", it followed principles laid down in De Libellis Famosis and R v Carr: that seditious libel was a criminal offence, that the intention of the publisher or the truth of the allegations was irrelevant, that mere publication was sufficient for a conviction, and that juries were only allowed to deliver a verdict on whether the material had been published by the defendant, not whether it was libellous. Traditionally, matters of fact were left to the jury and matters of law to the judge, but with seditious libel "matters of law" was construed very widely; it was the judge's job to decide if the material was libellous, what constituted "seditious libel", and the nature of "publication", which was understood to include almost anything. Even a private letter, if intercepted, could lead to a prosecution.
Because of public disquiet with these principles, Shipley's trial acted as a "test case" for the law of seditious libel; a Society for Constitutional Information was formed by concerned citizens and began raising money to pay for their defence. Able to afford the best representation, the society gave the brief to Thomas Erskine KC, a noted defence barrister. The trial was to be heard by Lord Kenyon, then Chief Justice of Chester, at Wrexham; after travelling 200 miles to the court Erskine discovered that a paper had been circulated in the area arguing that in libel cases juries were allowed to decide whether a publication was libellous, as well as whether it had been published. Citing the paper's circulation, the prosecution asked for a postponement; ignoring claims that a delay would cause Shipley hardship, Kenyon agree to postpone the trial. The case was eventually heard on 6 August 1784 by Mr Justice Buller, at Shrewsbury.
Trial and appeal
Edward Bearcroft, lead counsel for the prosecution, described the Dialogue as libel and argued that the truth of this was not a question for the jury to decide on; they were bound to convict the defendant as long as they decided that they had published the Dialogue, regardless of the contents. Those contents, Bearcroft went on, sought to persuade the public that "every man of age had a right to choose their own representative in Parliament". Erskine, in their reply, argued that the Dialogue was not libellous (it opened with a preface containing "a solemn protest against all sedition"), and insisted that the jury had the right to decide what constituted libel:
To demonstrate their feelings on the subject, Erskine asked the jury to consider them a fellow defendant, since they intended to publish the pamphlet themselves as soon as possible; they then went through the Dialogue line by line, showing that not only would most people agree with it, but that it was the foundation of Pitt's Reform Bill. After Erskine concluded their arguments, again stating that the jury should feel free to debate whether the material constituted libel, Mr Justice Buller began their summing up, instructing the jury that they were only allowed to decide on whether Shipley had published the work. The jury retired, and after half an hour of discussion returned to declare Shipley "guilty of publishing only". After a long and "confounding" debate between Erskine, Buller, and the jury, Buller declared Shipley guilty on all counts.
Erskine immediately appealed the decision to the Court of King's Bench, where they argued on 8 November that Buller's statement had misdirected the jury, and that as the jury was traditionally not given the right to investigate Shipley's actual guilt, the previous trial was invalid; a jury should be permitted to determine not only whether a statement was published, but whether it was libellous. With the exception of Mr Justice Wiles, the court unanimously declared that Erskine's arguments were incorrect, and that the jury had no such role; accordingly, their appeal was denied. Shipley was, however, later freed when the King's Bench held that the initial indictment had been invalid because "there were no averments to point the application of the paper as a libel on the king and government".
Lord Mansfield, giving the main judgment in the case, expressed their concern that Erskine's argument about the law of seditious libel would lead to uncertainty. If each jury was able to define 'libel' for itself, the law could descend into anarchy. Erskine had attempted to pre-empt this objection by arguing that it was the trial judge's duty to direct the jury on the law of seditious libel. In this way, the jury could give a full verdict on the defendant's guilt, while respecting the judiciary's expertise regarding legal matters. Crosby has argued that Mansfield's argument
This debate about the true nature of the jury's verdict subsequently formed an important part of the debate on the jury's role in nineteenth-century America.
Aftermath
Although the case did not directly lead to legal change, it was nevertheless widely seen as a victory; upon their release Shipley was greeted with fireworks and bonfires, and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester. Erskine, however, perceived it differently, and had records of the entire trial printed and sent to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden. Taking this as a hint, Fox (after much delay) introduced a Bill to Parliament in May 1791, seeking to reform the law relating to libel. After it was passed through the Commons it went to the House of Lords, where members of the judiciary attempted to delay it; in response Lord Camden, then 78, rose and bluntly stated that if the judges were to be the sole arbiters of public opinion, nothing would be able to appear that criticised the government, leading to a stifling of the freedom of the press. Their appeal was successful – without it, historian H.M. Lubasz writes, the Bill would never have passed the Lords – and within three weeks Parliament had formally passed the Libel Act 1792, commonly known as Fox's Libel Act, allowing juries for the first time to decide precisely what constituted libel.

Casper Oimoen (May 8, 1906 – July 28, 1995) was an American ski jumping champion.
Biography
Casper Oimoen was born at Etnedal in Oppland, Norway. They immigrated to the United States in 1923 and settled near Minot, North Dakota. Unable to compete in the 1928 Olympics because they were not an American citizen, they entered the Olympics in 1932 and again as captain of the U.S. team in 1936, placing 5th and 13th respectively.
Casper Oimoen won over 400 medals and trophies during their skiing career. They won the Northwestern Ski Jumping Championship nine times in nine entries, the Montana State Jumping Championship six times in six entries, the Central United States Championship ten times, six of them in consecutive years (1925-1931), and the United States National Ski Jumping Championship three times. In 1930, they won the Eastern, Central and National Championships, plus eight other firsts, a feat which has never been equaled.
Oimoen was inducted into the U.S. Skiing Hall of Fame in 1963. Casper Oimoen was granted the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award by the Governor of the State of North Dakota in 1973. Today their portrait, by North Dakota artist Vern Skaug, is on display in the Hall of Fame at the North Dakota State Capital Building in Bismarck. They were inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame in 1984. A bronze statue of Casper Oimoen stands in the Scandinavian Heritage Park in Minot, North Dakota.

John Baker (c. 1754 - 20 January 1831) was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom in 1796 and 1797 and from 1802 to 1818.
Baker was the son of George Baker, a surgeon and medical practitioner of Canterbury. The family had long lived in Canterbury. Their father left them a considerable fortune which they enlarged by marriage. They lived at Hawkhurst Lodge, in the Weald of Kent, and became one of the largest hop-planters in the district. Later they established the Union Bank at Canterbury and moved to St Stephen's, near there. They became active in local politics and was Sheriff of Canterbury for 1786–87.
In 1796, Baker was elected Member of Parliament for Canterbury on what was called the independent interest. They headed the poll with 774 votes but the election was declared void on petition under the provisions of the Treating Act. At the second election in March 1797 they again had a majority of votes, "although not one public-house had been opened in their interest, nor a single cockade distributed". However a protest was entered against the eligibility of the two elected MPs and the sitting members were re-instated.
In 1802 Baker was elected MP for Canterbury without opposition. They were returned again at the general elections of 1806, 1807, and 1812, and retired at that of 1818. In politics they were always a consistent Whig. They were also appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Canterbury volunteers in 1803.
Baker died at Canterbury, aged 76. They were considered one of the best gentlemen billiard players in the county and excelled even more at whist.
Baker married Jane Tattershall, the eldest daughter of the Rev. James Tattersall, Rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden. They had two sons and two daughters. Their son George was a barrister and Recorder of Canterbury.

Background and promotion
R.E.D is an acronym for Romance, Expression and Dance. It revolves around themes of sex, love and religious tropes. Savage recorded the album while pregnant with their son. The album was made available for free digital streaming on MTN Music, and was reportedly intended for release on December 21, 2015. Within 24 hours of its release, it became the most-streamed album of all time on the music platform. Mavin Records promoted the album by launching a meme generator through the website i-am-red.com. The website's interface allowed users to create a meme by uploading their pictures and entering values for the R.E.D acronym. Users had the option to enter text in the fields or choose from pre-defined suggestions. Users were encouraged to share their images on social media sites with the #IamRED hashtag.
While promoting the album in London, Savage stopped by BBC Africa's London Studio and spoke to Bola Mosuro about the project. They held an album listening party at Industry Nite and performed all the songs on the album. They also unveiled the album's cover art and narrated stories about each song on it. Guest in attendance included Fade Ogunro, Don Jazzy, Dr SID, D'Prince, Di'Ja, Korede Bello, Waje, 9ice, Tomi Odunsi, MC Galaxy and Iceberg Slim.
Composition
In the fuji-inspired street anthem "Standing Ovation", Savage appears tough and plays up their credibility. In "Adura", Don Jazzy channels Ebenezer Obey and incorporates drums and bass-guitar melodies. The secular track "African Waist" contains elements of Afro-Caribbean music and dubstep; its production features full horns, muted-trumpet solos and saxophone riffs. Echezonachukwu Nduka of Praxis Magazine said the song is "experimental in both rhythmic and vocal delivery". "We Don't Give a Damn" is composed of martial-like band music and muted trumpet riffs. "Rewind" has elements of Middle Eastern music, while the Dr SID-assisted track "If I Start to Talk" is grounded in Afrobeat. "Make time" is reminiscent of reggae music from the 80s. The dancehall pop track "Key to the City" features vocals by Jamaican singer Busy Signal. The emotional track "Bang Bang" has been described as the classic romance template in microcosm. The Reekado Banks-assisted track "Go Down" is thematically about oral sex. In "Love Me Hard", 2Baba reworked a line from their Grass 2 Grace album. In the D'Prince-assisted track "Before Nko", Savage brags about their sexual drive. Nduka criticized the song for appropriating Faze's "Need Somebody".
Singles and other releases
"My Darlin" was released as the album's lead single on October 8, 2014. It was jointly produced by Don Jazzy and Baby Fresh. The accompanying music video for "My Darlin" was directed by Kemi Adetiba.<ref name ="Okay Africa 1">{{cite web |author1=Z Weg |title=Tiwa Savage Shares Bittersweet Video For 'My Darlin |url=https://www.okayafrica.com/tiwa-savage-my-darlin-music-video/ |publisher=Okay Africa |accessdate=23 April 2019 |date=December 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423015425/https://www.okayafrica.com/tiwa-savage-my-darlin-music-video/ |archive-date=23 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the video's opening scene, Savage plays the role of an older woman who jokes about a wedding party in a room full of bridesmaids. The video also depicts images of Savage's wedding gown and a non-linear portrait of a loving yet tragic relationship. The Olamide-assisted track "Standing Ovation" was released as the album's second single on January 14, 2016. The accompanying music video for "Standing Ovation" was shot and directed by Clarence Peters.
A carnival-themed music video for "African Waist" was shot in South Africa and released in December 2015. In the video, Don Jazzy plays the role of a fitness instructor. Princess Abumere of Pulse Nigeria described the song as a "cheerful fusion of soul calypso and afrobeat". The Clarence Peters-directed music video for "If I Start to Talk" was released In April 2016. A teaser clip of the video was released the previous day. Tope Delano of TooXclusive said the song is a "deeply personal and raw account of Tiwa's life story". The music video for the Wizkid-assisted track "Bad" was released in July 2016, a day after the confirmation of Savage's Roc Nation deal. It was directed by Sesan Ogunro and features cameo appearances from Banky W, Funke Akindele and Denrele Edun. In the video, Wizkid and Savage are seen putting up graffiti on the wall. The Clarence Peters-directed visuals for "Rewind" was released in October 2016; Nigerian actor Emmanuel Ikubuese plays Savage's love interest in the video.
Critical receptionR.E.D received mixed reviews from music critics. In a review for 360nobs, Wilfred Okiche characterized the album as "a basic Nigerian pop record" despite it boasting "an interesting concept driven title". Okiche also opined that Savage is more grounded on the album and knows who their target audiences are. A writer for Pulse Nigeria described the album as a "singer-songwriter's album through and through" and said it is "personal and organic, fresh and contemporary without being beholden to conformist radio sounds".
Reviewing for Music in Africa, music journalist Oris Aigbokhaevbolo praised Savage for "producing an album deserving of the attention they crave", but cited the unevenness of the songwriting as its weakness. Ade Tayo of Simply African Music said R.E.D is quite inferior to Once Upon a Time from a direction and cohesive standpoint. Echezonachukwu Nduka of Praxis Magazine'' praised the album for staying true to its themes, but ended the review saying the "high presence of featured artistes robs them of full credits".

Darnley is an area in south-west Glasgow, Scotland, on the A727 just west of Arden (the areas are separated by the M77 motorway although a footbridge connects them). Other nearby neighbourhoods are Priesthill to the north, Southpark Village to the south, and South Nitshill and Parkhouse to the west; there is also a small industrial estate. The closest railway station is . The Brock Burn flows through the area.
History
The historic estate of Darnley (anciently Derneley, etc.), in Eastwood parish, Renfrewshire, east of Barrhead, was the seat of an ancient barony. In 1356, Robert Stewart, High Steward of Scotland, granted the barony to Sir John Stewart. It remained a possession of this branch of the house of Stewart (known as "Stewart of Darnley"), and in 1460 Sir John Stewart of Darnley (d. 1495) became "Lord Darnley" (a Scottish Lordship of Parliament) and subsequently in 1488 they were created Earl of Lennox (2nd creation).
Their descendant in the fourth generation was Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley (1546–67), the second but eldest surviving son of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, (the courtesy title "Lord Darnley", their father's subsidiary title, designating them as heir apparent to the Earldom of Lennox), and the husband of Mary Queen of Scots by whom they were the father of King James VI of Scotland, I of England.
The title Earl of Darnley has been created twice. The 1675 creation was as a subsidiary title for Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox (1672-1723), of Goodwood House in Sussex, an illegitimate son of King Charles II, who in the early 18th century sold the estate of Darnley to the Duke of Montrose. It was sold again in 1757 to Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, and in 1884 belonged to Stirling-Maxwell of Pollok and Keir, at which time it gave a prefix name to several seats of manufacture and other localities within its limits. Nothing remains of Darnley Castle, the seat of the Stewarts of Darnley, except possibly a round stair tower, now incorporated into a later building.
During the second half of the 20th century, Darnley experienced total transformation from being a modest semi-rural community to becoming a significant part of Glasgow's response to a post-war housing shortage. Following the construction of large housing schemes at South Nitshill (1957) and Kennishead (1966), the City of Glasgow approved the building of 2,048 homes in Darnley in 1968. This scheme was to occupy an area to the north of Nitshill Road covered by Leggatston Farm, part of the original Darnley estate taken within the City of Glasgow boundaries in 1938.
Over three phases a total of 1,336 deck-access apartments, in blocks ranging in height from between two and seven stories and with inter-linking pedestrian access corridors, were built. This fell short of the initial number planned owing to a combination of economic, political and management setbacks. It was intended that Darnley would be a largely self-supporting estate and for this reason, two primary schools and a community centre formed part of the Council's plans. A social club and bowling green, a church, a small shopping centre and a library were all added throughout the 1970s. Most of the original 1970s deck-access housing, which by the late 1990s had become dilapidated and increasingly abandoned, was demolished and replaced by a smaller quantity of modest individual houses with the remaining blocks refurbished. The present housing stock is managed by Glen Oaks Housing Association which was founded in 1991 and later expanded its scope to include regeneration projects in nearby Arden and Pollok as well as more recent developments at Southpark and Regents Park (north of Carnwadric).
The broadening of the A726 to dual carriageway status in 1983 heralded the development of the Nitshill corridor as a light industrial and retail location. Darnley Trading Estate and large retail outlets are clustered around Junction 3 of the southward extension of the M77 motorway (completed in 1997). The closure of Darnley Hospital in 1992 and the opening on the site of a £3 million 120-bed nursing home in 1993 also altered the employment opportunities for the local population and has become symptomatic of the regeneration of modern Darnley. However, there is a huge retail area with large chain stores, including a Sainsbury's supermarket (the first in Scotland, dating from 1992).
The Darnley plane tree
Mary, Queen of Scots came to Glasgow early in 1567, having left Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 24 January to collect their husband, Lord Darnley. Darnley had reportedly contracted smallpox and the Queen intended to bring them back to Holyrood on a litter as they were too weak to ride a horse. Darnley returned with their wife, only to be murdered a few days later on 10 February.
Recent development
A £20 million refit and extension programme of Sainsbury's began in February 2010; work included raising the store from 44,000sqft to 89,000sqft, constructing a mezzanine floor at the Nitshill Road side, a new petrol station and double-deck car parking area.
The new petrol station opened on 20 August 2010, the first in the company to have green-energy solutions such as solar energy panels and rain-water recycling for its car wash. The store was opened on 29 September 2010, by all 17 of the long-term employees who had been there since its initial opening in 1991. The store will become the Sainsbury's flagship store in Scotland again.

Lamprophyllite (named for its lustrous cleavage) is a rare, but widespread mineral Ti-silicate mineral usually found in intrusive agpasitic igneous rocks. Yellow, reddish brown, Vitreous, Pearly.
Lamprophyllite formula is (Sr,Ba,K,Na)2Na(Na,Fe,Mn)2Ti[Ti2O2(Si2O7)2[(O, OH,F)2 . Full isomorphic range between lampropyllite and baritollalpropyllite exist.
The general crystal-chemical formula for lampropyllite-related minerals can be written as A2[(M1)(M2)2(M3)X2] [[5] L2(Si2O7)2O2], where the contents of the O and H sheets are given in square brackets in this order and A = Sr, Ba,K, Na; M1 = Na, Mn2+; M2 = Na, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ca; M3 = Ti, Mn2+, Mg, Fe3+, Fe2+; L = Ti, Fe3+; X = OH, O, F.
Lamprophyllite is monoclinic, The mineral also has an orthorhombic polytype Unit-cell parameters mainly depend from the cationic composition in the interlayer position A crystal structures of the lamprophyllite-related minerals are based upon HOH modules consisting of a central octahedral O sheet sandwiched between two heteropolyhedral H sheets.
Lamprophyllite melts incongruently (880 °C) with formation of titanium oxides: rutile, tausonite, freudenbergite. Syntetic lamprophyllite synthesis was crystallized from melt. Tewly formed lamprophyllite show higher Sr/Ba ratioi than in equilibrium melt.

The Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) is a system to measure and describe thinking preferences in people, developed by William "Ned" Herrmann while leading management education at General Electric's Crotonville facility. It is a type of cognitive style measurement and model, and is often compared to psychological assessments such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Learning Orientation Questionnaire, DISC assessment, and others.
Brain dominance model
In their brain dominance model, Herrmann identifies four different modes of thinking:
A. Analytical thinking
Key words: logical, factual, critical, technical, quantitative.
Preferred activities: collecting data, analysis, understanding how things work, judging ideas based on facts, criteria and logical reasoning.
B. Sequential thinking
Key words: safekeeping, structured, organized, complexity or detailed, planned.
Preferred activities: following directions, detail-oriented work, step-by-step problem-solving, organization, implementation.
C. Interpersonal thinking
Key words: kinesthetic, emotional, spiritual, sensory, feeling.
Preferred activities: listening to and expressing ideas, looking for personal meaning, sensory input, group interaction.
D. Imaginative thinking
Key words: visual, holistic, intuitive, innovative, conceptual.
Preferred activities: looking at the big picture, taking initiative, challenging assumptions, visuals, metaphoric thinking, creative problem-solving, long-term thinking.
Their theory was based on theories of the modularity of cognitive functions, including well-documented specializations in the brain's cerebral cortex and limbic systems, and the research into left-right brain lateralization by Roger Wolcott Sperry, Robert Ornstein, Henry Mintzberg, and Michael Gazzaniga. These theories were further developed to reflect a metaphor for how individuals think and learn. Use of that metaphor brought later criticism by brain researchers such as Terence Hines for being overly simplistic, though advocates argue that the metaphorical construct has been beneficial in organizational contexts including business and government.
Herrmann also coined the concept Whole Brain Thinking as a description of flexibility in using thinking styles that one may cultivate in individuals or in organizations allowing the situational use of all four styles of thinking.
The Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument
The format of the instrument is a 116-question online assessment, which determines the degree of preference for each of the model's four styles of thinking. More than one style may be dominant (or a primary preference) at once in this model. For example, in Herrmann's presentation a person may have strong preferences in both analytical and sequential styles of thinking but lesser preferences in interpersonal or imaginative modes, though they assert all people use all styles to varying degrees.
A 1985 dissertation by C. Bunderson, currently CEO of the non-profit EduMetrics Institute asserts that "four stable, discrete clusters of preference exist", "scores derived from the instrument are valid indicators of the four clusters", and "The scores permit valid inferences about a person's preferences and avoidances for each of these clusters of mental activity".
Consulting and training
Based on the HBDI Assessment and Whole Brain model, Herrmann International and its global affiliates offer consulting and solutions (including workshops, programs, books and games) to improve personal or group communication, creativity, and other benefits.
Critiques
Self reporting
Measurements that require people to state preferences between terms have received criticism. Researchers C. W. Allinson and J. Hayes, in their own 1996 publication of a competing cognitive style indicator called Cognitive Style Index in the peer reviewed Journal of Management Studies, noted that "there appears to be little or no published independent evaluation of several self-report measures developed as management training tools. [including] Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument."
However, some find usefulness in self reporting measurements. Researchers G.P. Hodgkinson and E. Sadler-Smith in 2003 found cognitive style indicators generally useful for studying organizations. However, in a critique of the Cognitive Style Index indicator they opined that progress in the field had been "hampered by a proliferation of alternative constructs and assessment instruments" many unreliable with a lack of agreement over nomenclature.
To measure self-report consistency, a differential item functioning review of HBDI was published in 2007 by Jared Lees. However, their tests were supported by EduMetrics, a company on contract with Herrmann International to evaluate the system, and were therefore not completely independent.
Lateralization
Herrmann International describes an underlying basis for HBDI in the lateralization of brain function theory championed by Gazzaniga and others that associates each of the four thinking styles with a particular locus in the human brain. Analytical and sequential styles are associated with left brain and interpersonal and imaginative styles are associated with right brain, for example. Ned Herrmann described dominance of a particular thinking style with dominance with a portion of a brain hemisphere.
The notion of hemisphere dominance attracted some criticism from the neuroscience community, notably by Terence Hines who called it "pop psychology" based on unpublished EEG data. They assert that current literature instead found that both hemispheres are always involved in cognitive tasks and attempting to strengthen a specific hemisphere does not improve creativity, for example. Hines stated "No evidence is presented to show that these 'brain dominance measures' measure anything related to the differences between the two hemispheres. In other words, no evidence of validity [of hemisphere dominance] is presented.".
Creativity
Herrmann offered creativity workshops based on leveraging all the quadrants within the Whole Brain Model, rather than focusing on physiological attributes. strengthening particular thinking styles and strengthening the right hemisphere, which received critiques that creativity is not localized to a particular thinking style nor to a particular hemisphere.
A study published in the peer reviewed Creativity Research Journal in 2005 by J. Meneely and M. Portillo agreed that creativity is not localized into a particular thinking style, such as a right-brain dominance resulting in more creativity. They did however find correlation between creativity in design students based on how flexible they were using all four thinking styles equally measured by the HBDI. When students were less entrenched in a specific style of thinking they measured higher creativity using Domino's Creativity Scale (ACL-Cr).

Night Howlers is an accessory for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1992.
Contents
Players will require a copy of the D&D game Rules Cyclopedia to use this book. The D&D game presents lycanthropy as a disease player characters or NPCs can contract, rather than have Lycanthropes be a unique race. Any human player character (PC) can become a werecreature. Players using lycanthropic PCs must keep two sets of statistics, one for the human form, another for the beast, using the Werecreature Character Record Sheet, a single-page form that comes with the package. The "Werewolves' Manual" provides detailed descriptions of the D&D game's ten standard were-types, outlining their restrictions and special abilities. Available types include the weretiger, wererat, wereseal, weresharks, and devil swine, and most special abilities are received as level advancement bonuses. The D&D rules require lycanthropy victims to assume the alignment of their beast-form, which is usually Chaotic, but Night Howlers allows a PC lycanthrope to make a saving throw when transforming; a successful throw enables a bestial PC to retain the alignment of their human form. The book also includes role-playing tips to address the aspects of a werecreature's split personality.
Normally, an infected PC automatically transforms during the full moon, but Night Howlers enables them to resist the change with a successful saving throw; conversely, they may transform voluntarily by making a Constitution check, modified by the phase of the moon, and at higher levels a lycanthrope can change into an intermediate "beast-man," combining the special abilities of both their animal and human forms. The combat section clarifies the effects of damage—an injury suffered by the active form can affect the inactive form as well—and suggests penalties for lycanthropes who don't get enough rest. "Lycanthropic Procedures" handles some of the difficult aspects of shapeshifting, such as whether a lycanthrope can transform while wearing armor, or if a lycanthrope can ride a horse.
The "DM's Guide" covers the basics of converting existing characters to werecreatures, setting the tone of the game, and adapting published scenarios. A table compares the relative levels of human and werecreature characters, for help with designing balanced encounters. The "Valley of Wolves" chapter presents a setting that ties neatly into The Principalities of Glantri D&D Gazetteer. Scenario outlines are included, such as: "A-Hunting We Will Go", which illustrates the problems facing werecreatures on hunting expeditions, while "The White Wolf of Morlay" challenges the PCs to rescue a white wolf from Dame Genevieve, a magic researcher who uses lycanthropes for lab rats.
Publication history
Night Howlers was published by TSR, Inc. as a 32-page "Werewolves' Manual", a 64-page "DM's Guide", and a 32"X21" color map sheet. Design was by Ann Dupuis and editing by Jonatha Ariadne Caspian, with a cover by Fred Fields and illustrations by James Crabtree.
Reception
In the April 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 192), Rick Swan was relatively positive about the game, which they felt "achieves its modest goals quite successfully, providing slick, straightforward guidelines for incorporating lycanthropic PCs into Dungeons & Dragons campaigns", but they cautioned that players would require "a high tolerance for the system's eccentricities". Swan thought that keeping track of two sets of character statistics "sounds like a chore", but the Werecreature Character Record Sheet "makes it snap". They also felt that acquiring special abilities through level advancement was "a nice touch that encourages players to stick with their lycanthropic PCs though a campaign". On the downside, Swan was not impressed with the role-playing tips that "address only the most obvious aspects of a werecreature's split personality", commenting that head writer Ann Dupuis "seems more interested in physiology than psychology, making the book less useful than it could've been". Swan called the scenarios the game's strongest material, "designed to take optimum advantage of lycanthropic characters". Swan concluded that Night Howlers "lacks the atmosphere and spectacle of the Werewolf game... but it delivers the goods to D&D game players who want to shake up their campaigns... Used judiciously, Night Howlers can produce some of the wildest D&D sessions you've ever experienced."

On April 3, 1996, a United States Air Force Boeing CT-43A (Flight IFO-21) crashed on approach to Dubrovnik, Croatia, while on an official trade mission. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-200 originally built as T-43A navigational trainer and later converted into a CT-43A executive transport aircraft, was carrying United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and 34 other people. While attempting an instrument approach to Dubrovnik Airport, the airplane crashed into a mountainside. An Air Force technical sergeant, Shelly Kelly, survived the initial impact, but died en route to a hospital. Everyone else on board died at the scene of the crash.
The aircraft was operated by the 76th Airlift Squadron of the 86th Airlift Wing, based at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Unlike civilian 737s, the military CT-43A version was equipped with neither a flight data recorder nor a cockpit voice recorder.
Investigation
The official US Air Force accident investigation board report noted several reasons that led the Boeing CT-43A, callsign "IFO-21" (short for Implementation Force), to crash. Chief among the findings was a "failure of command, aircrew error and an improperly designed instrument approach procedure". The inclement weather was not deemed a substantial contributing factor in the crash.
The Boeing CT-43A used for this flight was formerly a T-43A navigator training aircraft that was converted for distinguished visitor travel. The flight was on an instrument flight rules non-directional beacon (NDB) approach, which is a non-precision type of instrument approach, to Runway 12 when it strayed off course. Non-precision approaches are those that do not incorporate vertical guidance. While NDB approaches are essentially obsolete in the United States, they are still used widely in other parts of the world. Because of their infrequent use in the United States, many American pilots are not fully proficient in performing them (a NASA survey showed that 60% of American transport-rated pilots had not flown an NDB approach in the last year). The investigation board determined that the approach used was not approved for Department of Defense aircraft, and should not have been used by the aircraft crew. The board determined that the particular NDB approach used required two operating ADFs, the instrument used to fly such an approach, on board the aircraft, but this aircraft only had one ADF installed. To successfully fly the approach, one ADF was required to track the outbound course of 119° from the Koločep NDB (KLP), while another ADF was required to observe when the aircraft had flown beyond the Cavtat NDB (CV), which marked the missed approach point. The alternative available to the crew was to repeatedly switch their one ADF between the signals at the KLP and CV beacons, though this would add further workload and stress to the crew. Further, the board noted that the approach was rushed, with the aircraft flying at above the proper final approach speed and had not received the proper landing clearance from the control tower.
The crash site, on a hill, was northeast of where the aircraft should have been on the inbound course to the NDB. The published NDB approach brings the inbound aircraft down a valley, and has a minimum descent height of at the missed approach point (where they should have climbed and turned to the right if the runway was not in view), which is below the elevation of the hills to the north. The runway is at above MSL. Five other aircraft had landed prior to the CT-43A and had not experienced any problems with the navigational aids. No emergency call from the pilots occurred, and they did not initiate a missed approach, though they were beyond the missed approach point when they hit the hill at 2:57 pm local time.
Each country is responsible for publishing the approach charts, including minimum descent heights, for its airports, and the investigators noted that the minimum in mountainous terrain in the United States is , as compared to the on the chart given to the crew of IFO-21. It was a requirement of the US Air Force to review and approve all charts, and to ban flights into airports for which the charts did not meet the proper American aviation standards. The commander of the 86th Operations Group, Col. John E. Mazurowski, revealed that they had requested (but not yet received) approval to waive the review for Dubrovnik, as the approach had worked for years, and the delay of a full review could hamper the interests of the American diplomatic mission.
Victims
Thirty-five people, six military crewmembers and twenty-nine civilians, died in the crash. Thirty-three of the victims were Americans and two were Croatians. Twelve Department of Commerce officials, including Secretary Brown, were among the deceased.
Outcomes
Dubrovnik Airport was singled out for an improperly designed approach and landing procedure.
A number of US Air Force (USAF) officers were found to have contributed to a failure of command. The general commanding the 86th Airlift Wing, Brig. Gen. William E. Stevens, vice-commander Col. Roger W. Hansen, and the commander of the 86th Operations Group, Col. John E. Mazurowski, were all relieved of their posts.
Mazurowski was later found guilty of a dereliction of duties and was demoted to major, while 12 other officers were reprimanded.
The USAF ordered all military aircraft to be equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder.
American military aircraft are no longer allowed to fly into airports without explicit approval from the United States Department of Defense, not even for high-ranking diplomatic missions.
Legacy
The area of the crash site is identified by a large stainless steel cross on Stražišće peak. Hikers can reach the peak via the "Ronald Brown Path", which is named in commemoration of the U.S. Secretary of Commerce who died in the crash.
A memorial room has been installed in the Ronald Brown memorial house in the old city of Dubrovnik. It features portraits of the crash victims as well as a guest book.
The head of navigation at Čilipi Airport, Niko Jerkuić, was found dead three days after the accident with a bullet wound to their chest. The police investigation concluded that the case was a suicide.
In popular culture
The crash of IFO-21 was covered in "Fog of War", an episode from the fourth season (2007) of the internationally syndicated Canadian TV documentary series Mayday.

Flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA) is an immobilization-free technology used for characterization and quantification of biomolecular interaction and protein concentration under native conditions. In the FIDA assay, the size of a ligand (indicator) with affinity to the target analyte is measured. When the indicator interacts with the analyte the apparent size increases and this change in size can be used to determine the analyte concentration and interaction. Additionally, the hydrodynamic radius of the analyte-indicator complex is obtained. A FIDA assay is typically completed in minutes and only requires a modest sample consumption of a few µl.
Applications
Quantification of analytes (e.g. proteins, peptides, DNA, nanoparticles) in complex solutions (e.g. plasma and fermentation broth )
Determination of
affinity constants
binding kinetics
molecular size (hydrodynamic radius)
oligomeric state
diffusion coefficient
Principle
The FIDA principle is based on measuring the change in the apparent size (diffusivity) of a selective indicator interacting with the analyte molecule. The apparent indicator size is measured by Taylor dispersion analysis in a capillary under hydrodynamic flow.

Jane Harris is a British television director and producer, best known for their contributions to soap operas, including EastEnders and Family Affairs.
Career
Harris worked on the BBC play Cathy Come Home in 1966. The play was produced by Tony Garnett, who Harris has described as their mentor. They later moved to America, where they worked on the soap opera General Hospital, and the successful action series The A-Team. When they returned to the United Kingdom, they worked for the BBC soap opera EastEnders.
In 1988, they were the serial's programme editor, but rose to producer in 1995, and eventually took control of the show as the series/executive producer in 1996, following the departure of Corinne Hollingworth. At EastEnders, Harris was responsible for introducing the di Marco family, the Flahertys, Irene Hills, Lorna Cartwright and Ben Mitchell as well as bringing back Frank Butcher and Dot Cotton as full-time characters. Axings included characters such as Ted Hills, Frankie Pierre and Felix Kawalski.
Storylines that aired under their tenure included Phil Mitchell's alcoholism, Ricky Butcher and Bianca Jackson's wedding, the critically panned Ireland episodes, and Cindy Beale's attempted assassination of Ian Beale, which brought in an audience of twenty three million in 1996, roughly four million more than rival Coronation Street. Harris's contributions to the soap were awarded in 1997, when EastEnders won the BAFTA for "Best Drama Series."
They shared the award with producer, Corrinne Hollingworth. They left the series at the end of 1997, and was succeeded by Matthew Robinson. Following this, Harris moved to channel five to become the series producer of its flagship soap opera Family Affairs, taking over from co-creator and their former boss on EastEnders, Corinne Hollingworth. They have also worked as an assistant director on various programmes including the police dramas Mersey Beat (2001) and Beech is Back (2001).

Cuca is a commune in Argeș County, Muntenia, Romania. It is composed of fourteen villages: Bălțata, Bărbălani, Cârcești, Cotu, Crivățu, Cuca, Lăunele de Sus, Măcăi, Mănești, Sinești, Stănicei, Teodorești, Valea Cucii and Vonigeasa. It was one of the most remote places in Romania. Today, in Romanian language, Cuca Măcăii means "a remote village or place, very difficult to reach".
History
The oldest document about Cuca is from April 3, 1853, referring to an even older document, from 1537. The commune was formed in 1968 at its current shape by merging the former communes Cuca and Lăunele. Another former commune was Măcăi.
Geography
Cuca is placed in the Getic Platform, subdivision Cotmeana Platform. The relief is segmented by many parallel valleys, while the villages are on the top of the hills, separated by forest areas. The rivers flow from north to south, south-east or south-west. The valleys dry up in summer. The altitude varies from .
The climate is temperate, with moderate summers and cold winters. The humidity is usually high.
Villages
The commune includes 14 small villages (the largest number in Argeș County).
Transportation
There are two national roads close to Cuca:
DN 7 (or E81) Pitești – Râmnicu Vâlcea
DN 67b Pitești – Drăgășani.
From these roads, the access way to Cuca is via local county roads:
DJ 678a (asphalted) connects Cuca to South with Vâlcea County and DN 67b.
DJ 678e (unasphalted) connects Teodorești village with DJ 678a.
DJ 703 (asphalted to North and unasphalted to South) connects Cuca with DN 7 to North and with DN 67b to South, in Olt County.
The distances to the nearest towns are:
Pitești 42 km
Râmnicu Vâlcea 32 km
Curtea de Argeș 52 km
Drăgășani 52 km
Slatina 80 km
Bucharest 164 km.
Economy
Resources
Cuca has two major resources: forests and fruit trees. The forests cover a big part of the commune and all the villages have direct access to the wooded areas. Nearly all the remaining terrain is used for fruit trees (mainly plum trees). The fruits are used to make țuică, a Romanian alcoholic drink.
Firms
There are 21 firms in the commune, including a pharmaceutical point and small local shops. There are no industrial or agricultural companies. The big distances to nearby cities (see #transportation) and the lack of bus lines makes it very difficult for the local population to find a good job.
Problems
The main problem for the economy is isolation (see #Transportation). The second problem is the lack of water. Some people say that in Cuca, water is as precious as in Sahara Desert. The villages are on the top of the hills and the rivers are about 100 m below the villages and they dry up in summer (see #Geography). The phreatic waters are even deeper, so permanent phreatic water exists more than 100 m below the river valleys. Pumping water from such depth is nearly impossible. A water pipeline was constructed to bring water to the villages in Cuca. For this, the pipe had to be longer than 100 km. It drains water from the river Topolog and continues south to other communes with similar water problems.
The legend of Cuca Măcăii
In the Romanian language, Cuca Măcăii defines a remote village or place, very difficult to reach. It is still unknown how this expression appeared. However, the Măcăi village is called by the locals Cuca Măcăii. Many people associate the commune Cuca with Cuca Măcăii. The entire commune is formed by small villages, isolated in the forest (see Villages). In the past, transportation was very difficult. Until 1922 the national road DN 67b did not exist. Older maps show that even the road that connects Pitești and Râmnicu Vâlcea did not exist. Being isolated by sharp valleys and long, parallel hills (see Geography), the land where Cuca is today must have been a very isolated place.

In December 2000, UNESCO declared the historical center of Arequipa a World Heritage Site, stating the following:
"The historical center of Arequipa is an example of ornamented architecture, represents a masterpiece of the creative coalition of European and native characteristics. A colonial town challenged by the conditions of nature, the indigenous influences, the conquest process and evangelism as well as for a spectacular natural scenario."
Description
The historic centre of Arequipa, built in volcanic sillar rock, represents an integration of European and native building techniques and characteristics, expressed in the admirable work of colonial masters and Criollo and Indian masons. This combination of influences is illustrated by the city's robust walls, archways and vaults, courtyards and open spaces, and the intricate Baroque decoration of its facades.

Coda is a Rock en Español bands from Mexico, formed in 1989. The band had much of success in the early 1990s, releasing four albums. In the late 1990s, the band had several line-up changes; the band disbanded in 2000, but resurfaced in 2002 with a new line-up.
Band history
Early years (1989−1990)
Coda was formed in 1989 by Salvador "Chava" Aguilar and Toño Ruíz with the intention to do quality rock music. They recruited Jesús "Chucho" Esquivel, Zitto Bremont and Diego Benyure. Their first show was in April 1989 when they opened a concert for another band at the Isabel Corona Theater in Mexico. In 1990, they released an EP called Tiempo Perfecto that was poorly received. Shortly after, Diego and Zitto left the band and were replaced with David Melchor and Allán Pérez respectively.
Rise to fame (1991–1994)
In December 1991, Raúl Vázquez, general director of Sony Music, heard the band and decided to sign them. The following year, they started working on their first full-length album. Enciéndelo was finally released in 1993 produced by Luis Carlos Maluly. The album managed to put the band on the radar and featured singles like "Tócame", "Eternamente", and "Sin Ti No Se Continuar". The video of "Tócame", directed by Memo del Bosque peaked at #1 in the TV channel TeleHit.
Following the success of the album, they opened concerts in Mexico for bands like Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe, and toured intensively through their country, playing for the first time at the Palacio de los Deportes of Mexico. They also won Best Hard Rock Band at the VIII National Survey Awards.
Success with second album (1995–1998)
In February 1995, the band moved to Farnham, England to record their next album at Jacob's Studios. Veinte Para Las Doce was produced by Robin Black (Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Bee Gees and Supertramp) and arranged by Spike Edney, (a recurrent Keyboardist from the 1986 Magic Tour by Queen). It was released in 1995 and the power ballad "Aún" reached the top of the Mexican charts and became one of the biggest classic songs from the mid 90s in Ibero-America. The song ranked 68 on the VH1 list Las 100 + grandiosas canciones de los 90´s en español. The song included a string arrangement by Edney. Also, the video of the title song peaked at #1 at TeleHit.
To support the album, they toured through Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and the United States. They also played at the IX Festival Nuestro Rock with Caifanes, El Tri, and La Ley. From 1995 to 1996 they played at the Plaza de Toros México, Estadio Centenario at Cuernavaca, and the Metropolitan Theater of Mexico.
After extensive touring, the band went to the studio again and recorded their next album titled Nivel 3. The album was released in 1997 and produced by Alejandro Zepeda and the band. It featured the singles "Luz Roja" and "No Digas No". In November, they opened a concert for Scorpions at the Palacio de los Deportes of Mexico. They also joined the Universo Musical 1997 tour that started in Chihuahua and finished in Cancún visiting 91 cities. In 1998, they also won the Best Hard Rock Band Award from the Nuestro Rock Awards.
Transition and retirement (1998–2000)
In 1998, lead singer Chava Aguilar left the band citing personal reasons. They were replaced by Eduardo Contreras (formerly of Tercer Acto). With Contreras in front, they continued to tour. The following year, they were nominated again for the Best Hard Rock Band Award of the Nuestro Rock Awards.
During this period of transition, the band allegedly wrote 30 songs. They decided to sign with Polygram, but at that time, the label merged with Universal Records. This ultimately left the band in the air, which prompted Pérez and Esquivel to leave the band. They were replaced by Fito Cedillo and Andrés Mura.
In 2000, band co-founder, Toño Ruíz decided to retire the band and to produce other artists. The rest of the band members also started other musical ventures.
Band reunion (2002–)
In September 2002, former singer and co-founder, Chava Aguilar, decided to start the band again after receiving e-mails from fans asking them to do so. They initially planned to go solo, but eventually decided to recruit Nicolas Loizaga (Guitar), Adrian Rojas (Bass), Luis Dominguez (Keyboards),who had previously played in Brujha, and Charly Salazar (Drums). Aguilar had met them in the old Coda days. The band became Retto. In that period the band co-wrote/produced over 20 songs and recorded them together with Gazú (LAML), Sergio Santacruz (Neón), and Joan Romagosa (Los Necios).
During that period Retto started preparing for a tour. After 2 years of moving round in circles and due to differences with Aguilar and Manager Lilian de Leon, Loizaga, Rojas and Dominguez left the band. They recruited an entire new line-up with Enrique Cuevas (guitars), Cesar "Gusano" (bass), Adan Ramos (drums), and Adrian Keys (keyboards). In June 2004, the band started recording material for their next album. Vivo was finally released July 6, 2006.

Gilbert H. Grosvenor Hall is a historic building in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Canada. The 19th-century building has served as a post office, library, and interpretive centre.
History
The building was originally built as the Baddeck Post Office and Custom House, Opening in 1886. The post office was located on the main floor with the custom house on the upper floor. The post office relocated in 1956, and the building was sold to Samuel Gayley who gave it to their wife Gertrude Gayley—the granddaughter of Alexander Graham Bell. Gertrude Gayley named the building after their father, Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor a former editor of National Geographic Magazine. The building was given to the Baddeck Library Board and housed the Baddeck Library until the 1980s. The property was recognized as an historic property by Nova Scotia's Heritage Property Act in 1983. In 1999 the building became home to the Bras d'Or Lakes and Watershed Interpretive Centre.
Design
The building is three storeys tall and built of red sandstone excavated from Boularderie, Nova Scotia. It was designed by Thomas Fuller, Chief Architect of Canada and co-designer of Ottawa's first Parliament buildings. Its design is typical of 19th-century Canadian post offices, featuring Romanesque Revival elements. The face of former local Member of Parliament Charles J. Campbell is carved into the stone above the entrance. The clock, located on the west gable, was added in 1912.

Shea's Hippodrome Theatre was a movie house that opened in 1914 in Buffalo, New York. It was renamed the Center Theater, following a renovation in 1951. In 1983, the theater closed and the building was demolished.
Early years
Shea's Hippodrome Theatre was designed by architect, Leon H. Lempert, Jr. and constructed in 1914. It was located at 580 Main Street in downtown Buffalo now known as "Theatre Historic District". The theater was entertainment mogul, Michael Shea's first movie house in Buffalo with 2,800 seats and a staff of nearly 100 employees. It was a state-of-the-art facility for its time and was designed and furnished with little concern for expense. Shea's Hippodrome Theatre was praised for the convenience and comfort it provided for its patrons.
A custom pipe organ was designed and installed in 1922 by The Rudolph Wurlitzer Co., model: Opus 585. In 1957, the organ was sold and changed owners several times in the ensuing decades. In 2005, the organ was purchased and restored by the Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania and is currently operational.
Renovation
In 1951, in an effort to modernize the facility, Shea's Hippodrome Theatre underwent a major renovation designed by architect Michael J. DeAngelis. The original marquee was replaced with modern signage and the building was renamed the "Center Theater", after being sold by Shea to Paramount decades earlier. Possibly by design, many of the original architectural details were unable to be seen, due to the darkness of the renovated interior spaces. It remained a movie theater until it closed in 1983.
Shea's Performing Arts Center
Shea's Performing Arts Center is located in Buffalo's Theatre Historic District and is comprised 3 theaters in close proximity to each other on Main Street, where Shea's Hippodrome Theatre once stood. The three theatres are: Shea's Buffalo Theatre, Shea's Smith Theatre, and Shea's 710 Theatre.

August Larson (July 2, 1904 – November 4, 1981) was a highly decorated officer of the United States Marine Corps with the rank of major general, who is most noted for their service as commanding officer of 22nd Marine Regiment during the Battle of Okinawa and later than director of personnel at Headquarters Marine Corps.
Early career
August Larson was born on July 2, 1904, in Sherburn, Minnesota, and attended high school there. Following graduation in 1922, they enrolled at the University of Minnesota, where they studied for three years. Larson left college and enlisted in the Marine Corps on January 13, 1928. They served three years as enlisted rank and reached the rank of NCO. Larson was attached to the NCO meritorious program and also received the Good Conduct Medal for their "exemplary behavior and efficiency".
Upon receiving their commission of second lieutenant on February 26th 1931, Larson was sent to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for their officer training. After one year of studies, they were attached to the 4th Marine Regiment under Colonel Emile P. Moses and sailed for China in December 1932. Larson took part in the guard duties at Shanghai International Settlement and later attended the Russian language course there.
In September 1934, they were attached to the Marine detachment aboard the cruiser USS Augusta under then-Captain Chester W. Nimitz and took part in cruises to the Dutch East Indies and Australia. Larson returned to the United States in November 1935, and after a brief leave they were ordered to the Marine Base Quantico, Virginia, where they took part in the training of the Marine detachment for President's Roosevelt residence at Warm Springs, Georgia.
In May 1936 they were assigned to the Junior Course at Marine Corps Schools Quantico. Following their graduation, they were attached to the 5th Marine Regiment under Colonel Samuel M. Harrington. During their time at Quantico, Larson was a member of the Marine Corps Rifle and Pistol Team and later coached the team in 1938 and 1939. They were ordered to the course at Ordnance Field Service School at Raritan Arsenal in Metuchen, New Jersey, during September 1939 and graduated in December of that year.
World War II
Following Christmas in 1939, Larson joined the Sea School Detachment at Norfolk Navy Yard and then assumed command of the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier USS Wasp under Captain John W. Reeves. While aboard this ship, they took part in the maneuvers off the coast of Guantánamo Bay and Culebra, Puerto Rico.
Larson was succeeded by their deputy, first lieutenant Ronald R. Van Stockum, and ordered back to Quantico in February 1942 and assigned to the staff Commandant of Marine Corps Schools, Brigadier General Samuel M. Harrington. They served under their old superior until March 1944 and took part in the training of new marine officers. During their time there, they reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and also attended Command and Staff course. This non-combat job did not satisfy them and requested combat duty, which was granted.
They were ordered to the Pacific area at the beginning of April 1944 and was attached to 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at Guadalcanal, which had just been activated under the command of Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd. Larson was appointed assistant chief of staff for supply and took part in the Amphibious landing on Guam in July 1944, during which their brigade assisted in mop-up operations for a month. They distinguished themselves in this capacity and received the Legion of Merit with Combat "V" for their service on Guam.
After the 1st Marine Brigade was reorganized as 6th Marine Division in September 1944, Larson remained in the same capacity with the unit. The 6th Division underwent "rugged" training on Guadalcanal between October 1944 and January 1945 and was attached to the III Marine Amphibious Corps for the Battle of Okinawa.
Larson landed on Okinawa at the beginning of April 1945 and distinguished themselves again in coordinating the supply of material and ammunition to the front line units. They received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V" for their efforts.
Tough Japanese resistance halted the advance of 22nd Marine Regiment. Division Commander General Shepherd was not satisfied with the progress of the regiment and relieved regimental commander, Colonel Merlin F. Schneider and their executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Karl K. Louther. Shepherd appointed highly decorated Colonel Harold C. Roberts as new regimental commander and Larson as their executive officer on May 17, 1945.
The 22nd Regiment fought its way up Sugar Loaf Hill, which was an elevated position dominating the battlefield. Colonel Roberts was killed by a Japanese sniper on June 18th and Larson assumed the command of the regiment as senior officer present. They personally conducted several reconnaissance missions in the front line positions and was slightly wounded. They helped to reorganize a badly-depleted battalion of the regiment. Okinawa was declared secured few days later, on June 22nd.
For their gallantry in action, Larson was decorated with the Silver Star, the third-highest personal decoration for valor in combat. they also received the Purple Heart for theirs wounds.
Later career
They resumed their duties as an executive officer on June 22, 1945, and spent the next several months on Guam, where the 6th Marine Division underwent preparations for future combat deployment. The Surrender of Japan in August 1945 changed those plans. The 22nd Marines were ordered to Tsingtao, China at the beginning of October 1945 in order to repatriate Japanese soldiers and nationals back to Japan.
When 22nd Marines were deactivated at the end of March 1946, Larson remained in China and was transferred to Peiping, where they were appointed commanding officer of the 5th Marine Regiment. They were also promoted to the rank of colonel at the same time. In this capacity, they supervised the removal of Marine units of their regiment from China, and the handover of some areas to Nationalist Chinese government.
Larson returned to the U. S. in August 1946 and received the Chinese Special Breast Order of Yun Hui for their service during the repatriation of Japanese. They did not stay long without assignment. Their old superior, Major General Shepherd, served as commanding officer of Troop Training Unit, Amphibious Training Command, U.S. Atlantic Fleet at Little Creek, Virginia, and appointed Larson Assistant Chief of Staff for Supply.
In March 1949 they attended the Logistics course at Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and then a course at the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. In June 1950, Larson was appointed Marine Corps liaison officer within Logistics Plans Division in the Office of Chief of Naval Operations under Admiral William Fechteler. They then served in the same capacity in the office of Secretary of Joint Chiefs of Staff until summer of 1953.
They left Washington in August 1953, when Commandant of the Marine Corps and their old superior, Lemuel C. Shepherd, established the Advanced Research Group at Quantico within the Marine Corps Schools. This group was tasked with the development of the recommendations on how the MAGTF should evolve structurally to meet the challenges of atomic warfare and new technologies such as helicopters and jet aircraft. The members of the group were Thomas J. Coolley, John P. Condon, Joseph N. Renner, Carson A. Roberts, Samuel R. Shaw, George R. E. Shell, Eustace R. Smoak, William J. Van Ryzin, and Richard G. Weede.
During July 1955, Larson was transferred to the California and appointed deputy commander of Camp Pendleton under Major General George F. Good. In this capacity they were co-responsible for the training of new recruits and finally received promotion to the rank of brigadier general on July 1, 1956.
Larson was ordered to Okinawa in July 1957 and appointed assistant division commander, 3rd Marine Division under Major General Francis M. McAlister. They took part in defense duties in the Far East until June 1958.
Following their return, Larson served briefly as deputy chief of staff for research and development, before being appointed director of personnel in August 1958. They were promoted to the rank of major general in August 1959 and served in that capacity until November 1962. They were succeeded by Major General Lewis J. Fields and spent next four months assigned to the Headquarters Marine Corps.
Larson retired from active duty on February 1, 1963, after 35 years of active service. They settled in Annandale, Virginia, and died there on November 4, 1981. General Larson is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, together with their wife, Alice Kennedy Larson (1915–2011).

Jacques Arthuys (15 February 1894 – 9 September 1943) was a French industrialist, a right-wing intellectual and early leader of the French Fascist movement.
They were initially a pan-European but became opposed to the Nazi movement.
During World War II (1939–45) they were leader of a French Resistance organization. They were arrested, deported to a concentration camp and killed by the Germans.
Early years
Jacques Arthuys was born on 15 February 1894 in Belfort, son of an officer.
They attended Catholic secondary schools, then studied the law, graduating in 1913 with a degree from the University of Nancy.
During World War I (1914–18) they joined the army as a volunteer.
They were commissioned in 1915 and made a lieutenant in 1916.
After being transferred to the air force, they led fighter and bomber squadrons in France and Italy.
Artuys was wounded twice, was given four citations and the Legion of Honour.
Arthuys left the military in 1920 and founded a building materials company in Roubaix-Tourcoing.
They and their father-in-law were directors of the Cazeneuve lathe company.
Inter-war politics
Right-wing intellectual
Arthuys helped the right-wing journalist Georges Valois direct the activities of the royalist Action Française movement that concerned the economy.
In 1921 Arthuys' book Le Problème de la monnaie was published by Valois.
Arthuys argued that monetary inflation might be the first cause of inflation, but the negative balance of payments was also a factor.
A stable currency was essential, and the franc-or proposed by Valois was the solution.
They were not a royalist, but doubted that the republican government could solve the problems France was facing.
In late 1921 Arthuys and Valois were members of an organizing committee for a Semaine de la monnaie.
In late 1922 Valois started working towards creating an Estates General of French Production, a movement that would bring together industrialists and leaders of labour unions to work on solutions to social and economic issues.
The textile manufacturer Eugène Mathon headed the national committee, which included Valois, Arthuys, Bernard de Vésins and several others.
As the post-war economic crisis grew, Arthuys and Valois were alarmed at the excess of state expenditure over revenue, causing a large and growing burden of debt.
German reparations could not cover this debt, even if were paid, which they doubted.
The only solution was to accept a drop in standards of living and slash spending, sell off state monopolies and fire civil servants.
This would be political suicide for the government, but the Estates General should block alternatives like inflation, repudiation or bankruptcy, and should be prepared to take over control from parliament.
Arthuys' published Les combattants in 1925, a book in which they described how the combatants in the war had been transformed by their experience from simple patriots into warriors.
They argued that since the war the leftists had exposed the country to many dangers.
The veterans, who should have seized power soon after the war, should now reverse this situation.
Arthuys contrasted the heroism and endurance of the veterans to the "mediocre and the cowards who make up democratic governments".
On 26 February 1925 Valois, Arthuys and others launched Le Nouveau siècle, a newspaper that was supported by some industrialists and that expressed the views of their right-wing group.
Arthuys was assisted as editor by the experienced conservative journalists Jacques Roujon and Léopold Marcellin.
The official editorial staff was Valois, Arthuys, Philippe Barrès and Hubert Bourgin of the Ligue des Patriotes.
The journal tried to reach a broad audience, and as a result was dull. It constantly struggled financially.
Fascist leader
In April 1925 Valois founded Les Légions pour la politique de la victoire, a veterans' organization with Arthuys as nominal president.
On 11 November 1925 this became the Faisceau des Combattants et des Producteurs (Collective of Combatants and Producers).
The Faisceau was the first French political party that supported Benito Mussolini's ideas.
The party was joined by Hubert Lagardelle, founder of Le Mouvement socialiste, and Marcel Bucard, later to be founder of the Mouvement Franciste.
They advocated a system based on Italian Fascism and led by the veterans.
Valois and Arthuys saw fascism as a pan-European movement, taking different forms in different countries, that would replace the old liberal and bourgeois order with a modern state that would mobilize industry with "a policy of high wages and large profits."
Valois and Arthuys criticized the royalist Action Française for its passive attitude.
Violence often broke out between the Faisceau and rival groups on both the left and the right.
Just before Christmas 1925 a meeting of the Jeunesses fascistes, the university section of the Faisceau, was violently interrupted by Camelots du Roi, members of "combat groups" of the Action Française.
Arthuys met Le Corbusier in March 1927 and soon after proposed that they should be minister of urbanism and housing, but Le Corbusier refused to get involved in politics.
Later views
Lack of money and the accession of the nationalist government of Raymond Poincaré on 23 July 1926 caused the Faisceau to start disintegrating.
By mid-1927 the Faisceau had lost nearly all its members.
A year later the remaining fascist loyalists founded the Revolutionary Fascist Party.
Valois, however, had started to move back towards the left.
On 9 May 1928 the Republican Syndicalist Party (Parti républicain syndicaliste, PRS) was founded, led by Valois, Arthuys, Hubert Bourgin and Charles Albert.
The first issue of the party's journal, Cahiers bleus, appeared on 15 August 1928 with contributors such as Pierre Mendès France, Pietro Nenni, Emmanuel Berl, Édouard Berth and future Fascist sympathisers such as Bertrand de Jouvenel, Marcel Déat and Paul Marion.
In the 1930s Arthuys was a member of the right-wing nationalist Croix-de-Feu league created by François de La Rocque.
When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 Arthuys strongly opposed Nazism.
In 1936 Arthuys, the industrialist Pierre Lefaurichon and the architect Roger Souchère launched the Mouvement des classes moyennes (Movement of the middle classes), based in Paris.
World War II
Defeat
After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Arthuys served as a captain in the 60th Divisional Reconnaissance Group.
Their unit retreated from the Sedan to Orange without loss, and Arthuys wanted to continue fighting in the Army of the Alps.
When the armistice was signed they hid their unit's arms in the Orange region and was demobilized.
They visited Vichy and spoke with Jean Bichelonne, René Belin and Henry du Moulin de Labarthète.
They then returned to Paris where they contacted some officers of the Army's General Staff.
The Deuxième Bureau put them in touch with Colonel Alfred Heurtaux.
First resistance organization
Pierre Lefaurichon, who had been severely disabled in the First World War, organized relief work for prison camps in the Paris region starting in June 1940, helped arrange escapes, and began to recruit resistance fighters.
After Arthuys returned to Paris they took command of the new resistance organization which they ran from their home on the Avenue Victor Hugo, helped by their secretary Vera Obolensky.
In November 1940 they defined the goals of their group as helping people hunted by the Germans to reach the free zone of France, publishing letters to the French people to raise their awareness, recruiting from the military and setting up an intelligence organization.
Organisation civile et militaire
Arthuys met Colonel Alfred Touny in Saumur during a veterans' reunion.
Touny helped create the Organisation civile et militaire (OCM).
The OCM was formed in December 1940 through the merger of the group headed by the Arthuys, the professional officers Colonels Alfred Heurtaux and Alfred Touny, and the group headed by the economic consultant and lobbyist Maxime Blocq-Mascart.
The two groups had complementary structures.
Blocq-Mascart's group provided leadership, while the Arthuys group could provide the rank and file drawn from the pre-war National Confederation of the Middle Classes.
Arthuys headed the OCM, which had a structure based on the military.
The First Bureau was in charge of general organization and directed by Jean Mayer, the Second Bureau was headed by Touny and dedicated to Intelligence, the Third Bureau was in charge of operations, also under Jean Mayer. Blocq-Mascart retained Civil Affairs.
The OCM soon began to absorb or make contact with other small groups and networks.
The OCM drew its recruits from senior industrialists, civil servants and professionals. The first priorities were collection of intelligence and organization of fighting units.
The group also published Cahiers that discussed the post-war economy and politics, which gave it the reputation of being elitist and technocratic.
Flight, arrest and death
A son of Colonel Heurtaux was arrested in February 1941.
Heurtaux intervened at Vichy and at the German military headquarters in Paris to get their son released.
Instead, they were also arrested.
For some time Arthuys and Lefaurichon went into hiding in the provinces.
They returned to Paris, and on 21 December 1941 both men were arrested at Lefaurichon's home.
After Arthuys was arrested by the Gestapo, leadership of the OCM was assumed by Colonel Alfred Touny.
It continued to provide intelligence to the Free French leaders in exile in Britain.
Arthuys was deported to Hinzert concentration camp, where they died on 9 September 1943.
On 13 July 1945 Arthuys was given the retroactive rank of Colonel, effective 1 December 1941.

Ithiel de Sola Pool (October 26, 1917 – March 11, 1984) was an American academic who was a widely celebrated and often controversial figure in the field of social sciences and information technology. They did significant research on technology and its effects on society. They coined the term "convergence" to describe the effect of various scientific innovations on society in a futuristic world, and made predictions of ways that technology would impact society that were often prescient. In their 1983 book Technologies of Freedom, they predicted that digital electronics would allow convergence between historically separated modes of communication, and that these modes would eventually become one single grand system.
Early life and education
De Sola Pool was the son of David de Sola Pool, spiritual leader of the Sephardic Congregation Shearith Israel in New York City. Their mother was Tamar Hirschensohn, the Palestine-born daughter of Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn. Their sister was Naomi de Sola Pool, a physician.
Pool was initially educated at an Ethical Culture School in New York City. They attended the University of Chicago, where they received a Bachelor of Arts in 1938, a Master of Arts in 1939, and their Ph.D. in 1952. The university was under the direction of Robert Maynard Hutchins, its president from 1929 to 1945, a period when it was called "the birthplace of modern American social sciences."
Career
During World War II, Pool went to Washington, D.C., where, under Harold Lasswell, they studied and researched the effects of Nazi and communist propaganda. They held academic appointments at Stanford University, and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they joined the MIT Center for International Studies. They remained at MIT for more than 30 years, researching the effects of communication technology on global politics.
Work
De Sola Pool's earliest interest was the study of rhetorical symbols of democracy, in which they analyzed speechmakers of totalitarian regimes to decipher the power and influence of words. However, they always returned to their fascination with technology and communications.
They were instrumental in establishing the small world hypothesis now known as the Six Degrees of Separation.
They eventually became the leading authority on the social and political effects of communications. In 1973, their name appeared in The Communications Handbook, where they defined the social and political effects of technological advances in a chapter called "Public Opinion." In 1983, Pool proved to be at the forefront of research into the ramifications of technological innovations in communication with publications such as "Forecasting Telephone and Communication Flows." They studied the rise of electronic media, noting that print media was becoming more expensive per word published, while the opposite was true for electronic media. In their 1983 publication "Tracking the flow of information science", they made a series of predictions that came to accurately describe 21st century communication: growing quickly and increasingly electronic, with people experiencing information overload and fragmented streams of information.
Pool was reunited with their former mentors Roger Hurwitz and Hirshue Inose to co-author the work A Census of Japan and the US. This would become one of their last forays into the literary world. They once again defined demand toward a global information society.
De Sola Pool was the chair and founder of the MIT political science department. They were often pulled away from MIT to advise the United States and other governments on various matters. In 1965, they wrote "The Kaiser, the Tsar, and the Computer," an essay about a computer-simulated international crisis. Later, their interest in quantitative analysis and communications would contribute to computer models to study human behavior.
The idea of freedom in all forms was extremely important to Pool. As a young man, Pool was a devout Trotskyite, though they quickly became disillusioned with this form of politics after seeing people's ideals used to take away the freedom for which they had initially fought.
Simulmatics Corporation
De Sola Pool was one of the leaders of the Simulmatics Corporation, a data science firm which used algorithms to target voters and consumers. Jill Lepore wrote extensively about the Simulmatics Corporation in their 2020 book If, Then: How the Simulmatics Corporation Invented the Future.
Controversies
Pool's work with the Simulmatics Corporation included Department of Defense contracts to predict counter-insurgencies in Vietnam; they also are involved in Simulmatics' efforts to predict where race riots would occur in the United States. Daniel Ellsberg would later say of Pool, "I thought of them as the most corrupt social scientist I had ever met, without question." Much of the work Pool led for Simulmatics in Vietnam was also of very low quality; one of their collaborators, a PhD in psychology, believed that Pool did not know what a null hypothesis was, saying, "He didn't know why they couldn't conclude that TV was having no effect if they couldn't measure it." Pool's work for the government made them an extremely controversial figure, both within social sciences and on the MIT Campus in the late 1960s; many students reviled him. In 1969, protesters called Pool a "war criminal." Simulmatics went bust shortly thereafter.
Beginning in 1975, Pool protested the growing power of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Their first involvement in IRB issues was when an MIT IRB told one of Pool's colleagues they could not interview Boston antibusing activists, reasoning that their colleague's research could be used against the criminals. Pool believed that much social science work was roughly equivalent to journalism and deserved equal protections against prior restraint.
Personal life
While at the University of Chicago, they met Judith Graham, who became an important researcher in hemophilia. They married in 1938, when they were a sophomore. Their first son, Jonathan, was born in 1942, and son Robert followed in 1945. The de Sola Pools divorced in 1953. In 1956 Ithiel married Jean Natalie MacKenzie (1919-2001). From that marriage they had one child Adam MacKenzie de Sola Pool.
Legacy
Pool died in 1984 from cancer. At that point in their career, they were a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, advising several countries around the world. Pool felt that the world was underestimating the importance of communications and technical change. Their greatest legacy was their book Technologies of Freedom (1983).
The American Political Science Association has established an Ithiel de Sola Pool prize that is awarded every three years. The Salzburg Global Seminar has established a prize lecture in the name of Ithiel de Sola Pool.

The Longest Yard is a 2005 American sports comedy film directed by Peter Segal and written by Sheldon Turner. A remake of 1974's The Longest Yard, it stars Adam Sandler as a washed-up former professional quarterback who, in exchange for reduced prison sentence, is forced to assemble a football team to play against the guards. The film co-stars Chris Rock, James Cromwell, Nelly, William Fichtner and Burt Reynolds, who played Sandler's role in the original.
It was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States and Sony Pictures Releasing–under the Columbia Pictures label–in other territories on May 27, 2005.
Plot
Paul Crewe is a former NFL quarterback who was accused of shaving points, though it was never proven. Nevertheless, they were placed on federal probation for five years. One night, they get drunk during a party and goes joyriding through San Diego in the Bentley of their girlfriend Lena, causing a police chase and the car to crash. Their probation is revoked and they are sentenced to three years in prison as a result.
Using their influence and contacts, Texas warden Rudolph Hazen, an avid football fan, manages to have Crewe transferred into their prison as they wish to use them as a coach for their personal football team composed of their prison guards to boost their reputation for future elections as State Governor. Using a week in a hot box to coerce him, Crewe recommends that the Guards, led by head guard Captain Knauer, play a tune-up game, a game between the Guards and a team that they easily slaughter to boost morale. Hazen tasks Crewe with forming a team composed of the prison inmates, believing that they will be unable to unite the unruly prisoners, thus not only achieving their goals, but also exerting their power over the inmates.
Crewe befriends Caretaker, who helps organize tryouts but finds a mostly inept roster due to Crewe's legacy. Seeing the team forming attracts former college football star Nate Scarborough, who decides to help coach the team by gathering several intimidating inmates, most of whom join in order to exact revenge against the abusive guards, bolstering their defense. Caretaker implores Crewe to seek out assistance from the black inmates to gain some much-needed offensive strength and speed. Crewe challenges their leader, Deacon Moss, to a one-on-one basketball game but refuses to call any fouls on Deacon, despite them being blatant. Deacon wins and refuses to offer help, but Earl Megget is impressed by Crewe's resilience and joins as their running back.
As the team gains strength, Hazen and the guards hinder Crewe's team in several ways, such as taunting Megget into attacking a guard by verbally harassing them at the library with ethnic slurs; Megget, however, does not retaliate. Deacon and the other black inmates witness this and decide to join Crewe's team to exact revenge. Meanwhile, inmate Unger spies on the activities of the inmates for the guards and is implored to use their "talents" to weaken their team. Unger rigs an incendiary explosive into the radio in Crewe's cell, which Caretaker accidentally sets off and is sealed within Crewe's cell by Unger, preventing anyone from rescuing him.
On game day, the inmates are revitalized in the wake of Caretaker's murder when they find they used their connections to their cousin at Reebok to supply the inmates with quality uniforms and gear as well as giving them the team name Mean Machine. Crewe deals with some difficulty getting the inmates to focus on winning the game during opening play, stating that a loss to them would be a far bigger mark of shame to the guards than any physical brutality they could inflict on them. Though the guards take an early lead, even having the referees call bogus fouls on them (which Crewe quickly amends by firing the football into the referee's crotch), by the end of the first half, the Mean Machines tie the game.
Hazen corners Crewe during half-time, during which they reveal that Unger killed Caretaker, and threatens to increase their prison sentence and pin Caretaker's death on them if they don't allow the guards a two-touchdown lead. Reluctantly, Crewe agrees. Hazen then orders Knauer to "inflict as much damage as possible" on the inmates once they get the lead. During the opening of the second half, Crewe deliberately throws the game and abandons their teammates despite their efforts to catch up in scoring. After earning a two touchdown lead on the Mean Machines, the Guards begin to brutally injure the inmates, spurring Crewe to re-enter the field. The inmates initially refuse to help him, allowing them to be sacked twice, but on 4th Down and long, Crewe completes a 1st Down on their own. Crewe confesses that they had thrown the game that got them cut from the NFL, citing they owed debts to “worse people”. Informing the team of Hazen's threats, they declare that they would rather stay with the inmates than betray Caretaker's memory. The Mean Machines rally behind Crewe once more and with a decisive two-point conversion, they win the game by a one-point margin.
Knauer, having newfound respect for Crewe, congratulates them for the win and informs Crewe that they are aware that they had nothing to do with Caretaker's murder and would defend him. Hazen admonishes Knauer for losing a fixed game and notices that Crewe is heading towards the exit. Eagerly implying Crewe is trying to escape, Hazen orders that Crewe be shot. Knauer hesitates and at the last moment realizes, and scornfully informs Hazen, that Crewe is only picking up the game football. Crewe returns it to Hazen, telling them to "stick it in [his] trophy case". Deacon and Battle then dump Gatorade on Hazen, while Crewe and Scarbrough go to get information on where Unger is so that Switowski can deal with him.

Reception
Box office
The Longest Yard did well at the box office. Its $47.6 million opening weekend was the largest of Sandler's career and only second to The Day After Tomorrow as the largest opening by a movie that was not #1. The film would go on to gross $158.1 million in the United States and Canada and $190 million worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film produced by MTV Films, until it was surpassed by Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Despite the large number of remakes released at the theaters, it's worth noting that The Longest Yard is the highest grossing comedy remake of the modern box office era (from 1980 on).
Critical response
The Longest Yard has received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 31% based on 170 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "This Yard has some laughs but missing from this remake is the edginess of the original." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore, gave the film a grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert, in the critical minority with this title, gave it a "Thumbs Up", defending it later in their Chicago Sun-Times review as a film that "...more or less achieves what most of the people attending it will expect." In the print review, Ebert beseeches their readers to "...seek out a movie you could have an interesting conversation about", citing films not in wide release such as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist and Kontroll, until finally encouraging their readers to "drop any thought of seeing anything else instead" if they can see Crash.
Accolades
The film earned Chris Rock a BET Comedy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Theatrical Film.
Burt Reynolds earned a nomination at the 26th Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Supporting Actor for their performance in both this film and The Dukes of Hazzard.

Holy Cross City is a ghost town in Eagle County, Colorado. Holy Cross City gets its name from Mount of the Holy Cross, located nearby. Presently, the former townsite is located along Holy Cross City Trail within Holy Cross Wilderness, part of White River National Forest. The Mount is not visible from the townsite.
History
Discovery of valuable deposits of lead, manganese, and trace amounts of gold made the Holy Cross Mining District a densely mined region in the 1880s. The town was populated between 1880 and 1884, with a peak population of 300, though the mines ceased being profitable in 1883. A brief repopulation of the town occurred in the 1890s as the mines were worked for a short time.
At its peak, the city contained a post office, boarding houses, a hotel, as well as other amenities. Only small remnants of the town remain, with four scattered cabins comprising the largest standing structures as of 2017.
The trail–constructed in 1883–remains accessible, but by road is difficult to reach by car due to rocky conditions. The trail is rocky, provides vistas of the Mount of the Holy Cross, and terminates at two lakes.

Christina "Kiki" Cutter (born July 24, 1949) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from the United States. They were the first American to win a World Cup event, a slalom race in Oslo, Norway, on February 25, 1968.
Although Cutter competed on the World Cup circuit for less than three years, their five career victories led the U.S. alpine team for eleven years, surpassed by Phil Mahre in 1979.
Early years
Born in central Oregon in Bend, Cutter learned to ski and race at Mount Bachelor, known as "Bachelor Butte" until 1983. They were one of six children of Dr. Robert Cutter and Jane Cutter, who relocated to Bend from the Midwest in 1948, and Kiki was the first in the family born in Oregon. Cutter was a junior racer at Mount Bachelor and gained recognition for their abilities; they won the U.S. junior downhill championship in 1967 at age 17.
Racing career
Not originally on the World Cup or Olympic teams in 1968, Cutter, age 18, and Judy Nagel, age 16, were brought over to Europe in January, a few weeks ahead of the Olympics, to compete for berths on the U.S. Olympic team, which they both made. Cutter competed with the team at the Grenoble Olympics in 1968 and the World Championships in 1970. In the 1968 games, they placed higher than any American woman and was the only American woman to ski in all three events—slalom, giant slalom, and downhill. Following the Olympic competition, their rise to stardom continued in Norway, with their first World Cup victory at age 18. Cutter finished ninth in the overall standings in 1968. With three World Cups wins the next year (giant slalom at Oberstaufen, West Germany, and slalom victories at Mount St. Anne, Quebec, and Waterville Valley, New Hampshire), they finished fourth in the overall standings and second in slalom in 1969. Cutter won their fifth and final World Cup race at St. Gervais, France, in 1970. During their brief amateur career, Cutter had five World Cup victories, twelve podiums, and 25 top-10 finishes, all in the technical events, with one victory and two podiums in giant slalom and the rest in slalom. After the 1970 World Championships in mid-February, Cutter retired from international competition at age 20. They raced professionally on the Women's Pro Tour in North America for several years.

They helped create the Kiki Cutter World Cup Ski Racing Scholarship in 1993 to help develop careers for youth ski racers. Cutter appeared in Bausch & Lomb advertisements for Ray-Ban sunglasses in the late 1980s.
They live in Oregon, in their hometown of Bend, and is the founder, publisher, and president of Bend Living magazine.

George Fort Gibbs (March 8, 1870 – October 10, 1942) was an American author, illustrator, artist, and screenwriter. As an author, they wrote more than 50 popular books, primarily adventure stories revolving around espionage in exotic locations. Several of their books were made into films. (His novel the Yellow Dove was filmed twice.) Their illustrations appeared prominently in such magazines as The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook and The Delineator. They also illustrated some of their own novels, and the novels of others. As a painter they produced many portraits, and painted murals for Pennsylvania Station and Girard College in Philadelphia. Their screenwriting credits include a film about the life of Voltaire.
Biography
Parents
George Gibbs was born in 1870 in New Orleans. Their father, Benjamin F. Gibbs, was a naval surgeon with the ironclad fleet stationed there. Dr. Gibbs had seen much adventure in their naval career. They had taken part in the Paraguay Expedition aboard the . During the American Civil War, they had taken part in the battle of Mobile Bay aboard the steam-sloop and had been aboard one of the ships that chased the on its dash down the Mississippi.
In mid-war, on February 25, 1864, Dr. Gibbs married Elizabeth Beatrice Kellogg. The bride's father, Major George Kellogg, was a homeopathic doctor brought to occupied New Orleans by General Nathaniel P. Banks, commander of the Army of the Gulf, and assigned to various duties as army surgeon, and as medical advisor to the family of General Banks. Nine months after their marriage, Mrs. Gibbs gave birth to a daughter, Julie Aline Gibbs. In 1870 a son, George Fort Gibbs, was born.
Dr. Gibbs continued to rise in the navy, ultimately attaining the rank of Medical Inspector and being designated Fleet Surgeon of the European Squadron on August 20, 1881. They took Elizabeth, Aline and George with him, settling them in Geneva, where George was enrolled as a student at the Chateau de Lancy for two years. Chateau de Lancy also educated such men as William Carlos Williams, Sir Harold Acton and Hamilton Fish. In September 1882, while aboard the sailing for Trieste, Dr. Gibbs became seriously ill. According to one source they were probably suffering from "malarial fever". When the ship reached port, they were immediately moved to a hospital, where they died on September 9. Their son George was twelve years old at the time.
Elizabeth Gibbs was extremely distraught over their husband's death. The family returned to the United States in November 1883, debarking in New York and then taking a train bound for Washington, D.C., where Elizabeth's father awaited them. George was then thirteen years old, and Aline eighteen. The children were concerned about their mother, who had expressed thoughts of suicide. As the train approached Union Station (at the site of what is now Penn Station) in Baltimore, Elizabeth left their children and entered the ladies' restroom. They were gone for a long time, and the children began to worry. When the train arrived at the station they tried the door of the restroom, but it was locked. George climbed up to a transom and looked in, only to find the room empty, and its window open.
The children notified railroad officials, who sent an engine back down the tracks to look for Elizabeth. Aline went ahead to D.C., to meet with their grandfather, and George stayed behind with the searchers. Later that day Aline received a telegram from George, telling them that their mother had been found lying on the tracks a few miles from the station. Them skull was fractured, and they were taken to a hospital, where they died soon after. They had apparently climbed six feet up to the window and leapt from the train, landing on their head.
Annapolis and Washington, D.C.
Following in their father's footsteps, George Gibbs entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1886, but they resigned in 1888. According to critic Grant Overton, Gibbs "generally neglected trigonometry in favor of a sketch book and the writing of verses."
While at Annapolis, they contributed drawings, poems and songs to Junk, the Naval Academy yearbook of that era (forerunner of the Lucky Bag, which began publication in 1894 and continues to today), and they edited a collection of material from past editions of Junk after they left the Academy. Gibbs also played football at the Academy, "in the gridiron days of skull caps and padless knickers".
After leaving Annapolis, Gibbs returned to Washington and began taking night classes at the Corcoran School of Art and the Art Students' League. They were active in the Washington Watercolor Club and the Society of Washington Artists. By August 1897 they were Treasurer of the Society of Washington Artists, collecting contributions for a fund to open a gallery for the Society. Works by Gibbs and other Washington artists were exhibited in the new gallery at its opening in November of the same year. By 1898, Gibbs was Vice President of the Society.
To support themselves during this time, they began writing articles "on science and naval themes" for the Sunday editions of the New York Sun and New York Times. (He also tried their hand at writing short stories, but with little success.)
By 1891 they were also supporting themselves through another enterprise. Together with Frank B. Jonas, Gibbs formed the "Jonas-Gibbs & Co." real estate firm. Frank Jonas was the son of Louisiana Senator Benjamin F. Jonas and cousin of Charles H. Jonas Jr., who married George Gibbs' sister Aline in 1893. One of the Jonas-Gibbs newspaper ads promised "We are prepared to furnish plans and
estimates for buildings of every description, and to guarantee satisfaction."
The firm seems to have had an arrangement with "Woods & Co., bankers" to
finance new construction. A newspaper account of a Jonas-Gibbs project reports the remodeling of
a house on F street, including
erecting a "new front of press brick and Ohio stone" and "a large iron
vault" in the rear.
By 1896 Gibbs was having some success as a professional illustrator. Their first magazine sale had been made sometime shortly after 1892. It was an illustration for the newly created Vogue, and they were paid ten dollars for it. In May 1896, the Washington Morning Times reported that
"Mr. George Gibbs is engaged on illustrations for 'navy stories,'
by Charles Ledyard Norton, and 'Above the Range,' by Theodora R.
Jenness, published by Wilde & Co. of Boston. A series of studies
about the Capitol and White House for 'Once a Week' are also on the
easel."
In September, the Washington Morning Times reported that Gibbs was setting off for New York with a portfolio of naval illustrations for a publication called The Navy, Old and New, and in May 1897 the Washington Times reported that Gibbs "has just completed a series of seven spirited illustrations for the life of Commodore Bainbridge". The resulting book was Commodore Bainbridge: From the Gunroom to the Quarterdeck, by James Barnes.
Philadelphia
In 1898, Gibbs moved to Philadelphia at the invitation of Cyrus Curtis, founder of the Curtis Publishing Company. There, they created cover and interior illustrations for such Curtis publications as the Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies' Home Journal. Among their early accomplishments was the first color cover for the Saturday Evening Post, which adorned the December 30, 1899, issue of the magazine. They also wrote "art critiques and editorials, short stories, etc." for the Saturday Evening Post. For a while, Gibbs shared a studio with illustrator Guernsey Moore, the creator of the typeface (called "Post Old Style") used in the Saturday Evening Post logo. An obituary for Moore credits him, rather than Gibbs, as the creator of the first color cover for the Post. Gibbs and fellow illustrator Mills Thompson were among the first to employ the services of model Evelyn Nesbit, who would later become famous after their involvement with architect Stanford White led to their murder by Nesbit's husband.
In April 1901, Gibbs married Maud Stovell Harrison (1878–1973), a classically trained pianist and daughter of a prominent Philadelphia family. The bride's father, Theodore L. Harrison, was the son of Joseph Harrison Jr., an engineer and railroad magnate who had, in 1843, received a $3,000,000 contract from the Russian government to construct locomotives and rolling stock for the St. Petersburg and Moscow railway. Theodore Harrison had a "wedding cottage" named "The Orchard" built for the couple on the Harrison family property in Rosemont, near Philadelphia. This was to be George Gibbs' home for the remainder of their life.
After their marriage, Gibbs' career as an author blossomed. From 1901 until their death in 1942, they reliably turned out novels at a rate of
about one per year. By 1916 newspapers were speaking of Mr. Gibbs' "annual novel".
Many of these novels were serialized in newspapers and magazines before being published in book form. Their books were primarily adventure novels, in the vein of John Buchan or E. Philips Oppenheim, often involving international intrigue. For example, their novel The Black Stone (1919) is reminiscent of John Buchan's Greenmantle (1916). Both novels involve a sacred stone, and deal with an effort to thwart a German plot to provoke an Arab insurrection.
Gibbs continued to illustrate their own and other authors' books, and to create illustrations for many magazines and newspapers. They also pursued a growing career as a painter.
In time, Gibbs became a pillar of the community and a well-known member of Philadelphia society. When G.K. Chesterton visited
Philadelphia in 1921, they stayed at the Gibbs' home.
The 1936-37 edition of Who's Who in America notes that Gibbs was a member of the Art Club of Philadelphia, The Franklin Inn Club, the Pegasus Club, the Merion Cricket Club and the Rittenhouse Club. During Chesterton's visit, Gibbs took them to lunch at the Franklin Inn club. In 1909, Gibbs discovered a fire in the clubhouse of the Merion Cricket Club, and helped organize a bucket brigade to put it out. Gibbs participated in amateur theatrical productions, in one instance dressing in feathers to play Chanticleer: "We made it a sort of satire on modern letters, with Chantecler chasing Rostand and Ibsen haunted by their characters, and so on. It was very good fun." Gibbs served on juries for many art exhibitions alongside fellow artists including Frederic Remington and A. B. Frost. The 1925 Haverford College yearbook notes that Gibbs, "the well-known painter and writer of best-sellers", had addressed that school's English Club on the subject of "Writing Novels".
Gibbs was for many years a vestryman of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont. In 1929 they created seven paintings for the church's High Altar reredos as a memorial to their parents. The center panel was a Virgin and Child, flanked by panels depicting other biblical figures from the Old and New Testaments.
By 1915 filmmakers had begun adapting Gibbs' novels for the screen. The first film based on a Gibbs novel was The Flaming Sword, produced by Rolfe Photoplays, a company that had been founded the previous year by B. A. Rolfe. This was the company's ninth feature film. It starred a young Lionel Barrymore. Between 1915 and 1926 ten films were based on Gibbs novels. In later years, Gibbs collaborated with lawyer E. Lawrence Dudley to write a "novel" about Voltaire at the request of George Arliss, intended to be the basis for a film. After several false starts, the film was finally produced in 1933. Their work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.
George Gibbs died on October 10, 1942, after a long illness. They were buried on October 14 in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.
Children
George Fort Gibbs Jr. (1902–1988) was a member of the Princeton University class of 1923. While there, they participated in college musical groups, serving as leader of the "Banjo Club", for example. The 1930 census lists them as a "play writer" living with their parents in Rosemont, and the Library of Congress Catalog of Copyright Entries lists a 1933 play called "This New Deal" authored by George F. Gibbs Jr., and M. Mark Sulkes. George Gibbs Jr. ultimately moved to Venice, Florida, where they became a real estate developer. They continued to be known as an amateur musician, and was one of the founders of what is now called the Sarasota Orchestra.
Theodore Harrison Gibbs (1908–1944) was a well-regarded sculptor. In 1938 they won the prestigious Prix de Rome fellowship and travelled to Rome to work at the American Academy. There, they met and married their wife, sculptor Maurine Montgomery. After the couple moved back to the United States, Harrison enlisted in the military and served in France during World War II. When they left the United States, Maurine was pregnant with their daughter Romona. Harrison was killed in 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge. Maurine and Romona were frequent visitors at "The Orchard". A large stone barn on the property was used as a sculpture studio by Harrison and Maurine. In 2011 the property was finally sold out of the family and many works of art by Harrison, Maurine and other family members were dispersed to museums and other new locations.
Sarah (Sally) Stovell Gibbs McClure (1912–2006) was a dancer, singer, songwriter and author of poems, novels and plays. At the age of nineteen they produced a book of poems called Beauty for Ashes. In 1928, when they were sixteen, they danced in the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company's production of Carmen. By 1934 they were singing and acting on Broadway in Life Begins at 8:40, a musical revue by Harold Arlen, Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg. They married Navy test pilot Howard McClure in 1941. McClure died in 1960, at which point Sally moved back to "The Orchard" to care for their mother (who lived until 1973), and remained there until their own death in 2006. While at "The Orchard" they taught flamenco and hula dancing. They were the last of their family to occupy the property. Toward the end of their life they wrote and self-published a fictionalized memoir titled Main Line Maverick.

Uvariopsis congolana is a species of plant in the Annonaceae family. It is native to
Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. Émile De Wildeman, the botanist who first formally described the species using the basionym Thonnera congolana, named it after the Belgian Congo now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the specimens they examined were collected near Makanza (then called Bangala) and Yambuya.
Description
It is tree reaching 10 meters in height. Its slender, egg-shaped to oblong, leathery leaves are 27-30 by 6.5-9.5 centimeters. The leaves have rounded to wedge-shaped bases and tapering tips with the tapering portion up to 3 centimeters long. The leaves are hairless. The leaves have around 12 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. The secondary veins arch and connect near the margins of the leaves. Its short petioles are 4-5 millimeters long. Its flowers occur clusters on the lower trunk. Each flower is on an slender, elongated pedicel up to 38 centimeters long. The pedicels have clasping bracts that are 2 millimeters long and covered in rust-colored hair. Its flowers are unisexual. Its flowers have two sepals that are 4 millimeters long and bent back. Male flowers have 3 triangular petals in a single whorl. The petals are 2.2 by 1.7 centimeters. The petals are shallowly pointed and thickened toward their tips. Male flowers have stamens that consist of an anther without a stalk (filament). The anthers have two locules. Female flowers have 3 triangular petals in a single whorl. The petals are 2.2 by 1.7 centimeters. The petals are shallowly pointed and thickened toward their tips. Female flowers have hairy, irregularly cylindrical carpels that are truncated at the top. The carpels have indistinct stigmas. The fruit are oblong to elliptical, with wedge shaped bases and tips and are 5-8 by 2.5-3.2 centimeters. The surface of the fruit has prominent vein-like patterning.
Reproductive biology
The pollen of U. congolana is shed as permanent tetrads.
Distribution and habitat
It has been observed growing in rain forests.
Uses
Bioactive compounds extracted from its tissues, have been reported to have antiplasmodial activity in laboratory tests using cultured Plasmodium falciparum.

"Parker's Mood" is a piece of music originally performed by Charlie Parker as an improvised blues in 1948. Vocalese lyrics were later written and recorded by King Pleasure and Eddie Jefferson.
Original recording
Alto saxophonist Charlie Parker recorded "Parker's Mood" in New York City on September 18, 1948. The other musicians for the Savoy Records session were pianist John Lewis, bassist Curley Russell, and drummer Max Roach. There were five takes: two false starts and three complete takes. The complete takes were improvised spontaneously, with the probable exception of the opening two bars, which are the same on each take. Parker "varies the phrasing and motivic relatedness of the opening melodic idea in each take". The tempo across the takes varies from 65 quarter notes to 87.
"Parker's Mood" is a B blues. "The introduction begins on G minor [...] The feature then proceeds to C minor, which [...] suggests i–iv in G minor (or v–i in C minor)." Then, from the third bar, "the rhythm section begin a four-bar chord progression that establishes B major through a tritone substitution of each chord of a vi–ii–V progression with major-seventh chords as the vi substitute (DM7) and the ii substitute (GM7)".
The piece was copyrighted on November 15, 1948.
Vocalese versions
Vocalese lyrics were added in 1953 by King Pleasure. Lewis appeared on piano in Pleasure's recording of it for Prestige Records, which was released around 1954. Separately, Eddie Jefferson wrote vocalese lyrics. Jefferson's version was retitled as "Bless My Soul" and recorded in 1962 for their album Letter from Home.
Reception and legacy
Jazz historian Ted Gioia described Parker's performance of "Parker's Mood" as a "bittersweet lament [that is] as deep a statement of the blues as exists in the jazz tradition". Jazz writer and musician Brian Priestley categorised the piece as a "slow blues masterpiece". By late 2018, there had been at least 90 recordings of Parker's piece.

The G1 Climax 32 was a professional wrestling tournament promoted by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). The tournament commenced on July 16 and concluded on August 18, 2022. It was the thirty-second edition of G1 Climax and the forty-eighth edition of the tournament counting its previous forms under different names.
Considered NJPW's most important tournament, the G1 Climax featured twenty-eight wrestlers, divided into four blocks of seven ("A", "B", "C", and "D"). Each participant faced all six other wrestlers within the same block in singles matches. The winner of each block was determined via a point system, with two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a defeat. Each night of the event saw one match from each block between two members. On the final two days of the event, the winners of each block entered a four-man playoff to determine the winner of the tournament, who also receives a future match for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom. The event was broadcast live on TV Asahi and Fighting TV Samurai in Japan, and New Japan Pro-Wrestling World worldwide.
For the first time in three years, the block returned to the summer, moving away from the previous years where it was held in the fall between September–October due to the 2020 Summer Olympic Games being held in Japan, while coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. At twenty-eight participants, it was the largest field in G1 Climax history and the most competitors since 2014. The tournament also ran in a four-block round-robin format for the first time since 2000.
The event saw the G1 Climax debuts of Tom Lawlor, Jonah, El Phantasmo, Aaron Henare, and David Finlay.

Tournament rules
The tournament features twenty-eight wrestlers, divided into four blocks of seven ("A", "B", "C", and "D"). Each participant faces all six other wrestlers within the same block in singles matches. The winner of each
block is determined via a point system, with two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss; each night of the event sees one match from each block between two members competing for the tournament. In case of several wrestlers sharing the top score, the results of the matches those wrestlers had when facing each other in the tournament act as tiebreaker, with the one having the most wins over the other top-scorers determining the winner of the block.
On the final two days of the event, the respective winners of each block enter a four-man single-elimination playoff to determine the winner of the G1 Climax, who would gain a future match for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship, NJPW's top championship, at Wrestle Kingdom, NJPW's biggest yearly event; if the IWGP Heavyweight Champion themselves wins, they select their opponent at Wrestle Kingdom. The Young Lion matches have a fifteen-minutes time limit, while the matches of the tournament have a 30-minutes time limit (with the time limit being reached resulting in a tie); the semifinal (block winners) and final (semifinal winners) matches, where a winner must be determined, have no time limit.
History
On April 9, 2022, at Hyper Battle '22, NJPW announced that the 2022 edition of the G1 Climax would take place from July to August, returning to the summer for the first time since 2019. During Dominion 6.12 in Osaka-jo Hall on June 22, NJPW announced the participants for the G1 Climax.
Storylines
The event includes matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Basic Leucine Zipper and W2 Domain-Containing Protein 2 is a protein that is encoded by the BZW2 gene. It is a eukaryotic translation factor found in species up to bacteria. In animals, it is localized in the cytoplasm and expressed ubiquitously throughout the body. The heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and hippocampus show higher expression. In various cancers, upregulation tends to lead to higher severity and mortality. It has been found to interact with SARS-CoV-2.
Gene
BZW2 is known as Basic Leucine Zipper W2 Domain-Containing Protein 2, MST017, MSTP017, 5MP1, Eukaryotic Translation Factor 5, and HSPC028. It is located on chromosome 7 at p21.1 on the plus strand. The gene spans 60,389 base pairs, at coordinates 16,583,248 – 16,804,999. There are 12 exons.
Protein
There are two known isoforms of BZW2. Isoform 1 is 419 amino acids long and is the most abundant form. Isoform 2 is 225 amino acids, containing only 11 exons and a shorter N-terminus.
The coded protein is 419 amino acids long and weighs 48.3 kDa. As described in the name, the protein contains a leucine-zipper motif. Four “L……” repeats are present in the beginning, giving rise to the characteristic leucine zipper helix within the 3D structure. An eIF5C domain follows the leucine motif, which is apart of proteins that are important for strict regulation of cellular processes.
The amino acid composition of BZW2 has a higher amount of lysines and a lower amount of prolines in humans but a higher glutamic acid composition in its orthologs. The human BZW2 protein has an overall charge of -3 which can go down to -9 in orthologs. There are no significant charge clusters. There is also a KELQ repeat that has remained conserved in animals.
The secondary structure contains a majority of alpha helices. There are 19 alpha helices in all orthologs, except for two additional beta sheets which are absent in humans. The tertiary structure forms a repeated fold of alpha-helices, a structure that is conserved through bacteria.
Regulation
Gene-level
There are three known promoters for BZW2. It is regulated by numerous transcription factors, including an estrogen receptor transcription factor (ESR2, ES3), leucine zipper transcription factor (RRFIP1), and Y sex-determining transcription factors (SRY). With these transcription factors, BZW2 has regulated expression in organs that contribute to cellular functions. The Y sex-determining transcription factor works to regulate BZW2 expression in the testis. Throughout the body, BZW2 is ubiquitously expressed within tissues. There is elevated mRNA abundance in the heart, placenta, and skeletal muscle.
Transcript-level
There are four major stem loops in the 5' untranslated and four in the 3' untranslated region that function in transcript-level regulation.
Protein-level
BZW2 has multiple phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, and glycation sites for regulation. Since upregulation of BZW2 leads to disrupted cellular processes and severe cancer forms, post-translational modifications are needed to keep the gene highly regulated. The protein is localized within the cytoplasm and has no likely or confirmed nuclear or mitochondrial target peptides.
Evolution
BZW2 has a single paralog, BZW1 which is conserved up to plants. There are BZW2 orthologs up to a couple species of bacteria. The most distant ortholog was Microbacterium arborescens. BZW2 contains an eIF5C domain which is also present in eIF2BE, eIF4G, eIF5, and a GAP protein specific for eIF2.
Compared to Cytochrome C, a quickly diverging protein, and Fibrinogen, a slowly diverging protein, BZW2 has had slow corrected divergence over time, illustrating conservation and protein importance.
Interactions
BZW2 is known to interact with:
BZW1
EIF2S2
PSTPIP1
NEK4
ORF4
SNW1
rep
EIF2S2 and ORF4 work to synthesize and replicate BZW2. PSTPIP1 and NEK4 are regulatory proteins that help in the functionality of BZW2. SNW1, a spliceosome protein, splices BZW2 mRNA variants. The protein rep is apart of SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits translation of BZW2.
Clinical significance
Cancer
BZW2 has been studied to determine its role in multiple cancers. Overall, the studies all showed that upregulation of BZW2 lead to more severe forms of cancer, higher rate of mortality, and increased likeliness of reoccurrence.
A 2019 study focused on the effect of BZW2 in colorectal cancer. It found that upregulation of BZW2 promoted tumor growth and had a downstream upregulation effect on c-Myc, a proto-oncogene. A second study from 2020 determined this upregulation also had a positive effect on the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway.
In hepatocellular carcinoma, ostersarcoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, overexpression of BZW2 lead to overactivation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by increasing phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. The AKT/mTOR pathway is an important intracellular signaling pathway that regulates the cell cycle. When the pathway activity is increased, cells proliferated at a higher rate and apoptosis decreases, leading to tumor growth.
SARS-CoV-2
BZW2 interacts with the nsp8 protein of SARS-CoV-2. nsp8 dimerizes and forms a supercomplex which works to repress the translation of BZW2.

The Ronde Lutherse Kerk (round Lutheran church) or Koepelkerk (cupola church) is a former Lutheran church in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the Singel canal. The church can be easily seen from the Singel, identified by its copper dome.
History
The church was designed by Adriaan Dortsman (ca. 1636-1682) and was opened in 1671. In 1822 the church was nearly destroyed; it was rebuilt in 1826. The organ was built by J Batz in 1830, and restored in 1983 by Flentrop Orgelbouw. In 1935 the Lutherans left the building and it became a concert hall. The neighboring Renaissance Amsterdam Hotel (formerly the Sonesta Hotel) rents the church building from the Lutheran Church. In 1975 a tunnel was built by the hotel to access the church. In 1983 the church was closed for restoration, but in 1993 the dome caught fire, and the church was again restored.
The church is not open to the public, but interested persons may request to view it at the Renaissance Hotel. A security guard accompanies visitors through the tunnel to the church, where the ground floor of the consistory has been converted to bathrooms and the upper floor to a meeting room. Of the main hall, the impressive columns, galleries, organ and pulpit can still be seen.

The Bellingham Herald is a daily newspaper published in Bellingham, Washington, in the United States. It was founded on March 10, 1890, as The Fairhaven Herald and changed its name after Bellingham was incorporated as a city in 1903. The Bellingham Herald is the largest newspaper in Whatcom County, with a weekday circulation of over 8,700. It employs around 60 people. It is owned by The McClatchy Company.
History
The Fairhaven Herald published its first edition on March 10, 1890, and was originally based in Fairhaven. The tri-weekly newspaper was one of several established in the Bellingham area in the late 19th century. The first editor, William "Lightfoot" Visscher, worked for the paper for 18 months before falling out with Nelson Bennet, the landowner. Visscher was fired in April 1891 and returned to their previous occupation in Tacoma. In 1900 the newspaper purchased the first linotype on the West Coast. In 1903, owner Sidney Albert Perkins merged the newspaper with a competitor and renamed it The Bellingham Herald.
The Herald fended off competition from the Puget Sound American, which had been established in 1904 by Seattle Times publisher Joseph Blethen. The American had merged with another existing daily, the Reveille, but was unable to overtake The Herald in circulation. The Reveille was acquired by The Herald in 1927.
The newspaper moved its offices to the newly-constructed Herald Building in 1926. Federated Publications bought The Herald from Sam Perkins in 1967 and merged with the Gannett Corporation in 1971. The Herald switched to morning delivery in May 1997 and launched its website on February 15, 2000. Knight-Ridder acquired The Bellingham Herald in 2005. Knight-Ridder was acquired by McClatchy in 2006, putting The Herald under their ownership.
Herald building
The Herald building is located in downtown Bellingham at the corner of State Street and Chestnut Street. Built in 1926, the six-story Gothic Revival building uses white terra cotta tiles and stained glass windows depicting a herald playing their trumpet. The building was the first in downtown Bellingham to use a concrete-and-steel form and steam for heating.
The newspaper's main offices were located on the second floor, while tenant businesses occupied the remaining space, including a dentist, a restaurant, and the local chamber of commerce. Prior to the construction of the Bellingham Towers in 1930, the Herald Building was the tallest in the city. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as the State Historic Register. The employee offices were relocated to the Barkley Village area in 2019 after the newsroom was downsized.
Herald sign
The Herald rooftop sign, standing 40'x10', is managed by Kane Hall of Daylight Properties. Morse Hardware had a similar sign for decades - and boaters would use the two illuminated signs at night for navigation. The original sign was lit by more than 300 incandescent bulbs before changing to neon four years later. In 2016, Daylight Properties installed modern aluminum lights, "creating a programmable LED lighting system that shows a variety of colors beyond the traditional neon red". The colors change to a bright red and green for the holiday season and can display multiple colors in accord with local festivals and holidays.
Subscription
The Bellingham Herald produces newspaper articles in print and digital form. The newspaper is printed alongside the Skagit Valley Herald in Skagit County and distributed to businesses, homes, and newspaper boxes in Whatcom County, excluding Point Roberts. The newspaper ended its Saturday print edition in 2019.

Levmoss (1965–1977) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse whose career lasted from 1967 to 1969. They were the leading stayer in Europe in 1969, when they won the premier long-distance races in England (Ascot Gold Cup) and France (Prix du Cadran). In October of that year they moved down to middle distances to win Europe's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
Background
Levmoss was a bay horse bred in Ireland by the McGrath Trust Company, a family breeding organisation headed by Joseph McGrath. Their sire was the McGrath-owned Le Levanstell, who won the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1961 before a successful stud career. Levmoss's dam, Feemoss came from a strong staying family, being a daughter of the Yorkshire Oaks winner Feevagh and a half-sister of the Queen Alexandra Stakes winner Laurence O. After, Levmoss, Feemoss went on to produce the Prix de Diane winner Sweet Mimosa and the champion stayer Le Moss.
Racing career
Early career
Levmoss ran twice as a two-year-old winning once at Gowran Park. At three they developed into a useful stayer. After winning a race at the Phoenix Park Racecourse they were sent to England where they finished fourth in the Lingfield Derby Trial. A month later they finished fourth in the Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot before returning to England for the third time where they produced their best performance of the year when winning the Oxfordshire Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, beating the St Leger Stakes runner-up Canterbury and the leading filly Park Top. That Autumn they finished third in the Prix Royal Oak (French St Leger) and ended the year by winning the Leopardstown November Handicap over two miles carrying top weight of 130 pounds.

Levmoss began their four-year-old season by running unplaced in the Gladness Stakes and was then sent to France where they finished third behind Zamazaan in the Prix Jean Prat over 3100m at Longchamp Racecourse. They returned to Longchamp the following month and recorded their most important victory up to that time as they beat Zamazaan into third place in the 4000m Prix du Cadran. Having won the most important French staying race, Levmoss was then sent to Royal Ascot to contest the English equivalent, the Ascot Gold Cup. They started 15/8 favourite and won easily by four lengths from Torpid.
Levmoss returned to Ireland in September to win the Leinster Handicap at the Curragh by three lengths, carrying a weight of 150 pounds (10st 10lbs). In October, Levmoss was dropped back in distance for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400m at Longchamp. Their opponents included Park Top, Blakeney, Prince Regent (Irish Derby) and Crepellana (Prix de Diane). As they were considered a specialist stayer, Levmoss was not considered a serious contender and started a 52/1 outsider. Ridden by the Australian Bill Williamson, Levmoss was prominent throughout before moving to the front turning into the straight and galloping on strongly all the way to the line, to win by three quarters of a length from Park Top.
Assessment
In their book "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Levmoss a "superior" Arc winner and the ninth best Irish racehorse of the 20th century.
Stud record
Levmoss went to stud as a five-year-old after accumulating eight wins worth £142,226. They stood for most of their life in Ireland, where they had been trained by Seamus McGrath, but moved to France for the 1977 season and died that year. The Irish St. Leger winner M-Lolshan, Prix du Cadran winner Shafaraz and Musidora Stakes winner Moonlight Night were their best winners. They were also the damsire of Ardross.

Karađorđe Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of FK Vojvodina. The stadium is one of the most modern stadiums in Serbia and has one of the best pitches in the country. The stadium has a total of 14,853 seats after new renovations were made in 2013. The stadium is also the home ground for the Serbian U-21 football team.
History
In late May 2007, the stadium was the site of Siniša Mihajlović's testimonial match. In 2009, the stadium was given a new athletic track, the southeast stand and a modern Philips scoreboard. After the reconstruction in 2009, it was the venue of the 2009 European Athletics Junior Championships and the 2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. In 2011, FK Vojvodina installed floodlights with strength of 1,400 lux. The largest attendance was on 1 March 1967 when Vojvodina played against Scottish side Celtic in the 1966–67 European Cup quarter-final. There were about 30,000 spectators.
Formerly, it was known as the Vojvodina Stadium (, ) or City Stadium (Serbian: Градски стадион, Gradski stadion). In 2007, the stadium was renamed to Karađorđe Stadium after Karađorđe "Black George", the leader of the First Serbian uprising. However, Karađorđe Stadium was in fact the older and original name of the stadium that was used from its foundation in 1924 until the end of the Second World War.
Recent upgrades and developments
In early 2012, the executive board announced further reconstructions of the Karađorđe stadium. Original plans included the construction of a new south stand, the reconstruction of the eastern and southwest stand. Finally, in May 2013, as a result of UEFA requirements for obtaining a license for UEFA Europa League participation, the city of Novi Sad agreed to an upgrade of the stadium that will take place through June 2013 in time for FK Vojvodina to host Europa League qualifying matches.

Orbeni is a commune in Bacău County, Western Moldavia, Romania. It is composed of two villages, Orbeni and Scurta.
Geography
The commune is located in the south-central part of the county, south of the county seat, Bacău. It is situated in the Pietricica Ridge of the Subcarpathian Plateau, an area of hills covered with forests of beech, oak, maple, acacia, and more recently fir and spruce trees. The Siret River and its valley lie to the east.
It neighbours four other communes: Parava to the north, Gura Văii to the west, Valea Seacă to the south, and Corbasca to the east.
Orbeni is crossed by the DN2 road, which connects Bacău to Focșani and forms part of the European route E85. On the eastern side of the commune is the Orbeni railway station, serving the Căile Ferate Române Line 500 that runs from Bucharest to Focșani, Bacău, and on north toward the Ukraininan border.
History
Legend has it that a woman who was almost blind ("oarba" in Romanian), head of a large family from the settlement "Rădăciei's mouth" and "Dacian's head", took their family and migrated through the valley of a river towards the Ciortolom's peak.
The Oarba family members have cut down the forests to build houses, for cattle breeding and for agriculture.
The descendants of this woman took their name calling themselves the followers of Oarba, and residents of neighbouring villages called them Orbenari. The creek crossing the valley received the name of those who possessed it – Orbenarilor Creek.

George Howe (1769 – 11 May 1821) was a poet, printer, and editor of the first Australian newspaper, the Sydney Gazette.
Early life
Howe was the son of Thomas Howe, a government printer on Basseterre, Saint Christopher Island (now better known as Saint Kitts) in the West Indies. When they were 21, they went to London and worked as a printer for The Times. In March 1799, George Howe, alias George Happy, alias Happy George, was charged with shoplifting after they and a man named Thomas Jones had robbed a mercer's shop at Alcester. and they were sentenced to death, commuted to transportation for life to New South Wales. Howe arrived at Sydney on 22 November 1800.
They received a full pardon on 4 June 1806.
Editor of the Sydney Gazette
A small printing press had been brought to Australia by Governor Arthur Phillip, and a convict named George Hughes used it to print a considerable number of orders, rules and regulations. Soon after they arrived George Howe became the government printer, and in 1802 printed New South Wales General Standing Orders consisting of 146 pages, the first book to be printed in Australia. In May 1803 Governor King, in a dispatch to Lord Hobart, mentioned the establishment of the Sydney Gazette as a weekly publication—its first number had appeared on 5 March and asked that a new font of type should be sent to Sydney. The paper was carried on at the risk of Howe, who, though they had been fully emancipated in 1806, did not receive a salary as government printer until 1811 when they were granted only £60 a year. In the meantime Howe conducted the Gazette under difficulties, often running out of paper and suffering much from patrons who fell behind in their subscriptions. In 1810 a lightning strike almost destroyed Howes's printing office. Howe tried various expedients to keep their household going, at one time keeping a school and at another becoming a professional debt collector. Another of these expedients was becoming a professional mobile food stand for the public, they did this for 3 years.
In addition to the Gazette Howe began the publication of the New South Wales Pocket Almanac in 1806, which became a regular yearly publication from 1808 to 1821. They also began trading in sandalwood, and in 1813 found themselves liable for over £90 of duty on two consignments. They appear to have become more prosperous, as in 1817 they were one of the original subscribers when the Bank of New South Wales was founded. Howe died on 11 May 1821 and left an estate of £400. They were married twice, and their second wife survived them with children of both marriages. They seem to have been a man of indomitable spirit and, considering their difficulties, was a good printer and editor. The memorial placed in the printing office by their son stated that "his charity knew no bounds". Their amiable disposition saw them given the nickname “George Happy.”
Family
Howe's eldest son, Robert (1795–1829), helped their father from age 9, but as a teenager rebelled, indulging in excessive alcohol consumption and fathering an illegitimate child before converting to Methodism under the guidance of Ralph Mansfield and returning to the family business in 1820. They printed the first magazine, The Australian Magazine; or, Compendium of Religious, Literary, and Miscellaneous Intelligence (1821), hymn-book, An Abridgment of the Wesleyan Hymns, selected from the larger Hymn-book published in England (1821), and Church of England hymn-book, Select Portions of the Psalms of David etc. (1828), in Australia. The first volume of verse published by a native-born Australian Wild Notes from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel by Charles Tompson junior, which appeared in 1826, is an excellent example of R. Howe's typographical work. Like many other editors in colonial Australia, Howe was implicated in several libel suits. Moreover, their editorial policies, stemming from their religious convictions and the newspaper's continuing support for the government, led to them being horsewhipped by William Redfern. Starting 1 January 1821, the Gazette was jointly edited by Mansfield, a division of duties that Howe hoped would facilitate their retirement from the newspaper. Less than a month later, on 29 January 1829, Howe drowned in a boating accident off Fort Denison, leaving their wife, Ann, as proprietor of the Gazette and Mansfield as the editor.
George Terry Howe (c. 1806–63), Robert's younger half-brother by their father's common law wife, Elizabeth Easton, went to Launceston, Tasmania in October 1821, becoming the town's first printer and the founding editor of the Tasmanian and Port Dalrymple Advertiser. In 1825, they were persuaded by the Lt. Governor Sir George Arthur to form a partnership with James Ross in Hobart, where they were appointed government printer and co-edited the Hobart Town Gazette. In 1827, they left the Gazette to edit the Tasmanian for six months before returning to Sydney. They died there on 6 April 1863. They were married and had six daughters and a son.

A lake effect snow warning is a bulletin issued by the National Weather Service in the United States to warn of heavy snowfall accumulations that are imminent from convective snow generated by very cold airmass passing over unfrozen lakes (lake effect snow). The criteria for amounts may vary significantly over different county warning areas. On October 2, 2017, some National Weather Service Forecast Offices discontinued issuing the Lake Effect Snow Warning, and consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning. On October 15, 2018, the National Weather Service discontinued issuing Lake Effect Snow Warnings nationwide all together, and all offices consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning. Lake effect snow warnings were reinstated for the 2019–20 winter season.
Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada issues similar warnings but they are called snowsquall warnings.

The Pedion was a subnotebook computer developed by Mitsubishi Electric with Hewlett-Packard in 1998. At thick, it was the thinnest notebook computer in the world, even thinner than the "MacBook Air" (although the Apple equivalent was 4 mm at its thinnest point), released nearly ten years later. The notebook included a Pentium 233 MMX processor, 64 MB RAM, and a 1 GB Hard disk.
The Greek word, pedion (πεδίον) means "plain", "flat", "field".
Mitsubishi ceased production and withdrew the notebook from the market due to "mechanical problems".

The Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam Synagogue is the restored the oldest synagogue of the Malabar Jews, with a Sefer Torah scroll and offering occasional services. It was established in 1200 CE and restored several times through the centuries on the same site. It is modeled on the earliest synagogue of the Malabar Jews at Muziris from the ancient times of Mediterranean sea trade with Kerala. The earliest synagogue of the ancient Malabar Jews is today submerged in the sea following the gradual rise of sea level over several millennia. Although the Chendamangalam Synagogue is the oldest surviving synagogue structure in Kerala and Indian sub-continent (established in 1166 CE), Its Torah scrolls were taken to Israel by it congregation in 1952. This makes the Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam synagogue the oldest Malabar Jewish synagogue today (since its restoration in 2018) with a Torah scroll that is occasionally used for services. The Paradesi Spanish Sephardic Jewish synagogue at Mattancherry also has Torah scroll but it was established much later in 1568.
Ancient history of the Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam synagogue
In ancient times, the port of Muziris served as a trading hub between the Levant (Israel, Phoenicia, Rome) and Kerala. This made the Kerala port of Muziri (Muchiri) to become the hub of continental trade between Mediterranean world and Kerala during Sangam era. The Kadavambhagam synagogue belongs to the diaspora of Jews who settled in Kerala during Sangam era when Black Pepper was considered (Black Gold) was a chief commodity being traded. Black Pepper was a sought after commodity used as preservative and for food and other purposes. A west-Asian trading post emerged in the ancient Muziris region as mentioned in the Periplus Maris Erythraei written by a certain a "Greek in Egypt, a Roman subject" as described by the translator Wilfred Harvey schoff (1912).
Ancient cultural context of synagogue and community
Several millennia of contact and sea trade between Malabar Jews and Local traders in Kerala has led to immense cultural exchange between communities. Jewish traders travelled to and fro between the Mediterranean region and Kerala in sea vessels similar to (Uru boats), a type of dhow that is even today made in Beypore, Kerala, in the southwestern coast of India. The Malabar Jews who settled since the times of King Solomon have intermingled with the natives and share linguistic and cultural aspects with the local people. While the Spanish Sephardic Jews that arrived in 1568 have maintained a distinct identity since they are recent arrival. Some of the cultural similarities and exchanges between Malabar Jews and Kerala locals can be seen in language use. For instance 'Tuki' refers to Peacock in Tamil and 'Tukyim' in Hebrew. Likewise in Hebrew 'Metta' refers to mattress and 'Metta' is also used to refer to mattress in Malayalam spoken by Kerala Nasrani Syrian Christians of Kerala. Similarly, 'Tarkam' is the malayalam word for 'debate' or 'oral exchange' derived from the Hebrew Targum (referring to the Jewish tradition of Targumennu) of 'discourse' and 'argumentation' of Targum. similarly, 'Cheri' or 'Sherry' (is Hebrew word meaning 'beloved') and is used as a ending suffix for several place names of endearment. e.g. Mattancheri / Mattancherry. Also, 'Matana' comes from the Hebrew work Gift from which is derived the name Matthai (Mathew) (meaning Gift of God).
Early Muziris and Historical background of synagogue
Periplus Maris Erythraei written around in 3rd century BC mentions Malabar coast as (Limyrikê). Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (53:17:15-27) mentions Limyrike to begin from Naura (Kannur) and Tyndis (Cerobothra north of Muziris) and corresponds to modern day Malabar coast where Jews had settled as traders in the Malabar coast especially Muciri since the time of King Solomon. The Periplus also mentions Nelcynda (that is today identified as Nakkada near Niranam in Pathanamthitta district) and was once the capital of Ay Kingdom in ancient times. Early Jewish settlements existed in Muziris (present day Pattanam in Kochi near North Paravur (Kochi)) and also at Palayur with ruins of an ancient Jewish Palli (House of gathering). An early Nasrani Palli was established along the Jewish settlement of Paloor (Palayur) as well. The settlement of Paloor (Palayur) is mentioned even in the ancient Kerala Nasrani Syrian Christian Ramban song and as well as Malabar Jewish songs. Old Malabar Jewish songs mentions Paloor as an important congregation for Jewish tradition in Malabar coast of Kerala with Jewish Palli (Synagogue). The ancient Malabar Jews were present all along the Limyrike (Malabar coast) through, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ezhimala, Pandalayini, and most of all in Muziris (Muciri/Muyirikode). An ancient Jewish Palli (synagogue) was said to have existed in Muziris (near present day Pattanam near North Paravur Kochi). This synagogue is now believed to be submerged due to gradual rising sea level over the millennium.
There were several rounds of migration of Jews from the Levant to the Malabar Coast of Kerala. These began from 722 BCE after the Assyrian conquest of Israel to the destruction of the first temple by Nebuchadnezzar II to the fall of the second temple in AD 70 to the fall of the Bar Kochba revolt and then subsequent attacks on the Jewish communities by various groups. The last significant migration from the Levant was after the Spanish inquisition in 1492. The earliest Jewish groups that settled in the Malabar coast of Kerala since the time of King Solomon of the Old Testament are called as 'Malabar Yehudan' (Malabar Jews) and form the original core population of the Cochin Jews. The last group of Spanish Jews that came few hundred years ago are called as 'Paradesi jews'. Thus there are two main groups of halakhic Cochin Jews – The ancient group of early Jewish settlers (Malabar Yehudan) and the latter group of European Jewish settlers in Kerala called (Paradesi jews). The Cochin Jews were granted copper plates of rights by the local ruler of Kerala. This is said to have taken place in the third century C.E. where in 72 privileges were granted on copper plates. The copper plates were privileges that enabled the formation of a trading guild called "Anjuvannam". The Hebrew inscriptions on the Copper plates in possession with Kerala Nasrani Syrian Christians who share common heritage with the Cochin Jews is taken as evidence of the presence of Jews in Kerala since antiquity. Incidentally, the copper plates that belong with the Kerala Nasrani Syrian Christians has the oldest Hebrew inscriptions in Kerala and India. These copper plates have old Malayalam inscriptions and also have signatures in Hebrew, Kufic and Palhavi. Hence the Kerala Syrian Christian copper plates are taken as the oldest evidence of the presence of Jews in Kerala and India. In the paper ‘Kerala and Them Jews', published by Cochin Jewish Synagogue (1984), the Cochin Jewish writers Fiona Hallegua and Shabdai Samuel Koder wrote: "...the Syrian Christian (copper) plates with the signature of four Jewish witnesses in Judeo - Persian, which incidentally is the second oldest inscription in Judeo- Persian in the world, are a few of the ancient relics that can still be seen to remind one of the glorious past of this forgotten outpost of the Jewish world."
In 2017 the Israeli government enshrined a replica of the Kerala Malabar Nasrani Syrian Christian Copper plates in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel. A plaque was installed citing that the Hebrew inscriptions on the Kollam copper plates from the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, in Thiruvalla, in Kerala is the oldest evidence of the presence of Jewish people in Kerala and India.
Malabar Cochin Jewish congregational music occurs in Organum style of music. Even today the song Yigdal Elohim Chai has the same tune in Yemenite Jewish tradition and Malabar Jewish tradition.
Later history of Malabar Jews and Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam Synagogue
By the 1300s Arab traders settled in the areas under the control of the Zamorin and this earned the Zamorin significantly more taxes from the Larger Arab trading population than the smaller Jewish community. As the Arabs gained more prominence in Kozhikode, the Jewish population began to leave or integrate with the Arabs in the Kozhikode region of the zamorin. Even today there is a Jew Street in Kozhikode.
Later Jewish settlements moved to further inland regions from Muziris. These settlements were at Chendamangalam synagogue, Paravur Synagogue (Paravur Jew Town and Paravur Jew Street) and the Kadavambhagham Ernakulam synagogue. The oldest tombstone from this community – the tombstone of Sarah Bet Israel is today to be seen in the Chendamangalam Jewish cemetery near the Chendamangalam Jewish Synagogue. This is the oldest tombstone in all of the Indian Sub-Continent and dates back from around the time of the founding of the Chendamangalam Synagogue in 1166 CE.
Through the 1200s CE a South-side synagogue (Thekkumbhagar synagogue) and a Coast side-river Harbour (Jetty) side synagogue (Kadavumbhagam synagogue was created in Mattancheri and similarly another set of ‘South-side' (Thekkumbhagar synagogue) and Coast side-river Harbour (Jetty) Synagogue (Kadavambhagam synagogue was also built in Ernakulam. Thus there are two sets of Thekkumbhagam synagogue and Kadavambhagam synagogue. One set in Mattanchery and another set in Ernakulam. The Kadavambhagam synagogue at Ernakulam still has the Sefer Torah (Torah Scrolls) making it the oldest Malabar Jewish synagogue. All these synagogues are essentially built as continuation of the synagogue in Muziris.
The Present Kadavumbhagam Ernakulam synagogue site is from 1200 CE though the structure is renovated. The Jewish settlement of Malha followed and a synagogue was established in Mala around 1200s CE as well. This synagogue site still exists and has one of the largest graveyards in India spread across 4 acres. Today the present day Paravur Synagogue, Paravur Jew Town and Paravur Jew Street and the Chendamangalam Synagogue and Chendamangalam Jewish cemetery are all part of the Muziris Heritage project.
The white Spanish Jews later came in the 16th century and made a Sephardic synagogue near the Kadavambhagam synagogue at Mattancherry. This Spanish Sephardic synagogue is today known as the Mattancherry Paradesi Synagogue and was made in 1568.
Modern day history of Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam Synagogue
The kadavumbhagham Mattancherry synagogue is in ruins. However, the Kadavunbhagham Ernakulam synagogue has now been restored (2018). In modern times the Sabbath services at the Kadavumbhagam Ernakulam synagogue continued till 1972 when a large portion of the community immigrated to Israel by 1972 along with the Torah scrolls. for decades, the Kadavumbhagham Synagogue at Ernakulam remained without any Sabbath services and without a sefer torah. Today the synagogue is nested within the bustling market at Ernakulam with a thriving aquarium in the front area near the synagogue operating since 1985. After much effort the Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam synagogue was restored and the Sefer Torah (Torah Scrolls) brought back to the synagogue in 2018 after 46 years. Today there are only 2 synagogues in Kochi that has Torah scrolls. The Paradesi synagogue of the (Spanish Sephardic Jews in Mattancherry) and the Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam synagogue of the ancient Malabar Jews.
Traditional Synagogue festivities, cuisine and cultural life
Traditional community cuisine include rice breads like Palappam (similar to Yemenite Jewish Lahoh and Ethiopian Jewish injera) for perunnal (High Holy Days), chuttu meen (fried fish), Erachi–molugu curry (Red chilli beef curry) and Chicken. There is also Coconut Rice. Delicacies include achappam and kuzhalappam. Other delicacies also include Kubbe. Pesahaappam (Passover unleavened bread) is prepared only for Passover festival. Coconut milk is used in cooking non vegetarian dishes to avoid mixing of dietary food in accordance with Kosher. The traditional attire of the community members included Chatta and Mundu as everyday clothing. Meekamothirum Kunukku (large ear ring), Chatta and Mundu, Kuppayam. The traditional language of the community is Judeo-Malayalam (Hebrew Malayalam). and the congregational biblical reading is done in a form of accentuated recitation called Cantillation. Hebrew Cantillation involves the Palestinian dot system, which was later incorporated into the Tiberian ekphonetic notation.
Synagogue Architecture
The synagogue has ceiling with intricate carvings. The women's section was the balcony so as not to distract men during worship. Like most orthodox Jewish synagogues around the world, Cochin Jewish synagogue has segregated seating for men and women. The Kadavumbhagham Ernakulam synagogue has a Bimah. the synagogue has a much decorated “heckal” that is usually made from wood and is typically plated with precious metal like gold or silver. This houses the Torah Scrolls. The Heckal constitutes the Holy of Holies that is separated only by a parokhet, or curtain, The synagogue also has 'ner Tamid' (a lamp from the ceiling at the centre of the sanctuary).

Clinical trials on Ayurveda refer to any clinical trials done on Ayurvedic treatment. Ayurveda is a traditional medicine system in India and like other cultural medical practices includes both conventional medicine and also complementary and alternative medicine. When there are clinical trials in Ayurveda, the focus tends to be on practices in alternative medicine.
A 2017 essay described that in India, Ayurveda is inadequately equipped to manage many modern diseases, owing to insufficient research and development. The essay argued that clinical trials in Ayurveda should focus on areas outside the scope of modern medicine.
Also, while there is a short history of clinical research on Ayurvedic treatments, there is no existing systematic review available which identifies all the studies and interprets them as a whole.
Educational organizations which teach Ayurveda require training if they are to design clinical trials on Ayurvedic treatments.
As of 2016 the Clinical Trials Registry - India contained approximately 200 records of clinical trials on Ayurvedic treatments.
List of clinical trials
Of all the recorded clinical trials, the following treatments are those for which there are meta-analyses of multiple trials:
Bacopa monnieri for cognitive skill
Withania somnifera for anxiety
treatment for osteoarthritis
Yoga as treatment

Alfred Guzzetti (born 1942) is a maker of documentary and experimental films and tapes. Their work has been shown at the New York Film Festival, the Margaret Mead Festival, and other festivals in London, Rotterdam, Germany, Spain and France, as well as in installation settings in New York, Copenhagen, and Santa Monica.
Education
Alfred Guzzetti was born in Philadelphia and attended the public schools there. They earned a BA from Central High School and a second BA from Harvard College. They studied at Birkbeck College, University of London, as a Marshall Scholar, and received a Ph.D. in English Literature from Harvard University, where they now teach.
Career
Following a series of films for theatrical productions, Guzzetti's experimental short film, Air, won first prize in its category at the 1972 Chicago Film Festival. Afterwards they embarked on an autobiographical cycle that included the feature-length Family Portrait Sittings (1975) and Scenes from Childhood (1979), both premiered at the Whitney Museum of American Art. These led to further autobiographical films, including the recently completed The Gifts of Time (2018), and to collaborations with the photographer Susan Meiselas and filmmaker Richard P. Rogers, with whom they co-directed Living at Risk: The Story of a Nicaraguan Family (1985) and Pictures from a Revolution (1991). These were political and historical documentaries and prompted later collaborations with Susan Meiselas on Reframing History (2004) and A Family in History, which includes Living at Risk plus a set of 20 short films entitled The Barrios Family 25 Years Later. In the late 1980s they began a series of conversations with anthropologist Ákos Östör that resulted in Seed and Earth (1994), a portrayal of life in a Bengali village, and Khalfan and Zanzibar (1999), which poses the question of an individual's relation to their culture. Both of these were made collaboratively with Östör and anthropologist Lina Fruzzetti. Around 1993 Guzzetti became interested in the experimental possibilities of the new small video formats and began a series of videos that included What Actually Happened (1996), Under the Rain (1997), A Tropical Story (1998), The Tower of Industrial Life (2000), which was shown in the 2002 Whitney Biennial, Down from the Mountains (2002), Calcutta Intersection (2003), History of the Sea (2004), and most recently, Still Point (2009) and Passage (2018). This experimental strain is related to their collaborations with composers, including their contributions to Earl Kim's Exercises en Route (1971), as well as to Kurt Stallmann's SONA (2005). They also work collaboratively with Kurt Stallmann on Breaking Earth (2008), a gallery installation for 11 channels of sound and 5 video projections; Moon Crossings (2011), for 15 instruments, electronics and video; the single-channel Time Present (2013); and Among Rivers (2019) for 7 projectors, 28 loudspeakers, and four performers. With composer Ivan Tcherepnin they created the 16mm film Sky Piece (1978)

In chemistry thiadiazoles are a sub-family of azole compounds, with the name thiadiazole originating from the Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature. Structurally, they are five-membered heterocyclic compounds containing one sulfur and two nitrogen atoms. They are aromatic ring by virtue of their two double bonds and the sulfur lone pair. Four possible structures exist depending on the relative positions of the heteroatoms; these forms do not interconvert and hence are structural isomers and not tautomers. The compounds themselves are rarely synthesized and possess no particular application, however compounds bearing them as a structural motif are fairly common in pharmacology.

Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Kentucky along the southern border with Tennessee. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 20,813. Its county seat is Monticello. The county, on the south-central border with Tennessee, was named for Gen. Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War hero. As of November 3, 2020, Wayne County is a wet countya measure allowing the sales and consumption of alcoholic drinks passed by a margin of 4,901 for and 3,966 against.
History
The first known European-American settlers to visit the area were longhunters who arrived in the 1770s. They established a temporary camp near Mill Springs on the Cumberland River. Benjamin Price built a log cabin in 1775, and Price's Station became one of the earliest Kentucky settlements. This was still an area of Cherokee homeland territory, and conflicts arose between the groups as more Americans settled here.
Many Revolutionary War veterans followed Price, including Joshua Jones, who arrived in 1794, Jonathan and James Ingram in 1796, Cornelius Phillips in 1798, and Isaac West in 1799. Veterans, they had each been given land grants in the area, in lieu of back salary payments by the United States government from the war.
Wayne County was formed December 13, 1800 from Pulaski and Cumberland counties. It was the 43rd county in the state and is named for General "Mad Anthony" Wayne, a hero of the American Revolution and the Northwest Indian War. Wayne's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers virtually ended the Indian threat against Kentucky settlers.
The area was developed for agriculture, and planters used enslaved African Americans as laborers. Early in the Civil War, Confederate Army General Felix Zollicoffer made their headquarters in the Brown-Lanier House at Mill Springs. They were killed at the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19, 1862, when they mistook some Union troops for their own and approached them. The Union men shot them dead, and without their leader, the Confederate were defeated.

Sean Sherman (born 1974) is an Oglala Lakota Sioux chef, cookbook author, forager, and promoter of indigenous cuisine. Sherman founded the indigenous food education business and caterer The Sioux Chef, as well as the nonprofit North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems. They received a James Beard Foundation Leadership Award and their 2017 cookbook, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, won the 2018 James Beard Award for Best American Cookbook.
Early life
Sherman was born in 1974 and grew up on their grandparents' ranch on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. They hunted and foraged from an early age, recalling their grandfather giving them a shotgun on their seventh birthday. They grew up eating many government commodity foods such as cereal, shortening, and canned hash, which they cite as the norm they seek to depart from. They attended Black Hills State University. Their grandparents were fluent in Lakota.
Early career
Sherman got their first restaurant job washing dishes at 13, soon moving onto the line. They spent a summer working for the US Forest Service in the Black Hills, identifying plants. They spent most of their twenties working in a series of Minneapolis restaurants and by 27 was working as an executive chef. By 29 they were burnt out and spent some time in Mexico regrouping; while in Puerto Vallarta they spent time with some Huichol people and had an "epiphany", saying: "After seeing how the Huicholes held onto so much of their pre-European culture through artwork and food, I recognized I wanted to know my own food heritage. What did my ancestors eat before the Europeans arrived on our lands?”
Career
In 2014 Sherman founded indigenous food education business and caterer The Sioux Chef. The Washington Post called it "a homonym to another ... culinary concept", the sous-chef.
They founded the nonprofit North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems (NĀTIFS) with their business and life partner Dana Thompson. The organization includes the Indigenous Food Lab, which works with ethnobotanists to record the earliest names of native plants. In 2015, they and Thompson launched Tatanka Truck, a food truck that offers such dishes as bison wild rice and teas made from cedar and maple.
In 2017 Sherman co-authored The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, published by the University of Minnesota, which won the 2018 James Beard Award for Best American Cookbook. In order to create the book's recipes, they interviewed older community members and searched archives for descriptions of traditional Lakota foods. Recipes in the book contain no dairy, wheat, beef, pork, or cane sugar, as these are non-indigenous ingredients, brought to North America by European colonizers. Sherman describes the recipes as "hyperlocal, ultraseasonal, uber-healthy [and] most of all, it's utterly delicious." Publishers Weekly called the book, "an illuminating guide to Native American food that will enthrall home cooks and food historians alike." That same year they prepared a six-course dinner at the James Beard House.
In 2018 they participated in a National Museum of American History roundtable at the Food History weekend event. During the event they prepared a traditional dish, Mag˘áksic˘a na Psíŋ Wasná, duck and wild rice pemmican.
In 2019 Sherman received a James Beard Foundation Leadership Award, which recognizes people and organizations that "(work) to change our food world for the better."
The New York Times called their style "colorful and elegant".
Philosophy
Sherman abandoned the use of ingredients that are not endemic to North America after having "an epiphany" while working at a restaurant in Mexico that used local ingredients and realizing that the traditional foods of the Oglala were "completely unrepresented in American cuisine." They object to indigenous cuisine being called "the next big thing", saying, "This is not a trend. It's a way of life." They told the James Beard Foundation, "We're not trying to cook like it's 1491. We're trying to take knowledge from the past and evolve it for today."
Along with some other Native American chefs, Sherman rejects frybread, often associated with "traditional" Native American cuisine, calling it "everything that isn't Native American food" and writing that it represents "perseverance and pain, ingenuity and resilience." While a symbol of resilience, as it was developed out of necessity using government-provided flour, sugar, and lard, these chefs also consider it a symbol of colonial oppression, as the ingredients were being provided because the government had moved the people onto land that could not support growing traditional staples like corn and beans.

The coins of the Rhodesian dollar were part of the physical form of Rhodesia's historical currency, the Rhodesian dollar.
All Rhodesian decimal coins were designed by Tommy Sasseen and struck at the South African Mint in Pretoria.

In late June 1969, Rhodesian voters agreed to adopt a new constitution which would establish a republic (1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum). On 17 February 1970, Rhodesia changed over to decimal currency. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland halfpenny and penny were withdrawn from circulation and replaced with the cent coin, 1 cent coin (click for image) (their values were not exactly equal) and a cent (3d) tickey. The new coins depicted the Rhodesian coat of arms on the obverse instead of Queen Elizabeth II's portrait, reflecting the de facto constitutional change. The 1964 coinage issue remained in circulation. The sixpence (6d) became 5 cents, the shilling (1/-) became 10 cents, the florin (2/-) became 20 cents, and the half-crown (2/6) became 25 cents.
In 1973, a new cupronickel five cent coin was issued. This coin had the Rhodesian coat of arms alone on the obverse, to which the legend RHODESIA was added for the 1975–77 strikings.
In 1975 a new ten cent and 25 cent pieces appeared; it was struck in this year only.
A new 20 cent coin was struck in 1975 and again in 1977.
The last Rhodesian coins were struck in 1977. The 1977 cent coin is extremely rare with 10 pieces known.
Following independence under majority rule in 1980 as Zimbabwe, the Rhodesian dollar was withdrawn in late 1980 and replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par.

Damage are a British R&B boy band who achieved success in the 1990s with eleven hit singles, including four top 10 successes on the UK Singles Chart. They have sold 2.6 million records worldwide. The band currently consists of Jade Jones, Rahsaan J Bromfield, Andrez Harriott, and Noel Simpson.
History
1995–1999: Formation and Forever
The band was formed by Rahsaan "Ras" Bromfield and Noel Simpson who were students at the Barbara Speake Stage School in the London neighbourhood of Acton. They rapped and danced at school assemblies. Jade Jones was brought into the band when Bromfield and Simpson heard them sing a high note. Andrez Harriott, a student at Sylvia Young Theatre School, was recruited after they and Jones performed together in the musical play Carmen Jones. Coreé Richards was asked to join the band after they were heard singing at a bus stop. The band sent a demo tape of a cover version of the Jackson 5 song "Anything" to Jazz Summers of Big Life Records in early 1995. Damage made inroads into the UK Singles Chart and the second single "Love II Love" reached number 12 while the follow-up, "Forever", charted at number 6 during the Christmas period. "Forever" was also notable for being both the first song that Steve Mac and Wayne Hector wrote together, and the song that caught the ear of Simon Cowell and effectively led to Mac becoming the chief songwriter-producer for Cowell's subsequent projects.
Damage's debut album Forever followed in 1997, along with two further UK top 10 singles – "Love Guaranteed" and a cover version of Eric Clapton's "Wonderful Tonight", the latter reaching number 3. The quintet subsequently embarked on an extensive touring schedule while negotiating a new recording contract following the collapse of Big Life. Jones remained in the media spotlight through their long-term romance with Emma Bunton of the Spice Girls.
2000–2001: Since You've Been Gone and split
In 2000, they signed with Cooltempo Records and released the second album's first single, "Ghetto Romance". The song was produced by production duo Tim & Bob, and peaked at No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart. On 30 August, "Rumours" was released as second single. The song is a mixture of R&B and 2-step. The CD2 single contains UK garage remixes of "Rumours" and their previous single "Ghetto Romance", as remixed by Ed Case & Carl H and Groove Chronicles, respectively. The second album was initially due for release on 25 September 2000, following the release of "Rumours". However, the release date was subsequently pushed back to allow for new material to be recorded. This resulted in the album's track listing being revised. The initial track listing includes the tracks "Feelin' Me" and "Midnight Caller", as well as an outro called "Before We Leave".
The second album, Since You've Been Gone, was released on 2 April 2001. However, the final release omits the last tracks and instead replaces them with "I Don't Know" (featuring Emma Bunton), "After the Love Has Gone" and a Mushtaq mix of "So What If I". In August, after the third and fourth singles – "Still Be Lovin' You" and "So What If I" – Richards decided to leave the band. The four members released "After the Love Has Gone" as the fifth and final single and decided to split in December 2001. Harriott and Jones formed CherryBlackStone in 2002, but the duo lasted only a few months. Damage performed a one-off gig at Party in the Park in Leeds on 25 July 2010, but did not officially reunite at that time.
2014–present: Return
In early 2014, Damage reformed as a quartet without Richards for the second series of the ITV2 documentary The Big Reunion along with other groups such as Eternal and A1, although Richards did appear on the show to talk about the band and meet with their bandmates one last time. Since their reformation the group have sporadicly performed at gigs together.

Potamarcha congener is a species of dragonfly in the family Libellulidae. It was first described by Jules Pierre Rambur in 1842, almost fifty years before Friedrich Karsch described its genus. Potamarcha congener is one of two species making up the genus Potamarcha, together with Potamarcha puella.
Distribution
Potamarcha congener is common through much of its range, which stretches through parts of South Asia, South-East Asia, and Oceania, including in countries such as India, Indonesia, China, Australia, and Vietnam. Owing to its wide distribution, the species has been classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Description and habitat
Potamarcha congener, known as a yellow-tailed ashy skimmer, common chaser, or swampwatcher,
is a medium-sized dragonfly with a bluish black thorax and yellow tail with black markings. Face is olivaceous yellow to steel black or brown. Eyes are reddish brown above and bluish grey below. In male adults, the thorax and first four segments of the abdomen are covered with bluish pruinescence. In young adults, yellow markings are visible through the pruinescence. The rest of the abdomen is black with orange markings, with the last two segments entirely black. The female thorax has yellow and black stripes on the sides. The abdomen is black with dull orange markings, and has prominent flaps on each side of segment eight. The flaps may serve to hold the eggs in place during oviposition.
This dragonfly is found in terrestrial areas with standing water. This can include near small ponds, rice fields or marshes where it breeds.

Chu Hsi-ning (born Chu Ch'ing-hai; 16 June 1927 – 27 March 1998) was a Chinese writer based in Taiwan.
Their daughters Chu T'ien-wen and Chu T'ien-hsin are also famous writers.
Chu was born in Suqian, China. In 1945, they entered an art college in Hangzhou, but dropped out to join the nationalist army in the struggle against the communists. They reached the rank of colonel. They were one of the soldiers who accompanied Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan in 1949. They came to prominence as a writer in the 1950s and remained productive until their death.
They can be grouped with anti-communist writers or the soldier writers; their fiction displays an interest in the impact of modernity on ordinary people and in the clash of social forces. These are concerns they inherited from the May Fourth Movement and the writers of the 1930s. However, Chu Hsi-ning, unlike many Chinese writers of the 1930s, was a conservative. Their stories reinforce traditional communal values and a morally Christian worldview.
Chu is the father of writers Chu T'ien-wen and Chu T'ien-hsin, together with whom they participated in the Three-Three series of publications in the late 1970s. The "threes" stand for the Three Principles of the People and for the Christian trinity.

Bezlotoxumab, sold under the brand name Zinplava, is a human monoclonal antibody designed for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infections.
This drug, along with actoxumab, was developed through Phase II efficacy trials by a partnership between Medarex Inc and MassBiologics of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The project was then licensed to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp for further development and commercialization.
Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies which bind C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively.
A Phase III trial only showed a benefit from bezlotoxumab; the combination of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab worked no better to prevent recurrence of C. difficile associated diarrhea than bezlotoxumab alone.
Progress towards FDA approval
On June 9, 2016, the U.S. FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (formerly known as the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee) met to discuss bezlotoxumab. The committee voted to recommend approval of Merck's license application by a vote of 10 to 5, generally expressing a willingness to accept that the trials had proven that bezlotoxumab decreased recurrence of C. difficile overall. The committee tempered this acceptance with a robust discussion of whether or not the drug provide more marked benefit in some patient groups and expressed concern over a potential safety signal in the group treated with bezlotoxumab. The data suggested that bezlotoxumab might have the most benefit in sicker, high-risk patients but did show a statistical benefit in all patient subgroups. Although the patient population as a whole contained many very sick individuals and thus there were many adverse events in both the subjects receiving placebo and those receiving bezlotoxumab, the panel focused on a small number of serious events in patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure. In this subset the patients receiving bezlotoxumab appeared to have a higher rate of negative outcomes than the placebo group, although there many have been imbalance in how sick the patients in those groups were.
The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the FDA's review of bezlotoxumab is July 23, 2016.
Bezlotoxumab gained FDA approval in October 2016: "indicated to reduce the recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibiotics for CDI and are at high risk for recurrence."
Mechanism of TcdB neutralization
By x-ray crystallized structure of N-terminal of Clostridioides difficile toxin B (TcdB), the toxin was identified to consist of three domains: a GTD, a cysteine protease and a combined repetitive oligopeptides, CROP domain. The CROP domain consists of four different peptide units: B1, B2, B3, and B4. Bezlotoxumab specifically inhibits the CROP domain of TcdB. It recognizes a specific epitope on toxin TcdB and has high affinity for that region. The GTD domain does not interact with bezlotoxumab, but appears to interact with B1, which is representative of the entire CROP domain. Bezlotoxumab interacts with either B2 and B3 or the overlapping residues region between the two domains. The B4 fragment does not interact with the specific portion of the CROP domain. Characterization of peptide B1 as full CROP domain of TcdB suggests that the antibody specifically reacts with the B2 region of the CROP domain. The leads to the conclusion that TcdB epitope lies within the N-terminus of the CROP domain.

The Praeneste fibula (the "brooch of Palestrina") is a golden fibula or brooch, today housed in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome. The fibula bears an inscription in Old Latin, claiming craftsmanship by one Manios and ownership by one Numazios. At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language. The authenticity of the inscription has since been disputed. However a new analysis performed in 2011 declared it to be genuine "beyond any reasonable doubt" and to date from the Orientalizing period, in the first half of the seventh century BC.
Discovery
The fibula was presented to the public in 1887 by Wolfgang Helbig, an archaeologist. According to some sources, Helbig did not explain how they had come to acquire the artifact at the time, although others state that the fibula "was first made known to the public in three short articles in the for 1887 where it is said to have been purchased in Palestrina by a friend of Helbig in the year 1871, or five years before the discovery of the tomb" – the tomb in question being the Bernardini Tomb whose treasure the fibula was later claimed to be a part of.
Date and inscription
The fibula was thought to originate from the 7th century BC. It is inscribed with a text that appears to be written in Old Latin or Proto-Latino-Faliscan (shown by as an accusative instead of ablative), here transcribed to Roman letters:
The reconstructed Proto-Italic ancestor would have been:
The equivalent Classical Latin sentence obtained by applying the appropriate differences between Old Latin and Classical Latin would probably have been:
translated as:
Manius made me for Numasius
Hoax hypothesis
In 1980 Margherita Guarducci, a leading epigraphist, published a book arguing that the inscription had been forged by Francesco Martinetti, an art dealer, and Helbig, who were known to have collaborated in shady dealings. Guarducci argued that the fibula's presentation in 1887, was a hoax perpetrated to advance the careers of both men. This was the most formal but not the first accusation of its kind: Georg Karo had said that Helbig told them that the fibula had been stolen from Palestrina's Tomba Bernardini.
Subsequent arguments for authenticity
Evidence in favor of the genuineness of the text came from a new Etruscan inscription of the Orientalizing period published by Massimo Poetto and Giulio Facchetti in 1999. The inscription scratched on the body of an Etrusco-Corinthian aryballos shows a gentilicium, Numasiana, which provides confirmation of the genuineness of the name Numasioi on the Fibula Prenestina, often regarded as suspicious by the supporters of the theory that it was a forgery.
In 2005, based on epigraphic and other arguments, linguist Markus Hartmann concluded that it is justified to assume the authenticity of the inscription as long as there is no compelling evidence for a forgery, and dated it with confidence to the seventh century BC.
In 2011, new scientific evidence was presented by the research team of Edilberto Formigli and Daniela Ferro, whose optical, physical and chemical analyses allowed them to take into consideration smaller scrapes on the surface of the object than was possible in the 1980s. Observation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and detailed physical and chemical analyses on the surface of small areas within the track of the incision showed the existence of micro-crystallization of the gold surface: a natural phenomenon that could have taken place only in the course of centuries after the fusion. The study reported that a 19th-century forger could not have realized such a forgery.
However, the micro-crystallization discovery alone seems to still leave open the possibility that C. Densmore Curtis' impression, expressed in 1919, that "based on its stiff lines and awkward transitions, ... it did not come from the Bernardini Tomb, but is of a somewhat later date", could be correct.
Replicas
Replicas of the fibula are held by the National Roman Museum's Museum of Epigraphy at the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, and also by the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Theophile Verbist, CICM (12 June 1823 – 23 February 1868) was a Belgian Catholic priest who founded the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a missionary religious congregation of men. They led missionary activities in China.
Early life
Verbist was born in Antwerp, Belgium on 12 June 1823. After brilliant studies at the Minor Seminary and Major Seminary in Mechelen, they were ordained as a priest on 18 September 1847. They were appointed subregent of the Minor Seminary of Mechelen on 1 October 1847.
Career in Belgium
In 1853 they became chaplain of the Military Academy in Brussels. They were simultaneously appointed director of the Sisters of Molenbeek, a Congregation of Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, which worked since 1840 in various countries as missionaries. They became the National Director in Belgium of the Association of the Holy Childhood, a charitable organization established in France to raise funds for orphans in countries with Catholic missions. Through this engagement they became aware of the plight of orphans in China.
In 1860 they conceived the plan to gather Belgian secular priests to travel to China and establish an orphanage. This initiative received the approval of Cardinal Engelbert Sterckx, Archbishop of Mechelen. Cardinal Sterkx insisted that Verbist could only leave if they joined an existing congregation such as the Jesuits, the Recollects, the Paris Foreign Missions Society or the Lazarists who were already active in China or if their mission was incorporated into one of the apostolic vicariates in China. However, Verbist was able to convince the Belgian church leaders and finally obtain the approval of Cardinal Sterckx and the Belgian bishops to establish a new Belgian missionary congregation. The canonical establishment of the congregation by Cardinal Sterckx is dated 28 November 1862. This congregation, which had as its objective to send missionaries to China, was called the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (CICM). It is better known under the name Scheutists, which refers to the place of its foundation, i.e. the "Scheutveld" in Anderlecht (now in Brussels). Theophiel Verbist was appointed by Cardinal Sterckx as the first Superior General.
Mission to China
During a visit to Rome in 1862, they had proposed to the Propaganda Fide that Hong Kong be assigned as their congregation's mission area. This was declined as this area had already been assigned to the missionaries of Milan. On 1 September 1864 the area of Inner Mongolia in northern China was assigned to the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary as its mission area. This area had previously been assigned to the French Vincentians. As a result of the French protectorate of foreign catholic missionaries in China there existed a requirement that even Belgian missionaries should hold a French passport in order to engage in missionary activities in China. This delayed Verbist's departure for one year.
On 25 August 1865 Verbist set out on their journey in the company of four companions: Father Aloïs Van Segvelt, Frans Vrankx, Ferdinand Hamer and lay helper Paul Splingaerd. After landing in Hong Kong, they made their way to Xiwanzi in Inner Mongolia. Initially Xiwanzi was the center of their mission area. Two Chinese priests Petrus Feng and Vicent Fan who had been formed by the Lazarists assisted the newly arrived missionaries. In November 1866 three new CICM fathers arrived to support the missionary work, which was being expanded eastward.
On 23 February 1868 Verbist died from typhus in the village of Laohugou () during a visit to the eastern mission area. On 10 May 1931 their mortal remains were solemnly repatriated in a Chinese coffin to Anderlecht and placed in a mausoleum established in a side chapel of the CICM church in Scheut. The mausoleum includes a bronze statue of Verbist, dressed in Chinese garments, and kneeling with open arms before the globe, made by the sculptor Aloïs De Beule. When the CICM church in Scheut was razed in 1974, Verbist's Chinese coffin was moved to a small crypt under the new chapel and the bronze statue was placed in the garden.

Horse worship is a spiritual practice with archaeological evidence of its existence during the Iron Age and, in some places, as far back as the Bronze Age. The horse was seen as divine, as a sacred animal associated with a particular deity, or as a totem animal impersonating the king or warrior. Horse cults and horse sacrifice were originally a feature of Eurasian nomad cultures. While horse worship has been almost exclusively associated with Indo-European culture, by the Early Middle Ages it was also adopted by Turkic peoples.
Horse worship still exists today in various regions of South Asia.
Bronze Age
The history of horse domestication is still a debated topic. The most widely accepted theory is that the horse was domesticated somewhere in the western Eurasian steppes. Various archaeological cultures including the Botai in Kazakhstan and Dereivka in Ukraine are proposed as possible candidates. However, widespread use of horses on the steppes is only noted from the late part of the third millennium BCE.
The world's oldest horse burial and signs of horse worship (such as horse figurines among grave goods) were discovered at the Syezzheye cemetery of Samara culture in the Bogatovsky District. The cemetery is dated to the 1st half of the 4th millennium BC.
Iron Age
The Uffington White Horse in the United Kingdom, is dated to the Iron Age (800 BC–100 AD) or the late Bronze Age (1000–700 BC) in Britain; deposits of fine silt removed from the horse's 'beak' were scientifically dated to the late Bronze Age.
The French archaeologist Patrice Méniel has demonstrated, based on examination of animal bones from many archaeological sites, a lack of hippophagy (horse eating) in ritual centres and burial sites in Gaul, although there is some evidence for hippophagy from earlier settlement sites in the same region.
Horse oracles are also attested in later times (see Arkona below).
There is some reason to believe that Poseidon, like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a horse. In Greek art, Poseidon rides a chariot that was pulled by a hippocampus or by horses that could ride on the sea, and sailors sometimes drowned horses as a sacrifice to Poseidon to ensure a safe voyage.
In the cave of Phigalia Demeter was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized corn-spirit bore this form. Them priests were called Poloi (Greek for "colts") in Laconia.
This seems related to the archaic myth by which Poseidon once pursued Demeter; They spurned their advances, turning themselves into a mare so that they could hide in a herd of horses; they saw through the deception and became a stallion and captured them Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech.
This bears some resemblance to the Norse mythology reference to the gender-changing Loki having turned themselves into a mare and given birth to Sleipnir, "the greatest of all horses".
Germanic
Tacitus (Germania) mentions the use of white horses for divination by the Germanic tribes:
But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions divine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same sacred woods and groves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly labour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest and the King, or the Chief of the Community, who both carefully observed their actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and assurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles, even by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods, and the horses privy to theirs will.
Gallo-Roman
In Gallo-Roman times, the worship of Epona was widespread in the north-western portions of the Roman Empire.
Early medieval
The Welsh legend of Rhiannon and the Irish legend of Macha, although first recorded in Christian times, may indicate memories of horse worship. The white horse of Rhiannon are another example of cultic use of white horses, which seems to be an Indo-European phenomenon.
The temple fortress of Arkona, at Cape Arkona on the German island of Rügen, was the religious centre of the Slavic Rani in the Early Middle Ages. The temple, dedicated to the deity Svantevit, housed an important horse oracle in Slavic times, where the behaviour of a white stallion could decide peace or war – recalling the above account by Tacitus.
Similar horse oracles have been reported from medieval temples in Pomeranian Stettin and Lutitian Rethra and in temples in the Ming Dynasty Tombs.
India
In India, horse worship in the form of worship of Hayagriva dates back to 2000 BC, when the Indo-Aryan people started to migrate into the Indus valley. The Indo-Aryans worshipped the horse for its speed, strength, and intelligence. To this day, the worship of Hayagriva exists among the followers of Hinduism.

John Field or Feild (1520/1530–1587), was a "proto-Copernican" English astronomer. Field was the son of Richard Field (d. 1542). They were born, it is supposed, at Ardsley in the West Riding of Yorkshire between 1520 and 1530. They received a liberal education, and Joseph Hunter, their descendant, conjectured that part of it was gained under the patronage of Alured Comyn, Prior of Nostell, from which house the cell of Woodkirk, near Ardsley, depended. Anthony à Wood believed that they studied at Oxford.
They were living in London at the date of their first Ephemeris (1556), and appears, from a remark in a manuscript in Lambeth Palace Library, to have been a public instructor in science.
Publications
They published:
Ephemeris anni 1557 currentis juxta Copernici et Reinholdi canones … per J. Feild … ad Meridianum Londinensem … supputata. Adjecta est Epistola J. Dee, qua vulgares istos Ephemeridum fictores reprehendit, London, 1556
Ephemerides trium annorum, an. 1558, 59 et 60 … ex Erasmi Reinoldi tabulis accuratissimè ad Meridianum Civitatis Londinensis supputatæ, London, 1558
To the latter work the following are added:
Canon Ascensionum Obliquarum cujusvis stellæ non excedentis 8 gradus Latitudinis confectus, and
Tabula Stellarum Fixarum insigniorum, &c.
These works were the first in England in which the principles of the Copernican philosophy were recognised and asserted.
Arms and crest
On 4 September 1558 Field received a confirmation of arms and the grant of a crest allusive to their attainments in astronomical science, viz. the device of a red arm issuing from the clouds and presenting a golden orrery.
Personal life
In about 1560 they married Jane (d. 1609), daughter of John Amyas, a Kentish gentleman, and some time between that date and 1577, settled down at Ardsley, where they continued till their death, their position being that of a gentleman held in esteem among the better class of their neighbours. In the Yorkshire visitation of 1585 they recorded their arms and crest and the names of their wife and nine children. In their will, dated 28 Dec. 1586, they describe themselves as a "fermer sometyme student in the mathymathicke sciences". They died soon after the date of this will, the administration of their estate being granted to their widow on 3 May 1587.  They are buried in the porch of the church of East Ardsley, Yorkshire and a memorial plaque which reads: "Beneath this porch lies buried John Field 1520-1587 They were the first astronomer in this country to make known the discoveries of Copernicus."
Their library passed into the hands of William Coley of York, who afterwards returned it to the family.

Eremophila biserrata, also known as prostrate eremophila, is a flowering plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south of Western Australia. It is a prostrate shrub covering an area of up to about and which has serrated leaves and flowers that are green and yellow.
Description
Eremophila biserrata is a prostrate shrub often with long unbranched snake-like stems up to long and under ideal conditions the plant may spread to a diameter of . Its leaves are arranged alternately or clustered in rosettes, mostly long, wide, broadly lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. The leaves have serrated edges, the serrations often themselves serrated, sometimes deeply so that the leaf appears to have separate leaflets.
The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk usually long but are mostly hidden between the leaves with only the tips of the flowers visible. There are 5 overlapping green sepals differing slightly in size and shape from each other but about long. The 5 petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube and the petal lobes on its end are green and yellow, sometimes pale red and the 4 stamens extend well beyond the petal tube. Flowers appear mostly between September and November and are followed by fruit which are dry, oval-shaped and about long.
Taxonomy and naming
Eremophila biserrata was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1979 and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Chinnock collected the type specimen north of the road between Hyden and Lake Cronin. The specific epithet (biserrata) refers to the unusually serrated leaf margins.
Distribution and habitat
This eremophila occurs in areas near Hyden and Lake King in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy and clay soils near salt lakes and freshwater depressions.
Conservation status
Eremophila biserrata is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, meaning that it is rare or near threatened.
Use in horticulture
Prostrate eremophila is a ground-hugging shrub, ideal to replace grass where there is no foot traffic, because it does not grow into higher plants. It is easily propagated from cuttings, striking in a few weeks but needs to be kept moist during hot weather when first planted out. It will grow in full sun or as an understorey but is frost tolerant and relatively drought resistant.

The Glasdrumman ambush was an attack by the South Armagh Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) against a British Army observation post in Glasdrumman, County Armagh on 17 July 1981. An attempted ambush by the British Army on IRA members at a scrapyard southwest of Crossmaglen was itself ambushed, resulting in the death of one British soldier and the IRA retaining the ability to set up checkpoints in South Armagh.
Background
The crisis triggered by the 1981 Irish hunger strike of Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners led to an increase in militant Irish republican activity in Northern Ireland. British intelligence reports unveiled IRA intentions of mounting illegal checkpoints and hijacking vehicles on the IRA-controlled roads in South County Armagh, near the Irish border. To counter it, the British Army deployed the so-called "close observation platoons" (COPs) - small infantry sections acting as undercover units to counter IRA activity, a tactic introduced by Major General Richard Trant in 1977.
On 6 May 1981, a day after the death of hunger-striker Bobby Sands, one IRA member from a three-man unit was arrested while trying to set up a roadblock east of the main Belfast-Dublin road by 12 members of the Royal Green Jackets, who had been divided into three teams. A second volunteer crossed the border, only to be arrested by the Irish Army. The third IRA man escaped, apparently injured. A total of 689 rounds had been fired by the soldiers.
Ambush
After this initial success, the British Army continued these tactics. On 16 July, another operation was carried out by 18 Royal Green Jackets soldiers. That night, four concealed positions – Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta – were inserted into the Glassdrumman area, southwest of Crossmaglen in South Armagh, around a scrapyard along the border. The plan was that another unit – called the triggering team – would ambush any IRA unit on sight, while the other four would block the expected escape routes. On 17 July, the commanders in charge of Alpha and Delta teams, suspecting that the operation had been compromised by the presence of local civilians, ordered the withdrawal of their men. Shortly thereafter, Bravo team was suddenly engaged by automatic fire from an M60 machine gun and AR-15 rifles fired by six or seven IRA members. The concealed position, emplaced inside a derelict van, was riddled by more than 250 bullets. The team's leader, Lance Corporal Gavin Dean, was killed instantly and one of their men, Rifleman John Moore, was seriously wounded. Moore was later awarded the Military Medal. The IRA members fired their weapons from across the border, away.
Aftermath
The British Army's follow-up investigation concluded that Dean's team had been seen on the first day, allowing the IRA to carry out detailed reconnaissance of the area and to select a firing position for their ambush.
British army commanders concluded that "it was not worth risking the lives of soldiers to prevent an IRA roadblock being set up." The incident also exposed the difficulties of concealing operations from local civilians in South Armagh, a region of Northern Ireland heavily sympathetic to the IRA. Several years later, the IRA repeated its success against undercover British observation posts in the course of Operation Conservation in 1990.

In Spring 2008 they were the 94th Sather Professor of Classical Literature at the University of California, Berkeley; their Sather Lectures focused on the restaging of Greek tragedies in America, and the ways in which modern productions of these plays explored themes of contemporary concern including slavery, race, the status of women, immigration, and identity. These lectures were later published as Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage (2012). They have also been Visiting Professor at Dartmouth College and New York University.
 They are currently finishing a book on Euripides' Hecuba, coordinating an issue of the Proceedings of the Modern Language Association with Jean Howard on Tragedy, and working on tragic choruses.

Bertram Schmiterlöw (20 January 1920, Karlskrona–28 December 2002, Stockholm) was a Swedish painter, printmaker, draughtsman and sculptor. Bertram Schmiterlöw's artistry extends through more than five decades and is characterized by figurative, expressive and colorist works where light and surface jointly create the setting. The themes are often of a desolate, dreamy atmosphere where people are portrayed more as staffage figures rather than as the primary subject matter of the work. Their works include human depictions and natural scenes from Sweden and the Mediterranean countries. Schmiterlöw also painted portraits of many important members of the Swedish and Argentine trade, industry and government institutions. In addition they were commissioned to do the portraits of many politicians, royal family members and cultural celebrities in Sweden. Schmiterlow had their artistic training at Otte Skölds art school but left Sweden for Europe and Argentina in their early years. Their artistry was inspired by Edward Hopper, Giorgio Morandi and Pedro Figari.  They are the halfbrother of actor Vera Schmiterlöw. In 1974 they were decorated with the Royal Order of Vasa and in August 2001 with the Order of the Liberator General San Martín.

Dew is an unincorporated community in southern Freestone County, Texas, United States. It is located at the junction of State Highway 75 and Farm to Market Road 489, nine miles south of Fairfield, the county seat.
Originally known as Avant or Avant Prairie, the area was first settled in the 1850s by pioneers from Alabama. It hosted a post office under the name "Avant" from 1853 through January 1885 . In 1870, the settlement's name was changed to Sunshine after a local Methodist church. A post office was reestablished in December 1885 with the town renamed Dew. Locals requested the name "Drew" to honor a local resident, but the postal authorities misread the application.
The population of Dew peaked in 1947, when it was home to 195 residents. Approximately 70 people reside in Dew today. The Dew Independent School District serves area students.

Zach Merrett (born 3 October 1995) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). A medium sized midfielder standing at 1.79 metres (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighing 83 kilograms (183 lb), Merrett is able to contribute as a hard running midfielder capable of collecting a large number of uncontested possessions whilst also being capable of winning a contested ball and clearance. They were recruited by the Essendon Football Club with the twenty sixth selection in the 2013 AFL draft and made their debut in the 2014 season. Merrett is a three-time Crichton Medalist and dual All-Australian.
Early life and junior football
They grew up in Cobden, Victoria before boarding at Melbourne Grammar School on a cricket scholarship. Merrett participated in the Auskick program at Cobden. As a junior, Merrett played for Cobden Football Club and as a kid supported the Western Bulldogs. After a promising junior cricket career, Merrett focused on their footy and had a breakout year. They played every game for Vic Country and impressed in many, they took that form into the end of the TAC Cup season, where they were a consistent contributor for the Sandringham Dragons. Known as a ball winner in the TAC cup, they averaged 25.7 disposals a game during the tournament.  They are the younger brother and former teammate of Jackson Merrett.
AFL career
Essendon (2014–present)
After predictions Merrett would be drafted inside the top thirty in the 2013 national draft, they were recruited by the Essendon Football Club with their second selection and twenty sixth overall. Merrett made their debut in the opening round of the 2014 AFL season against North Melbourne. They were named as the substitute and came on late in the game, replacing Martin Gleeson. They were rewarded with a nomination for the 2014 AFL Rising Star after they collected 22 disposals, three tackles, and two goals in the round 11 wins against Richmond.
The 2015 AFL season saw Merrett spend more time in the midfield. In August, following Essendon's 87-point loss to the Western Bulldogs in round 18, it was announced that they would miss the remainder of the season with a major stress fracture in their foot.
In round 21, 2016, they became the third youngest match day captain in Essendon history when they led the side against at Etihad Stadium. Under their leadership, they won just their second match for the season, defeating the Suns by six points. They won the W.S. Crichton Medal as the club's best and fairest player for 2016, becoming the youngest player in 35 years to win the award. Their magnificent season was capped off by polling 19 votes in the 2016 Brownlow Medal. This was the third most votes for a player whose team won three or fewer games, and the most for a Bombers player since Jobe Watson polled 30 votes.
Merrett was named vice-captain for the 2017 AFL season. They had another fantastic season collecting 659 disposals, receiving their first selection in the All-Australian team and being named vice-captain in the 22under22 team for the second year in a row.
Their 2018 season failed to reach the heights of their previous, after being concussed in the opening round against the Adelaide Crows. They were continuously tagged throughout the year, but showed signs of improvement as Essendon worked towards a resurgence.
In January of the 2019 pre-season Merrett injured their ankle resulting in the use of a moon boot for 2 weeks however they were available for selection in round 1. Merrett went on to return to near their best footy during the 2019 season capped off with a 2nd club best and fairest award beating new Essendon recruit Dylan Shiel.
The Essendon midfielder produced another brilliant season in 2020, averaging 26.3 disposals and 4.3 marks, a statistic ranked elite by Champion Data, in shortened quarters to finish second in the Crichton Medal. Their 13 Brownlow Medal votes from 16 games, equal 11th overall, saw them rise to 12th position on the club's all-time votes leaderboard.
Before the start of the 2021 AFL season, Merrett was re-added to the club's leadership group with fellow Bombers Michael Hurley, Andrew McGrath and club captain Dyson Heppell. This was after being removed from the club leadership in the 2020 season, which was seen by some as a surprising move. Merrett started the 2021 season in great form with 31 disposals and a goal in Essendon's round 1 loss to Hawthorn. With injuries to key midfielders, Jye Caldwell and Dylan Shiel in Essendon's Round 2 lost to Port Adelaide, much of the midfield load was placed upon Merrett. Merrett would share most of the midfield responsibilities with fellow emerging talent Darcy Parish as both of them announced themselves as one of the most damaging midfield duos of the 2021 season. This fact was made apparent in Essendon's round 11 win over the West Coast Eagles where the duo would combine for 73 disposals, 13 inside 50s, 12 clearances and 9 tackles. The performance would earn both Merrett and Parish 9 coaches votes each. After continuing their good form through to the midway point of the season, Merrett, on June 17 2021, re-signed with the Essendon Football Club on a 6-year deal until 2027. After finishing the 2021 home and away season with 694 disposals going at an average of 31.5 disposals a game, ranked elite by Champion Data, and 103 tackles going at an average of 4.7 tackles a game, ranked above average by Champion Data, Merrett was awarded with their second All-Australian blazer.
Player profile
Merrett plays as an outside-inside midfielder with the ability to win the ball at the source of the contest. They were regarded as one of the best footy decision makers out of the 2013 AFL draft pool and uses their left foot as a penetrating weapon to spot up teammates inside fifty. Merrett is also known for their defensive work efforts and thus far in their career averages over 5 tackles a game.

Caesars Palace 2000 is a gambling simulation video game developed by Runecraft and published by Interplay Entertainment. It was released in North America and Europe in June 2000 for the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows' PCs. It is named after the famous Caesars Palace luxury hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Interplay announced in late 1999 that they were working on a title for the Dreamcast which was known to be a 3D simulation of gambling with traditional casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game machines. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds and payouts verified by a Ph.D in statistics. The PC version of the game received praise for its graphics and sound, but the Dreamcast version received criticism for its presentation, graphics, and slow pace.
Gameplay
There are eleven casino games, authentic Caesars Palace cards, chips, rules, and tutorial guides for beginners throughout each game. In the PlayStation version of the game, there are six card games, including variations of poker and blackjack; table games, including roulette and craps; video game machines, including video poker and keno; and five slot machine themes. For each of the various games included, official Caesars Palace tables and equipment are used. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds and payouts confirmed by statistician William Bertram, Ph.D. Tutorials and in-game hints can be shown on each of Caesar's Palace 2000: Millennium Gold Edition'''s various games. The tutorials and hints are displayed at times when the game notices that the player is making moves considered incorrect by casino standards. For further assistance, Caesar's Palace 2000: Millennium Gold Edition also features the Caesars Palace Guide to Gaming Handbook, which details rules and strategies for the included games.
In the PC and Dreamcast versions of the game, an initial stake of $2,000 is given, though more is available through loans at a virtual automated teller machine. Official Caesars Palace rules and tutorials are given for each game, along with genuine cards and chips. Odds and payouts are confirmed by Bertram. The card games include blackjack, Pai gow poker, Mini-Baccarat, Red dog, Casino war, and Spanish 21. The table games include craps and roulette, while machine gambling include video poker, poker challenge, and video Keno. The five slot machine themes include Ancient Egypt, Baseball Challenge, Halloween Spooky, Progressive Fruit, and Wild West. They all have different payouts and odds. The settings can be customized for some games, including the volume, coaching, number of decks, card tracking, bet limits, and animations.
Development
In September 1999, publisher Interplay Entertainment announced the arrival of several Dreamcast titles to be developed by Rage Software. Interplay revealed that they were working on another title, known as Caesars Palace 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was known to be a 3D simulation of gambling, and they promised that it will be "one of the most realistic portrayals of the casino atmosphere ever". It was going to have traditional casino games, like blackjack, poker, and slots, and was slated for a late fourth-quarter release in 1999.
In May 2000, developer Runecraft was simultaneously working with publisher Ripcord Games on the Dreamcast port of Spec Ops, while developing Caesars Palace 2000. It was announced that the game was set for release on the PC, Dreamcast, and PlayStation. They promised to include all the things associated with gambling, and a release in late May 2000. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino, with twenty-three different gambling games and adhering to the Official Caesars Palace Rules. Runecraft promised a title that "reflects the ambiance of Caesars Palace, including dealers with personality". Players would also be able to track their performance and do some statistical analysis.
ReceptionCaesars Palace 2000 received mixed reviews from critics, while the PC version received the most positive reaction. It received aggregate scores of 55% and 45% from GameRankings for PC and Dreamcast respectively.
For the PC version, GameSpot editor Stephen Poole stated "You'll be better off looking for free online versions of the various games contained in Caesars Palace 2000". In contrast, IGN was more favorable to the PC version of the game. Francois Laramee of Allgame praised the game for its "excellent audio-visuals. The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful. The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, they noted that "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently to be anything but distracting. The slot machine wheels are a bit on the small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired". ComputerAndVideoGames.com's Alex Huhtala criticized the game for its "Poor, vomit-inducing presentation".
For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that "Many of the games are quite enjoyable, but the truth of the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing" and criticized on how "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". They also called the music "boring and completely uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" and that "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000'' recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". They stated that the game "is definitely not about the looks" but "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". They noted that players "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" but to "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".
The Dreamcast version was heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that "the best bet for all involved would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint the most basic of cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". They also complained that "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that "when you win at slots, the camera always goes to the bottom of the machine to show you the payout scale" which "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". They also said that the advice the game gives you is "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" because "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" and that "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".

Jim Ball is an Australian radio personality, formerly broadcasting with the 2GB and 2UE networks in Sydney.
Biography
Ball's program typically consists of them discussing various issues (especially current events, politics and history) with callers. Ball is frank and does not shy away from politically incorrect topics. Like most radio announcers on the AM band in Sydney, Ball is politically conservative; they claim to represent traditional Australian values. According to Ball, the major threats to these values are a naive and uninformed view of Islam by many Australians (including the media), apathy and political correctness. Ball is also a staunch critic of multiculturalism and says that immigrants to Australia should be encouraged to integrate into mainstream Australia and accept "core Australian values."
Ball began on 2GB back in 1999 and constantly won the ratings manning the midnight to dawn shift. On 7 March 2008 Ball announced to their audience their resignation from 2GB and was replaced by David Oldfield. Ball took over 2UE's midnight to dawn program "New Day Australia" on 17 March, replacing Clive Robertson.

Avenging Angel is a solo piano album by American jazz pianist and composer Craig Taborn recorded in July 2010 and released on the ECM label.
Background
Taborn had been speaking to producer Manfred Eicher about recording their trio, but coordinating the schedules of everyone required was proving difficult. A week after Taborn had completed a solo piano tour of Europe, Eicher suggested that they record a solo album; Taborn "was ready at that point: shedding for hours a day, just practicing and playing exercises to prepare". For a week before the recording, they had been teaching children jazz in Switzerland; then, after a solo concert, Taborn remembers, "I was driven to Lugano, arriving at like 2 a.m. I was tired the next day going into the studio". Once there, they were determined to record something individual, instead of sounding similar to other solo jazz piano projects.
Recording and music
The album was recorded in a Radiotelevisione svizzera studio in Lugano, Switzerland. The piano was a Steinway concert grand model D. Asked how much of the album was improvised, Taborn replied that, "I would say 90 percent. A couple of the more rhythmic, long-cycle things were preconceptualized." Although two days were available in which to record, a total of 33 or 34 pieces for possible inclusion were recorded on the first day, and on the second Taborn told producer Manfred Eicher, "I think we're good, let's just start listening." The only pre-existing composition on the album is "Over the Water", which featured on Taborn's first album as leader, Craig Taborn Trio.
Taborn's comment on solo piano performance, including for this album, was that "I'm really listening intensely to these very subtle nuances of the sound in the piano. I'm even hearing the three different strings on each note, how they resonate and how the beats work. I wanted to find a way to document that, which can be tricky."
"The Broad Day King" features an ostinato with single-note phrases under it and much sustain and space between ideas. "Glossolalia" is more aggressive: rapid three-octave runs and bass poundings are used. In "This Voice Says So", they play just 20 notes in the opening minute, including a three-note phrase that is repeated six times. In "Gift Horse/Over the Water", Taborn uses right-hand chords played in different places within each repetition of the ten notes that are used in each unit of two bars.
Reception
The Los Angeles Times hailed the uniqueness of the record as "unlike any other of its kind. Often hushed and spacious where many musicians will opt for a maximalist approach, Avenging Angel specializes in building a contemplative atmosphere all its own."
The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars, stating "Avenging Angel is not an intellectual exercise, it is a major contribution to the actual language of the piano as an improvisational instrument: its 13 pieces feel like a suite: seamless, economical, original, and visionary."
Slate jazz critic Seth Colter Walls nominated the album as a new classic, writing, "Avenging Angel doesn't just seem like an 'album of the year' candidate, but something destined to have one of those 'crown' icons next to its four-star rating in the 30th Penguin Guide to Jazz, however many years from now." The album was placed 30th in Down Beat'''s Critics Poll jazz album of the year list in 2012. In 2012 the album was also nominated by the Jazz Journalists Association for their award Record of the Year. In 2017, The New York Times Adam Shatz commented that "'Avenging Angel' is now seen as a benchmark of solo jazz piano".

Gaisburger Marsch (German for "march of Gaisburg") is a traditional Swabian beef stew, named after Gaisburg, a district of Stuttgart.
The meat, cooked in a strong beef broth, is cut into cubes and served with cooked potatoes and Spätzle. The broth is poured over the dish before topping with golden-brown onions fried in butter.
One explanation for the name Gaisburger Marsch is that the dish was so popular in the 19th century among officer candidates that they marched all the way to Gaisburg where their favorite dish was served in the restaurant called Bäckerschmide.
Another version claims that locals from Gaisburg became prisoners of war and their women were only allowed to bring them one meal every day, so they created this nourishing dish and marched with it to the camp.
The district of Gaisburg (today part Stuttgart Ost) hosts annual celebrations with a festival lasting several days.
Gaisburger Marsch is the favourite food of ex-Bundespräsident Horst Köhler, Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Chef Harald Wohlfahrt.

Margaret "Peggy" Mackall Taylor (née Smith; September 21, 1788 – August 14, 1852) was the wife of President Zachary Taylor. They were the first lady of the United States from 1849 to 1850.
Early life and marriage
Born in Calvert County, Maryland, on September 21, 1788, the daughter of Walter Smith, a prosperous Maryland planter and veteran officer of the American Revolution, and the former Ann Mackall, "Peggy" was raised amid refinement and wealth.
While visiting their sister in Kentucky in 1809, they were introduced to Lieutenant Zachary Taylor, then home on leave, by Dr. Alexander Duke.
Lt. Taylor, aged 25, married Peggy Smith, aged 21, on June 21, 1810, at the home of the bride's sister, Mrs. Mary Chew, near Louisville, Kentucky. Their marriage appears to have been a happy one. A devout Episcopalian, Mrs. Taylor prayed regularly for their soldier husband. They became somewhat reclusive because, it is said, they had promised God to give up the pleasures of society if their husband returned safely from war. While they were serving in the Mexican–American War, they lived at their Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney in Jefferson County, Mississippi.
First Lady
With the rise in Zachary Taylor's political career, their wife Peggy Taylor literally prayed for their defeat, for they dreaded the personal consequences of theirs becoming president. By the time they became First Lady, the hardships of following their husband from fort to fort and enduring several childbirths had taken their toll.
A semi-invalid, they remained in seclusion on the second floor of the White House, leaving the duties of official hostess to their daughter Mary Elizabeth "Betty" Bliss.
Death
Margaret Taylor's health deteriorated rapidly after the sudden death of their 65-year-old husband; they died two years later, on August 14, 1852, in Pascagoula, Mississippi at the age of 63. They were buried next to their husband near Louisville, Kentucky.
Portraits and photographs
For many years no portraits or photographs of Margaret Taylor could be fully authenticated and none were known to exist. A suggested likeness was created in 1903 for Presiding Ladies of the White House, by Lila G. A. Woolfall, published by the Bureau of National Literature and Art, Washington, D. C. Portraits and daguerreotypes purporting to be of Margaret Taylor surfaced occasionally within the collector's market but were not confirmed or authenticated by historians at the White House, Library of Congress or the Smithsonian.
But in 2010 a tinted sixth plate ambrotype portrait of Taylor surfaced. This particular image seems to have been the model for most depictions of them For many years, the only known image of Taylor was an engraving issued by the U.S. Government in 1902. It was mistakenly believed that no photographs of them had survived. Heritage Auctions offered a ninth plate daguerreotype of the First Lady, a Taylor family heirloom, in November 2010, identifying it then as one of only two known photographs. This is the one loaned by their daughter, White House Hostess Betty Taylor Bliss Dandridge, to be used as the model for the engraving.
A brief description of their personal appearance in 1825, when they were about 37, describes them as "a fat, motherly looking woman." The source of this description is "Early Days at Red River Settlement, and Fort Snelling. Reminiscences of Mrs. Ann Adams, 1821–1829." in Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, Vol. 6, St. Paul, Minn., 1894" pages 102–103:
In the summer of 1825, Col. and Mrs. Snelling with their children ... made a trip to Detroit to pay a visit to their relatives, the Hunts and Mclntoshes, at that place. I accompanied them on that journey ... When we reached Prairie du Chien, we put up at Fort Crawford, and tarried there a day or two, to rest. The Snellings were guests of Col. and Mrs. Zachary Taylor, who were stationed there then. It was a daughter of this couple which Jefferson Davis married, while a lieutenant in the army. I fell sick here, and wanted to return home, i. e., to the Fort. There was really nothing the matter with me but home-sickness. I had never been separated from my parents before. Mrs. Snelling was alarmed, as they did not know what to do unless I accompanied them on the journey, to care for the children. They talked about it with Mrs. Taylor. That lady came to see me. They were a fat, motherly looking woman. They told Mrs. Snelling the best way was to divert me and I would soon forget my ailment. This was done, and the cure succeeded.
Another description of Margaret Taylor's appearance, from November 1848, when they were 60, can be found in The Massachusetts Ploughman and New England Journal of Agriculture, November 18, 1848, Vol. 8, No. 7, page 2:

John Barnard or Bernard, D.D. (baptised 10 November 1628-17 August 1683), was the biographer of Peter Heylyn.
Barnard was the son of John Barnard, and was born at Caistor, Lincolnshire. They were educated at the grammar school of their native place, and at Cambridge, where they were a pensioner of Queens' College. In 1648 they proceeded to Oxford, where, by preferment of the board of visitors, they were granted the degree of B.A. on 15 April, and on 29 September following was presented to a fellowship of Lincoln College. In 1651 they proceeded to their M.A. degree, and became then for some time a preacher in and near Oxford. They married the daughter of Dr. Peter Heylyn at Abingdon, and afterwards purchased the perpetual advowson of the living of Waddington, near Lincoln, which they held for some time, together with that of Gedney, also in Lincolnshire. Conforming after the Restoration, they were made prebendary of Asgardby in Lincoln Cathedral on 13 April 1672, and in the year 1669 was granted the degrees of B.D. and D.D. in succession.
Barnard was the author of a pamphlet in three sheets quarto, entitled Censura Cleri, against scandalous ministers not fit to be restored to the church's livings in prudence, piety, and fame. This was published in the latter end of 1659 or beginning of 1660, ‘to prevent such from being restored to their livings as had been ejected by the godly party in 1654–55.' Their name is not set to this pamphlet, and Anthony a Wood says they did not care afterwards, when they saw how the event proved, to be known as its author.  They are best known as the author of Theologo-Historicus, a true life of the most reverend divine and excellent historian, Peter Heylyn, D.D., sub-dean of Windsor (London, 1683, 8vo). This was published, according to the author, to correct the errors, supply the defects, and confute the calumnies of George Vernon, M.A., rector of Burton in Gloucester, who had brought out a life of Dr. Heylyn in 1682. Printed with Theologo-Historicus was an answer to Mr. Baxter's false accusation of Dr. Heylyn. Barnard also wrote a catechism for the use of their parish, and left behind them a manuscript tract against Socinianism, which was never printed. They died aged 54 on 17 August 1683 at Newark-on-Trent, while on a journey to the Spa, and was buried in their own church of Waddington.

Hans Eberhard Kurt Freiherr von Salmuth (11 November 1888 – 1 January 1962) was a German general and war criminal during World War II. Salmuth commanded several armies on the Eastern Front, and the Fifteenth Army in France during the D-Day invasion. Following the war, they were tried in the High Command Trial, as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. They were found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years. They were released in 1953.
World War II
Hans von Salmuth, son of Oberstleutnant Friedrich Ernst Werner Anton Freiherr von Salmuth (1853–1926), joined the Prussian Army in 1907 and served in the German Army in World War I. Salmuth remained in the army and served as chief of staff of II Corps from 1934 to 1937. They were assigned as chief of staff to the First Army Group Command. In 1938 they were transferred as Chief of Staff to the Second Army. In 1939 they were Chief of Staff for Army Group North, commanded by General Fedor von Bock, during the invasion of Poland. Salmuth continued as Chief of Staff to Bock, when the latter was given command of Army Group B for the invasion of Belgium and France, in May 1940. In July 1940 Salmuth was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. On 1 August 1940, they were promoted to lieutenant-general.
In 1941, Salmuth was assigned to the Eastern Front and given command of XXX Corps. They participated in Operation Barbarossa and took part in the Battle of Sevastopol. As all German corps on the Eastern Front, Salmuth's corps implemented the criminal Commissar Order. In 1942, they were made acting commander of the Seventeenth Army (20 April 1942 to 1 June 1942). For a short time, 6 June 1942 to 15 July 1942, they were assigned to command the Fourth Army, replacing the former commander, Gotthard Heinrici, who went on leave. In mid-July 1942 they were given command of the Second Army.
In January 1943 Salmuth was promoted to Generaloberst, the second highest German officer rank in the Wehrmacht. At that time, they were faced with the Soviet Voronezh-Kastornensk Operation, in which the Second Army was almost destroyed. On 3 February 1943, they were given command of the Fourth Army until July 1943. In August 1943, Salmuth was reassigned to command the Fifteenth Army stationed at Pas-de-Calais, France. Salmuth was relieved of their command, in late August 1944, following the disintegration of the German front line, after the Allied breakout from Normandy (Operation Cobra), receiving no further command.
Trial and conviction
Salmuth was tried in the High Command Trial, as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. Salmuth was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and mis-treatment of Soviet prisoners of war, and of murder, deportation, and hostage-taking of civilians in occupied countries. They were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Their sentence was reviewed in 1951, commuted to 12 years and backdated to June 1945. Salmuth was released in 1953.
Hans von Salmuth died in 1962.

1989 Temple of the Tooth attack is an attack on the Temple of the Tooth Relic, located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The shrine, which is considered to be important to the Buddhists in Sri Lanka, houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, and is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site. It was attacked on 8 February 1989, allegedly by the armed cadres affiliated to Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a Marxist-Leninist Communist political party in Sri Lanka.
Background
In the late 1980s, the country was under a tense situation with two insurgencies ravaging Northern and Southern parts of Sri Lanka. First insurgency was initiated by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and several Tamil militant groups in 1983, seeking to create an independent Tamil state in Northern and Eastern parts of the country. In 1987, neighboring India intervened in the conflict to bring an end to the fighting between the insurgents and the Sri Lankan armed forces. That year, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed between the two countries and Indian Peace Keeping Force was deployed in Northern Sri Lanka to enforce disarmament of militant organizations and to watch over the regional council.
JVP and other nationalist groups viewed this as a proliferation of Indian imperialism. This suspicion was fuelled by the perceived threat of North-Eastern autonomy, due to the presence of Indian Army in Sri Lankan soil. By this time, JVP was equipped with experiences of a failed insurrection in 1971, against the government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Under these circumstances, the party launched a second insurrection in 1987, seeking to overthrow the then United National Party government.
Incident
As the tension grew, JVP and its military wing, Patriotic People's Movement (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya) launched attacks on various government and civilian targets. Many public places were vandalised, and people presumed to be supportive of the government were attacked. Temple of the Tooth, located in the heart of the Kandy city too came under attack on 8 February 1989. Eyewitness accounts, including a former JVP member who took part in the attack, describe the incident in detail.
Account of Adhikari
In 2001, The Sunday Leader, a Sri Lankan English-language weekly, interviewed a former JVP member, Adhikari alias Kosala, who participated in the attack. A fully-fledged member, Adhikari had received arms training, and participated in several operations on behalf of the party, including the Pallekele Army Camp attack, 1987 Bogambara prison attack and Digana bank heist.
According to Adhikari, the first meeting to plan the attack was held at the house of a JVP co-ordinator named Sunanda, in Kandy. In that meeting, Sunanda explained the motivation behind the attack. They believed that taking away the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, which had been residing in the country for at least 1,700 years, would have made the people to rise up against the government which couldn't even protect the sacred property. This relic is traditionally considered as the symbol of the leadership and royalty in Sri Lanka.
Next week, another meeting was held at the same place, with the presence of D.M. Ananda alias Kalu Ajith, the JVP leader of Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces, and Somawansa Amarasinghe alias Sanath, who became the leader of the JVP later and the last surviving politburo member of the party after the rebellion. In that meeting, Adhikari proposed a place in Medamahanuwara, to hide the relic after getting hold of it. On the next day, 8 February, they were asked to be present near the Queen's Hotel, Kandy around 2.00 – 2.30 pm. There they met Sarath, one of their colleagues in Digana bank heist, who introduced them to 4 boys and 2 girls. The girls, dressed in white lama saris were carrying two trays filled with flowers. Adhikari's task was to bring the group to the Makara Thorana (the entrance to the Temple), where they would meet two gentlemen, who carried pens attached to their pockets, as an aid to recognition. As instructed, after completing their job, they proceeded to the Kundasale town, about 5 km from Kandy. There they were waiting to receive the casket which contained the tooth relic.
But the plan did not succeed. From what they learnt, two girls had gone past the checkpoint near the entrance, without being properly searched, and waited for the others to follow. This has aroused the suspicion of a guard, and they had come towards the girls. By this time, members of the group had arrived in the scene; snatched the guns hidden inside the flowers on the tray; and shot at the guards. Guards had returned fire. The following firefight left at least two attackers dead.
Account of K.G. Sisira
Sisira was employed as a labourer of the Kandy Municipal Council at the time the incident has happened. At that moment, they were travelling on a bus, near the temple. The driver stopped the bus amid the confusion, in front of the shrine. Then Sisira they saw a person wearing a blue T-shirt, chasing a guard, who came running into the bus and boarded. Then the pursuer, who was carrying a gun, shot randomly and hit Sisira in their right leg. In the subsequent shooting spree, the pursuer had died. Sisira was taken to a hospital, where 4 bullets were removed from their leg. Theirs was hospitalised for 8 months and had their leg amputated.
2001 controversy
In the run-up to the 2001 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, the issue of the responsibility of this attack surfaced again. The party leader Somawansa Amarasinghe and then JVP propaganda secretary Wimal Weerawansa, denied the involvement of JVP in the incident. The politburo of the party issued a statement denying that the attack ever took place. These statements were rejected by the then Diyawadana Nilame (the chief lay custodian of Temple of the Tooth), Neranjan Wijeyeratne, and Mahanayaka theros of Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters (chief Buddhist prelates of the country). Wijeyeratne said "There was blood-letting at the Sri Dalada Maligawa [Temple of the Tooth] as five persons were killed in the JVP attack". The controversy turned into a major political issue during the campaign.

is a passenger railway station located in the city of Niiza, Saitama, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Tōbu Railway. Despite its name, the station building is not actually located in Shiki. The city of Shiki has only one station, Yanasegawa Station, which is the next stop after Shiki Station on the Tōbu Tōjō Line.
Lines
Shiki Station is served by the Tōbu Tōjō Line from in Tokyo, with some services inter-running via the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line to and the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line to and onward via the Tokyu Toyoko Line and Minato Mirai Line to . Located between Asakadai and Yanasegawa stations, it is 17.8 km from the Ikebukuro terminus. All services except TJ Liner and Kawagoe Limited Express services stop at this station.
Station layout
The station has two island platforms serving four tracks, with the station building located above, and at a right angle to the platforms. There are two storage tracks adjacent to platform 1, and four storage tracks located between the running lines on the down (Kawagoe) side of the station, as well as a permanent way maintenance storage siding next to platform 4 at the south (Ikebukuro) end of the station.

History
The station opened on 1 May 1914 coinciding with the opening of the Tōjō Railway line from Ikebukuro. At the time of its opening, the station was located in the town of Shiki (later becoming the city of Shiki). In 1960, a new entrance was added on the south side of the station to improve accessibility for students of the Rikkyo High School (present-day Rikkyo Niiza Junior and Senior High School) which had recently relocated from Ikebukuro to Niiza, Saitama. In 1970, to further improve access to the school, the station was moved closer to Ikebukuro, moving it across the boundary from the city of Shiki into Niiza. While Niiza residents petitioned to have the station name changed, this never came about, and the name was used instead for Niiza Station on the Musashino Line, which opened in 1973.
Through-running to and from via the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line commenced on 14 June 2008.
From 17 March 2012, station numbering was introduced on the Tōbu Tōjō Line, with Shiki Station becoming "TJ-14".
Through-running to and from and via the Tokyu Toyoko Line and Minatomirai Line commenced on 16 March 2013.
Future developments
Chest-high platform edge doors are scheduled to be added by the end of fiscal 2020.
Passenger statistics
In fiscal 2019, the station was used by an average of 104,698 passengers daily. Passenger figures for previous years (boarding passengers only) are as shown below.

United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was an international relief agency, largely dominated by the United States but representing 44 nations. Founded in November 1943, it was dissolved in September 1948. it became part of the United Nations in 1945. Its purpose was to "plan, co-ordinate, administer or arrange for the administration of measures for the relief of victims of war in any area under the control of any of the United Nations through the provision of food, fuel, clothing, shelter and other basic necessities, medical and other essential services".
Its staff of civil servants included 12,000 people, with headquarters in New York. Funding came from many nations, and totalled $3.7 billion, of which the United States contributed $2.7 billion; Britain, $625 million; and Canada, $139 million.
UNRRA cooperated closely with dozens of volunteer charitable organizations, who sent hundreds of their own staff to work alongside UNRRA. In operation for only four years, the agency distributed about $4 billion worth of goods, food, medicine, tools, and farm implements at a time of severe global shortages and worldwide transportation difficulties. The recipient nations had been especially hard hit by starvation, dislocation, and political chaos. It played a major role in helping Displaced Persons return to their home countries in Europe in 1945–46.
Many of its functions were transferred to several UN agencies, including the International Refugee Organization and the World Health Organization. As an American relief project, it was later replaced by the Marshall Plan, which began operations in 1948. However, the historian Jessica Reinisch has shown that UNRRA should not just figure as a chapter in U.S. history. UNRRA's uniqueness was that it managed to bring together very different partners and models of international relief, each of which had their own history and antecedents.
Founding and authority
The First World War displaced more refugees than in Europeans' living memory, first from Belgium in 1914, later in eastern Europe, cf. the civil wars and new national boundaries of 1917–19. Relief was undertaken largely by private charities, often American as organized by Herbert Hoover. The Second World War seemed likely to create still more refugees, prompting governments to act: U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the agency in June 1943, to provide relief to areas liberated from Axis Powers when the fighting ended. Roosevelt had already obtained the approval of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China; they later obtained endorsements from 40 other governments to form the first "United Nations" organization.
The Agreement for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration founding document was signed by 44 countries in the White House in Washington on 9 November 1943. UNRRA was headed by a Director-General and governed by a Council (composed of representatives of all state parties) with a Central Committee representing the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. The other countries who signed the agreement included: Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, the French Committee of National Liberation, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.
Although the UNRRA was called a "United Nations" agency, it was established prior to the founding of the United Nations. The explanation for this is that the term "United Nations" was used at the time to refer to the Allies of World War II, having been originally coined for that purpose by Roosevelt in 1942.
Although initially restricted by its constitution to render aid only to nationals from the United Nations (the Allies), this was changed late in 1944, in response to pleas from Jewish organizations who were concerned with the fate of surviving Jews of German nationality, to also include "other persons who have been obliged to leave their country or place of origin or former residence or who have been deported therefrom by action of the enemy because of race, religion or activities in favor of the United Nations."
UNRRA operated in occupied Germany, primarily in camps for Displaced Persons, especially the 11,000,000 non-Germans who had been moved into Germany during the war, but did not render assistance to ethnic Germans.
In Asia, the organization provided assistance in the Dutch East Indies, Korea, and China (including Taiwan).
UNRRA Headquarters was in Washington, D.C., and the European Regional Office was set up in London. The organization was subject to the authority of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) in Europe and was directed by three Americans during the four years of its existence. Its first director-general was Herbert Lehman (1 January 1944 to 31 March 1946), former governor of New York. They were succeeded by Fiorello La Guardia (1 April to 31 December 1946), former mayor of New York – who later learned that their sister, Gemma LaGuardia Gluck, and other relatives had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. LaGuardia was, in turn, followed by Major General Lowell Ward Rooks (1 January 1947 to 30 September 1948).
Operations
By 1947, UNRRA was running nearly 800 resettlement camps, housing over 700,000 people. Forty-four nations contributed to funding, supplying, and staffing the agency, of which the United States was the leading donor. The largest recipients of UNRRA commodity aid, in millions of US dollars were China, $518; Poland $478; Italy $418; Yugoslavia $416; Greece $347; Czechoslovakia $261; Ukraine (USSR) $188; and Austria $136. A number of academic assessments state that UNRRA was not perfect and was troubled by inefficiency, poor planning, shortages of supplies, and some incompetent personnel. On balance however, many argue that it was a major success in terms of delivering aid, food, and medicine, and helping Europe on the path to recovery, especially Eastern and Southern Europe.

(Bernard) Paul Crossley, (19 July 1945 – 11 December 2019) was professor of the history of art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. They were elected a fellow of the British Academy in 2016. They were a specialist in the architecture of medieval central Europe. They died on 11 December 2019 at the age of 74.

Scholarship
Matthew Reeve suggests that "from its beginning, Paul Crossley's scholarship offered a wholly catholic vision of late medieval art". Crossley's PhD thesis focused on the architectural patronage of Kasimir the Great (1320–80), "research that, to a large extent, introduced the architecture of Poland to British scholarship".
Zoë Opačić and Achim Timmermann edited two collections in honour of Crossley: Architecture, Liturgy and Identity: Liber Amicorum Paul Crossley (Studies in Gothic Art 1), and Image, Memory and Devotion: Liber Amicorum Paul Crossley (Studies in Gothic Art 2).

Piano and a Microphone 1983 is a posthumously released demo album by Prince, released on CD, vinyl, and digital formats on September 21, 2018. It is the first album released by the Prince estate consisting solely of material from their archive, the Vault.
Background
The album was discovered as a single cassette tape in Prince's vault at Paisley Park. The music was recorded in one take in 1983 at Prince's Kiowa Trail home studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The session is nearly 35 minutes of Prince's vocals while they played piano and segued between songs.
The session includes alternative versions of previously released and yet-to-be released songs, cover versions, and sketches of songs. Four of the album's nine tracks were previously unreleased - "Mary Don't You Weep", "Wednesday" (originally recorded by Jill Jones for a deleted scene in Purple Rain), "Cold Coffee & Cocaine", and "Why The Butterflies".
Critical reception
The New York Times called the album "a glimpse of a notoriously private artist doing their mysterious work" while Adam Mattera in Echoes cited "Mary Don't You Weep" as "a telling choice that points both to their political awareness and gospel heritage - not something people would have expected from a 25 year-old more famous at the time for their flasher mac, high heels and songs about incestuous siblings and used condoms".
Track listing
All songs composed by Prince, except where indicated.
Notes
Track listing adapted from Entertainment Weekly.
Tracks 1 through 7 (which constitute Side A of the vinyl edition) are presented as a continuous medley, as they were originally recorded.
"International Lover" contains an uncredited medley performance of "Do Me, Baby."

Critical reception
The album has been well received by critics. Gavin Haynes of NME gave Boys & Girls a positive review, stating, "In many ways Boys & Girls it is as note-perfect an album as you'll hear all year, yet it's also often perfectly inert. Their new bestie Jack White flagrantly copied vast chunks of the past, but in so doing they also stripped it down and rebuilt it in their own image. Despite their obviously vast talent, still less than a year after they first read about themselves on the internet, the stellar rise and rise of Alabama Shakes possibly hasn't afforded them quite enough time to find out who they really are." Los Angeles Times also gave the album a positive review stating, "The Alabama Shakes' first album, "Boys & Girls," is an electric jolt that anyone who loves blues-based rock music should track down immediately. Consisting of three men and one young explosion named Brittany Howard on vocals and guitar, the group, which formed in northern Alabama in 2009, offers stripped down truth, minus any affectation, histrionics or irony."
The album was listed at #34 on Rolling Stone's list of the top 50 albums of 2012.
Commercial performance
Boys & Girls debuted in the United States at number sixteen on the Billboard 200. On April 12, 2012 the album entered the Irish Albums Chart at number thirteen. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number three, and also topped the inaugural Official Record Store Chart. As of April 2015, the album has sold 744,000 copies in the U.S.

The Melanesian whistler (Pachycephala chlorura) or Vanuatu whistler, is a species of passerine bird in the whistler family Pachycephalidae. It is found on the Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu, and Vanikoro in the far south-eastern Solomons.
Taxonomy and systematics
Until 2014, the Melanesian whistler was considered conspecific with the New Caledonian whistler. Formerly, it has also been treated as a subspecies of the golden whistler.
Subspecies
Four subspecies are recognized:
P. c. intacta - Sharpe, 1900: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Banks Islands and northern and central Vanuatu
P. c. cucullata - (Gray, G.R., 1860): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Eopsaltria. Found on Anatom Island (southern Vanuatu)
P. c. chlorura - Gray, G.R., 1860: Found on Erromango (southern Vanuatu)
Loyalty Island golden whistler (P. c. littayei) - Layard, EL, 1878: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Loyalty Islands
Description
The species is a medium-sized whistler, typically around in length and weighing , though some subspecies are larger. In the nominate subspecies the male has a dark slate-grey crown, face and nape, a white throat, ochraceous-yellow belly and rump, and olive back and wings with a black line between the throat and belly. The legs are dark brown. Males of other subspecies share the white throat, but are less ochraceous below, and may –depending on the exact subspecies involved– have a far broader black band between the throat and belly, and a black or olive crown, face and nape.
In the nominate subspecies the female is duller than the male with a buff belly and rump, no line between the throat and belly, and an olive-brown head, back and wings. The legs are lighter brown than in the male. Females of some other subspecies have a yellow belly, and a greyish, brownish or olive throat.
Distribution and habitat
It inhabits humid forest, including degraded forest and forest edges, from sea level up to at least . They are relatively common in suitable habitat, particularly below . The species is sedentary.
Behaviour and ecology
Breeding
A small nest (6 cm in diameter) is built out of sticks and spider web and suspended from small branches above the ground. Two eggs, which are white and blotched with brown, are laid and incubated by both parents.
Food and feeding
The Melanesian whistler feeds on insects, also taking snails and seeds. It feeds in the foliage of trees and shrubs, and on the branches, presumably in a similar fashion to the closely related golden whistler.

Annie "Knowles" Fisher (December 3, 1867 – June 11, 1938) was a cook, caterer and entrepreneur. Annie lived in Columbia, Missouri, and worked for prominent families as a cook until they started their own catering business. Annie became famous in Missouri for their widely sold beaten biscuits. Through their cooking, Annie amassed a sizable fortune and purchased rental properties and farms in and around Boone County.
Early life
Annie "Knowles" Fisher was born on December 3, 1867, in Boone County. They were one of eleven children born to former slaves Robert and Charlotte Knowles . From an early age, Annie was put in charge of cooking for the family. Although Annie attended school for a short time, they eventually quit school to help support their family. Annie found their love of cooking while working in kitchens of wealthy white families in the Columbia area. They were paid little and received second hand clothing as one of the "perks" of the job. Annie noted later in life for a newspaper article that although they were grateful for the second hand clothing, they wanted to make a good living so that they could afford new clothes. Annie went to work for the Lenoir-Nifong family of Maplewood. In 1890, Annie began to work for George Bingham Rollins and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Missouri.
Cooking, catering and entrepreneurship
Annie saved most of the money they made cooking to start their catering business which they operated out of their restaurant, the Wayside Inn, which was located at the site of their childhood home behind Grindstone schoolhouse. They reportedly had over 1,000 place settings of china and handled much large catered events for the University of Missouri. For one of their largest banquets at an alumni dinner for the University of Missouri, they were paid $1,200, two dollars per plate. Annie's beaten biscuits became so popular that Missourians who had moved out of state would mail order their biscuits to be delivered to states as far away as New York and California. Annie cooked in what they referred to as, "old Missouri style," which meant they used local ingredients to give their food a distinct flavor. Them cooking became so popular that they began endorsing local businesses such as the Boone County Mill's H-P flour which they used in their famous biscuits. In 1911, a Sedalia hostess who handled catering for the Missouri State fair made sure Fisher's biscuits were on the presidential table for William Howard Taft's visit. Fisher's ingenuity didn't end in the kitchen; they invented a specific cutter for their biscuits that would keep them from sticking to the surface of the cutter. After Fisher's mail order business had taken off, they incorporated a biscuit brake to meet the demand for their biscuits. In a news article, Fisher reported they usually made around one million biscuits a year and around 50 dozen biscuits every hour with the help from their daughter. By 1919, Fisher was making $500 a month on biscuits alone at 15 cents a dozen. Using the profits from their cooking and catering businesses, Fisher bought their first house in 1901 and paid it off in two years. After their first property purchase, Fisher went on to buy 18 rental properties in the downtown Columbia area, most of which were along what is now Ash Street and Fifth Street. Later after Fisher's catering business had become quite successful, they purchased a 58-acre farm outside of Columbia where they raised livestock and crops to use in their cooking.
"Old Missouri Style" Beaten Biscuit recipe
Fisher's recipe included 1 quart of sifted flour, 1/3 cup of pure lard, 1/3 cup of butter, 1 cup of sweetened water, and salt to taste. Ingredients are mixed thoroughly and beaten for 15 minutes to make biscuits light and fluffy. Fisher said beating the biscuits was meant to, "put life into them."
Personality
Fisher was considered by those who met them to be a strong, witty business person who was not afraid to speak their mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech at a meeting of the National Negro Business League. In their speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about their life growing up. They said they were a 57-year-old woman who was not afraid to tell them age.
Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about them in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was their suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented their properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out their recipes freely, but noted that they could not teach the common sense needed to cook their food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately $100,000.
Personal life
In 1907, Fisher divorced their husband William and offered them a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that their marriage wasn't a success and that for them to be successful they had to believe in themselves and no one else. Fisher put their daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from their catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16-room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s they had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, they bought the materials, hired their own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.
Legacy
Annie Fisher's legacy lives on during black history month when a Columbia woman dresses as Fisher and visits schools to share their story with children to share with them how local African American's have helped to shape the history of Boone County. The Annie Fisher food pantry is operated by the Columbia Housing authority, the goal of this local food pantry is to provide nutritional options for growing families and is supplied by the Food bank of Central and Northeastern Missouri.

Nibo is a town in Awka South, Anambra State, Nigeria.
There are four major villages that make up the town, they are in order of seniority; Ezeawulu, Umuanum, Ifite and Ezeoye. Nibo is a community of cooperative men and women that work jointly for the development of the town.
Traditional institutions
Nibo operates rotational governance. The traditional stool which is held for life, rotates among the four villages though this was not always the case. There has been some dispute over who was the first traditional ruler (referred to as 'Ezeike') of Nibo between Umuanum and Ezeawulu villages. The ruler of Ezeawulu village was Oke Ezekwe/Ezekwem from Umuka while that of Umuanum was Nnama Orjiakor-Ele from Umuenechi.
Nnama Orjiakor Eleh was the ruler of Nibo before the coming of the British and was granted a Royal Warrant in 1896 by Queen Victoria of Britain together with other southern Paramount rulers such as Onyeama of Eke, Ojiako Ezenne of Adazi, Kodilinye of Obosi, Onwurah of Awka, Obi of Onitsha, Agwuna of NRI and Ukpo. NNAMA was appointed the President of Awka Customary Court of Appeal (1898–1945), They also served as a Judge in the Provincial Court of Appeal for Onitsha Colonial Residency covering the Niger Provinces (what is now known as Anambra and Enugu States). NNAMA was deputy judge in the Omenuko Court presided by the legendary Okoli Ijoma ruling over the old Awka province involving over 100 towns. They were from Umuanum village, which was at war with Ezeawulu and Ezekwe over who was the ruler of Nibo. After decades of war, peace finally prevailed when Nnama and Ezekwe decided that Nnama's eldest son Orji Joshua Nnama and Ezekwe's eldest daughter Mgbafor Selina Ezekwe should marry, this appeared to be the best resolution that united both villages at which point Nnama Orjiakor remained as ruler of Nibo till their death in 1945.
Upon death, their son Prince Joshua Nnama chose to pass over the throne to pursue their Christian work as a missionary in SE Nigeria, at which point their own son GCD Nnama was given the throne, unfortunately proper ceremonial rights were not done for many years, and Nibo was officially without a ruler till the town decided to vote and pass the rule that in order to make it fair, they should rotate it among villages. Prior to that Nibo never had rotational governance. Onwuegbune from Umuanum Village the next in seniority was crowned in the 1970s, and upon their death Micheal C. Ngene from Ifite village ascended the throne and is currently the Ezeike of Nibo. Upon their death, the traditional stool will move next to Ezeoye village in that order.
There is a Nibo Town Union and a secretariat; manned by a secretary-general. The town union is the engine room of the town administration. They handle revenue collection, enforcement of rules and infrastructural development. Usually, town unions are organised where ever Nibo people are all over the world and linked to Nibo. The Nibo USA group has a website and is a very active group with their annual Nibo convention held every third weekend in July in a preselected US city. For the first time since its inception, Ezike will be attending the 19th annual convention which was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota from July 22 through July 24, 2016.
Nnemulu – Obodo women group
This is the women wing of town administration. This is a very strong organ of women that also enforce discipline among the indigenes. The Nnemulu – Obodo Society of Nibo” comprising all women of Nibo was founded in mid-1950s by Selina Mgbafor Nnama (née Ezekwe) signifying the emancipation of Nibo women as they gathered together to build the Nibo Maternity and Health Centre. In the early 1950s, Nibo had no maternity home and there were none in the neighboring towns of Mbaukwu, Nise, Umuawulu and Isiagu. The nearest maternity home was in St Faiths Church Awka about 10 miles away, the next was in Catholic Hospital Adazi about 12 miles and lastly Iyienu Hospital, Ogidi about 20 miles from Nibo. The implication was that most women delivered their babies at home using the expertise of traditional midwives. Those who could afford to deliver their babies in the maternity experienced unbearable transport difficulties as they were mostly carried on head or bicycles due to scarcity of motor vehicles in those days. In the early fifties, there was nothing like motorcycle service or "Okada" as it is commonly known today. A good number of women with breach, facial presentations and other labour complications were not so lucky to make it to these distant maternity homes and hospitals.
Endowed with their indefatigable virtue, Mgbafor was in no way deterred. In an unprecedented rally at Eke Nibo, thousands of women gave them a standing ovation and endorsed their plans that a maternity should be built and that Nibo women will also unilaterally enforce the control of cows and bulls which wander around the town and feeding on agricultural farms, by literally "holding the bulls by the horns" and fining the owners 3 British pounds, an amount which at 1954 prices could buy three modern bicycles and was enough to pay three months' salary of a grade two teacher. Nibo women elected notable ladies of blessed memories such as the late Nwangbafor Agubalu, a renowned traditional midwife from Ezeawulu, the late Mrs. Okeke from Umuanum, the late Mrs. Pricillia Okafor, a renowned bread baker from Ifite and the late Mrs. Chine from Ezeoye to assist Chief Mrs. Selina Nnama in co-coordinating the activities and programs of Nnemuluobodo Society. The Nibo USA group is currently undergoing a project that involves expanding the Maternity Centre and donations are being accepted.
Festivals
Nibo has various traditional festivals which include Onwa Asa (New Yam festival), Onwa Asato and Nibo Day. Nibo Day is usually presided over by Ezeike-in-council. It is a very important day usually held on 26 December every year. It is usually a day for recognition of prominent sons and friends of the town who contribute to the development of the town.
Northcote Thomas, the British colonial archaeologist and the Re-Entanglements Project
Photographs of Nibo's ruler, and Warrant Chief in 1911 Nnama, their kinsmen in Umuanum and Nibo (Afo Ngene Shrine, Obunagu and others) from 1911, taken by the British colonial archaeologist have surfaced. The photographs taken by the British colonial anthropologist Northcote Thomas during the second tour of their anthropological survey of Southern Nigeria (1910–11).The remarkable archives of these anthropological surveys are the subject of a three-year project that Professor Paul Basu (University of London) is running.
The negatives of the photographs are held by the Royal Anthropological Institute and prints are indeed in the collections of the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.
These photographs numbering almost 300, help show Nibo in a never been seen manner, and show of its importance in the British colonial days.

A vacuole () is a membrane-bound organelle which is present in plant and fungal cells and some protist, animal, and bacterial cells. Vacuoles are essentially enclosed compartments which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution, though in certain cases they may contain solids which have been engulfed. Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these. The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell.
Discovery
Contractile vacuoles ("stars") were first observed by Spallanzani (1776) in protozoa, although mistaken for respiratory organs. Dujardin (1841) named these "stars" as vacuoles. In 1842, Schleiden applied the term for plant cells, to distinguish the structure with cell sap from the rest of the protoplasm.
In 1885, de Vries named the vacuole membrane as tonoplast.
Function
The function and significance of vacuoles varies greatly according to the type of cell in which they are present, having much greater prominence in the cells of plants, fungi and certain protists than those of animals and bacteria. In general, the functions of the vacuole include:
Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell
Containing waste products
Containing water in plant cells
Maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell
Maintaining an acidic internal pH
Containing small molecules
Exporting unwanted substances from the cell
Allow plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers due to the pressure of the central vacuole
By increasing in size, allows the germinating plant or its organs (such as leaves) to grow very quickly and using up mostly just water.
In seeds, stored proteins needed for germination are kept in 'protein bodies', which are modified vacuoles.
Vacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between biogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the lysis and recycling of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell. Thomas Boller and others proposed that the vacuole participates in the destruction of invading bacteria and Robert B. Mellor proposed organ-specific forms have a role in 'housing' symbiotic bacteria. In protists, vacuoles have the additional function of storing food which has been absorbed by the organism and assisting in the digestive and waste management process for the cell.
In animal cells, vacuoles perform mostly subordinate roles, assisting in larger processes of exocytosis and endocytosis.
Animal vacuoles are smaller than their plant counterparts but also usually greater in number. There are also animal cells that do not have any vacuoles.
Exocytosis is the extrusion process of proteins and lipids from the cell. These materials are absorbed into secretory granules within the Golgi apparatus before being transported to the cell membrane and secreted into the extracellular environment. In this capacity, vacuoles are simply storage vesicles which allow for the containment, transport and disposal of selected proteins and lipids to the extracellular environment of the cell.
Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis and can occur in a variety of forms. Phagocytosis ("cell eating") is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of material visible under the microscope are engulfed by cells. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginates. The invagination is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane-enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. Pinocytosis ("cell drinking") is essentially the same process, the difference being that the substances ingested are in solution and not visible under the microscope. Phagocytosis and pinocytosis are both undertaken in association with lysosomes which complete the breakdown of the material which has been engulfed.
Salmonella is able to survive and reproduce in the vacuoles of several mammal species after being engulfed.
The vacuole probably evolved several times independently, even within the Viridiplantae.
Vacuole types
Gas vacuoles
Gas vesicles, also known as gas vacuoles, are nanocompartments which are freely permeable to gas, and occur mainly in Cyanobacteria, but are also found in other bacteria species and some archaea. Gas vesicles allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy. They are formed when small biconical structures grow to form spindles. The vesicle walls are composed of a hydrophobic gas vesicle protein A (GvpA) which form a cylindrical hollow, proteinaceous structure that fills with gas. Small variances in the amino acid sequence produce changes in morphology of the gas vesicle, for example, GvpC, is a larger protein.
Central vacuoles
Most mature plant cells have one large vacuole that typically occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume, and that can occupy as much as 80% of the volume for certain cell types and conditions. Strands of cytoplasm often run through the vacuole.
A vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast (word origin: Gk tón(os) + -o-, meaning “stretching”, “tension”, “tone” + comb. form repr. Gk plastós formed, molded) and filled with cell sap. Also called the vacuolar membrane, the tonoplast is the cytoplasmic membrane surrounding a vacuole, separating the vacuolar contents from the cell's cytoplasm. As a membrane, it is mainly involved in regulating the movements of ions around the cell, and isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell.
Transport of protons from the cytosol to the vacuole stabilizes cytoplasmic pH, while making the vacuolar interior more acidic creating a proton motive force which the cell can use to transport nutrients into or out of the vacuole. The low pH of the vacuole also allows degradative enzymes to act. Although single large vacuoles are most common, the size and number of vacuoles may vary in different tissues and stages of development. For example, developing cells in the meristems contain small provacuoles and cells of the vascular cambium have many small vacuoles in the winter and one large one in the summer.
Aside from storage, the main role of the central vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the tonoplast (aquaporins) control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole through active transport, pumping potassium (K+) ions into and out of the vacuolar interior. Due to osmosis, water will diffuse into the vacuole, placing pressure on the cell wall. If water loss leads to a significant decline in turgor pressure, the cell will plasmolyze. Turgor pressure exerted by vacuoles is also required for cellular elongation: as the cell wall is partially degraded by the action of expansins, the less rigid wall is expanded by the pressure coming from within the vacuole. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is also essential in supporting plants in an upright position. Another function of a central vacuole is that it pushes all contents of the cell's cytoplasm against the cellular membrane, and thus keeps the chloroplasts closer to light. Most plants store chemicals in the vacuole that react with chemicals in the cytosol. If the cell is broken, for example by a herbivore, then the two chemicals can react forming toxic chemicals. In garlic, alliin and the enzyme alliinase are normally separated but form allicin if the vacuole is broken. A similar reaction is responsible for the production of syn-propanethial-S-oxide when onions are cut.
Vacuoles in fungal cells perform similar functions to those in plants and there can be more than one vacuole per cell. In yeast cells the vacuole (Vac7) is a dynamic structure that can rapidly modify its morphology. They are involved in many processes including the homeostasis of cell pH and the concentration of ions, osmoregulation, storing amino acids and polyphosphate and degradative processes. Toxic ions, such as strontium (), cobalt(II) (), and lead(II) () are transported into the vacuole to isolate them from the rest of the cell.
Contractile vacuoles
Contractile Vacuoles is a specialized osmoregulatory organelle that is present in many free-living protists. The contractile vacuole is part of the contractile vacuole complex which includes radial arms and a spongiome. The contractile vacuole complex works periodically contracts to remove excess water and ions from the cell to balance water flow into the cell. When the contractile vacuole is slowly taking water in, the contractile vacuole enlarges, this is called diastole and when it reaches its threshold, the central vacuole contracts then contract (systole) periodically to release water.
Food vacuoles
Food vacuoles (also called digestive vacuole) are organelles found in Ciliates, and Plasmodium falciparum, a protozoan parasite that causes Malaria.
Histopathology
In histopathology, vacuolization is the formation of vacuoles or vacuole-like structures, within or adjacent to cells. It is an unspecific sign of disease.

The 1995 Copa América Final was the final match of the 1995 Copa América. It was held on July 23, 1995, in Montevideo, Uruguay. This was the fourth final for both Uruguay and reigning World Champion Brazil, and the third final featuring the two teams; previously Uruguay had defeated Brazil in 1983, with Brazil returning the favor in 1989 at the Estádio do Maracanã.
Uruguay won the match 5–3 on penalties, continuing its historic run of winning every international tournament held in Uruguay. This remarkable streak includes South American Championships victories in 1917, 1923, 1924, 1942, 1956, and 1967, and the 1930 FIFA World Cup.
By winning the 1995 Copa América tournament, Uruguay qualified for the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Richard Thomas (5 December 1837 – 28 September 1916) was an English tin plate manufacturer. They were the founder of Richard Thomas & Co., which later merged with Baldwins Ltd to become Richard Thomas and Baldwins, which in turn was absorbed into British Steel Corporation in the 1960s.
Biography
Richard Thomas was born 5 Dec 1837 in Bridgwater, Somerset. They were the eldest son of Richard Thomas (25 Dec 1814-31 Jan 1895), a Somerset shipowner and merchant. The younger Richard Thomas attended the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute in Taunton before starting work as a clerk in their uncle's draper's shop in Oxford. They then worked at various jobs in the coal mining industry in Wales, including as a coal exporter, a commission agent, a works manager and an accountant. In 1863, they moved into the tin plate industry when they became accountant and sub-manager of an iron and tin plate works in Neath. In 1871, they founded their own company: Richard Thomas & Co. They acquired tin plate works at Lydbrook in Gloucestershire and Lydney, and then the colliery at Lydbrook. Financial problems caused directly by the flooding of Lydbrook Colliery led Richard Thomas to liquidate their company in 1883, but it was relaunched as Richard Thomas & Co. Ltd in 1884, with the financial backing of the Barrow Hematite Steel Company.
Thomas married Anne Loveluck (06 Feb 1837–04 Apr 1914) daughter of John Loveluck of Hafod Talog, Margam in Cardiff on 18 February 1859. Anne bore thirteen children, a number of whom did not survive to adulthood. Their eldest son, Richard Beaumont Thomas, succeeded them as managing director of Richard Thomas & Co. Ltd. Three of their other surviving sons namely Harold Massey-Thomas of Moor Hall, Hubert Spence-Thomas of Cae Pwcella and Wyndham Partridge Thomas of Caxton House held prominent positions within Richard Thomas and Co. Ltd. Richard Thomas died in Bath on 28 September 1916. Their will was proved at £92,140 at Bristol Registry Office on 11 Apr 1917. By this time, Richard Thomas & Co. Ltd and its associated companies employed over 11,000 in South Wales.

Physaria fremontii (syn. Lesquerella fremontii) is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae known by the common name Fremont's bladderpod. It is endemic to Wyoming in the United States, where it occurs only in and around the Wind River Range in Fremont County.
This species is a perennial herb growing from a taproot and producing decumbent or prostrate stems up to 15 centimeters long. The basal leaves are up to four or five centimeters long with oval blades borne on petioles. Longer, narrower leaves occur along the stems. The flowers have four yellow petals and measure 6 to 8 millimeters in length. The fruit is an inflated or flattened pod up to 7 millimeters long. It has a coating of hairs on the outer and inner surfaces.
This plant is a calciphile, growing only on limestone or rocks that are partly limestone or are derived from limestone. It can be found up to 11,100 feet in elevation, up to the subalpine climates of the local mountains. It may be grown in Festuca idahoensis plant communities, and it is often associated with Pinus flexilis and Artemisia tripartita. The habitat is open. The landscape may have few plants, or it may be covered in cushion plants or dry mountain meadow species. Associated plants include Arenaria congesta (ballhead sandwort), Balsamorhiza incana (hoary balsamroot), Draba oligosperma (few-seed draba), Elymus spicatus (bluebunch wheatgrass), Erigeron compositus (cut-leaved daisy), Haplopappus acaulis (stemless mock goldenweed), Hymenoxys acaulis (stemless hymenoxys), Hymenoxys richardsonii (Richardson's hymenoxys), Koeleria macrantha (Junegrass), Lomatium cous (biscuitroot), Lupinus argenteus (silvery lupine), Oxytropis sericea (white locoweed), Phlox hoodii (Hood's phlox), Phlox multiflora (many-flowered phlox), Poa secunda (Sandberg bluegrass), Potentilla ovina (sheep cinquefoil), Sedum lanceolatum (lance-leaved stonecrop), Senecio canus (woolly groundsel), and Townsendia spathulata (spoon-leaved Easter-daisy).
This plant's habitat is affected by road construction, limestone quarrying, and recreational activity such as off-road vehicle use.

The Grasshopper & the Ants, by Jerry Pinkney, is a 2015 adaptation of the classic Aesop fable where a grasshopper relaxes through Spring, Summer, and Autumn, while a colony of ants works at gathering food for the Winter, but although initially refusing the grasshopper's request for help, they relent and invite them in to share.
Reception
Booklist, in a review of The Grasshopper & the Ants, wrote "Another winner to follow their other renditions of Aesop's fables .. Pinkney's lush style and Aesop's timeless fables are an award-winning combination.". and School Library Journal found it "A lively and engaging version of a favorite Aesop fable."
Common Sense Media wrote "Though the washy watercolor and busy spreads of ants sometimes make it difficult to discern the finer details, a close reading yields benefits" and highlighted the story's message that "Art and entertainment are important, as is the sharing of bounty."
The Grasshopper & the Ants has also been reviewed by The Horn Book Magazine, Publishers Weekly, School Library Connection, and Kirkus Reviews.

Martin Bakole Ilunga (born 1 June 1993) is a Congolese professional boxer.  They are the younger brother of boxer Ilunga Makabu.
Professional career
Bakole made their professional debut on 25 March 2014, scoring a second-round technical knockout (TKO) victory over Cecil Smith at the Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, Gauteng, South Africa.
After compiling a record of 9–0 (6 KO), they faced undefeated Ali Baghouz (10–0–1) on 11 November 2017 at the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh, with the vacant IBO Continental heavyweight title on the line. Bakole captured the vacant title via first-round knockout (KO). They successfully defended the title in their next fight with a first-round TKO against DL Jones (8–1–1) on 23 June 2018 at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow.
They next fought former Olympian and cruiserweight world title challenger Michael Hunter (14–1) for the vacant IBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title on 13 October 2018 at the York Hall, London. Bakole lost the fight via tenth-round TKO. The first few rounds were evenly contested with Bakole walking their American opponent down while Hunter remained on the back foot, utilising movement and picking their moments to throw combinations. From round four and onwards, Hunter began to make an impression with their ring movement and speedy combinations. Towards the end of the seventh, Bakole landed a powerful right hand that stunned Hunter, causing the former cruiserweight to hold in the clinch. Hunter, now looking fatigued and suffering a cut to the right eye, had their mouth piece knocked out in the eighth by a clean right hand. After injuring their right shoulder in the eighth, Bakole was reluctant to throw the right hand in the ninth, instead choosing to work behind the jab. The end came in the tenth and final round; with Hunter landing powerful shots with more frequency, a left hook sent Bakole stumbling – not for the first time during the round – towards the corner. After a barrage of unanswered punches, referee Phil Edwards waved off the fight with 41 seconds of the round remaining, handing Bakole the first defeat of their professional career.
Following their loss to Hunter, Bakole fought former heavyweight world title challenger Mariusz Wach (33–4) on 6 April 2019 at the Spodek Arena in Katowice, Poland, with the vacant Republic of Poland International heavyweight title up for grabs. Bakole won the fight via eighth-round TKO in a scheduled ten-round bout. The first-round saw Wach boxing in a defensive manner, staying at range behind the jab and looking to counter-punch. The next few rounds saw Bakole take the lead. Throwing heavy combination punches to the head of their Polish opponent. Towards the end of the fifth, Bakole landed several punches to their opponent's head, leaving Wach on unsteady legs as they walked back to their corner. Wach attempted to rally back in the sixth-round, having success as Bakole's pace slowed. Bakole came back in the seventh to repeat their performance of previous rounds, putting together combinations and landing punches to the head of Wach. The end came in the eighth when referee Robert Gortat waved off the fight after Wach was on the receiving end of a flurry of twelve unanswered punches.
Following a first-round TKO win over Ytalo Perea (11–4–2) in August, Bakole was scheduled to face Gabriel Enguema on 19 October 2019 at the Utilita Arena, Newcastle. Days before the fight, Enguema withdrew from the bout due to an injury. Former world title challenger Kevin Johnson (34–15–1) stepped in at short notice. In what was a one-sided affair, Bakole won by fifth-round TKO in a scheduled eight-round bout after referee Ron Kearney waved off the fight following Johnson being on the receiving end of several unanswered punches, handing the durable veteran boxer the third stoppage defeat of their career.

"Poison" is a short story written by Roald Dahl that was originally published in June 1950 in Collier's. In 1950 it was adapted for the radio programme Escape. In 1958 it was turned into an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, directed by Alfred Hitchcock himself. In 1980 it was adapted as the fifth episode of the second series of Tales of the Unexpected.
Plot summary
The story is set in India during the time of British rule. The main character is Harry Pope and the narrator of the story is Timber Woods. Timber goes over to their friend Harry Pope. Harry is in bed, motionless, sweating, and panicked. They explain that a venomous snake, the krait, has crawled onto their stomach, underneath the covers, and asks Timber to fetch a doctor. Timber calls Dr. Ganderbai, a local Indian doctor who rushes to help. Timber and Ganderbai frantically try to get the snake off of Harry through various methods (which include sedating the snake and giving Harry an antivenom). As the story progresses, it is revealed that there is in fact no snake on Harry.
After the initial panic, Ganderbai inquires whether Harry is certain that there actually was a snake. Harry, believing that Ganderbai is calling them a liar, berates the doctor with racial slurs. As Ganderbai walks out of the room, Timber thanks them and apologizes for Harry's behavior. Ganderbai's only reply is that the only thing Harry needs is a good vacation.

A box truss is a structure composed of three or more chords connected by transverse and/or diagonal structural elements.
Application
Box trusses are commonly used in certain types of aircraft fuselages, electric power pylons, large radio antennas, and many bridge structures. (For various truss arrangements used see truss bridge.)
By using what are in effect stiff panels in a cylindrical arrangement the resulting structure can have a high resistance to axial torsion (twisting along its long axis) and a higher resistance to buckling in its highly loaded sides.
When finished as an open structure the truss will be less subject to wind drag and to aeroelastic effects than would a completely enclosed structure.
Structural system
Chisholm Trail Technology Center (CTTC) is a public career and technology education center located in Omega, Oklahoma, and is part of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education system.
The center is located on Highway 33, 13 miles east of Watonga and 16 miles west of Kingfisher.
History
In August 1987, voters in the Kingfisher, Watonga, Lomega and Hitchcock school districts elected five board members to the newly formed Area Vocational School District No. 26. Their first official act was to call for a 5-mill election on November 3, 1987, to provide for operating expenses for the district. The 5-mill operational levy was approved by solid margins.
Kenneth Glazier began duties as Superintendent of the district on March 1, 1988.
In April 1988, a contest was held to name the vo-tech district. The winning name, Chisholm Trail Area Vocational-Technical Center, was submitted by Roger McAdams of Kingfisher.
Fifty acres of land were purchased for the construction of the center. HT&B Architect firm of Oklahoma City was hired to design the facility. Short-term adult classes began in Kingfisher and Watonga in September 1988.
Voters in the Watonga, Hitchcock, Lomega, and Kingfisher school districts went to the polls on September 27, 1988, and passed a $2.6 million bond issue to build and equip the center. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on Friday, June 2, 1989. The building was completed and dedication ceremonies were held on Sunday, August 12, 1990. Classes in the new facility began that month for adult and high school students.
In 2001 the center changed its legal name to Chisholm Trail Technology Center.
Max Thomas was hired in July 2007 as the current Superintendent.
On April 1, 2014 the Dover Public Schools voted to annex to Chisholm Trail Technology Center to become the fourth school in the CTTC district.

Transportation Center Skopje is the main city bus and railway station in the Republic of North Macedonia capital Skopje. It was built after the 1963 Skopje earthquake that destroyed the Original station buildings. The station is served by Long-distance trains to Belgrade, Thessaloniki, Athens and Ljubljana, and Express routes to Thessaloniki, via Vienna that serve Skopje twice daily, once going to Thessaloniki and second time returning to Vienna, passing through Belgrade and Ljubljana. The Skopje railway station is 15 min walking from the main square Makedonija.
History
The station was built following the 1963 Skopje earthquake that hit on 26 July 1963 which destroyed the Original station buildings. The old station building has become a symbol of the earthquake, with the clock stopped at 5.17 and now houses the Museum of the City of Skopje (Muzej na grad Skopje). After the earthquake, a project was started for a major reconstruction of the city, authored by Kenzo Tange, a Japanese architect, but which has not been fully implemented. The station was rebuilt in the Brutalist style of architecture. It was completed in 1981.
Services
The main north–south line from Niš in Serbia to the port of Thessaloniki in Greece on the Aegean Sea (Corridor X), passes Skopje. Intercity trains link Skopje with, Kumanovo, Zelenikovo, Veles, Negotino (Kavadarci), Demir Kapija, Miravci (Valandovo) and Gevgelija (Bogdanci) with Serbian Railways and Greek railways. Connections to Bulgarian State Railways are via Niš in Serbia and via Thessaloniki in Greece. Intercity trains from Kosovo Railways link Skopje with Pristina.

Dixons was a British high-street retailer of consumer electronics, originally founded in 1937 as a photographic studio by Charles Kalms. The company would later deal in many consumer electronics, with nationwide outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
In 1984, Dixons purchased rival Currys, though kept separate brand identities between the two stores. Dixons typically encompassed shopping centres and town centres, whereas Currys were larger stores in out-of-town retail parks. On 5 April 2006, it was announced that the Dixons brand in the United Kingdom would be superseded by Currys, branded as Currys.digital. The Ireland subsidiary followed this in August 2008. Dixons continued to trade online as Dixons.co.uk, until 2012.
History
The first Dixons was opened by Charles Kalms in Southend as a photographic studio in 1937. The business flourished during the Second World War, as there was much demand for photographic services and family portraits.
By the end of the war, Kalms had opened seven more studios in the London area. The demands for portrait services decreased considerably after the war, and they were forced to close all but one studio in Edgware, north London. The company was taken over by their son Stanley Kalms, who was chairperson until September 2002.
On 5 April 2006, Dixons announced that there would no longer be any Dixons shops in Britain; shops would henceforth be named Currys.digital. This was said to signal a shift to more Internet based selling and to "reduce confusion". Dixons stores were to be retained in Ireland, and in locations such as airports, and the Dixons website would continue.
The Dixons subsidiary in Ireland was discontinued in August 2008, renamed to Currys. A Dixons.ie internet site was set up. Dixons branches in airports were re branded as Dixons Travel from January 2009, and the new format was rolled out to many airports in the United Kingdom.
Closure
In October 2012, Dixons Retail announced that they would no longer trade using Dixons.co.uk website. Customers were then redirected to the Currys and PC World websites, where all remaining orders and agreements were honoured.
Dixons Travel
Dixons Travel was a technology retailer, with stores in four airports in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is a division of Currys Retail, a subsidiary of Currys plc.
It was initially established as Dixons Tax Free in June 1994 to relaunch the Dixons brand in airport locations. The name changed to Dixons Travel in January 2009. A branch in Brussels trades under the Knowhow brand.
On 28 April 2021, Dixons Carphone announced the closure of the Dixons Travel business, due to the removal of tax-free shopping from UK airports from December 2020, and lower passenger numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company stated that the Dixons Travel business had historically contributed annual profits of over £20 million to the Dixons Carphone group.
As of June 2021, Dixons Travel had reopened its stores in Birmingham Airport, Dublin Airport's Terminal 1, Gatwick Airport's North Terminal, and Heathrow Airport's Terminals 2 and 5. Other stores in Heathrow's Terminals 3 and 4 and the rest of the UK, Dublin's Terminal 2 reopened July 19th 2021. Oslo Airport, and stores on both the P&O Ventura and Britannia cruise ships, remain closed, they later closed them again due to folding into Currys plc.
Legacy
As of October 2021, the Dixons intellectual property is currently owned by Currys plc, where it is used to operate Dixons Travel.

Oakham railway station serves the town of Oakham in Rutland, England. The station is situated almost halfway between Leicester – to the west – and Peterborough – eastward on the (as built) Syston and Peterborough Railway, the line is the Birmingham to Peterborough Line.
Oakham is the only surviving passenger railway station in Rutland. The line is served by Cross Country trains between Birmingham New Street and or . Until recently, the line from Oakham to Kettering via Corby (which branches off just east of Oakham) was rarely used by passenger trains, being almost exclusively a freight line, but now infrequent East Midlands Trains services to London St Pancras, as well as occasional diversionary trains which would have used the Midland Main Line serve the station.
History
The station was opened by the Midland Railway on 1 May 1848. The building was designed by the company architect, Edward Wood of London, and is Grade II listed.
In October 2020, work began to refurbish and repaint the footbridge. This was completed and the footbridge reopened in April 2021.

Services
From Oakham there is an hourly service in both directions operated by CrossCountry, with some additional peak-hour trains. Services run westbound to Birmingham New Street via , , Narborough, , and whilst services eastbound run to or via , , , and .
Despite managing the station, East Midlands Railway (EMR) only operates a limited number of services to/from it. A few trains operate at either end of the day, mainly for train crew route knowledge retention purposes. An early morning service runs from to and an evening service operates from via Peterborough to Nottingham.
The station retains a ticket office which is staffed seven days a week, a car park and help points for times where there are no staff present.
A single daily return service to London St Pancras commenced on 27 April 2009 running via Corby and is notable for being the first regular passenger service to cross the spectacular and historic Welland Viaduct since 1966. The company introduced a further return service from Derby via East Midlands Parkway (for East Midlands Airport) from May 2010. Further services may be introduced in the future. The initial London service had been due to start on 14 December 2008 but because of a delay in reaching agreement with the Department for Transport and the rolling stock company (ROSCO) for the four additional trains needed for the service EMT started the service around four months later.
Former services
Prior to the Beeching Axe, trains used to stop at a number of smaller village destinations in Rutland. These were closed between 1961 and 1966.

Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas is a visual artist, author, and public speaker. Their work has been seen in public spaces, museums, galleries and private collections across globe. Institutional collections include the British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum and Vancouver Art Gallery.
Yahgulanaas has a long history of environmental activism and political involvement. For many years they were an elected Chief Councillor of the Old Massett Village Council and a member of the Council of the Haida Nation.
Early life
Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas was born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia in 1954 and grew up alongside Delkatla, near the fishing village of Masset on Haida Gwaii, off the north coast of British Columbia.  They are a descendant of the influential artists, Isabella Edenshaw, Charles Edenshaw.
As a child, Yahgulanaas was an avid comic book reader and cartoonist. A prolific young artist, they soon covered the walls and ceilings of their bedroom with drawings.
At age 22, they began to direct their artistic endeavors outward, to effect change in the community and in relation to broader movements of environmental activism.
Art career
Training
In 1978, Yahgulanaas began an apprenticeship with renowned Haida artist Robert Davidson. Yahgulanaas credits Davidson, as well as Haida master carver James Hart, in providing them with formal training in the classical forms of Haida art.
Haida manga
While Yahgulanaas trained under master carvers, their brief exposure to Chinese brush techniques with Cai Ben Kwan encouraged a departure from the typical expressions of the Haida art form and the development of a new genre of narrative art called "Haida manga."
Haida Manga blends Pacific Northwest Indigenous iconographies and framelines with the graphic dynamism of Asian manga. Haida Manga is committed to hybridity as a positive force that opens a third space for critical engagement. It offers an empowering and playful way of viewing and engaging with social issues as it seeks participation, dialogue, reflection, and action.
Sculpture
Yahgulanaas's works in metal include commissions from the British Museum (2010), The City of Vancouver (2011) and the 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee. In 2015, their sculpture Sei, depicting a sei whale, was unveiled at the Vancouver International Airport. In January 2016, their sculpture Yelthadaas from the Coppers From the Hood series joined the permanent collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This work was put on display in 2017. The piece hangs in Gallery 399, between the Modern and Contemporary Art wing and the Rockefeller Wing, where contemporary art borders Indigenous art.

William Howard Campbell (20 September 1859 - 18 February 1910) was an Irish Presbyterian missionary who worked with the London Missionary Society in southern India. They worked in Jammalamadugu in Cudappah District. They were also a naturalist with a keen interest in birds and moths. The Campbell Memorial School founded in Jammalamadugu in 1913 was named in their memory. The Northern Ireland MP, Sir David Callender Campbell was one of their sons.
Biography
Son of business person Thomas Callender Campbell, Howard was born in Derry, the oldest of nine siblings, and took an interest in the local moths and butterflies from an early age. Their brothers David Callender and Thomas Vincent were also keen naturalists. One of their brothers, Sidney George become a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. Their family "museum" of specimens was said to have been one of the best in the region. They studied at the Academical Institution in Derry and received an MA from the University of Edinburgh in 1880 and a BD in 1882. They studied Sanskrit at Edinburgh for two years. They were a champion rugby player at Edinburgh University and in one match earned a win with a maul-in-goal, with three Portadown players holding them down. A Foyle College magazine had a picture of them under the heading "The Bringing of the First Football Cup to Derry." They joined the London Missionary Society and went to Cuddapah in India in 1884. They lived in Jammalamadugu from 1895. They learnt the Telugu language and wrote several religious tracts. They played tennis and cricket in India, organizing village matches and rallying people for various causes including, on one occasion to fix a reservoir on the verge of breaching. In 1901 they moved to Gooty to work at the LMS training institution. They returned to England in 1903 due to ill health. In 1909 they were appointed head of the United Theological College at Bangalore but they did not take it up due to an illness which was diagnosed as sprue. They moved to Switzerland and the Italian Riviera to convalesce but died at Bordighera where they were buried.
Contribution to science and literature
Campbell was a member of the Bombay Natural History Society who collected specimens, mostly of moths, and made natural history observations during their travels between 1901 and 1908. These included notes on a nesting colony of spot-billed pelicans near Buchupalle. They also collected insect specimens mainly from southern India, some of which they sent to Walter Rothschild and are now held in the Natural History Museum, London. Among their moth collections held at Gooty, there were nearly 60 that were new to science. Most of the species were described by George Hampson. Some of the species described (but may not currently be considered valid) from their collections include Phthonoloba auxostira, and Abraxas prosthetocneca, Homoptera ruficolora, Bleptina heteropalpia, Rhynchina leucogonia, Hypena mesogramma, H. molybdota, Mecistoptera albisigna, Cidaria nyctichroa, Chilo araealis, Phycita umbratalis, Stemmatophora aedalis (now considered a synonym of Hypsopygia fuscalis), Oligostigma chrysozonalis, Nacoleia pachytornalis, Nacoleia megaspilalis, and Calamochrous bipunctalis. They were also an expert on the flora, and recorded the host plants of many moth caterpillars. They were among the few who had observed the rare Jerdon's courser. They called themselves a socialist, sympathized with the problems of the local people and wrote a critique of colonial government in The Truth about the Government of India (1909) published by the East India Association. They wrote about the famine of 1897 in the Madras Mail, which helped direct relief work. Campbell also acted as examiner at the University of Madras for philosophy. They wrote several Telugu books including (translated titles) Grounds for Belief in a Personal God (1893), Christian Evidences (1898), Christian Theology (1905) and along with Veerasalingam Pantalu helped revise Browne's Telugu-English Dictionary (1906) and Arden's Telugu Grammar (1908). Their contribution to the dictionary included Telugu names for birds and trees that they and W.M. Thorburn had collated.
Campbell married Elizabeth Nevin, daughter of David Boyd at Madras on 7 December 1884 and they had four sons including David who was later knighted.

Waste Watch was a non-profit, sustainability organisation based in the UK, inspiring people to live more and waste less. It was a registered charity.
Waste Watch aimed to improve well-being and the environment on a local and global level, by changing the way we live; such as the ways we produce, buy, use and dispose of things. The organisation primarily worked with community groups, businesses, schools and other not-for-profit organisations.
In 2011 Waste Watch merged with the environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy.
History
Waste Watch grew out of the community recycling movement in the 1980s. The organisation was founded in 1987, by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, with a mission to make waste issues mainstream and to encourage waste reduction, reuse and recycling.
Timeline
1987. Ran the UK's first Recycling Week during the European Year of the Environment. During this time, it also published the first UK National Directory of Recycling Information.
1991. Registered as a charity (no. 10054)(1337). During the 1990s, Waste Watch launched telephone information service Wasteline, produced the first UK Recycled Products Guide and lobbied UK government to introduce the first waste strategy for England.
1994. Launched Recycler the rapping robot to deliver the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle' message to British primary school children.
1999. Commissioned the first UK-wide survey of public attitudes to waste which shaped the development of future national and local awareness campaigns.
2000. Became a founding member of the UK government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), whose mission is to help develop markets for material resources that would otherwise have become waste.
2011. Merger with the UK environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy.
During the 2000s, Waste Watch ran Rethink Rubbish, which later became the national Recycle Now public awareness campaign.
Recycler the Robot
In 1994, Waste Watch launched Recycler the rapping robot to deliver the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle' message to British primary school children.
The Recycler show involves story-telling with theatrical props and quizzes, and follow-up activities for the school. Along with an education professional, the robot shows pupils how they can put reducing, reusing and recycling into practice at home and at school.
Recycler has reached more than 1.5 million pupils since 1994, and has visited more than 7,200 schools, performing more than 15,000 times.

Fred A. Howland (November 10, 1864 – March 30, 1953) was a Vermont attorney, business person, and Republican politician. They served as Secretary of State of Vermont and president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Early life
Fred Arthur Howland was born in Franconia, New Hampshire on November 10, 1864. Their father, Moses Nathan Howland (1833-1906) was a dentist, and their mother Sylvia Ann Shipman Howland (1841-1901) was a sister of Mary Ellen Shipman (1846—1893), the wife of William P.

The Federal Economic Competition Commission (Spanish: Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica, Cofece) is the chief competition regulatory agency in Mexico. Known as the Federal Competition Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia, CFC) prior to 2013, the commission functions under the portfolio of the Secretariat of Economy.
History
The commission was established in 1993. Under Article 28 of the Mexican Constitution, it is responsible for:"...overseeing, promoting and guaranteeing competition and market access in Mexico for the efficient functioning of markets to the benefit of consumers and implementation of the Federal Economic Competition Law (LFCE)".The commission is headed by five commissioners appointed by the President of Mexico, each of whom serves 10-year terms; one of the five members serves as president of the commission. Additionally, Cofece employs 175 other people, including 41 support staff.
The mission of the CFC is to "protect the process of competition and free access to markets, through the prevention and elimination of monopolistic practices and other restrictions to market efficiency, in order to contribute to societal welfare." Functions of the CFC include approval of mergers and acquisitions, investigating and penalizing monopolistic conduct, authorizing business activities in regulated sectors, and advocacy for competition in the marketplace. Article 28 of Mexico's constitution prohibits monopolies, but a more complete competition policy was set out in the LFCE (1993).

Joseph Réginald Topize (10 August 1960 – 21 February 1999) professionally known by their stage name Kaya was a Mauritian musician and the creator of "seggae", a fusion of Mauritian sega and reggae; two popular music genres in Mauritius. Kaya died while in police custody (purportedly beaten to death by the police); they were arrested for smoking Marijuana during one of their concerts.
Musical career
Joseph Réginald Topize was born in Roche-Bois in Port Louis on August 10, 1960, from a family of five children. They were left under the supervision of an uncle as their father, a fisherman, was unable to support their education. Topize did not have a very happy childhood. Being a Mauritian Creole, they were a young victim of racism and found themselves left on their own to find odd jobs at the age of 8 years. At 16, they began to learn the guitar. They played hits from artists such as Mike Brant, Santana, Deep Purple, etc., and hosted dances and weddings with their first band, "Wind and Fire".
Topize adopted the name 'Kaya' soon after discovering Bob Marley and reggae music in homage to Marley's album of the same name. Kaya revered Marley and was heavily influenced by them both musically and politically.
Kaya decided to move away from their former music style covering pop-rock groups and became dedicated to both interpreting the music of Bob Marley. Spotted for their talents as a guitarist, they joined the group 'Lélou Menwar'. It was with them that Kaya performed in their first real concert and recorded their first studio album 'Letan Lenfer'.
After touring with Lélou Menwar, Kaya gathered some friends from their hometown, Roche-Bois, to create the group 'Racinetatan'; named after a Malagasy prince exiled in Mauritius. Kaya and Racinetatan incorporated many of Marley's hits into their performances along with heavily influenced reggae compositions of their own. However, over time Kaya began to question this with the concept of "roots & culture" in mind. Kaya began to see that though they loved reggae and Jamaican culture, this did not fit their reality in Mauritius. In 1986, fueled by their new thought process, Kaya began to mix reggae music in with the local music, Sega.
Political action
Kaya also campaigned for the rights of the Mauritian Creole people.
On February 16, 1999, the Republican Movement organised a free concert for the decriminalization of cannabis along Edward VII Street at Rose Hill. Five groups were playing, including Kaya.
Rama Valayden, the leader of the Republican Movement later nominated as Attorney General in 2005, opened the festivities with a speech in favor of the decriminalization of soft drugs, saying: "mo pou amène dépénalisation, sinon mo pas pou dans gouvernement" as reported by the local press. Valayden then asked the crowd for a show of hands in support of resolutions calling for the decriminalization and appealed to Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam for those imprisoned for possession of marijuana to be amnestied. At the time, about 2000 people or 75% of the prison population were imprisoned for soft drugs offenses, with sentences ranging from several months to two years.
The event drew approximately 2000 participants and was held in a loving and peaceful atmosphere. Many young people began to smoke marijuana openly and at the time there was no police intervention.
Two days after the event, police forces identified five people for smoking or encouraging the smoking of marijuana during the concert and had them reprimanded. Kaya was among those arrested and admitted to smoking the night of the concert. They were immediately imprisoned in "Alcatraz", at the Line Barracks prison, a detention center in Port-Louis.
The police issued a request of 10,000 rupees (a considerable amount for the average Mauritian) for the release of the artist. Kaya's wife, aided by their fellow musicians and members of the MR (not Valayden), managed to raise the bail money. However, due to various blunders of the lawyers involved and especially a lack of political support for the MR, Kaya was not released on the expected date, February 20. Since this then led on to a weekend, their release date would be postponed until the Monday. This was too late for Kaya and they were found dead in their cell on the morning of Sunday, February 21, 1999.
Aftermath of Kaya's death
Contradictory results of autopsies
Official records state that Kaya, suffering from drug withdrawal, threw themselves against the walls of their own cell and broke their skull in the process. A coroner from the neighbouring island of Reunion, Dr. Ramstein, contradicted this statement with their examination which claimed Kaya had been beaten to death.
Riots in Mauritius
Riots followed soon after news of Kaya's death, causing further deaths and social disorder which have been termed as the 1999 Mauritian riots.
2005 state compensation of Rs 4.5 Millions
In late 2005 Véronique Topize, Kaya's wife and hairdresser as profession, received a compensation of Rs 4.5 Millions from the Government of Mauritius. Rama Valayden, who was then the nominated Attorney General of the PTR–PMXD–VF–MR–MMSM government, made an agreement with Véronique Topize's lawyer Rex Stephen. They thus dropped their original claim for Rs 10 Millions which lawyer Rex Stephen had initiated as a civil prosecution against the state.
2019 revelations
In an interview with Daniella Grandcourt in 2019 Véronique Topize revealed that a psychic in France had predicted Kaya's premature death and subsequent riots in 1993.
